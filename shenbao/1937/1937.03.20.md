Han stated that his reasons for applying for Chinese citizenship are that the Chinese people are amiable, courteous, and righteous, and he wishes to contribute to China's construction efforts in the future. His wife and son, Qiu Jian, will also come to China to apply for citizenship. (Special dispatch, 19th)

### Chen Jie Discusses Sino-Japanese Diplomacy in Tianjin, No Further Talks Held

Economic Cooperation Cannot Be Conducted Independently; Adjustment of the Diplomatic Lineup Still Requires Some Time

[Tianjin] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Jie will return to Beijing immediately after hosting the engagement ceremony for his eldest son on the 20th. Chen told reporters on the morning of the 19th that this trip was purely for personal matters and that he did not intend to meet with anyone. He will return to Beijing to cancel his leave in two or three days. Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations have not yet resumed. In the future, it is hoped that the Japanese side can implement the policies previously indicated by Foreign Minister Sato in a concrete manner. Regarding economic cooperation, this matter is generally considered to be closely related to politics and diplomacy and cannot be conducted independently. Ambassador Xu requested leave to return home and earnestly requested resignation, but after the central government's sincere persuasion, it is hoped that he will withdraw his resignation. The envoy to the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor in England will be Vice President Kong. He is currently preparing for departure.

Searching and Arresting Together with Japanese Consulate Police Officers

[Peiping] The crackdown by the Peiping authorities on gambling dens and opium dens opened by Japanese and Korean residents in Peiping is still in full swing. Last night, Chinese police, accompanied by several police officers from the Japanese consulate, went to Guanyinsi Street and the Hezhong Hotel to investigate gambling.

Both of the above locations were opened by Japanese and Koreans. There was also a gambling den in the same hutong, but all the gamblers had heard the news in advance, so when the police arrived, there was no one inside. In addition, yesterday afternoon, personnel from the Wangfujing Street Police Station investigated a gambling den opened by Koreans on Chongwenmen Avenue and arrested 30 gamblers. All of the above gamblers have been sent to the inland police station for legal processing. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 19th)

Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour

### Chu Minyi Discusses Mission and Plans

Preparing to Depart Immediately

[Nanjing] Chu Minyi, the head of the Executive Yuan and the leader of the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour Group, is still looking for candidates for the deputy head. On the 19th, reporters specially visited Chu to inquire about the mission and plans of the tour group. He spoke about the following points: The Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour was initiated by President Chiang and can be considered an unprecedented initiative. President Chiang has high hopes for this. In addition to promoting virtue and showing concern for the hardships of the people, he also hopes to use this opportunity to develop industry in the border areas and develop transportation, so that the central and local governments can communicate closely. I highly agree with this and am willing to accept the mission. I have always been interested in long-distance travel. I have previously inspected the northwest of China, and I originally planned to go to the southwest in the year of the Republic, but I had to interrupt my trip due to official business in Xinjiang. I hope to conduct a thorough inspection of the transportation, education, economy, sports, and national election preparation. Transportation is especially important. In the past, before the Beijing-Yunnan Highway was completed, transportation was extremely difficult. Those who wanted to go had to travel by land through the high mountains and ridges of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, which would take no less than two months, or by sea around Annam, which would also take more than 20 days. If the tour is successfully completed, it will be possible to travel directly at any time, day and night, without having to go through other countries. This great achievement will greatly benefit politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. However, the journey is long, there are many members, and it is not easy to travel. It is hoped that everyone will abide by the rules, be patient, and endure hardships so that the mission can be completed smoothly. I am scheduled to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 19th to prepare everything, stay for a short time, and then return to Beijing to prepare for departure. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)

Current Commentary

### Conflict Between Left and Right in France

— Hua

A few days ago, several hundred members of the French Fascist Social Problems Research Association gathered in Clichy, a suburb of Paris. This provoked Communist Party members to surround them in a demonstration. The result was a conflict with the police and the Republican Guard, resulting in several deaths and hundreds of injuries. As a result, two million workers in Paris unanimously went on a half-day general strike to protest and demand severe punishment for the Fascists. The intensity of the power struggle between the left and right factions in the current French political situation can be seen from this.

This kind of intense conflict between the left and right can give people two impressions on the surface. Namely, (1) the instability of the internal political situation in France, and (2) the instability of the French Popular Front government. However, these two observations are only superficial. In reality, since the Paris right-wing riots of February 1934, Fascist groups have been disarmed, and their strength is not that great. However, the emotions of the French people are relatively strong, and they are easily agitated and cause conflicts. As for the Popular Front government, its unity has not reached a complete level. Only a small number of radical socialists are easily swayed. The Socialist Party under Léon Blum and the Communist Party, which serves as the grassroots foundation of the Popular Front government, have always stated that the Popular Front government must be maintained.

France has the longest democratic tradition in politics. Its people are also accustomed to the ideas of civil rights and freedom. Therefore, in the struggle between the left and right in France, the right-wing Fascist forces are inevitably in a losing position. This can be proven by the general strike of two million workers in Paris this time. The orderliness of their actions, without descending into riots, also shows the full development of democratic political literacy.

The conflict between the left and right in France can give people two lessons in general political trends. First, in a country like France, the Fascist right-wing forces have little hope of development. This is because most of the French people are passionate about freedom and oppose violence. Secondly, most of the French economy is based on small-scale agricultural production. The rule of financial oligarchs is not sufficiently strong. Therefore, after the Popular Front government came into power, the reorganization of the Banque de France, the nationalization of the arms industry, and even the 40-hour work week in industry, could be resolutely implemented without being obstructed or sabotaged by the Fascist right wing under the command of financial oligarchs.

Second, the fatal blow to the French right wing lies especially in their collusion with Germany, France's historical enemy. Originally, because the Fascist right wing in France was weak and sympathetic to German Fascism, they secretly communicated with each other. The pig iron raw materials in the German arms industry were actually supplied by French industrial giants. Such "supplying the enemy with food" naturally aroused the antipathy of the French people. Therefore, Laval's pro-German policy not only could not be realized, but his own position was also swept away by the political torrent. This important lesson can not only show us the trend of French political development but also greatly help our political understanding.

### Quezon Suggests to the US That the Philippines Should Gain Independence Earlier

Decides to Form a Joint Committee to Study the Complete Independence Period and Adjust Economic Relations

[Washington] Philippine President Quezon formally suggested today that the Philippines' complete independence, originally scheduled to be implemented in 1945, should be advanced to 1938 or 1939. Quezon returned here yesterday from New York to attend a joint committee meeting of government departments to discuss US-Philippine relations. He then issued a joint statement with Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles, stating that the US and the Philippines will soon send expert committee members to jointly study the commercial relations between the two countries and adjust the Philippines' economic status. The US-Philippine Mixed Committee will also make recommendations on how the economic adjustments will benefit or harm the Philippines if it gains independence earlier. Both the US and the Philippines have also agreed that preferential commercial relations between the two countries will end when the Philippines' economic situation improves to a considerable extent. Afterwards, a common reciprocal trade agreement will be signed separately. Quezon, with the negotiations coming to an end, left for New York at 7:00 PM tonight and will probably not come to Beijing again before Easter. It is said that this US-Philippine agreement does not require congressional approval. The date of the expert committee's report has not yet been determined, but today's joint statement caused quite a stir. Observers believe that the early termination of preferential commercial relations between the two countries shows that the Philippines' preferential rights in the US market, equal to those of Cuba, have been cancelled. In this way, the United States' commercial policy towards the Philippines can be based on the State Department's policy and conclude a reciprocal trade agreement. As for the attitude of Congress, it will probably have to wait until President Roosevelt makes a definite recommendation before taking any action. (National Telegram, 18th)

[Washington] Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles told the Associated Press today that the rumor that the US authorities and Philippine President Quezon had agreed that the Philippines would achieve complete independence in 1938 or 1939 is absolutely not true. As of now, no agreement has been reached on the issue of independence. The date when the United States will allow the Philippines to be completely independent will be determined after the US-Philippine Mixed Committee submits its report. The committee's report will probably not be submitted until the end of the year. Even if the report makes a proposal regarding the date of complete independence for the Philippines, it is purely advisory. Ultimately, the committee of government departments must draft a bill and submit it to Congress for discussion. (National Telegram, 19th)

[Manila] People here were greatly shocked today to learn that Philippine President Quezon had suggested to the US to shorten the term of Philippine autonomy. The reactions from all walks of life are not uniform. The Stock Exchange Board of Directors initially held an emergency meeting to discuss suspending trading to prevent a catastrophic drop in prices, based on a Reuters misreport that the US authorities had agreed with Philippine President Quezon on the date of the Philippines' early independence. After confirming the facts, it was verified that the early independence of the Philippines was only a suggestion made by Quezon to the US, and market panic subsided. (National Telegram, 19th)

### Foreign Minister Sato Studies Economic Diplomacy Towards China

To Summon Ambassador Kawagoe to Solicit Opinions; All Sectors in Japan Pay Attention to Zhou Zuomin's Speech

[Tokyo] Since taking office, Foreign Minister Sato has been studying Japan's diplomatic policy to deal with the international situation in extraordinary times with a cautious attitude, considering both internal and external situations. He is paying special attention to China policy and is determined to actively adjust Sino-Japanese relations after the Diet adjourns. The Foreign Minister believes that the visit to China by the Kodama Kenji and other inspection groups, and the warm welcome they received from all sectors of China in Nanjing and Shanghai, show that it is not impossible to start negotiations between China and Japan. After the inspection group returns home, he will listen to their report on the actual situation in China and begin studying specific policies towards China, with the Three Ministers' Conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, and the Navy as the center. According to the Foreign Minister, since Finance Minister Yuki and Minister for Commerce and Industry Godo have always enthusiastically advocated Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the two ministers will also participate in the Five Ministers' Conference to discuss China policy. The Foreign Minister has repeatedly met with Yuki and Godo to exchange views and conduct preparatory work on economic and trade issues. Therefore, after the Diet adjourns, he will summon Ambassador Kawagoe to solicit opinions and start resolving Sino-Japanese pending issues that are relatively easy to adjust, such as economic cooperation. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 19th)

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Naotake met with Japanese newspaper reporters last night. Since Sato became Foreign Minister, this was the first time he had spoken to newspaper reporters about diplomatic issues with China. The gist of his words is recorded below. Sato said, "Diplomacy with China is the backbone of Japan's overall diplomacy, so it should be given great importance. However, this does not mean that diplomacy with the Soviet Union is secondary. On the contrary, we should give it the same attention." Sato also said, "Diplomacy with China should place emphasis on the economic aspect, and Japan will adopt separate and gradual negotiations on various pending issues to facilitate their resolution." All newspapers here today carried the above news, but they did not specify that it was Sato's speech. Furthermore, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out two errors in the report: ㊀ When asked whether he intended to summon Ambassador Kawagoe back to the country, Sato only replied that he felt that the longer the envoy was stationed abroad, the better. However, if there was a need to negotiate, Kawagoe might be summoned back to the country. He did not say that Kawagoe would be replaced. ㊁ Sato did not say that he would convene the Five Ministers' Conference on a regular basis. However, the China policy will continue to be drafted jointly by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, the Army, and the Navy, and the Finance Minister may also participate at times. As for Minister for Commerce and Industry Godo, he will only be invited to participate when events related to industry and commerce occur. This is certainly not a regular Five Ministers' Conference. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)

[Tokyo] Zhou Zuomin's speech at the general meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association yesterday, in which he stated that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation could only be realized after political obstacles were removed, has attracted close attention from people here. Some knowledgeable people in Japan believe that the first step should be to promote economic cooperation, and the elimination of political obstacles can be carried out after a good environment has been created. However, at the same time, another group of knowledgeable people, having insight into the crux of today's Sino-Japanese stalemate, agree with the view that economic cooperation cannot be promoted without first removing political obstacles. The two sides seem to be studying this issue, but the conclusion will depend on the return of Kodama Kenji's group. Currently, all speculation here is focused on whether the demands of the Chinese side are limited. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)

### Japan-Europe-US Inspection Group Members Selected

First to the United States, Then to Europe

[Tokyo] The Japan Economic Federation announced today that it has appointed the following members to organize an economic inspection group to go to the United Kingdom and the United States: Shigeshiro Kadono, Vice President of Okura & Co., Ltd.; Kunizo Hara, Director of the Hundredth Bank; Taizo Ishizaka, General Manager of Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company; Hideshige Kashiwagi, Director of Yokohama Specie Bank; Hiroshi Kasuga, General Manager of Tomoegumi Metal Industries Co., Ltd.; Kanzu Tanaka, General Manager of Mitsubishi Corporation; Kishitsugu Fukushima, Director of Mitsui Gomei Kaisha; Yoshio Shimode, President of Daido Electric Copper Refinery; Sachie Suzuki, General Manager of Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.; and Seiichi Takashima, Director of the Japan Economic Federation. Two representatives from the shipping and cotton industries are still to be elected. The group is scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the Asama Maru on April 28th for San Francisco. After inspecting in the United States, they will then travel from the United States to Berlin in mid-June to participate in the International Chamber of Commerce Congress. In early July, they will go to London to continue their inspection. When announcing the members of the inspection group today, the President of the Japan Economic Federation said that the members were selected with the consent of the government authorities. The main purpose of the group is to reciprocate the visits to Japan by the Pengbi Inspection Group in September 1934 and the Forbes Inspection Group in April 1935. The group will also represent Japan at the Ninth International Chamber of Commerce Congress, which will open in Berlin this year. The group intends to freely exchange views with government and business leaders in the countries they visit in order to strengthen economic relations between Japan and those countries and to promote mutual friendship.

In Hopes of Reviving British Trade

[London] The Minister of Overseas Trade, Mr. Wallace, stated in the House of Commons today that he is currently striving to arrange for diplomatic and commercial personnel stationed in China to travel to important inland cities, with the aim of revitalizing British trade. However, the frequency and scope of such travels will naturally be limited due to the overall demands of official duties. In the past two years, British personnel have travelled to various parts of China, and this will continue to be done within feasible limits in the future, Wallace said in response to a question from Conservative MP Smith.

More Than Six Hundred Students Died Horribly, Severed Limbs and Broken Bones Too Gruesome to Bear Witness To, Parents Searching for Their Children, Their Cries Shook the Heavens

⊙New London, Taylor County, Texas, USA, is a small town located in the oil region. It had a magnificent and well-equipped primary school, considered one of the best in the country. The students were mostly children of oil technicians and miners. The school's heating boiler suddenly exploded today, turning the entire school into rubble. The number of teachers and students killed was very high. By 8:00 PM (local time), more than 300 bodies had been unearthed. Only four of the teachers' bodies had been found, and the whereabouts of the other 36 were unknown. The search for bodies continued under the bright lights of searchlights. The entire town presented a desolate scene. Around the school, steel bars, bricks, and the corpses of severed limbs and broken bones were scattered all over the ground. Each body was gradually identified amidst the wails of their parents, a truly unbearable sight. Many trucks are currently carrying the bodies to the city for burial. After hearing the news, people from all over the state have been donating money and supplies to provide relief. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)

⊙Today, a primary school in Taylor, Texas, 15 miles from here, was completely destroyed in a boiler explosion. More than six hundred male and female students died. The bodies of 135 high school students and 10 teachers have been found. The school is divided into elementary and high school sections. The high school section has a total of 730 teachers and students, and only 100 have survived. The elementary school section was dismissed, so there were no deaths. The explosion was very loud, and bricks and tiles flew as far as a quarter of a mile away. Families of the students rushed to the school to look for their children, a truly tragic scene. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

⊙After the tragic accident at the New London Primary School in Taylor, Texas, the school principal estimates that about 670 teachers and students died. Three hundred bodies have been found. The Governor of Texas has ordered the National Guard to provide security, and martial law has been declared in the vicinity of New London. Some speculate that the disaster was caused by a gas pipe explosion from a nearby oil field. Most of the students at the school are children of oil field workers. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

⊙Overton: A terrible boiler explosion occurred today at a rural primary school in New London, Texas, killing about three or four hundred students. It is reported that the explosion was caused by a gas pipe from a nearby oil pool leading to the school's boiler room. The boiler operator was careless, causing a build-up of gas in the room, which then ignited and exploded. At the time of the explosion, 730 high school students and teachers were gathered in the auditorium. Once the explosion occurred, it was impossible to contain. The roof of the auditorium was blown off during the explosion and then collapsed. The remaining classrooms were also destroyed. The first to hear the news was a female telephone operator who rushed to the scene immediately. According to her, nine out of ten of the school's 1,300 students had been killed, and the scene was littered with the dismembered bodies of children. The school principal, Mr. Pu, also stated that the death toll was between 500 and 1,000. The exact number is difficult to calculate as most of the bodies have not yet been recovered. Two hours after the explosion, 100 bodies had been transported to the nearby town of Henderson. Injured and dead children have also been sent here. Local public institutions and churches have been temporarily converted into mortuaries and hospitals. The New London school is known as the largest rural school in the world. The school buildings are located on a hilltop surrounded by pine forests and numerous oil pools. At the time of the explosion, most of the students were in the auditorium, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe. New London is a small town with a population of less than 1,000. The capacity for telegraph and telephone communications is naturally limited, so accurate reports of the tragedy were difficult to obtain at first. (18th, National Telegram)

⊙New London: Eight hours after the primary school collapsed, two students, a boy and a girl, both about twelve years old, were found in the rubble, unharmed and embracing each other. They were standing under an arched doorway, and the roof had collapsed on top of it, so they were not crushed to death. It is said that about 50 students' mothers were gathered in the gymnasium of another building to attend a school parent-teacher conference when they heard the school collapse. They hurriedly ran across the athletic field and clawed away bricks and tiles with their bare hands to find their children. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

### The British Naval Secretary Expresses Concern About Unlimited Naval Competition

Hoping to Implement the New London Naval Treaty, Military Spending at Singapore Port Rises Sharply to Protect British Interests in the Pacific

[London] Regarding reports that the Japanese government intends to reject the 14-inch caliber limit on battleship guns stipulated in last year's London Naval Treaty, Naval Secretary Sir Hoare made a special declaration to the House of Commons this afternoon, saying, "The UK's new battleships will be equipped with 14-inch caliber guns and will not be built as battleships above 35,000 tons. The UK has decided to do so on the condition that other naval powers do the same. I dare say that this approach is in the best interest of the whole world, and I believe that by doing so, no country's navy will lose its efficiency. On the contrary, if one of the naval powers installs guns of a larger caliber than 14 inches or builds battleships over 35,000 tons, we would be greatly regretful. In short, we should proceed with our original plan, and I hope that this plan will not be changed in the future. However, if other countries abandon the agreement to limit the caliber of guns, we should reconsider the situation at that time." Sir Hoare then defended the government's naval shipbuilding program, saying, "The funds I am requesting from Congress are necessary for fulfilling our country's collective obligations and for defending our country's coasts and imperial territories. Our country's naval fleet must take into account both collective security and imperial security, and it must be able to perform its duties simultaneously in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. In short, our obligations are not limited to one hemisphere, and if our country's navy had been stronger than it is today several years ago, world peace would have been greatly enhanced." Finally, Sir Hoare refuted claims that the British naval shipbuilding program would lead to a naval arms race, saying that he hoped that the London Naval Treaty signed last year would still be implemented. "If this treaty cannot be adopted by the major naval powers, and if naval powers repeat competition in tonnage and armaments without limit, it would be a great calamity for the whole world." (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)

[London] Labour MP Mr. Hall raised the issue of funding for the Singapore naval base in the House of Commons today, saying that the cost of this base has increased from £7 million to £11.5 million, and that the £1.75 million to be paid by the army and air force is not included. Naval official Mr. Lim said that the reason why the expenditure on the Singapore naval port is more than it was two or three years ago is entirely due to the adoption of new engineering plans, such as increasing the north embankment to accommodate battleships and increasing the capacity by 50%. The foundation of the naval port is now in place, and the entire plan will be completed in a few years. It will increase even more in the coming year, but it is not difficult to accurately estimate the total cost at present. After the completion of this project, this naval port can be a very clear indication that the UK is prepared to protect its interests in the Pacific. The UK will protect the interests enjoyed by British 漢洲 New Zealand and others in the Pacific. Of course, the UK has no intention of aggression against Japan, which is 4,000 miles away.

### Austro-Hungarian Talks Begin

Discussing Three Current Issues

⊙Budapest: Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg has arrived in Hungary to return the visit and arrived here at 5:10 PM by plane from Vienna. Prime Minister Darányi personally went to the airport to greet him. After leaving the airport, Schuschnigg drove to see Regent Horthy at 6:00 PM and began talks with Darányi and 外是加尼亞 in the evening. The talks will continue tomorrow morning. Tomorrow afternoon, Schuschnigg will take a plane back to Vienna. According to Schuschnigg, who met with Austrian reporters before departing from Vienna, the outcome of this trip will not be surprising, as the foreign policy of Austria and Hungary is based on the Rome Protocols of Austria, Hungary, and Italy, and there is no need for change. However, responsible officials here say that when key figures from Austria and Hungary hold talks, they will discuss three issues: first, to define the relationship between Austria and Hungary within the framework of the Rome Protocol; second, Hungary's attitude towards the activities of the National Socialist Party in the Danube River basin countries; and third, the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria. Responsible parties also believe that Schuschnigg was originally scheduled to go to Italy next month to meet with Mussolini. The purpose of this visit to Hungary is to prepare before going to Rome. As for rumors that the foreign policy of Austria and Hungary will be changed, its main purpose is to establish a relationship between Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, which has already been denied by responsible parties. However, some people in political circles believe that it is not impossible. Demonstrations held repeatedly by the Green National Socialist Party here have made Hungary deeply aware of the harm of National Socialism, and Italy is now developing in the Mediterranean region, fearing that it will no longer be able to prevent the expansion of German power in the Danube River basin. For this reason, the Hungarian government has to relax its ties with Germany and try to win over Czechoslovakia for assistance, which is also natural. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)

Paris Shooting

### Was the French Female Reporter In Love With Mussolini?

300 Photos Seized From Residence, Real Name Revealed in Diary

[Paris] The murderer, Madam Fangdanqi, a woman who changed from being an actress to a journalist, was arrested on the spot. More than 300 photos of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini were seized from her residence, including a huge one with Mussolini's autograph on it. This proves what Fangdanqi told the police a few days ago: "尚伯兰 made me lose the love of a major Italian politician. 金 deeply believed 尚氏, so I told him a secret. Unexpectedly, he leaked my words and spread rumors to hurt me. I regret that I could not kill him with my own hands because I was not accurate with the gun." It is indeed thought-provoking. In addition, a diary was found, and it was learned that Madam Fangdanqi's real name is Madam Fanlilei, which also contained records involving Mussolini and 尚伯兰. This diary has now been sealed and kept secret. However, Madam Fangdanqi's lawyer declared that the relationship between Madam and a certain Italian politician has nothing to do with the assassination case. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

[London] The 明鏡 Daily reported today that the female reporter Madam Fangdanqi shot former French Ambassador to Italy 尚伯兰 in Paris yesterday, the reason being that 尚伯兰 had leaked her love for Mussolini to others. It is said that Madam Fangdanqi had two conversations with Mussolini two years ago, and once, when 黑索里尼 gave a speech to the crowd on the balcony of the Venice Palace, Madam Fangdanqi threw an orange at him. Mussolini caught the orange and waved to Madam Fangdanqi. (19th, National Telegram)

### Madam Simpson's Divorce Case is Retried in London Court

The Original Judgment Remains Valid

[London] Regarding the divorce case between Madam Simpson and her ex-husband, although the Ipswich City Court in the UK ruled to grant the divorce on October 27 last year, Sir 彭思斯, the civil prosecutor, recently submitted new facts to the London Court, requesting that it be revoked. The London Court opened the trial this morning. After 彭恩斯 stated the reasons, the Attorney General declared that, according to these new facts, Madam Simpson and her ex-husband did not have any "collusion and fraud" (that is, mutual agreement in advance that Madam Simpson would request a divorce on the grounds that her husband committed adultery). Madam Simpson did not lose control in her behavior, so the divorce "ruling" established on October 27 last year should still take effect on April 27 this year. Therefore, the Duke of Windsor can marry Madam Simpson after this ruling takes effect. (Central News Agency, 19th, Havas)

### The Roman Pope Rejects Communism

Saying it Contradicts Christian Truth, Sympathy for the Oppressed Russian People

⊙Vatican City: Pope Pius XI today issued an encyclical condemning atheistic communism and warning the world that communism has made all countries feel a serious danger, so there must be a novel and serious philosophy to expose the fallacies of communism and compare them with the truth in Catholicism. The Pope believes that there are two reasons why communism has been widely spread: one is the ingenuity of the propaganda methods, and the other is the silence of public opinion. As for the oppressed Russian people, the Pope expressed deep sympathy for them, saying that this is a political system. The Pope also said that the wages that working workers should receive should not be regarded as relief from charitable causes. Employers should know that the wages of workers must be sufficient for their entire family to maintain human dignity. All parties deeply agreed with the Pope's general theory, calling it an important social document that confirms the rights of workers. According to reliable sources, the Pope's health has improved day by day.御醫米蘭尼 has decided to take the Pope to visit the Vatican Gardens by car on Jesus' Resurrection Day. The Pope also wants to participate in the Resurrection worship at St. Peter's Church and bless the public as usual. (18th, National Telegram)

### Tianjin Two Major Stores Case of Selling Smuggled Goods

Seized by Customs, Valued at Over 50,000 Yuan. The Chamber of Commerce Publicly Negotiates with Customs.

Tianjin Dispatch: On the morning of the 17th, at around 9:00 AM, the Tianjin Customs received a report that Dunqinglong and Ruifu Xiang, two large department stores on Gu Yi Street in the city, were selling smuggled goods. Customs dispatched special commissioner Zhang Guide, along with detectives from the 3rd Detective Team of the Police Bureau, and patrol officer Zhang Zhaoquan from the First Precinct of the Third Branch, leading over a dozen police officers to search the warehouses of the two stores. Inside the warehouse of Ruifu Xiang Qingji, they discovered over 50 pieces of various brands of Japanese Ito factory-made cloth, each piece containing ten bolts, valued at approximately 20,000 yuan. There were also over 600 bolts of broadcloth and other items, valued at over 10,000 yuan. Subsequently, inside the warehouse of Dunqinglong, they found 11 packages of finished artificial silk and over 130 bolts of plain white cloth, totaling over 15,000 yuan. All items were transported to the customs warehouse by truck and confiscated. This incident greatly shocked the business community in the city. Both stores are located on Gu Yi Street, each with over a century of history. They have always prided themselves on being the oldest and most well-established in the industry. Their strong capital base also ranks them among the top merchants in Tianjin. Ji Hua, a shareholder of Dunqinglong, is a well-known figure in the Tianjin business community, having served as the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce last year and currently serving as a standing committee member. Shareholders of Ruifu Xiang are also committee members of the Silk and Cloth Yarn Trade Association. This dishonorable incident, whether true or not, is embarrassing. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened an urgent meeting that day and dispatched Wang Wenzao, director of the Commercial Affairs Section, along with Cao Zhujiu, a committee member of the Silk and Cloth Yarn Trade Association, to negotiate with the customs. The customs refused to return the goods, citing conclusive evidence. Regarding future penalties, they stated that it would be decided after the Tax Bureau reviews the matter. However, they stipulated that if the two stores could provide customs duty receipts for the goods within five hours, the goods could be returned and the penalty proceedings would be terminated. After receiving the negotiators' report, the two stores were unable to provide the receipts within the specified time. Therefore, as of the 18th, the customs' attitude remained firm, insisting on confiscating the goods and prosecuting the matter. On the morning of the 18th, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held another meeting. In addition to sending a direct letter to the customs based on the Silk and Cloth Yarn Trade Association's statement, stating that the goods were indeed purchased from foreign merchants and had undergone customs duty procedures, they cited examples of imported goods, stating that the responsibility for paying taxes on imported goods lies with the importers, and goods sold in the mainland are all duty-paid. There have never been any issues with merchants buying and selling, and customs have never inspected warehouses. The seized goods should not be regarded as smuggled goods. They also requested that customs pay attention to the following in the future: when inspecting commercial establishments, they should cooperate with personnel dispatched by the Chamber of Commerce; if suspicious goods are found, they should be sealed in the presence of a Chamber of Commerce representative before investigation. They should not be immediately transported away to avoid panic in the business community. The customs did not heed the letter. The Chamber of Commerce then sent committee member Wang Xiaoyan to visit Ma Yanchong, the secretary-general of the Municipal Government, requesting his support. The Municipal Government largely agreed with the commercial establishments' proposal that inspections of smuggled goods should be carried out in cooperation with the Chamber of Commerce and has forwarded it to Sun Weidong, the Tianjin Customs Supervisor, for transmission to Mei Weiliang, the Tax Commissioner.

In recent years, Tianjin has been a source for Japanese ruffians smuggling in North China and a drainage point for smuggled goods from the pseudo-area of Eastern Hebei. Given its special environment, the customs' influence cannot reach commercial establishments in the concessions, and it is not surprising that they openly sell smuggled goods. Stores in the Chinese-controlled areas are directly affected. To maintain their business, they have no choice but to purchase and sell smuggled goods to compete with the lower-priced goods from businesses in the concessions. This has continued to this day, and even large stores with hundreds of years of honest history cannot maintain their commercial integrity and must rely on smuggled goods to sustain their operations. The Dunqinglong and Ruifu Xiang incident is one such example. (18th)

### The Truth About the General Strike in Wuhu

Due to the Business Tax Bureau's Armed Audit. Merchants Request Government to Revise Tax Rates.

Wuhu Dispatch: On the 16th, all kinds of businesses in Wuhu suddenly closed their doors and declared a strike at 2:00 PM due to public outrage over the Business Tax Bureau's armed, door-to-door audit and the arrest of several merchants. Merchants gathered at the Chamber of Commerce for discussion and held a protest march. The military and police were immediately dispatched to maintain order, creating a tense atmosphere. On the 17th, the government's attitude was extremely firm, and the arrested merchants were not released. Therefore, the entire city remained closed for business. The provincial government of Anhui set business tax rates particularly high compared to the capital of Nanjing and various places in Zhejiang Province in order to obtain sufficient funding. Merchants in various counties and towns have been constantly protesting because they cannot bear the burden. Last year, the Provincial Department of Finance summoned representatives from the Anqing, Wuhu, and other major county and city chambers of commerce to the provincial capital for discussion, but there was no result. At the joint conference of chambers of commerce from various counties and towns in the province held in Wuhu last month to study income tax, the effort to reduce business tax rates attracted much attention. However, since the provincial government regards business tax as a large source of funding, it has spared no effort in rectification. In addition to organizing a Business Tax Consolidation Committee, it ordered the Wuhu Business Tax Bureau to implement door-to-door audits first to prevent tax evasion by merchants. After receiving the order, the Tax Bureau sent personnel accompanied by guards to the streets on the 16th and went directly to various commercial establishments for inspection. Unexpectedly, Lu Chunpu, the owner of Lu Rongji Yarn Store in Ximen, and Hou Hongda, the owner of Yuxinghou Noodle Shop, were arrested for slight resistance and paraded through the streets as a demonstration. As a result, the various stores felt a sense of shared grief and were outraged, closing their doors and going on strike. They immediately gathered at the County Chamber of Commerce to discuss countermeasures. Although Cui Lianggong, the chairman of the Chamber, repeatedly advised them not to be too hasty, the public was already extremely angry and could not be restrained. Subsequently, they went to the Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Second District to appeal and petition, but to no avail. They returned to the County Chamber of Commerce, and in their anger, the masses unanimously decided not to reopen until the corrupt officials who harassed the people were punished and the tax rates were reduced. In addition to posting white paper and red character notices stating "Business Tax Bureau, illegal oppression, merchants forced to suspend business," they sent telegrams to the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Control Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, overseas compatriots, and the Anhui Provincial Government and Anhui-Jiangxi Inspectorate to report the facts of the heavy burden of business tax, the armed audit of the Tax Bureau, and the strike. They also requested that personnel be sent to Wuhu for thorough investigation to prevent the unrest from spreading. Yang Mianzhong, the director of the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance, happened to be in Wuhu due to other matters. After the unrest occurred, he expressed his opinions: (1) The merchants' strike is a local security issue, and the responsibility lies with the local officials. (2) The business tax regulations were drafted by the provincial government and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. As for the merchants' request to reduce the tax rates, according to the business tax regulations, it must be deemed necessary by the provincial government and reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Currently, the Provincial Department of Finance is still studying the merchants' request for tax reduction. The results will come in time. The provincial government has not rejected the merchants' request. (3) If the incident occurred today due to Tax Bureau personnel deliberately harassing merchants, the Tax Bureau should be responsible. If the merchants do not want the audit, then the responsibility lies with the merchants.

Currently, the atmosphere in the city is extremely desolate. The detention of Lu Chunpu and Hou Hongda at the police station for a whole night has made the merchants feel even angrier. On the morning of the 17th, they gathered at the Chamber of Commerce again and held a temporary joint conference of representatives from various industries. The resolutions passed were as follows: (1) The strike will continue pending investigation by higher authorities. (2) Director Yang of the Finance Department should convene a meeting of chambers of commerce from the entire province as soon as possible to discuss revising the provincial business tax collection regulations and reducing tax rates in line with Nanjing and Zhejiang. (3) An Business Tax Review Committee will be organized. (4) Bai Yunsheng, the chief of the Business Tax Bureau, and his staff, who abused their authority, will be removed and punished, and the Consolidation Committee will be abolished. (5) Representatives from various industries will be sent to the police station to express their concern for the detained merchants. (6) There should be no more armed audits in the future. At the same time, the merchants issued a self-declaration, stating that under severe oppression, they have no choice but to suspend business indefinitely, awaiting slaughter. Telegrams were also sent to chambers of commerce in various counties and towns, informing them of the incident in Wuhu and urging them to rise up and fight for their rights together. Judging from the situation, the strike is unlikely to be resolved in one or two days. However, if the standoff lasts for a long time, the direct losses suffered by the merchants will be extremely significant, and the people's food supply will also be greatly affected, which is not fortunate for the locality.

### After the Signing of the Agreement on Lu Salt Export to Japan, It Will Be Affected

Since the price of Changlu salt has been lowered, the price of Lu salt exported to Japan will also decrease

Jinan Dispatch: Regarding the issue of Changlu salt being exported to Japan, the authorities on both sides have negotiated and signed a contract. The price is 2.362 yuan per ton. After the draft contract is approved by the Ministry of Finance, the export will be implemented. Export to Japan is also the main destination for Lu salt products, with approximately 250,000 tons exported annually. The price is slightly more expensive than Changlu salt. Although the signing of the Changlu salt export to Japan will not have a significant impact in form, the impact on price revenue will be very significant. According to Li Zhifan, the director of the Lu Salt Affairs Inspection Office, "Japan needs a lot of salt every year. The annual demand for industrial salt alone is 1.35 million tons. In addition to China's supply, there are also supplies from European countries and the Red Sea coast. Although it has now ordered 230,000 tons of Changlu salt, this 230,000 tons is only a small part of its required quantity, and the suppliers are not just one country. Therefore, it will definitely not affect the quantity of salt exported from our province to Japan. However, the export price of salt from our province will inevitably decrease in the future, just like a competitive sale of goods in a store. Even if it is below cost, they will compete to lower the price. The Changlu salt is old salt from two or three years ago. The cost must be less because the living standard was extremely low at that time. Therefore, the export price is also low. Lu salt is a newly produced product, and all expenses are high, so the price is also higher. In the future, the export price of Lu salt must be similar to the export price of Changlu salt. Therefore, there is a large impact on the income from salt exports in our province." (18th)

Five people drowned in the lake

Due to a low pressure passing through the Yellow Sea, strong winds, sudden climate changes, and continuous rain, the lake caused the tragic drowning of five people. There was a fishing boat of the Wu family in the Kangshan branch of Wutangmen in the third district, with a total of seven men and women. Apart from an old woman in her sixties and a three-year-old child who were living in the cabin, the remaining five people were all fishing with nets at the bow of the boat. At about 6:00 PM the other night, a strong wind blew in the lake, and the waves were surging. The five men and women were still standing at the bow of the boat to fish. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused all five people to fall into the lake at the same time. Only one old and one young person in the cabin escaped. Although neighboring fishing boats caught a glimpse at that time, they were too busy to take care of themselves due to the strong winds and waves and could not rescue them. It was not until the next day that the fishing boat was found aground on the Kangshan branch. Others devised a way to send the two old and young people to their relatives' homes for temporary accommodation. The bodies of those who drowned in the lake have not yet been recovered. It's so tragic.

▲The match at Yiyuan at 2:30 PM today depends on the weather.

▲The tickets from the last Shenyuan refund are valid today and invalid after the deadline.

The international cup replay match between China and Portugal, which has been postponed twice, has been scheduled to be held at Yiyuan at 1:30 PM today. The list of the Chinese team was finalized last night, but due to the continuous spring rain yesterday, there is a lot of water in the venue. If the sun does not shine brightly this morning, there is no hope of holding the match, and it will inevitably be postponed again. In addition, there are two matches in Group A, Rax vs. Jinan and Sucor vs. French Merchants, which will be held in Hongkou Park and the Racecourse, respectively. It is feared that they will also be blocked. The Chinese lineup is as follows:

Referee: Butt, side referees: Chen Jixiang, Terry.

It is also reported that the refund tickets for the Donghua vs. Losier match at Zhongyuan on March 6 can be used to enter the Yiyuan stadium to watch the match between China and Portugal today. Those who hold this kind of admission ticket can go to use it today. It will be invalid after the deadline.

### Mayor Wu's Speech on the Literacy Education Movement in Shanghai (1)

Attending the Annual Meeting of the International Education Society

The Shanghai International Education Society is a group composed of Chinese and Western educators in the city. This year's annual meeting was held last night at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. Mayor Wu was invited to give a speech on "The Literacy Education Movement in Shanghai." The original text of his speech is recorded below:

Today, the Shanghai International Education Society is holding its annual meeting in this city. As the host, Tiecheng (吳鐵城) feels honored to gather with Chinese and foreign education experts. I am also grateful for the invitation from your society to attend and give a speech. Tiecheng has no specialized research in education, so I will give a simple report on the literacy education movement in this city, and I hope that all experts will give practical criticisms of this basic movement for building the nation and educating the people. The meaning of a modern country, along with the great torrent of the times, has evolved from passive law and order to active nurturing.

The duties of a modern government have also changed from simple to complex due to social progress and the promotion of the times. Municipal administration is not only a part of national administration, but also a microcosm of national administration. Naturally, it should also follow this path of political evolution and attempt active improvement. Therefore, in governing this city, Tiecheng, in addition to promoting the construction of general municipal affairs, also emphasizes the development of social and educational undertakings.

The fundamental driving force of a nation's progress and cultural development is knowledge. The level of knowledge can not only affect the rise and fall of culture, but also determine the prosperity and decline of a nation. In the historical evolution, education is not only the initial stage of nation-building, but also the starting point of human evolution. Therefore, in order to fulfill its mission of nation-building, the Chinese Kuomintang has a plan for six movements, one of which is the National Literacy Education Movement, which is enough to show the great importance of the literacy education movement to the construction of a new China.

Tiecheng believes that this matter is of great significance, and Shanghai is the cultural center of the country. Therefore, starting from July 1st of the 24th year of the Republic of China, we implemented a compulsory literacy education movement in order to gradually eliminate illiteracy in this city and improve the knowledge of citizens. The general situation of this work in this city is reported as follows (to be continued).

Securities

### Major Players Continuously Push Up Prices, Government Bonds Reach New Highs

Rising Three to Four Yuan in Two Days, Classes B, C, and D Exceed 70% of Par, Trading Volume Breaks Recent Records

Yesterday, the market on the Chinese Securities Exchange continued its frenzied rise. For a time, short sellers covered their positions, and bullish players increased their stakes. Major players appeared to continue buying, and retail investors also increasingly turned bullish. Market prices soared, reaching unprecedented highs since the introduction of unified government bonds. Classes B, C, and D all exceeded the 70 yuan mark, rising by a substantial three to four yuan in two days, far exceeding the expected range. The bullish camp has built extremely high defenses, and spot goods are flowing out. On the surface, major players are selling on one hand and buying on the other, indicating manipulation. The entry and exit of various players are actually already in motion, and the bullish trend is gradually shifting into the hands of retail investors. Moreover, most of the bullish players are from the gold and yarn industries, entering covertly and exiting overtly. A reversal is not far off. Throughout the day, Class E bonds initially rose by 6 jiao due to insufficient gains the previous day. However, they gradually weakened and retreated by 2, 3, or 4 jiao. In the second session, bullish players raised prices again to prevent a decline, creating a situation where they had no choice but to continue riding the tiger. Therefore, after a slight decline of a few jiao for Class E bonds, they were raised again. Front-month Class A bonds were 6.5 jiao higher. In the afternoon, the price continued to be raised, and the rally was extremely strong, rising again by several jiao to 1.25 yuan. However, major players such as Nos. 4, 10, 21, 32, 54, and 58 were all selling, while only Nos. 5 and 34 were buying. The trend was that front-month bonds rose by more than one yuan, while Class A bonds only rose by 2 or 3 jiao. The situation clearly indicated a potential decline. However, the bullish players feared a reversal and mustered their remaining strength to raise prices again. On the one hand, Nos. 5, 10, 24, and 71 were all unloading, and spot goods from the financial sector also flowed out in the afternoon. Although market prices are high, optimism should not be excessive. In the end, market prices rose by another 1.05 yuan to 1.95 yuan. The total trading volume reached 16 million yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared and listed in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).

Yarn and Cotton

### Yarn Sales Remain Active, Spot Yarn Especially Good for Near Months

Speculative Buying of Near Months and Selling of Far Months, Wider Spreads between Months

Spring yarn sales are developing, with the Sichuan and Hubei (蜀帮) merchants taking the lead. The Tianjin (天津帮) merchants of North China also followed suit. Yesterday, a large quantity of 3,770 bales of coarse and fine yarn were sold. Other merchants from Sichuan, the interior, and Guangdong also followed, totaling more than 5,640 bales. As a result, the market was shaken, and floating traders, realizing the unfavorable situation, rushed to cover their positions. At the same time, rumors were rampant in the market that there would be an increase in the consolidated tax on cotton yarn, with an increase of 2 yuan per bale starting on April 1st. As a result, customers were even more eager to purchase spot goods. However, compared to the opening prices on Monday, the prices of all months had risen by 9.3 yuan to 6 yuan. Moreover, bullish players took advantage of the spring sales season to buy near-month contracts and sell far-month contracts, which is why the spread between the fourth and fifth months widened further yesterday.

March-April Approaching 45 Yuan

In the spot yarn market, prices opened lower in the morning due to the continued decline in overseas yarn and cotton prices. The first session remained flat and sluggish. However, after the close of the entire third session, it was reported that sales of spot yarn remained active, and procurement of coarse yarn by North China merchants was picking up. The intake of Sichuan merchants was also strong. As a result, market sentiment improved, and floating traders covered their positions. Market prices suddenly rose sharply and turned bullish. In the end, the prices of all months in the spot yarn market rose by 5 jiao to 1.1 yuan compared to the closing prices of the previous day. In the afternoon, the near-term market was firm, especially the April contracts. Short sellers were actively covering their positions. However, the far-term market was weaker due to the decline in the market for third-grade yarn, and some bullish players were selling far-month contracts and turning bearish. In the end, near-month contracts rose by 7 jiao to 1.2 yuan compared to the morning closing prices, while far-month contracts rose by 5 and 7 jiao. It was found that Hengyi (恒益) sold 2,100 bales, Shenji (愼記) sold 1,650 bales, Zhenda (振大) sold 1,450 bales, Juxing (聚興) sold 1,250 yuan, Taifeng (太豐) sold 1,600 bales, Jinchang (錦昌) sold 2,500 bales, Gengfeng (賡豐) sold 4,550 bales, Senkang (森康) sold 2,000 bales, Taichang (泰昌) sold 1,700 bales, Yichang (益昶) sold 2,900 bales, Jiankang (澗康) sold 2,400 bales, Shengyuan (生源) sold 1,200 bales, Tonghe (同和) sold 1,900 bales, Fukang (福康) sold 4,350 bales, Dachang (大昶) sold 1,800 bales, and Xincheng (信誠) sold 1,650 bales. Tongfeng (同豐) bought 1,000 bales, Youda (由大) bought 1,450 bales, Yuda (裕大) bought 11,250 bales, Yukang (裕康) bought 1,100 bales, Hexing (合興) bought 4,550 bales, Dachangcheng (大昌成) bought 4,200 bales, Xiecheng (協成) bought 2,100 bales, Jifeng (吉豐) bought 1,000 bales, Shenchang (愼昌) bought 1,000 bales, and Senkang bought 1,050 bales. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.

North China Purchases Coarse Yarn

Spot yarn sales remain brisk, and merchants in North China are purchasing a large quantity of coarse yarn. It was found that a total of 5,641 bales were purchased by various merchants throughout the day, with selling prices rising by more than 2 yuan. However, daily transactions (from the beginning of the week to yesterday) have not been significant, and it is rumored that the actual goods have not yet been moved, with very few shipments. Therefore, some market participants suspect that the transactions made in recent days may not all be for actual sales, and may be speculative transactions. The purchase amounts for each merchant yesterday are listed below.

### Overseas Cotton Turns Back, Spot Cotton Falls Rapidly

Large Quantities of Coarse Cotton Continue to Arrive, No Fear of Depletion of Contracts This Month

The cotton market has weakened due to the decline in US cotton by more than 10 pounds. Third-grade spot cotton has fallen by 1 yuan to 2.4 yuan, and market sentiment has softened slightly. In addition, there is a sufficient supply of contracts for delivery this month. The amount of new cotton that has passed inspection has reached over 60,000 bales, and there is also a large quantity of arbitrage cotton. This is all coarse cotton, which is the raw material for spinning 16s and 17s yarn, and the demand from factories is relatively low. As a result, the market has been pressured and has retreated. Far-month contracts have fallen below the 6 yuan mark.

All Months Fall by 4 or 5 Jiao

In the spot cotton market, prices opened lower in the morning due to the continued decline in US cotton by 13 to 16 pounds, flat Indian cotton, and a sharp decline in Osaka third-grade cotton by more than 1 yuan to 2.25 yuan. As a result, market sentiment was flat, and prices for all months fell uniformly by 2 or 3 jiao. However, by the close of the session, the yarn market had improved, and there was a slight upward trend. However, the ample supply of coarse cotton for delivery this month put heavy pressure on the market, and the close was also small. In the end, the prices of all months in the spot cotton market fell by 1.5 jiao to 3 jiao compared to the closing prices of the previous day. In the afternoon, the market trended towards flatness, and the buying pressure was relatively weak due to the congestion of deliveries this month and the downward trend in overseas cotton markets. In the end, the prices of all months fell again by 1.5 jiao to 2 jiao compared to the morning closing prices. It was found that Tongji (通記) sold 3,400 bales, Zhenda (振大) sold 3,600 bales, Mingde (明德) sold 3,700 bales, Jinchang (錦昌) sold 5,900 bales, Changyu (長餘) sold 3,800 bales, Renfeng (仁豐) sold 7,500 bales, Yuanyi (元一) sold 3,800 bales, Dachangcheng (大昌成) sold 7,600 bales, Changfeng (長豐) sold 11,400 bales, Fukang (福康) sold 3,000 bales, Tonghe (同和) sold 7,600 bales, and Yuanxingchang (源興昌) sold 6,500 bales. Xiecheng (協成) bought 11,200 bales, Changji (昶記) bought 3,100 bales, Jifeng (積豐) bought 6,700 bales, Taifeng (大豐) bought 2,900 bales, Hexing (合興) bought 3,300 bales, Shenchang (愼昌) bought 4,700 bales, Senkang (森康) bought 4,000 bales, Fengtai (豐泰) bought 5,100 bales, Yichang (益昶) bought 2,900 bales, Yongchang (永昌) bought 2,800 bales, Dachang (大昶) bought 1,800 bales, Shenji (愼記) bought 1,700 bales, Hengde (恒德) bought 1,500 bales, and Daji (達記) bought 1,300 bales. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.

Cotton Manufacturers Continue to Buy

Current cotton consumption is still brisk, and factory demand is not weak. However, the source has not been seen, it is said.

Yesterday, the US cotton market showed a tendency to reverse, with prices falling by 6 pounds to rising by 3 pounds. Bullish players in domestic and overseas markets closed their positions. At the same time, the labor unrest was severe, the stock market did not rise, and Washington's intention was that high prices would lead to an increase in cotton fields. Therefore, some buyers sold with stop-loss orders. Near-month contracts rebounded slightly due to purchases by industry players. However, the future situation of May contracts is uncertain. Mid-session, prices rebounded briefly due to purchases by industry players and short covering. However, the prices fell again due to short sellers re-entering the market. In terms of current demand, premium grades are doing well, while lower grades are weak. The close was flat and sluggish. Spot prices fell by 15 pounds, and futures prices fell by 13 to 18 pounds. UK spot cotton fell by 8 points, and futures fell by 8 to 10 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to bullish position closing, then strengthened due to buying by futures traders, then fell again due to further selling by bullish players, and finally rose again due to buying by industry players and bullish players. Bengal cotton rose by 1 rupee, and Oomra and Broach cotton rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (Telegram dated 18th).

According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 19th is that Broach will be 248 rupees, Oomra will be 234.75 rupees, and Bengal will be 197 rupees, all down 4 rupees.

Attached is the weekend statistics for Egyptian cotton (unit: 1,000 kantars).

Piece Goods

### Spring and Summer Cloth Sales Gradually Stir

Eastern Goods Stores Tentatively Begin to Rise

Yesterday, the cloth market was affected by the rain, and sales on this street turned quiet. However, due to the strong bullish sentiment for standard yarn, Eastern goods stores tentatively began to rise, which greatly encouraged the industry. Fine cloth and fine twill prices were quoted about five cents higher per bolt. Due to a shortage of heavy-weight goods from this factory, the market for coarse cloth was also quite strong, but transactions were only sporadic. Fine twill from Changzhou also rose five cents to one dime per bolt due to a lack of arrivals. The Hefei and Wuhu gangs purchased over a hundred packages, and the Guangdong gang purchased over a hundred cases of assorted plain silk from various factories. There are gradual signs of movement in spring and summer goods. Only small amounts of restocking occurred for other Yangtze River products. Therefore, the market for light-colored spring and summer goods is still unlikely to improve.

Finance

### Benchmark Gold Price Remarkably Stable

The gold market yesterday initially saw fluctuating exchange rates due to contraction in overseas silver markets and divergent rises and falls. London spot gold remained unchanged. The Central Bank's official rate remained the same for both the British pound and the US dollar. The customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard benchmark gold price remained at $1157.40.

### Forward Foreign Exchange Slightly Tight

HSBC's rates for the British pound and US dollar remained unchanged and stable. Later, foreign firms stuffed near-term and bought forward, with banks hedging the swap. Although foreign firms stuffed near-term, banks maintained support, resulting in a struggling situation. The equalization tax contracted by half a cent, but had little impact. Later, although large Chinese merchants sold shillings, foreign banks had a good appetite and held firm. As a result, near-term rates closed slightly and forward rates tightened. Compared to the previous day, the British pound and US dollar were flat for near-term and tight for forward-term. The shilling was soft by 0.015625, and the US dollar was soft by 0.03125.

Yesterday, Zheng Jin bought 75 for 104 yuan for March for the Eastern exchange. Transactions totaled over 100,000 yuan.

Silk and Tea

### Raw Silk Rises Too Quickly, Exceeding Anti-Movement

Yesterday, overseas silk markets, both the Japanese and American exchanges, reported declines. This was due to a correction after excessive gains in previous days. However, New York silk merchants held prices quite firmly, so the future development is still unpredictable. According to yesterday's New York Exchange, near-term prices fell by five points, and futures fell by four and a half points. Yokohama spot prices fell by 15 yuan, and futures fell by 10 yuan. However, New York's held prices showed signs of rising. Japanese silk, grades 83 and 75, each rose by three points. Shanghai silk, grade 78, and Guangdong silk each rose by two points. Lyon silk has been quite stable. Although the recent sharp rises and falls in American silk have been rapid, it has maintained its consistent calm attitude. Yesterday's silk prices were all sold at the previous prices. The local silk market yesterday saw few transactions due to weak overseas silk prices, while domestic prices remained firm. However, in addition to white filature, grey silk and tussah silk were sold in small quantities. Tussah silk was sold at 690 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of five yuan from the previous day. The asking price for grey silk was 375 yuan, and the chemical treatment price was 400 yuan, an increase of about 15 yuan from the previous week. User silk was sold slightly yesterday, but was not strong. A total of 157 bales of broad silk were traded.

### Pingshui Gunpowder Tea Sales Active in Europe

Recently, there have been frequent good news reports from overseas tea markets. Pingshui Gunpowder tea from Zhejiang province has the most active sales in the African Moroccan market. Most of the stocks in the hands of merchants have been cleared. Prices have risen sharply by over 20 francs this month, and merchants have profited considerably. The Zhen Mei teas from Luzhuang and Tuzhuang roads are slightly inferior to Gunpowder tea due to the large amount of tea stored, leading to low-priced competitive sales. According to tea merchants, when new goods open in the Shanghai market in the future, apart from Gunpowder tea, the rest will not be able to rise in price.

North and South Goods

### Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Supply Disrupted

—Market Price Rises by Two Yuan—

Due to the recent disruption of supply of Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, stocks have become scarce. Therefore, the previous market price of 29.8 to 30 yuan per load of bulk tuber has now risen, and sellers are unwilling to sell for less than 32 yuan. For example, pickled tuber from Fuling, which previously opened at 25.5 yuan, is now asking for 26 or 27 yuan. In recent days, the Guangdong and Tianjin gangs have been buying smoothly, and the market is tight, with signs of further increase.

Grains

### Flour Bulls Finish Strongly

The lowest record since last year at 3 yuan, 8 jiao, 3 and a half fen

Yesterday's flour market presented an initial settlement for each month, followed by a recent trend of decline. Chicago wheat prices were up 2-3 jiao, Canada up 2-4 jiao, and Liverpool showed a slight increase. When opening prices, the good wheat market stabilized the market somewhat and so the opening prices for this month were still good at 8 jiao 9 fen, but as actual sales were not smooth and Tianjin prices also fell 5 fen, the excess of bull positions was compelling for immediate settlement and the market was in a downward slide. April also followed suit to drop by 2-3 fen due to the frenzied selling of floating positions, while the July-August prices dropped a little less because there were fewer long positions in buying. Later in the afternoon opening, prices experienced a record low since last year at 3 yuan, 8 jiao, 3 and a half fen because there were no takers for the bulls coming out, and a heavy drop of another 2 fen also occurred for April. July-August trading was busy and prices still hovered. In the recent market, actual goods are abundant and the bulls are unable to absorb the goods and so prices are falling again and again, and it is feared that they will be difficult to reverse in the short term.

### Tianjin Gang Abandons Receipt of Goods, Wheat This Month Drops Another 5 Fen

Yesterday's futures wheat market was stable after the morning opening but remained unaccumulated for recent months. In the morning, various prices still reported an increase of 2-3-4 jiao for wheat and the continuous rainy weather calmed the inner and outer market. Trading was smooth and the market had few comings and goings. However, in the afternoon opening, the price for this month increased by 6 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen as multiple client longs sold off and there were rumors of the Tianjin Gang abandoning some shipments which made the market very nervous. April also dropped 3-4 fen and then shorts slightly filled and returned to 2-3 fen. New wheat prices for June and below were hovering and slightly flat and dropped about 1 fen. The actual wheat market was very smooth in delivery and prices continued to drop 2-3 fen. Huaian wheat opened at 6 yuan, 3 jiao, 2 fen, then to 1 jiao, 3 fen. Tiantai wheat opened at 6 yuan, 2 jiao, Jiangbei wheat opened at 6 yuan, 1 jiao, 8 fen, then to 2 jiao, 2 fen, Guantian wheat opened at 6 yuan, 2 jiao, 5 fen, Shaoxing wheat opened at 6 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen, then 6 yuan. Shen Da sold 3,000 bags and Fuxin sold 4-5,000 bags.

### Ke Xian Rice Sells Especially Well in Guangdong

Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian rice continued to be strong. Ke Hua rice was especially active, with Guangdong gangs inquiring about various milled rice types. The Xi'an gang only took 200 bags of milled rice. However, Shantou and this street turned greedy, and mid-grade rice types were digested even better. The total number of transactions increased to 27,000-8,000 bags again. The Guangdong gang took more than half, and the rest was distributed by this street and Shantou. The price of mid-grade rice was raised by one dime, and high-grade prices were all increased by five cents. If sales become stronger again, there is still a need to raise market prices. Furthermore, the cold and rainy weather is making people more optimistic. The total amount of Jiangxi rice sold was over 17,000 bags, Xiang rice 400 bags, Han milled rice 6,000 bags, Shashi milled rice 3,000 bags, and Wenshao machine-milled rice 1,000 bags.

### River Rice Has Little Arrival or Sales Due to Rain

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs only arrived on the 15th and 16th, about 3,200-300 stones of goods. Transactions were not strong due to the rain, and few goods were traded. The Xi'an and Qingdao gangs only processed about 1,000 bags of thin rice. Therefore, although the arrival of goods was scarce, the market remained stable. Prices for thick and thin japonica rice were neither elevated nor depressed. Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan were also flat.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few sources from various roads under the river due to the incessant rain, and the number of stores listing on the market was small, resulting in flat transactions. The market price for white japonica rice tightened by several cents to one dime, and thin rice tightened by several cents. Sheep Du Bu customers also added five or six cents. 100 yuan was quite elevated and all other loans were tightened.

### Soybean Oilcake Trends Are Not Good

Yesterday, the standard oilcake price of oil soybean cake was the same and flat. However, the Dalian telegram still showed a trend of progressively stepping up. Sales in Shanghai were sluggish and factory clients were competing to sell, and the oilcake market was in a stationary situation. The standard oil was unchanged in near months, slightly high by 5 fen for distant-month ticketed cake. Although it was pushed down by the influx of various spot supplies, there was still some sales yesterday and the market was close and firm. The soybean truck plants had relaxed stomachs and supplies were arriving non-stop. The standard bean price for this month has fallen by 6 yuan, which is 2 fen lower than the previous market. Distant terms were pulled by the Dalian telegram and bought slightly, and the closing price was up 2 fen.

Following the arrival of Kodama Kenji, President of the Japan-China Trade Association, and others in China, they attended the first member's meeting of the China-Japan Trade Association the day before yesterday, where they passed resolutions to complete the association's organization. Yesterday morning, they continued to hold a discussion meeting to discuss concrete measures. At noon and in the evening, they attended banquets hosted by Mayor Wu and the Shipping Industry Association, among others. Today, they will again be entertained by the Diplomatic Affairs Office and the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and will host a return banquet in the evening. Starting today, they will freely visit various parties, with some traveling to different regions and others returning home at a set date. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below:

Further Discussion

Following the conclusion of the first member's meeting of the China-Japan Trade Association, preparations are underway to actively implement the organizational matters passed at the meeting. Yesterday morning, Chairman Zhou Zuomin of the association specially invited Vice Chairman Xu Xinliu, and directors of the China-Japan boards Li Fusun, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Hongsheng, Yu Zuoting, Yu Qiaqing, Rong Zongjing, Du Yuesheng, Wu Yunzhai, Lin Kanghou, Zhong Bingfeng, Funatsu, Yoshida, Bube, Yamamoto, and others, to visit Kodama and others at the International Hotel around 10:00 AM. They continued the discussion meeting, exchanging opinions and discussing matters related to completing the organization, appointing Zhou Zuomin and Kodama to be responsible for the implementation. They dispersed at noon. It is heard that Kodama will remain for several days after the formal reception arrangements on our side are completed in order to discuss concrete measures for matters such as the organization of the investigation department.

Mayor's Banquet

Yesterday at noon, Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at the restaurant on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. The main guests were Kodama Kenji and others. Our side's accompanying guests included Xu Shiying, Yang Xiaotian, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Xinliu, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Kemin, Song Hanzhang, Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Wu Yunqi, Bei Songsun, Li Zeyi, Yu Zuoting, Tang Shoumin, Chen Jian'an, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, Rong Zongjing, Tong Xingbai, Guo Shun, Hu Zhengzhi, Dong Xianguang, Cui Weiwu, Feng Youzhen, Hu Pu'an. The Japanese accompanying guests included Consul General Kawasai, Secretary Tajiri, Commander Kan Nōmori, Yoshida Seiji, Funatsu Tatsichiro, Bube Takué, Yamamoto Takeo, Yabuki Keiichi, Hattori Daisan, Nakayama Kiichi, Do I, Hayashi Yūkich, Kawaguchi Ken'ichi, Matsumoto Shigeji, Fukamachi Sakuji, as well as the host Mayor Wu, Secretary General Yu, Director Pan, Wang Changchun, Li Dachao, Tang Shixuan, and more than ninety others. Chinese food was served, with a band providing accompaniment.

Mayor's Speech

During the meal, Mayor Wu stood up and delivered a speech, saying, "This time, the China-Japan Trade Association is holding a member's meeting in Shanghai, and your Excellency and distinguished guests have graced us with your presence. I am honored to have this opportunity to host you all and do my best as the host. Since your arrival in Beijing and Shanghai, you have received a warm welcome from all sectors of our country and have attended countless banquets and listened to countless speeches. If there is a banquet without a speech, it will surely be more appreciated by you and all the accompanying guests, and the atmosphere during the meal will be even more different. Therefore, this afternoon, I will only say a few brief words to express the welcome of this city to you all. Though the words are short, the sentiment is long, and I hope it will be acceptable to you all. The purpose of your visit to China this time is to attend the China-Japan Trade Association meeting, but its significance is profound. It is no less than a friendly mission from Japan. Our country's reception of you is also in the spirit of friendship. Your Excellency came in the spirit of friendship and good neighborliness, and our country's reception of you is also in the spirit of friendship and good neighborliness. If Sino-Japanese relations can be built on this foundation of friendship and good neighborliness, we believe that Sino-Japanese relations will become increasingly friendly and consolidated. This requires the greater efforts of people of insight in both China and Japan to realize it. Finally, among you, some have come to China more than once, and some have resided in Shanghai, China, for more than ten years. This time, revisiting old places and reconnecting with old friends will surely be a most pleasant thing in life. I only wish you all to have the joy of being at home away from home and wish you good health."

Kodama's Reply

Kodama replied, "I am deeply grateful for Mayor Wu's banquet today. I was also deeply moved to hear Mayor Wu explain the purpose of our group's visit to your country in his speech. Before the banquet began, I had a long conversation with Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu's concise words were very forthright, and I need not add more. Recalling this spring in Tokyo, I sat with Ambassador Xu, and Ambassador Xu recorded Lu Fangweng's poem, 'When peace prevails, everyone is drunk; Nature is impartial, and spring is everywhere.' Today's banquet has the meaning of this poem. I would like to read this sentence to express my intentions and borrow the host's wine to wish you all good health."

Shipping Industry Tea Party

In the afternoon, the local Shipping Industry Association held a tea party at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road to welcome them. The venue was decorated very elaborately, with many flags and emblems of China and Japan hanging on the four walls. At one end of the hall, a long table was placed in a T-shape for the main guests and important accompanying guests, with several square tables scattered below for the accompanying guests from both countries. Around 3:00 PM, the guests arrived, including the main guests Kodama Kenji and others, totaling twenty people, and accompanying guests from both China and Japan, including Zhou Zuomin and others, totaling more than seventy people. They were received by members of the association, including Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lüdeng, Shen Zhongyi, Feng Youxin, Lin Xisheng, Fang Jiaobo, Du Yuesheng, Jiang Zigang, Li Zhiyi, Yu Shunmao, Wu Delin, Cai Zengji, Mao Heyuan, Lao Mian, Yang Guanbei, Lu Yingen, and others.

Yu's Speech

During the tea party, Chairman Yu Qiaqing of the association stood up and delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Today, despite your busy travels, you have taken the time to grace our association with your presence, for which we are deeply honored. The gentlemen who have come to China this time are all first-class figures in the business community of your country. At this time when relations between the two countries are gradually becoming friendly, your visit will undoubtedly benefit the future of both countries in no small way. Therefore, people from all sectors of our country have extended a warm welcome and hold great hopes for the gentlemen from your country. Due to your hurried travel arrangements, we can only spare a little of your precious time and offer some refreshments to express our intentions. I was one of the earliest to engage in trade with Japan and believe that the development of trade between the two countries depends on the harmony of international policies. In recent years, there have often been rifts between Japan and China, which is undeniable. The cause of this stems from the Twenty-One Demands of the Yuan government in 1915, and its impact on the Chinese people is extremely broad. In 1923, when a major earthquake occurred in your country, I happened to be the chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and, in accordance with the government's policy of disaster relief and good neighborliness, requested the cancellation of the ban on the export of rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in our country to provide assistance. At the same time, I persuaded the people not to harbor any resentment, which is well known to all those present. In 1926, the Shanghai business community organized a delegation to visit your country, and we were treated with sincerity and courtesy by all sectors of your country. After returning to China, I screened the films I had taken in various places, which fully demonstrated the harmony between the business communities and people of the two countries. The people's negative images have gradually begun to change, but after the September 18th Incident, followed by the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the people's feelings were too deep. Although our government authorities sincerely took good neighborliness as a prerequisite and prevented the people from taking any actions outside the bounds of propriety, the people's psychology has not forgotten. From this, it can be seen that the economic cooperation between China and Japan depends on the harmony of international policies, without a doubt. China and Japan are brotherly countries, with historical and geographical foundations to rely on. Coexistence and co-prosperity are timeless theories. There is an ancient Chinese proverb that says, 'If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.' Therefore, there can be no discord between the two countries. Our country has always taken morality and etiquette as the basis for dealing with the world, and your country is the same. Therefore, I believe that seeking harmony between the two countries is not difficult. I also remember that Viscount Shibusawa, a senior member of the business community in your country, and I had several meetings. Before his death, he sent me a specially printed copy of the Analects as a souvenir, which I have never forgotten. Today, you are all important figures in the business community of your country. At a time when economic cooperation between the two sides is rampant, your visit is timely. How can we turn the relationship between the two countries onto the right path of economic cooperation and make the future of both countries brighter? This must be hoped for in your efforts after returning to your country. Furthermore, the shipping industry is the mother of all industries, especially for trade between the two countries, which relies on the shipping industry as a transit point. Your country's shipping industry has been flourishing for forty years since the Meiji Restoration, which is admirable. Our country's shipping industry also has a long history, but it is still in its infancy, which is deeply regrettable. I hope you will give us some guidance. Today's refreshments are crude, and my words are also straightforward, for which I am very sorry. I also ask for your forgiveness."

Kodama's Reply

Kodama Kenji then stood up and gave a speech of thanks, saying, "Today, the shipping industry of your country is hosting us. Originally, Mr. Horishin should have given the reply, but since I am in the position of the main guest, I would like to give the speech of thanks on behalf of everyone. We are very surprised to have received such a warm welcome from all sectors of your country. Today, we are being hosted by the shipping industry, and we are grateful for Mr. Yu Qiaqing's speech, which is for our reference. Mr. Yu is a senior member of the Chinese business community, and his words about the past history of China and Japan have evoked good feelings in me that cannot be expressed in words. Mr. Yu mentioned that there were previously bad atmospheres between the two countries, but when faced with great misfortune, the previous mistakes were forgiven and mutual assistance was provided. This is indeed a good phenomenon. China and Japan are brotherly countries. It is common for brothers to fight each other. For example, when I was young, I often quarreled with my older brother, but I forgot about it after it was over. After growing up, I also knew how to love each other. Since the two countries can forget the past mistakes in times of trouble, it is indeed a good phenomenon. However, individuals and countries are different and cannot be allowed to develop automatically. Mr. Yu will surely be able to lead the people of your country to work hard to harmonize the feelings between the two countries. We are grateful for the hospitality today. I would like to thank you on behalf of everyone." The tea party dispersed at 5:00 PM.

Japanese Consul General's Banquet

At 7:00 PM, the Japanese Consul General in China, Kawasai Tatsuo, hosted a banquet at the French Chamber of Commerce on Meiershire Road. In addition to Kodama Kenji and others, the guests included Hasegawa, Commander of the Japanese military, Sugiyama, Chief of Staff, Major General Honda, Commander Kan Nōmori, and our Ambassador Xu, Mayor Wu, Commander Yang, Zhou Jue, and important figures in the business community of China and Japan, totaling more than seventy people. They were hosted by Consul General Kawasai, Secretary Tajiri, and Consul Kawasaki Fuku. They dispersed late at night after enjoying themselves.

Today's Social Events

Kodama and others will visit various friends this morning. At noon, they will attend a banquet at the Central Bank Club hosted by the Central, China, and Communications Banks. President Kong Xiangxi of the Central Bank has specially come to Shanghai from Beijing to preside over the event. At 3:00 PM, Zhou Jue, Director of the Diplomatic Affairs Office, will hold a tea party to host them. In the evening, Kodama and others will host a return banquet for various sectors of China and Japan in Shanghai at the Six Three Garden. The Shanghai reception arrangements will end there. It is heard that Mr. Kodama will remain in Shanghai for several days.

### Cotton Mill Business is Booming

This Year's Production Will Increase

According to the New News Agency, since the autumn of last year, the rural economy has improved slightly, and the domestic sales of domestically produced cotton yarn have suddenly increased, and the market is in a state of short supply. Therefore, the price of yarn has gradually risen, and the market price per bale has exceeded 240 yuan, which is nearly 60 yuan higher than the lowest price. Recently, although the demand from Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other provinces has decreased slightly, Sichuan cotton cloth merchants have been purchasing very actively, so the market is still active.

Increase in Spindles in Cotton Mills

Various cotton mills in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, in view of the increased demand, have successively added spindles in recent months to increase production. Cotton mills in various counties scattered throughout Jiangsu Province are also vying to add spindles. Therefore, in terms of Chinese-owned cotton mills, the number of spindles added is not small. Therefore, the yarn production this year will definitely increase compared to last year. If the yarn sales situation can be maintained for a long time, production and sales can be balanced.

Slight Increase in Stored Yarn

The stored yarn in this city has been very weak in recent months. The month with the least amount of stored yarn was less than 20,000 bales. However, the amount of stored yarn increased due to the lunar New Year period last month. According to statistics, the stored yarn of Japanese mills was 4,267 bales, and the stored yarn of Chinese mills was 47,301 bales, totaling 51,568 bales, an increase of 2,504 bales in Japanese mills and 20,865 bales in Chinese mills, totaling 23,369 bales, compared to 28,199 bales at the end of January, an increase of about double the previous month.

### Overseas Chinese Compatriot Wang Jingshan Deported from Japan

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Wang Jingshan, Chairman of the Kyushu Overseas Chinese Association in Japan and Executive Committee Member of the Nagasaki Direct Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, was hired as a Chinese language teacher at the Nagasaki Commercial School. However, he was deported for participating in patriotic movements and opposing the Japanese mistreatment of overseas Chinese. He arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Wang yesterday afternoon, and he recounted the details of his deportation. The details are as follows:

Jealousy of the Japanese

Mr. Wang is forty-two years old and hails from Daxing County, Hebei Province. He graduated from the Hiroshima Higher Normal School in Japan. After returning to China, he served as the Director of Studies for the former Governor of Jingzhao and as the Administrative Inspector of Jingzhao. Later, he went to Japan to work in the education sector. He was enthusiastic about overseas Chinese affairs. In May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), when a Japanese person killed the overseas Chinese student Ye Muhua, Mr. Wang presided over the negotiations and planned to erect a monument for Ye Muhua. Although the matter was not completed, it had already aroused the jealousy of the Japanese. The monument is still stored in the storage room of the Nagasaki Shichu Middle School. In June of last year, Mr. Wang presided over the affairs of the Kyushu Overseas Chinese Association in Japan and, along with his comrades, published a semi-monthly publication called "Important National Affairs News" to communicate domestic news and promote party ideology and the New Life Movement. He and four others were arrested by the Japanese and sentenced to one day of imprisonment and a fine of thirty yuan. Later, publication was prohibited. Last year, Mr. Wang was also deemed to be engaging in political activities for participating in the National Assembly elections and was forced to resign and deported.

Japanese Anti-Chinese Sentiment

According to Mr. Wang, in the spring of last year, the Japanese believed that the content of the textbooks used by overseas Chinese students contained anti-Japanese sentiment and confiscated all of them, leaving overseas Chinese schools without books to read. The teachers of the overseas Chinese schools had no choice but to transcribe and print the books themselves while submitting a request to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for instructions. Subsequently, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in order to compromise and seek peace, compiled a set of textbooks specifically for use in Japanese and Korean overseas Chinese schools. However, as soon as the elementary Chinese language books were published, the Japanese claimed that the content of the seventh and eighth volumes still contained anti-Japanese sentiment and confiscated those two volumes as well. In reality, the content of the two volumes did not contain any such meaning. The oppression was severe. Furthermore, the Japanese imposed strict restrictions on overseas Chinese who changed occupations or moved to different locations. For example, if they worked in location A, they were not allowed to move to location B, and if they worked in store A, they were not allowed to move to store B. Those who violated these rules were oppressed and deported. Although overseas Chinese residents had asked the consulate to negotiate with the Japanese, it was to no avail. In short, it is clear and undeniable that the Japanese have an organized and planned way of excluding our overseas Chinese compatriots.

### Book Industry Association Notifies Member Bookstores

In Case of Doubtful Manuscripts, They Must First Be Submitted to the Ministry for Review

The Shanghai Book Industry Association issued a notice (No. 278) stating that on the 16th of this month, the Social Bureau convened a meeting with the managers of various bookstores in the city. Director Pan instructed that recently, various bookstores have published literary and social science books, some of which contain reactionary content. Because they were not submitted to the Central Government for review beforehand, the party and government organs discovered them afterwards, resulting in penalties such as a ban on distribution and causing significant losses. In the future, before publishing any books, each bookstore should carefully review them on its own. In case of doubtful manuscripts, they should first be submitted to the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing for review. After the Propaganda Department approves the publication, they can be printed to avoid losses.

### Special Cash Guarantee Method Implemented by Guangdong Provincial Bank

Officially Announced and Implemented on the 15th

According to the Central News Agency, the China Personnel Management Association believes that the abolition of the current bank guarantee system and the proposed special cash guarantee method are greatly related to the improvement of personnel management and have been extensively studied. It believes that the only way to protect the bank's own interests and alleviate the difficulty of employees finding guarantors is to implement this new system. According to the person in charge of the association, the Guangdong Provincial Bank has already announced the implementation of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" on the 15th of this month and has set four implementation steps: ㊀ The Personnel Section of the head office is responsible for handling the matter. ㊁ The amount of the guarantee to be paid by each person is tentatively set at three months' salary. ㊂ All employees of the bank should first pay one and a half months' salary before the end of March, and the remaining amount will be paid on a designated date. ㊃ Detailed methods will be announced later. Other banks are also considering adopting it.

### Assistant of Hebei Provincial Bank Embezzles Huge Sums and Flees to Shanghai

Transfers through Zhengzhou and Flies to Shanghai Under an Assumed Name on a Eurasia Flight; Initially Stays at the International Hotel, Then Moves to the Yangtze Hotel, and Later Rents a House; Deposits More Than 30,000 Gold Yuan Embezzled in Shanghai Banks

Fan Shaochang, 26 years old, from Fengtian, was an assistant at the Gaoyi County branch of the Hebei Provincial Bank. Because he had been using more than 1,000 yuan of public funds for personal use and was unable to make up the difference, he embezzled 33,000 yuan of bank funds on the 12th of last month and fled with his wife, Xu Lanying, 22 years old, from Fengtian. After the provincial bank reported the incident to the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau, detectives Zhang Ming, Chen Shulin, and Zhen Kui learned that Fan had taken a train to Shijiazhuang after embezzling the funds.

Transfers Through Zhengzhou

On the 19th, he used the assumed name Fan Dangping to fly to Shanghai on a Eurasia flight. The two detectives then traveled to Shanghai and requested assistance from the Chief Inspector's Office of the General Patrol Room. Hua Detective Feng Zhiming and Detective Yan Kuang began investigating, determining that Fan must be staying in a hotel after arriving in Shanghai. They investigated each hotel daily, but to no avail. Until the morning before, while investigating on Jing'an Temple Road at the

International Hotel

, they discovered that a person named Fan Dangping had resided in rooms 513 and 514 of the hotel from February 14th to 16th and then moved out. The detectives determined that Fan must have moved to another hotel, so they intensified their investigation. At 12:45 PM, while investigating at the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road, Fan came to rent room 601 under the name Fan Dangping. He was immediately

arrested by the detectives

and taken back to the Patrol Room. Under questioning, Fan confessed that after residing at the International Hotel, he found the daily room rate of over 20 yuan to be unsustainable in the long run. Therefore, on the 16th, he changed to room 601 at the Yangtze Hotel. After staying there for three days, he found a room at 36 Lane 301, Weihaiwei Road, and immediately moved in, equipping it with all the necessary furniture. The detectives then went to his residence and arrested Xu Lanying, seizing a savings passbook for 10,000 yuan from

the Four Lines Savings Society

(name of the account: Ji Shan Tang), a savings passbook for 3,500 yuan from the Shanghai Bank (name of the account: Shan Ji), a savings passbook for 11,800 yuan from the Bank of Communications (name of the account: Ji Ji), a savings passbook for 4,500 yuan from the Bank of China (name of the account: Ji Shan Tang), all deposited on February 16th, 120 yuan in cash, five gold rings, and five pairs of gold bracelets. All were

taken back to the Patrol Room

Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Patrol Room lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the situation, stating that the official request from the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau for the transfer of custody had not yet been prepared. Therefore, he requested permission for detention and a later review, and that the furniture in Fan's home was inconvenient for the Patrol Room to store, requesting that it be disposed of first. When questioned, Fan confessed to the fact of embezzling public funds, stating that the furniture was purchased with the embezzled funds, but the clothes and gold jewelry were his own. After Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession, he ordered that the case be reviewed again at a later date, and that the seized furniture be disposed of appropriately by the Patrol Room and the proceeds be handed over to the case.

### Gu Bingzhang Assaults His Wife After Taking a Concubine

Wife's Injuries Verified; Police File Public Prosecution

Gu Bingzhang, a local Shanghai resident and owner of the Gu Chun Ji Leather Shoe Store at 320 Hubei Road, married Ms. Song nine years ago. Three years prior, Gu took Ren Xingqing as a concubine, causing a rift in the marriage and frequent disputes. Recently, Ms. Song suddenly accused her husband, Gu Bingzhang, at the Lao Zha police station of assault. She claimed that she had been assaulted by her husband before, leading to a fine of 100 yuan. Now, her husband has again

committed violence without cause,

requesting legal action. The police sent her to the hospital, where examinations confirmed injuries to her chest and waist. Consequently, they filed a lawsuit according to the law. Yesterday morning, detectives summoned Gu Bingzhang to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, filed a public prosecution for the crime of injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, presenting the case details. Ms. Song stated that she had been married to the defendant for nine years. On the 13th of this month, at 9 a.m., she went to her mother-in-law's in the countryside and stayed overnight at her parents' home. Upon returning home the following evening, the defendant accused her of immoral conduct and having an affair,

with a fierce demeanor,

attacking her with fists and feet. He then pressed her throat, while his concubine, Xingqing, punched her chest, pushing her down the stairs. Fortunately, the old steward intervened, otherwise, her life would have been in danger. She requested a thorough investigation. The defendant, Gu Bingzhang, testified that since he took a concubine, the plaintiff had considered her a thorn in her side, constantly provoking and making trouble. He felt intimidated and made concessions to maintain peace, hoping to quiet the household. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 11th of this month, the plaintiff and the concubine, Xingqing, had another major quarrel. On the 13th, the plaintiff angrily went to his mother's in the countryside,

making demands,

insisting that he apologize and beat the concubine. Otherwise, she would invite thugs to fight, and he could not stop her. If he did not agree, she threatened to slander him in the future. On the night of the 14th, when the plaintiff returned, he was already asleep. She suddenly woke him up, pulled him out of bed, accusing him of being too carefree and demanding he give her face. He considered the plaintiff unreasonable and wanted to drag her to the police station. The old steward

and others

dissuaded them. He denied assaulting her this time, claiming that the store's bookkeepers could testify. If anyone could prove he committed violence, he would accept legal punishment. He also hired lawyer Yan Yinwu to defend him in court. Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the testimonies and adjourned the hearing to Wednesday morning next week, pending further witness summons.

### Kidnappers Sentenced

Yang Rongfang, a native of Wuxi and owner of the Dachang Porcelain Shop at 130 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, had his six-year-old son, Yang Huiqi, kidnapped on the morning of January 27th. The boy was playing at the entrance of the lane when he was abducted by the hired rickshaw puller, Cai Fuxing, in collusion with a gang. They demanded a ransom of 3,000 yuan. Zhang Yunqing, a tailor, learned of the inside story and impersonated the kidnappers, sending a letter to Yang demanding 1,000 yuan, arranging a meeting at the Zhongnan Hotel to exchange the ransom. Yang reported this to the French police, who arrested the kidnappers Cai Fuxing, Wu Jinshu, Shi Dehong, Zhang Yunqing, and suspect Chen Shouming, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. After investigation, the kidnappers, seeing their leader arrested, sent the hostage back home safe. The French police investigated and publicly prosecuted Cai, Wu, and Shi for extortion, and Zhang Yunqing for extortion by intimidation. Chen Shouming was found to have no involvement and was released. Judge Chen Shuoying opened court to examine the case, the final hearing of which had been previously reported. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. Around 10 a.m., Judge Chen presided over the First Criminal Division, ordering the defendants to be brought in. After briefly questioning them, he sentenced Cai Fuxing to six years and two months imprisonment, Wu Jinshu to four years imprisonment, Zhang Yunqing to four months for attempted extortion, and Shi Dehong was acquitted. It is known that the defendants will be held in the detention center during the appeal period.

### The Depraved Doctor and His Miserable Wife

Having squandered everything, with no clothes or food, she insists on divorce; the judge urges temporary separation to avoid a complete break

Gu Zi'an, a Shanghai native, came from a moderately well-off family in his youth. His father had three sons, he being the eldest. After dropping out of school, he studied traditional Chinese medicine. After mastering the art, his father passed away. His mother arranged a marriage for him. His wife, Li Xiuzhen, is from Yuyao, Zhejiang. Both are twenty-six years old. Since marriage, they have had two daughters, six and four years old. Gu's mother, seeing that her son could support himself, separated from them, living with her other two sons on Avenue Edward VII, allowing Gu to merely

provide for them

without the burden of supporting them. Unexpectedly, Zi'an became depraved. Initially, he smoked opium, then also became addicted to heroin. Day and night, he indulged in these habits, harming his body. As a doctor in Shanghai, he was largely unknown. As a result, his practice was deserted. Not only could he not afford his opium and heroin, but he also struggled to make ends meet. He pawned his wife's clothing to survive. After selling all her dowry items, he sold the furniture to get by. When Ms. Li

gently advised him,

he not only failed to repent but instead became angry and beat her. One day last autumn, the family was destitute. Zi'an, seeing that Li only had a set of xiangyun gauze shirt and pants to wear, insisted on taking them to Changsheng Pawnshop to satisfy his cravings. She naturally resisted and was struck with a stool. How could she rely on such a husband? She abandoned her two daughters and ran back to her mother's home in Sanzhu Lane, Wenzhou Road, to live with her mother. Zi'an, later, because

the two children missed their mother,

and he was unable to raise them, sent the children there as well. He canceled the lease on the house, completely unburdening himself and beginning his solitary life. However, Li's mother's family was very poor, and she had no brothers. Her widowed mother had to care for her in-laws and had no resources to support her married daughter. Xiuzhen wanted to work in a factory but was hindered by her two children. After much thought, she decided to divorce her husband, hoping to relieve her suffering, and filed a

divorce lawsuit

with the First Special District Court. The initial trial ruled that the accusations did not meet the conditions for divorce and dismissed her lawsuit. Xiuzhen, unwilling to accept this, appealed to the First Branch of the Higher Court. Yesterday afternoon, Head Judge Han Zuzhi convened a collegial panel to hear the case. Gu Zi'an looked quite robust, with shiny hair and clean clothes, showing no signs of the typical "smoky face" or "sordid appearance" of an addict. His wife, Li Xiuzhen, on the other hand, was

dressed plainly.

The judge first asked Li the reasons for requesting a divorce. She described in detail Gu's addiction to opium, his failure to work, and his constant pawning, her voice breaking with tears. Then, the judge questioned Gu Zi'an, who firmly stated that he did not want a divorce. The judge then asked Li how she would live after the divorce. She stated that if the divorce was granted and Gu took the children, she could support herself by working. Otherwise, Gu had to

quit opium for good,

stop abusing her, and provide alimony for her to continue living with him. Judge Han carefully considered the current circumstances of both parties and Li's hopes for Gu's family (Gu currently lives with his mother and younger brothers) and decided on a reconciliation plan: Li would temporarily live with her mother, the two children would remain in her care, and Gu Zi'an would send twenty yuan on the 15th of each month as

alimony for the three of them.

In the future, Gu would find a job and, with a fixed monthly income, welcome his wife and children back to reunite the family. Both parties agreed to these terms, and Secretary Li recorded the reconciliation agreement, which they signed in court, ending the proceedings. Although the two lovebirds are temporarily separated, the breaking of the wagon wheel spoke can be avoided.

### Jiangsu Bank Robbery: Police Request Death Penalty

Planned Murder Before Robbery; Heinous Acts Leave No Room for Leniency

The robbers Chen Changfu, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Youren, Bai Fugui, Qian Arong, Bao Heming, Shi Amao, He Renlin, Yang Yushu, and others, on the afternoon of February 3rd, stole a Yunfei automobile, number 12314, and drove to the entrance of the Jiangsu Bank branch on Xin Zha Road, intending to rob the bank of over 7,000 yuan being transported to the head office. The robbers opened fire, killing officer Shi Jinzhi and injuring bodyguards Gu Wenlin and Jiang Ziqin, as well as rickshaw puller Chen Youru. Afterwards,

the Lao Zha Police Station

Chief Detective You A'gen, Detectives Wang Shanqing, Ye Yuming, Zhu Shangwu, and others arrested the suspects, seizing many weapons. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the Criminal Division to continue the trial and immediately ordered the start of arguments. Police representative Ru Bao'yi argued that although this was an ordinary

robbery and murder

case, its actual circumstances differed from typical robbery and murder cases. Ordinary robbery murders occur when the victim resists or when someone chases the robbers. However, the murders in this case were premeditated. The aim was to kill first and then rob. Therefore, when the employees of the Jiangsu Bank left the store, the robbers had not even been seen, yet gunshots were already heard, and officer Shi Jinzhi had already

been fatally shot.

The officer was unaware that a robbery was about to occur, so he did not pay attention and was shot by the defendants. Expert analysis confirmed that Shi Jinzhi was killed by a gun held by Zhao Jinrong, Jiang Ziqin and Chen Youru were injured by a gun held by Zhang Shaoqing, and Gu Wenlin was injured by a gun held by Bai Fugui. Therefore, the murders committed by the defendants were intentional and a necessary part of their plan. Thus,

their acts were heinous,

leaving no room for leniency. He requested that Chen Changfu, Zhao Youren, Zhao Jinrong, Bai Fugui, and Zhang Shaoqing be sentenced to death, and the remaining defendants be punished according to the law. Lawyers Fan Gang, Ma Leming, and Wu Baotai, appointed by and for the defendants, argued in turn. Judge Feng then announced the end of the arguments and set the date for sentencing to Thursday afternoon next week.

### Xu Yongshou, Driven by Lust, Rapes Nine-Year-Old Girl

Accused Claims It Was The First Time; Victim Says Three or Four Times

Xing Zhigang, 43 years old, owner of the Maoshengchang Clock Shop at 148 Sanguantang, Tangqiao, Pudong, native of Nanjing, has a daughter named Meimei, who is nine years old. She is clever and lively, deeply loved by her father. However, her mother has died, and Xing remarried. She lives with her stepmother, who does not care for her. Xu Yongshou, an apprentice at Xing's shop, 18 years old, native of Zhenjiang, driven by lust, lured Meimei upstairs and raped her. While he was raping her, Xing went upstairs and caught him. Furious, he immediately reported it to the Sanguantang police station, who took them to the Tangqiao police station. Chief Ju interrogated them. Xu Yongshou confessed that this was the first time, but Meimei said that she had been raped three or four times since last winter. Because it concerned the rape of a young girl, the case was submitted to the Municipal Police Department for investigation.

Present were Lin Kecong, Lu Lihua, Yan Zhenyu, Yang Dexin, Zhang Xiangwen, Jiang Yixiao, Chen Guiru, Cai Jinying (representing Lin), Shen Ziju, Yu Feng, Zhao Longlan, and over twenty others.

### Dredging Bureau Replies to Shipping Industry, Promising to Dredge Huangpu River

Hopes Police Will Remove Obstructions

Xing Zhigang, a representative of the shipping industry in Pudong West, found that the Huangpu River area from Dongjiadu Wharf south to Nanma Wharf was full of obstructions, making the river prone to silting and hindering traffic. He wrote to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau requesting continued dredging. The bureau replied yesterday, stating that they had received his letter of the 13th, noting that the area south of the Nan Huiguan Wharf was obstructed, hindering traffic, and requesting removal of obstructions and dredging to facilitate navigation. The bureau is currently dredging the Huangpu River area near the Shanghai South City Wharf. After this project is completed, they will conduct some dredging upstream from the Nan Huiguan Wharf. Regarding the removal of obstructions, it seems appropriate for your office to directly urge the Municipal Police Department to pay attention and strictly adhere to the management regulations.

### Debt Arising From Cohabitation Due to Coercion and Threats

Involving Two Lawyers: Jia Yi and Ding Xudong

Lawyer Jia Yi, also known as Yunbiao, has his office at Room 507, Taihe Building, Lloyd Road, and his residence at No. 121, Lane 1491, Xin Zha Road. He is being sued in the local court by Zhang Suzhen, a 24-year-old woman from Wuxi, residing at No. 340, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, for a cohabitation relationship and a settlement agreement. The agreement, dated December 30th of last year, involved payments in two installments: 100 yuan on February 5th and 170 yuan on January 9th. As the payments are overdue, she requests the court to order payment. Judge Wang Kequan opened the court yesterday. Jia Yi claimed that the trial should be suspended because the so-called settlement agreement was obtained through coercion and threats. He claimed that they used a honey trap at a small hotel in Southeast, writing up the agreement and forcing him to sign it. He is currently suing Ding Xudong (also a lawyer) and two others at the prosecutor's office. The court adjourned to review the prosecutor's files before continuing the hearing.

### Dispute Between Northern Performer and Suzhou Dancer

Dancer Crushes Li's Finger, Accusing Him of Assault; Language Barrier Leads to Shouting Match on Balcony

Mao Fanhua, a 19-year-old Suzhou woman with a beautiful and charming appearance, residing in the upstairs unit at No. 54, Hengmao Lane, Baixianqiao, French Concession, works as a dancer at ABC Dance Hall and currently dances at the Far East Ballroom in the Far East Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. Living in the adjacent unit at No. 55 is Song Xiaofang, a 30-year-old man from Tianjin who performs in local opera, working with

Zhu Baoxia

and Zhu Zixia in performances at the Great World entertainment complex. On the 15th of this month, Song's landlord, Xin Jitang, had a quarrel on the balcony with his neighbor, the dancer Mao Fanhua, over a minor matter. Song heard the noise and went to the balcony to assist. Xin verbally abused Mao. One party was from Suzhou, the other from the North. Due to their different accents and language barriers, Mao became enraged and grabbed Song's clothes to argue. Song then slammed the small balcony door shut, attempting to escape. Mao rushed forward in anger, causing her left hand

three fingers

to be crushed in the door, fracturing the bones and tearing the skin. She cried out in pain, bleeding profusely. Her family rushed over, sent Mao to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and reported the incident to the French police, who arrested Song and sent him to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the continued trial in the Eighth Criminal Division. The police prosecutor charged him with assault, presenting the details of the case. The plaintiff, Mao Fanhua,

submitted a private lawsuit, seeking compensation for losses. After describing the incident, she stated that she earns ten yuan dancing at the Far East every night, netting five yuan. She would have to stay in the hospital for one and a half months, incurring a loss of 125 yuan, plus 15 yuan for mental distress, requesting the defendant to compensate her for 250 yuan. The defendant's testimony was vague and evasive. The court reviewed the testimonies, ordered closing arguments, and immediately sentenced Song Xiaofang to a fine of twenty yuan. The related civil suit was transferred to the Civil Division for trial.

### Sibling Lawsuit Over Property Division

Weng Xiaofeng Entitled to His Late Father's Estate; Brother Weng Zuoyu Refuses to Divide It, Accused of Embezzlement

Weng Zuoyu, manager of Yuefeng Pawnshop at the intersection of North Henan Road and Lao Baga Road, Chaozhou native, has been accused of embezzlement in the First County Court by his younger brother, Weng Xiaofeng, represented by lawyer Chen Wen, and a related civil suit has been filed. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff and defendant are brothers, and their father passed away early, leaving all his estate in the defendant's hands. Over the years, the defendant has spent a considerable amount of it. Recently, the plaintiff came of age, and the defendant should

return the inheritance

he has been managing on his behalf. Despite repeated requests, the defendant has refused to divide it. In 1934, the defendant wrote a note handing over ancestral home and land to the plaintiff. The note did not specify its purpose, and all supporting documents are in the defendant's possession. The most important part of their father's estate is the Shanghai Xidang Pawnshop, of which the plaintiff and defendant are each entitled to half. However, the defendant has not transferred the plaintiff's share and is withholding

other deposits

of considerable value, all under the defendant's control. He refuses to return them, leaving the plaintiff to suffer. The brothers are like strangers. The defendant has violated Article 335 of the Criminal Code. The related civil suit requests the return of ancestral land and property, three shares of Yuefeng Pawnshop at 1,000 taels each, and deposits in Yuefeng, two shares of

Hua Yi Factory,

etc. That afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang presided over the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Division. The plaintiff stated the above circumstances. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff was an illegitimate child and not a sibling. All the land and property due to him had been divided and were under his control. The documents, however, were under the control of

the family accountant.

The Yuefeng Pawnshop's capital was not their father's inheritance but his own shares, and he had not embezzled anything. He hired lawyer Guo Qiming to defend him and filed a countersuit for false accusation. The court concluded the arguments and scheduled the verdict for Monday.

### Direct Highway Open Between Shanghai and Annam

The First Person is Pasquali

According to a French Shanghai newspaper translated by a foreign news agency, five years ago, Shanghai was merely an isolated island. Its transportation with the inland areas could be described as virtually nonexistent. The furthest point reachable by car from Shanghai was only Minhang Town. Now, one can travel directly from Shanghai, following the highway and taking a car to French Indochina. Recently, the Italian Consul in Hanoi, Pasquali, along with his wife, traveled 3,000 kilometers by road to Shanghai last Sunday (the 14th). The cities they passed through include Nanning, Guilin, Hengzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, and Hangzhou. Pasquali is the first person to travel directly between Shanghai and Indochina by road. It is noted that Consul Pasquali's long journey was not planned long in advance. When he departed from Hanoi, it was primarily exploratory. He was unaware whether there were highways outside Guangxi Province sufficient to reach other provinces. Mr. and Mrs. Pasquali traveled in a four-cylinder Walyer car, carrying two suitcases containing some kitchen utensils for preparing meals along the way. Both of them do not speak Chinese, nor do they understand English. It is noted that the Consul and his wife are well-known explorers. Last year, they went to the border of Tibet to see the waterfalls upstream of the Yangtze River, which took 45 days, mostly relying on sedan chairs and horses for transportation. This time, they traveled by car from Hanoi to Shanghai with the same spirit of exploration as in Tibet. No accidents occurred along the way, but one incident demonstrates Pasquali's perseverance. When the Consul and his wife arrived in Changsha, they encountered two roads ahead. Pasquali chose one at random. After traveling some distance, they encountered a broken bridge. So they turned back and took the other road, only to find it also blocked by a broken bridge. Others might have turned back to Hanoi, but Pasquali hired two sampans to park under the broken bridge to ferry his car across and took a picture of the broken bridge as a souvenir. Another incident occurred when Pasquali's Annamese chauffeur, wearing a military uniform, was mistaken by a local village militia for a spy and was about to be arrested. Fortunately, an explanation resolved the situation. These were the only incidents encountered by Mr. and Mrs. Pasquali on their journey. According to the Consul, the Chinese villagers treated travelers with extreme sincerity. Although Pasquali cooked his own meals for the first few days, he later found Chinese cuisine better than Western food, and he stayed overnight in small rural inns. According to Pasquali, the roads from Hanoi to Shanghai are generally very good, especially the roads in Guangxi and Hunan. In Guangxi Province, government-run hotels are available everywhere, with hot and cold water facilities and bathrooms, and the service personnel are very polite. Mr. and Mrs. Pasquali plan to return to their post in Hanoi via the highway, but this time they will take the route through Fujian and Guangdong provinces to see the customs and people of the two provinces. From this, it can be seen that Consul Pasquali is very grateful for this road trip from Indochina to Shanghai, hence the special attempt. According to Pasquali, he decided to take the Fujian-Guangdong highway to return to his post in order to visit Guangzhou Bay and Mangjie (transliteration) along the way, but he does not know if there are highways that can directly reach those places. The date of departure for Mr. and Mrs. Pasquali has not yet been determined. They are currently staying at the Italian Consulate in this city.

### Rayon Factory Hires German Technician

Products to Exceed Japanese Goods

The Ministry of Industry's rayon factory has a fixed capital of 4 million yuan, invested by the private sector, with the government in a supervisory role. As sericulture is a major sideline in rural China, excessive development of the rayon industry would directly and greatly impact the silk industry. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has set the investment amount for rayon at 10 million yuan. It is heard that rayon factories, silk farms, silk weaving factories and the financial sector are all willing to invest. Therefore, raising 4 million yuan in capital should not be a problem. The factory has decided to hire a famous German rayon expert as a technician, so that its exports can exceed Japanese goods. This is because the chemical procedures for rayon are very complex, and the manufacturing methods of various countries are kept secret. Although Japanese rayon is said to be developed, its quality is not as good as Italian, German or British goods. Furthermore, the fiber and other raw materials for our rayon are better than those of Britain, Germany, and other countries. Therefore, our country's rayon can counteract Japanese goods.

### Liu Ruiheng Visits Cancer Treatment Hospital

Dr. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Health Administration, visited the Sino-Belgian Radium Therapy Institute, a sister hospital of Yang Shupu Sacred Heart Hospital, last week. The hospital has newly installed two radium tubes and a new X-ray therapy machine with a power of 25,000 volts per tube, which is very effective. Director Liu personally inspected the machine. Dr. Jin Maishan, Deputy Director of the Health Experiment Office, and Dr. Van Slyke, advisor to the National Government, also visited the hospital. After their visit, they were deeply impressed by the organization of cancer prevention work in China and believed that the full development of the Sino-Belgian Radium Institute's functions could remedy this need. They also acknowledged that the Sino-Belgian Radium Institute is the only radium center in the Far East with a considerable amount of radium and the latest scientific treatment capabilities for alarming pain, with adequate X-ray equipment. The hospital's original research laboratory could not conduct research due to equipment limitations. The hospital is currently seeking to expand.

### Evergreen Broadleaf Trees Function as Fire Prevention

Planted at Zhenru Gansheng Farm, Best Material for Urban Residences

According to Shanghai News Agency, Zhenru Gansheng Farm was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China by Chen Gansheng, a pioneer in the horticultural world. It has a large area and many greenhouses. The reporter visited the farm the day before yesterday and saw pines and cypresses forming forests and all kinds of flowers scattered among them. All kinds of exotic flowers and rare trees were beautiful and breathtaking. The tropical plants and succulents cultivated in the greenhouses were especially valuable and rare. According to Mr. Chen, these plants come from Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Egypt, Mexico, the West Indies, and other places. Collecting so many varieties was quite a feat, and the cultivation methods are not something that non-experts can understand. There are also thousands of cedars and junipers, all growing vigorously and thriving. There are also many evergreen broadleaf trees with fire-prevention effects. It is said that this kind of tree is indispensable for urban residences. Mr. Chen is originally from Chongming. He graduated from the Chiba Horticultural College in Japan with a degree in horticulture. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he was elected as the Shanghai Farmers' Association representative to the National Assembly.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Junshan

(III) The Evolution of Modern Politics.

In this section, we will also explain it in three parts:

1. The Trends of Modern Political Evolution;

2. The Reasons for Modern Political Evolution;

3. The Results of Modern Political Evolution.

First, let's talk about the trends of modern political evolution.

As mentioned earlier, there are four major trends in modern politics: first, a shift from multi-party to one-party systems; second, a shift from decentralization to centralization; third, a shift from collegiality to dictatorship; and fourth, a shift from emphasis on the rule of law to emphasis on the rule of people. Now, let's talk about the first trend, which is more important than the others. Understanding this point will make it easier to understand the others.

You should know that in the past, almost all constitutional countries were multi-party political systems—whether constitutional monarchies or democracies. Pre-war Russia, pre-revolution Italy, Turkey, and pre-Hitler Germany were all multi-party political systems. Some Germans today don't even know how many political parties their country had in the past. It was truly complex and diverse. This proves the development of multi-party politics in the past. But now, many countries' political parties have declined, and this trend is clearly before our eyes. However, you may ask: why haven't the political parties in countries like England, Japan, France, and the United States declined, but instead shifted from multi-party to one-party systems? I will give you an answer to this question later.

Second, there is a shift from decentralization to centralization. This is not only the case in one-party political states; even countries like Japan, which have multi-party politics, are now moving towards centralized politics. The United States, a multi-party political country, is seeing a growing spirit of centralized politics. Even England, with its party politics, is experiencing new trends day by day; only France has not changed much. Why are all these countries in this state? This question will also be answered below. What should be noted here is that the trend from decentralized politics to centralized politics is more pronounced.

Third, there is a shift from collegiality to dictatorship. This is related to the shift from decentralization to centralization. Generally, a country in the early stages of revolution tends to have a collegial nature. Mussolini initially formed a mixed cabinet, and Kemal also allowed others to participate when he first took office. However, now in Italy, no other parties are in the cabinet, and there are no popular elections. Collegiality is a mere formality, while dictatorship is the reality. Germany was also like this in the past. When Hitler first rose to power, he still allowed others to participate in the government, but now it is very different. Therefore, we can summarize by saying that in the past, there was a trend towards the rule of law, but now there is a feeling of emphasizing the rule of people. What is the reason for this trend? What is the rationale? Why did this situation form? We need to know here: (To be continued)

Women's Special Section

### On Women's Liberation

— Chen Tianci

"Women's liberation requires women to liberate themselves and cannot rely on men to liberate them. The most important issue is education. The second most important issue is economic independence." — Hu Hanmin.

"I have come to a conclusion regarding the issue of women's liberation in China: (1) The first step in women's liberation is equal education for men and women. (2) The purpose of women's education is to provide educational opportunities for women workers who serve society." — Dai Jitao.

"The most important spiritual liberation for Chinese women is to break away from the education of being a good wife and mother and replace it with an education that recognizes women as individuals, so that they can liberate themselves." — Luo Jialun.

"Liberated women's education means that, whether in middle school or university, men and women should attend the same schools and receive the same preparation, so that they can have a shared life." — Hu Shi.

"The modern women's issue is actually born from the false, biased, and unnatural culture of the modern era. To solve this problem, we must overthrow the old system and create a new culture." — Zeng Qi.

"If we want to change the current status of women, a social revolution and a fundamental renewal in culture are necessary." — August Bebel.

"The women's issue is fathered by awakened thought and mothered by the necessity of society."

### German Women Under Fascism

— Qiu Wen

After the European War in 1918, Germany suddenly had more than 2.4 million fewer men, and the female population outnumbered the male population by one-third. After this year, German women invisibly seized men's occupations, and there were a large number of husbands who depended on their wives for a living. That time could be called the era of German women's center society. However, after Hitler came to power, he believed that the decline in Germany's population production rate would create an unparalleled crisis for the German nation. In Hitler's book "Mein Kampf," he said: "All hope belongs to men, because women are ultimately passive." "The greatest purpose of marriage is to increase the population and perpetuate the race. This is the true meaning and responsibility of marriage." From these two famous sayings, one can know Hitler's hatred for women serving in society.

In a state-run newspaper, a ridiculous statement was found, which said: "Women should have no place in politics at all and should sincerely leave it to men. Women are inherently unsuitable for competing with men for survival. It is enough to make their own small circle (referring to the family) beautiful." From this kind of remark, it can be seen that the slogan "send women back home" has been shouted out directly and happily.

The German Minister of Women's Propaganda, Farn Magda-Goebbels, is an old politician who oppresses same-sex relationships in Germany. She once broadcast on the radio and also made strange arguments. She said: "The reason why Germany under Fascism wants women to leave public and political activities is not because it despises women or insults women, because the political circle is fundamentally a dirty garbage can. Noble women should not be tricked with children's methods to deceive German women. It is really the most stupid thing. And please ask why she has to step into this dirty garbage can and let it be defiled!"

Recently, Hitler has promulgated that rebellious women will be driven to the army to do hard labor and will be subjected to imprisonment, punishment, and death. In the newspapers, one can often see female corpses floating in the sea, but clever reporters often euphemistically call them "suicides."

In short, the golden age of German women has passed. They only stay at home to raise sons for their husbands. Look at the recent announcement that only seventy-five female students are allowed to enter the university each year, and they are only allowed to enter medical school. Don't you think this method is not far from our country's Qin Shi Huang?

### Escape

— Youlan

Woof... Woof... Woof...

Just as Jiaqing was sleeping soundly, he was suddenly awakened by a series of urgent and fierce barks.

"Could there be a thief?" His wife also woke up and asked from the small bed in the east.

Because there was no other man in the house, Jiaqing had to get up himself, take a flashlight, and hold a fire poker, and went out with courage. Fortunately, it was early autumn, and the weather was not very cold, but when Jiaqing walked out of the back courtyard, perhaps due to some terror, his legs were already a little shaky.

"Open the door! Open the door quickly!" Fortunately, it wasn't a thief, someone was knocking on the door, and the person's voice was very familiar.

Jiaqing hurriedly opened the back door, and Bangda came in. His attitude was very panicked, his face was pale, and as soon as he entered the door, he grabbed Jiaqing's clothes and said anxiously:

"Run away! Magistrate Wu saw that you hadn't corrected him in today's newspaper and has decided to do it at all costs... he's going to do it. At the latest, at dawn, they... they will definitely send someone to arrest you! I advise you to run away... quickly... run away!"

As Jiaqing led Bangda inside, his heart was in a turmoil, like tangled threads that couldn't be untangled. He didn't expect Magistrate Wu to be so unreasonable. If he were really caught, no matter whether he could get out safely later, he would definitely suffer a loss in the present; but if he really had to run away, what about his wife and two young children?

"We must escape!" When they arrived in the inner room, Bangda urged, seeing that Jiaqing was still hesitating, "And we must leave quickly, it is said that they are going to treat you as a Communist..."

"Communist?" Jiaqing asked inexplicably. "Am I a Communist...?"

At this time, his wife also got up, her face pale, standing behind Jiaqing.

"I said you shouldn't run the newspaper, now that the matter is at hand, don't you want to leave?" His wife said excitedly, "Are we going to send our lives to the hands of such corrupt officials for nothing!"

It was decided to escape. At that time, Bangda went to hire a boat for him first, his wife was busy packing his clothes, and he himself was just running around in the room. "Wah... wah..." The younger child woke up, and then the older child also woke up. They felt that the situation tonight was a bit special, so they all sat up and refused to sleep again. His wife had to try her best to scold them, while hastily packing a small suitcase for Jiaqing.

Bangda came back and told him that he had hired a small fishing boat waiting in the small river outside the back door. Jiaqing picked up the small suitcase, but seemed to feel the weight of separation, and put it down after only three or four steps. Bangda knew that time was very short, so he grabbed it and carried it for him first. His wife held a kerosene lamp behind him and sent him all the way to the back door.

"You should take ten more dollars with you!" Finally, his wife stuffed two banknotes into his pocket.

"Then what about you?" Jiaqing originally wanted to leave fifteen dollars to his wife, but now his wife had returned ten dollars to him, leaving only five dollars.

His wife didn't say anything, just smiled bitterly, and closed the back door.

### Eighth Letter

Ms. B:

You asked in your letter about the design of a personal garden. Today, I will talk to you specifically about this matter.

Besides parks and gardens attached to public buildings, there are also personal gardens. Personal gardens are mostly attached to ordinary residences, so the types vary depending on the residence, and the size is proportional to the residence. Gardens attached to upper-class residences are very large, and the various parts and details of the garden are also very complex. Gardens attached to small and medium-sized residences are small in area, and the various parts and details are simple. There is also a big difference between gardens in the city and outside the city. City gardens are very small in area, and the land is used very sparingly; suburban gardens are larger in area, and the surroundings are also open. Vegetable gardens, flower gardens, lawns, tennis courts, and other special parts of the garden are more numerous. If it is a villa garden, it has its own characteristics depending on its location, such as on a hillside, seaside, forest, or lakeside. There are also distinctions such as "summer gardens" and "winter gardens" depending on the season of use.

How should the parts and details of a garden be structured and distributed? This is the most important technique in garden design, so it is important to first understand the types of parts and details of a garden. Some parts of the garden are opposite to the rooms of the house and have different uses. Some have independent uses in the garden itself. The one closest to the gate is called the front garden. The one facing the living room and dining room is called the main garden. Outside the kitchen, there is also a corresponding part of the garden, which is called the service garden. In addition, there are paths (connecting the various parts of the garden), vegetable gardens, fruit orchards, chicken farms, etc., which are independent for practical purposes. Tennis courts, sand playgrounds, swimming pools, etc., are independent for the purpose of sports and games. These all have their own uses and are all parts of the garden.

The parts of the garden are governed by the relationship between the rooms of the house and the streets, and the requirements of the various parts of the garden. Following the conditions of the land, such as the limited location, orientation, terrain, and area, all become requirements for distribution. How to choose these parts and how to configure them on this land? This is the backbone of garden design. Among the distribution of each part, the main garden is the most important part and should be given the most favorable and largest area possible. For the front garden, paths, and service garden, there is no need for a good location, and the area can be saved. It is easier to first determine the minimum area required for each of these parts. Once the position of the main garden is determined, there will be a way to deal with the other parts. Once the size of each part is determined, be sure to make the most of the main garden, and if there is any surplus, you can add parts for practical and sports purposes.

In addition to finding ways to make each part of the garden function, the connection of each part and the requirements of the surrounding area of the garden must also be satisfied. For example, concealing streets or places that can be seen from neighboring houses, preventing strong sunlight and storms, and paying attention to garden drainage are all points that must be considered during distribution. The orientation of the garden is best to the south. Next is the order of east, west, and north. Therefore, the main garden is often located in the south or east, and the front garden and service garden are located in the north or west. Which side is the street on? This should be studied.

Madam! I'm afraid you'll find it boring if I talk too technically, right? And I can't finish talking about it in one go, so I'll have to continue talking to you next time.

### The Relationship Between Health and Beauty (Part 1)

— Te

A British physical educator once compiled a complete system of body tempering, which received enthusiastic endorsement from the whole country. He recently wrote a paper on this issue as follows:

Some people are born beautiful, and some become beautiful through their own efforts - this may take time and patience - but the result has proven that the time is worth spending. I dare say that every woman is responsible for making the world more beautiful because she was born into this world, but not for adding ugliness. Embellishment and clothing are of course very helpful to the beauty of modern women, but the beauty I mean is durable, radiant, and eye-catching, in other words, beauty obtained from health.

Embellishment is an amazing thing, and every woman born today should be grateful that she belongs to an era of popular embellishment. But the ugliest thing in the world is to add embellishment to a sickly complexion, or to paint the cheeks of a haggard face red, which greatly loses the original meaning of embellishment, because embellishment is only to cover up one or two shortcomings so that people do not notice that place. So, on the other hand, a smooth face with healthy skin, plus the appropriate embellishment, makes people feel like they have changed their face. The effect of embellishment is indeed magical. Undoubtedly, health is now becoming more and more fashionable, even if you are a beautiful young woman, if you do not look healthy, you will not have much success today. From this, it can be seen that the first thing every woman should pay attention to is "how to maintain health."

This person seems to have finally realized the "love of ease and aversion to labor" in the lives of most civilized people, thinking that the way to save it is that everyone should pay attention to gymnastics, especially special gymnastics with a clear health purpose. Or someone said; "But the certain format of gymnastics is not natural for everyone." That's right, it's unnatural. But sitting in the office all day, or working in the factory, and there is a noble person who does less work than others, eats more than others, and sits in cars or airplanes all day, losing the effect of his legs, none of these can be considered natural.

Every day there is a lot of outdoor work, and swimming and other similar activities, absorbing air and sunlight, are very sufficient. If people have the possibility of enjoying this kind of moderate and healthy life, I also believe that an organized body tempering method is not necessary. But as far as the world today is concerned, just look at the pedestrians on the street, poor and rich, most of them show a weak look, and their physique has many shortcomings. As long as they are willing to put in the effort, they can all become healthy and full of energy, so why not do it!

Recently, the kind of people who love swimming, dancing, ice skating, and all kinds of sports have become increasingly popular. However, even if all kinds of conveniences are fully prepared, these active entertainments are not something that everyone can fully enjoy due to time constraints or excessive costs. Some people therefore advocate walking as a simple method of fitness, but I dare not agree. Comparing the time and energy spent with the benefits obtained, walking is indeed a kind of exercise that is "not worth the effort", because if you are not on a steep slope, often going up and down, but only walking on flat ground, this only makes the muscles of the legs move, and in terms of health observation points, leg movement is not very important.

You only need to open the window every morning (better on the Yang Zai or in the garden) and do special gymnastics in the room for ten minutes, and the effect is really better than walking for an hour. If you can follow a few kinds of gymnastics compiled according to scientific methods, you can also correct your body posture and get a very solid effect, such as reducing fat, expanding breathing power, increasing digestive power, and correcting round shoulders and flat feet.

You may want to ask yourself: "Is it worth putting in this kind of hard work?" At the moment of answering, you will think of clothing, which also has a special relationship with the beauty of appearance. Naturally! A perfect figure and perfect clothing together will become a kind of "ideal beauty." However, there is something amazing about it. A woman with a good figure does not need perfect clothing. Even if she wears cheap clothes, she will feel graceful and move pleasingly.

Then you will say: "A perfect figure is very difficult for us to obtain. How can the thousands of women with poor figures, who have less income and no power to buy good clothes, increase their beauty?" Yes, I know that women often complain about their poor figures, but based on my experience in dealing with all walks of life, I dare say that there are relatively few cases where the figure is so bad that it cannot be remedied, because only when the bones of each part are disproportionate and cannot be changed can it be considered truly bad.

Talks

### “Perhaps It Will Be a Blessing for Both Countries”

— Xiao Mei

Our China is a country that emphasizes "good neighborly relations." The heads of "friendly nations" should, of course, be avoided in discussion, just like avoiding the name of the "Emperor" in autocratic times. Even the customs of "friendly nations" should be discussed as little as possible, to avoid causing interference and many inconveniences. This method of clearing the field is originally very good, as it can save trouble. But there is usually a downside to everything in the world. Not talking about it certainly saves a lot of trouble, but having something stuck in your throat is not a pleasant feeling, especially in this era of freedom of speech. Seeing others say what they want to say at will, one can't help but feel itchy. And one feels especially fond of what others have said, wishing one could fly over and listen to the great arguments of the time in person.

Since New York Mayor La Guardia's last speech denounced Hitler as a "brown-shirt madman" and a "disturber of world peace," which provoked attacks from German newspapers (especially the Nazi Party's official newspaper), I thought that there would probably be some crime of insulting the head of a friendly nation. But the result was completely unexpected. Although protests were also lodged, and there was a threat of swords being drawn and bows bent, it ended with words like "apology" and "regret," and in the "apology" and "regret," one statement said: The United States has always valued freedom of speech; and another said: But the attacking words used by German newspapers do not represent the views of the German government. One day of turmoil vanished like smoke.

It should be unexpectedly fortunate to insult the head of a friendly nation and only end with "apology" and "regret." One should have stopped talking about it from then on. Unexpectedly, that was not the case. At the American Jewish anti-Nazi demonstration, La Guardia reiterated, "German leader Hitler should still be regarded as a 'brown-shirt fanatic.' How Hitler reacts is not something you need to worry about, because as far as the world is concerned, Hitler's character and diplomatic actions are not worth taking." As for how to interpret the phrase "not worth taking," it was not said at the time. According to onlookers' speculation afterwards, it was nothing more than "honor is present, and Hitler cannot get a foothold." Also, "During La Guardia's speech, every time he mentioned Hitler's name, the audience made cow-like noises to mock him."

Feeling like a frightened bird after such repeated insults, I thought that La Guardia would definitely be imprisoned this time. But the result was still not so. According to a Washington dispatch from the National Society on the 17th:

"... Especially to lodge a protest with the U.S. Department of State again. Secretary of State Hull immediately replied, expressing his deep regret again, and said that the United States has always valued freedom of speech, and that it is useless to pursue the past. It is hoped that the people of the United States and Germany will no longer participate in this kind of dispute that is becoming more and more resentful, and that they can end it as soon as possible, change the topic, and discuss it politely, perhaps it will be a blessing for both countries."

It looks like it will probably still end with "expressing deep regret." La Guardia will not be imprisoned, and the reply that "it is useless to pursue the past" further guarantees that "the United States values freedom of speech."

Will this case end here and begin to "change the topic and discuss it politely?" I don't know; "How Hitler reacts?" is even more unknown. But regardless of whether they "change the topic" or not, and regardless of "how they react," it is always enviable that the US government can always deal with such disputes with "valuing freedom of speech." And in mutual abuse, in a free world, if one can find out who is right and who is wrong (the right to decide this is in the hands of the entire public), then even if "resentment becomes more and more deeply rooted," it is still "a blessing for both countries." Because in my opinion, although Mr. Hitler is currently the only leader of Germany, Germany is not ultimately privately owned by Mr. Hitler.

### Ruan Xiao Wu

— Song Nian

——Gleanings from Stories——

(Part One)

On the Hall of Loyalty and Justice, spiderwebs were already hanging full, the spiderwebs covered with dust, like pendants accompanying the yellow leaves on the great wooden ceiling, swaying together in the west wind, adorning the desolation of Liangshan Marsh.

In the dark night, crickets chirped mournfully, and wild deer cried plaintively, while owls, awakened from their dreams, laughed "ho ho" at all human follies.

In this frigid air, besides the crickets and owls, there was scarcely any other sound; only the distant, faint barking of dogs from the foot of the mountain, indicating that the night was only half over.

Everything on Liangshan had long since fallen asleep – the only person who had not yet soundly slumbered was Ruan Xiao Wu, and his young daughter. He himself was unwilling to enter the prison of civilization, letting his brothers surrender if they wished, embrace wealth and splendor if they desired.

He loved freedom, he loved Liangshan. So he built a thatched cottage at the foot of Liangshan, living with his daughter, growing old together with the white reeds and rushes.

The thatched cottage had no lights, not much furniture; a fishing net hung on the wall behind the door, outside on the stove there was a leftover carp, and a ten-pound wine gourd, as well as a foot-long gleaming sharp knife, stuck in a broken board, which was his daughter's beloved thing, used for killing fish, and also for killing people.

Besides that, there were only a few broken clay pots scattered on the stove, containing nothing more than some salt, sesame oil, and such.

Behind a pile of firewood, there was also a clay jar, but what it contained was indistinguishable in the darkness.

He: Ruan Xiao Wu, went to bed to sleep, but he could never fall asleep deeply, getting up three times, without knowing why. He draped a cloak made of homespun cloth over himself, sat on the wooden bed, opened the paper window, gazing intently at the mountainside – the owls were laughing at his white hair.

He felt vexed, vexed to the point of wanting to cry, no, to kill someone. – He knew himself what caused this vexation. It was as if something was accumulated in his chest, inflamed, rising to his throat...

Behind him, only a few steps away, was the sleeping cot of his young daughter, and he suddenly heard some faint sounds from that bed. He turned his head sharply and saw his daughter sitting there, already dressed, not making a sound, sitting there motionless. Only a pair of sharp eyes, jumping together with her eyebrows in the darkness.

His pent-up feelings seemed to have eased a little, and without a word, he took off his cloak and went back to bed.

The thatched cottage was almost at the end of the mountain, and through the window, one could see the distant fields and lush forests. He could see the eastern horizon gradually turning white, and then becoming red as if by a wildfire, a round-faced moon, unexpectedly peeking out from behind the distant reeds, its light strangely pale and frightening, shining on the stream outside his house, the stream still carrying the stench of wine from years past.

That would be nothing more than sighing, drinking a few cups of wine, and letting it all end in drunkenness.

Especially tonight, he wanted to forget the things that angered him, to cast them aside; for the sake of the mountains and forests, for the sake of the stream, and especially for the sake of his young daughter, he should do so. But he couldn't, the more he tried to cast it aside, the more he couldn't.

(Part Two)

The embarrassing fat face of Lord Ding, the tax collector of the actresses, the pack of lackeys, behaving so barbarically, the county magistrate, so perverse and filthy... all these black shadows of devils that wouldn't let him live, were clearly imprinted on his tranquil mind.

The pain of the beating was like thorns, even turning over in bed, he couldn't help but groan.

The moon was still a face, peeking at his movements in the sky, but he instead became silent, smiling faintly.

The cricket chirped in the stove, the shadow of the reed flowers swayed and was imprinted on the window lattice, forcing his gleaming eyes to look. What entered his eyes was his young daughter, still sitting there, and his chest began to feel congested again.

He turned his head heavily, and sighed.

The cricket chirped, chirping softly and weakly, the moonlight was still peeking, and he vaguely saw his warhorse from years past, his precious saber from years past, a handsome young man riding in a pool of blood.

He remembered everything, and missed everything, but in his half-sleep, it didn't seem like the force that wouldn't let him live. Finally, he was congested to the point of death, he opened his eyes, and looked around.

He laughed, he felt very strange, looking at the moonlight, listening to the cricket, it seemed like they were also laughing, also feeling strange.

He couldn't sleep anymore.

He slowly put on all his clothes, tightened his belt, and clenched his fists, looking at them in front of his eyes. Slowly, slowly, he lifted away the straw mat, revealing a gleaming knife that was too long and too narrow. He slowly picked up the knife, tapping it with his fingernail from the tip all the way to the guard, the knife rang crisply, and he smiled.

He turned to look at his young daughter, she was busy bundling the fishing net and the wine gourd. The gleaming knife that was stuck in the broken board, he didn't know when, had flown onto the belt she was tying, stuck diagonally behind her back.

She seemed to still be busy with something. He slowly shook his head, and smiled triumphantly.

Two long shadows quickly passed the mountainside, passed the great forest, and quickly disappeared into the moonlight, as if carried by the wind.

Roosters were crowing everywhere, but here it was as silent as death.

She tied the fishing net and wine gourd together, along with a small package, which must have been his own clothes.

It looked like they were about to travel.

He was still stroking the two broken, bloodstained sharp knives.

Everything on earth was still sound asleep, everywhere drifting with deathly silence, the owls were tired, the crickets were also tired, and the moon had already hidden behind the mountains. There was not a single sound here, nothing could be heard, only the distant, faint sound of more dogs barking from the foot of the mountain, at which point it was almost dawn.

### Whose Bestowal Is It?

The Calamity Suffered by Young Men and Women Today

In the fragmented present-day China, young men and women are suffering unprecedented calamities. Deprived of education. Present society the opportunity for , , , , education. They have a strong desire for knowledge, but under the restriction of economic conditions, they are abandoned outside the educational circle – Loss of love: A man and woman in their adolescence needs love to irrigate their lonely life, which is a rational requirement both mentally and physiologically, but under various reasons, most young people cannot pursue satisfactory results - Unemployment: Although young people graduate from school with abundant knowledge and some hope, the current society cannot allow them to have a place to stand. Whose bestowal is this?

In the new film of the Star Film Company, directed by Shen Xiling, and starring Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, Lü Ban, Ying Yin, Yi Ming, and Sha Meng, "Crossroads" (this film is scheduled to be released on the 26th of this month at the "National Grand Theater" in Beijing), there is a clear answer. At the same time, it points out a path for young people.

This is a very moving subject that grasps reality. Shen Xiling uses a comedic approach to deal with it. The development of the whole play makes the audience feel the inner sorrow and pain in laughter. The director's skills and the actors' acting skills have special achievements, creating an artistic work in which the content and form of "Crossroads" reach the peak - the writer dares to guarantee with his personality that this is not an exaggerated propaganda, but a recommendation for the audience to appreciate.

### Two Good Films During the Spring Holidays: "Green Hills and Red Powder" and "Moonlit Night and Flowery Sky"

"Green Hills and Red Powder" God's Country and the Woman, is the latest natural color film produced by Warner Films, starring George Brent and Bebe Daniels, etc. It has poetic images and fiery emotions, and is indeed better than the previous "Song of the Pines" etc. It is heard that the Great Light Cinema has scheduled to release this film during the Spring Holidays.

"Moonlit Night and Flowery Sky" Ir's Love Again, is a great British song and dance blockbuster that once caused a sensation in major cities around the world, starring Kiki McManus, the artistic star of "Spring is Endless". All the song and dance scenes are extraordinary, and the plot is quite hot and moving. It is heard that the film will be released during the Spring Holidays at the Cathay Cinema.

### Slapstick is a Vitamin

Laughing three times a day is the way to health. This is what everyone knows, so optimistic people can also be strong.

In addition to laughing three times a day, you should also laugh a few times in a year, so that you can be even healthier. And to realize this big laugh, you can only watch slapstick films, like the slapstick film "Mr. Wang Gets Rich", which is full of jokes from beginning to end. Of course, everyone who sees it will laugh a lot. Now "Mr. Wang Gets Rich" will be released soon. Please, friends who are interested in hygiene, may you go and have a big laugh!
