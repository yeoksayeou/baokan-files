[Luoyang] Rumor has it that Yu Xuezhong's troops have news of obeying the central government's orders. The remaining staff in their headquarters office in Xi'an are being monitored by Yang Xiaocheng. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)

[Luoyang] According to semi-official sources, there is a turning point in the Shaanxi situation. Based on the current situation, if there are no other changes, it will come to an end within days. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)

[Xuzhou] Military report: Yang Hucheng is now in a united front with the Red bandits, holding the Northeast Army generals hostage, and actively deploying defenses. The Red bandits are doing their best to entice officers of various armies and young people in the provincial capital, creating a strong atmosphere of terror. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)

[Nanjing] Bao Wenxue, Mi Chunlin, and Li Zhigang, etc., took special Eurasia flights to Xi'an on the previous two days to convey the central government's generous handling of the Shaanxi aftermath and its deep concern for the people of Shaanxi, hoping that Yang Hucheng would consider the central authorities' sincerity for the country and the people, and immediately obey the orders and handle the Shaanxi situation according to the central government's plan.

### Foreigners in Xi'an Are Safe

The Government Is Deeply Concerned and Doing Its Best to Find a Solution; Counselor of the US Embassy Flies Back to Beijing from Shaanxi

[Nanjing] US Embassy Counselor Peck flew to Xi'an on the 15th to inspect the situation of American expatriates in Shaanxi. Mr. Peck arrived in Beijing at 5:00 PM on the 16th on the original plane that brought Mi Chunlin and others. American women and children in Xi'an did not travel with Peck. According to Peck's response to reporters at the airport, he met with the expatriates during this trip. The expatriates are currently safe. The evacuation of American expatriates is being considered for a considerable time. Peck spent about twenty hours in Xi'an and did not meet with Yang Hucheng. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Foreign report: There were originally twelve German expatriates in Xi'an. Due to the unfavorable situation in the area for German expatriates, they have successively found ways to leave the country. There are currently no German expatriates in Xi'an. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] All parties are now paying close attention to the protection and repatriation of foreign expatriates in Xi'an. A Central News Agency reporter has learned that as early as mid-December of last year, when the Xi'an Incident first broke out, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had telegraphed Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to do their best to protect foreign expatriates in Shaanxi. With the recent changes in the Shaanxi situation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is maintaining contact with the relevant embassies on the one hand and repeatedly telegraphing Yang Hucheng on the other hand, instructing him to escort the expatriates out of the country. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also consulting with the military authorities on rescue measures, and the military authorities have repeatedly telegraphed Yang Hucheng, instructing him to send the expatriates to Huaxian and guaranteeing that any vehicles transporting the expatriates will be allowed to return to Xi'an. As for the measures proposed by the relevant embassies, all those that can be implemented in practice are being implemented. The dispatch of personnel from the embassies of relevant countries to Luoyang or Xi'an is being given the utmost assistance and convenience at all times and places. For example, when Mr. Peck, Counselor of the US Embassy, flew to Xi'an on an Eurasia aircraft on the 15th, it was with the assistance of the government authorities, and the government personnel on board the aircraft delivered letters on behalf of the embassy. However, the round-trip flights are only possible if the local authorities have been contacted in advance to arrange for parking. In fact, there are inevitably many difficulties. In short, it is still difficult to predict how the Shaanxi situation will develop in the future, but the government will treat all expatriates in Shaanxi equally, with deep concern and doing its best to find a solution to get them out of their current situation. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)

[Nanjing] Peck said that the area where foreign expatriates are concentrated in Xi'an is still safe, but it is best to move out. I originally planned to take a group of women and children out of the country, but because there were not many seats on the plane, I was unable to take them. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Mr. Peck, Counselor of the US Embassy, returned here this afternoon from Xi'an on an Eurasia aircraft. In an interview with a Reuters reporter, he stated, "Foreign expatriates in Xi'an are safe. A plan has been drafted to transport expatriates out of the country and will be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval." Mr. Peck did not carry any foreign expatriates on this trip because the plane was full of Chinese officials and their families, as well as central government officers residing in Xi'an, with no space left. Among them were Mi Chunlin, former Director of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Li Zhigang, representative of Yang Hucheng, and Bao Wenxue, leader of the Northeast Army. The plane took off from Xi'an at eleven o'clock this morning. The weather was extremely bad, and the pilot had to fly entirely by direction along the way. When it arrived in Beijing at 5:00 PM, it could not descend for a while due to poor visibility. Later, it was able to land safely with the help of signal flares launched by the airport. US Ambassador Johnson, Buxton, Fischer, and Mrs. Peck were all waiting at the airport. After Mr. Peck got off the plane, he replied to a reporter from Reuters, "When I was in Xi'an, I met with all the foreign expatriates. Although they hoped to leave the country, they did not feel despair. Xi'an is still peaceful and there is no chaos. Last night, I was invited to a banquet by Yang Hucheng, but Yang himself did not attend, so I had no opportunity to meet him. The Xi'an authorities are very polite and promised to reserve seats on the plane for foreign expatriates who wish to leave the country. Unfortunately, there were only eleven seats on the entire plane, all of which were occupied by three representatives of Yang and their families, leaving no space for foreign expatriates. When we were about to leave Xi'an, many American and Swedish expatriates gathered at the airport, hoping to hitch a ride, but they were disappointed and returned." (Sixteenth Reuters Electric)

### Overseas Chinese Support the Central Government

Speaking to reporters on the 16th, he said that overseas Chinese, in view of the completion of the unification of the motherland and the rapid progress of construction, are more enthusiastic in their support of the central government than before. This can be evidenced by the various facts of overseas Chinese caring about the country. In recent years, our overseas Chinese residing in various countries have also been more respected than before. This is due to the increase in our country's international status. There have been no cases of oppression and expulsion in the past year. This can be reported to the people of the country.

In the counties of western Henan along the Shaanxi border, there are already tens of thousands of refugees from Shaanxi. The Henan Relief Association originally planned to open porridge kitchens to provide relief, but because the number of people was too large and the funds were insufficient, it was decided not to open the porridge kitchens for the time being, as the number of people coming would only increase after the porridge kitchens opened, and it would be impossible to sustain them in the future. For now, local charitable organizations are providing relief as appropriate. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)

[Xuzhou] Road news: Traffic to and from Xi'an has been cut off for a long time, and various materials are in short supply, especially food.

㊀ The Delicate New Year of Congratulatory Greetings

Nineteen thirty-six passed bit by bit in a tense atmosphere. As usual, at the end of the year, everything must come to a conclusion, and the achievements of the year must be calculated. Therefore, many innovative people always like to seize the main characteristics of the year and give it a new term. I remember when I was in China, everyone called 1934 the "Magazine Year" and 1935 the "Imitating Ancient Books Year," but some people also thought that 1935 should be called the "Essay Year." What should the just-passed 1936 be called? I still don't know. I think it might still be called the "Magazine Year," which might not be wrong.

People in Tokyo have the same habit. For example, 1935, they called it the "Military Demand Boom Year." In fact, Japan's military demand boom was not only in 1935, but also in 1933 and 1934, but in 1935, it was the "culmination of the boom."

In 1936, some people familiar with the Japanese economic situation still advocated calling it the "Military Demand Boom Year" because the expansion of military demand in the past year was not worse than in 1935. On the contrary, with the active development of international arms competition, it developed further than in 1935. The expansion of military demand caused the steel panic problem and the oil resource problem. The expansion of military industry has reduced the number of farmers in rural areas day by day. Therefore, some people are shouting loudly, "This is Japan's current crisis, farmers should return to the countryside! Reduce the burden on farmers!"

Opening the newspapers for the last day or two of the year, I suddenly found the eight big characters "New Year's Congratulatory Boom Year" on the "Society Page" of each newspaper.

What is called the "New Year's Congratulatory Boom Year"? In other words, the number of New Year's telegrams and New Year's cards sent throughout Japan at the end of 1936 increased by almost double on average. If we only take Tokyo City as an example, then the receipt of New Year's telegrams increased threefold, and the receipt and delivery of New Year's cards increased by 0.9 times. According to the report of the Tokyo Ministry of Communications, the reasons for the sudden increase in New Year's cards and New Year's telegrams are: first, the stimulation of the military demand boom; second, the reduction of telegram fees and the psychological stimulation of the new New Year's postage (a special New Year's rate of 1.5 sen); and third, the effectiveness of the Ministry of Communications' publicity, which is also a manifestation of the upward trend of social culture. However, another part of the people think that this is a manifestation of the downward trend of social culture. It is a micro-expression of the fact that the survival competition between individuals and the phenomenon of infighting between groups are becoming increasingly prominent. Because of the fierce competition and infighting, they have to come up with all kinds of tricks to win over their helpers.

Is it cultural progress or cultural decline? This small incident seems to contain a profound meaning.

㊁ Different Views on Pessimistic Tones

Perhaps it is a unique phenomenon this year. In the process of this booming military demand, the Tokyo newspapers and various magazines with a background in Beiping seem to have unanimously revealed some pessimistic elements. Some say that diplomacy has failed, others that the political situation is uncertain, some say that there is a financial crisis, others that the decline of rural areas is worrying, some support political parties, and others act as cheerleaders for the military. Among them, there are also many people who advocate compromise. With various patterns and different colors, the public opinion circle is really like a place of chaotic and complex ideological struggle. Therefore, in the publishing industry, there is also the elegant name of the "Pamphlet Boom Year."

Let's take an example. In terms of newspapers, the tone of advocating zaibatsu consciousness has been quite strong recently. For example, the Asahi Shimbun in Tokyo, which has the largest circulation, its editorial on the last day of the year is titled "The State of the World Standing Between Light and Darkness." It holds an infinitely pessimistic attitude towards the increase in the burden of national life, the pursuit of empty pleasures, the confusion of the times, the increase in social depression and people's political vigilance, the repeated occurrence of corruption incidents among the backbone elements, and the occurrence of crimes such as parents killing their fathers to defraud insurance money. Its central point seems to be how to relieve the national burden in this extraordinary time.

However, standing from another standpoint—the standpoint of a strong political viewpoint—there are different opinions and different observations.

Let's take the magazine "New Problems" run by young military officers as a representative. In the past year, it once pointed out very angrily: "1936 is a year of chaos, confusion, and dim hope! A social phenomenon at the end of the century! And a year of the development of social culture! In the economic aspect, there is a decisive battle between state-owned and private enterprises. In the social aspect, there is the emergence of the new national movement centered on the right wing camp. However, in the left wing camp, there is also the legal rise of the proletarian forces in the Tokyo Municipal Assembly election last winter. In the cultural aspect, since the February 26th Incident, general important newspapers and magazines have almost completely shifted from the position of guiding society to the position of commercialism. The Asahi Shimbun in Tokyo is an example. Recently, the critical attitude of major magazines and newspapers in Tokyo towards the Japan-Germany Agreement is simply an unprecedented degradation in the history of our country (Japan's) newspapers."

The above is just a summary of the main ideas of the entire magazine. This kind of tit-for-tat argument and these different views interact with each other and roughly show the entire outline of Japanese society to us.

㊂ Five Percent Respect

Recently, Professor Hyoe Ouchi of Tokyo Imperial University said a rather humorous sentence: "Five Percent Respect!"

The so-called "five percent" refers to the increase in the budget of the Ministry of Finance in the twelfth year, which actually reached 1.065 billion yuan, of which the national livelihood stabilization fee was 53 million yuan, accounting for exactly five percent of the total increase.

In this five percent national livelihood stabilization fee, there are a large number of uses such as river improvement, disaster prevention! Such as forestry investment, special subsidies for rural economic regeneration! Such as state-run grain inspection, financial subsidies for small and medium-sized businesses! Such as business subsidies for farmers, mountain and fishing associations! Each sector and each amount is really too numerous to mention!

The common people are always grateful for these subsidies, but the component of gratitude is only five percent!

In addition, Professor Ouchi also listed some statistics, pointing out the living conditions of the general working masses during the five years of extraordinary times. He said: "In the past five years, the livelihood index and income index of the working masses have obviously shown an expanding state of contradiction, that is, on the one hand, the cost of living index has continued to increase, and on the other hand, the real index of wage income has continued to decrease. If we take the cost of living index in November of the sixth year of Showa as 159, then by October of the eleventh year of Showa (i.e., 1936), it will increase to 1839, of which the cost of clothing, etc., will increase by 37%, and the cost of food, etc., will increase by 39%. But what about the actual number of wage income? In the sixth year of Showa, it was still 92.6 (taking the fourth year of Showa as 100), but by the eleventh year of Showa, it had decreased to below 81.6."

In this way, if the opposite trend continues to develop, the lives of the masses are unimaginable. What's more, we saw in the Yomiuri Shimbun on December 29th: "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Doubles Capital Increase in One Fell Swoop"!

### Three Stages of Reform

— Xu Xusheng

Generally speaking, in a society where most people can live and work in peace and contentment, not only the facts of reform but also the ideas of reform are not easy to occur. When it is difficult for a large part of the people to maintain their livelihoods, the ideas of reform are easily generated and spread rapidly. Subsequently, reform will change from ideas to facts. This kind of major social reform can usually be divided into three attitudes. Because they are often continuous, they can also be said to be the three stages of the reform period. The degree of simplicity and complexity of the social content is different, and the nature of the reform is also different. Therefore, some reforms do not fully complete the three stages, and some, although roughly complete, pass quickly and are not easy to distinguish. The content of my country's reform in the past 100 years is extremely rich, and the slow pace is a very obvious national characteristic of my country. Therefore, these three stages are extremely obvious, and their nature is roughly as described below:

The first stage: The situation of the society at that time is not good, which can be seen by all knowledgeable people. Poverty leads to change, and change leads to success, which can also be felt by most thoughtful people. If there is cultural contact at that time, then taking the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses should also be the overall requirement of those who advocate reform. However, because what was seen at that time was only the surface phenomenon of society, and the fundamental ideas had not been shaken, all these questions, such as what is strength? What is weakness? What is the standard for selection? At that time, they all felt very simple. All that is in line with the main ideas of the past should be accepted; all that is different should be rejected. Acceptance and rejection are all based on the original main ideas. The idea of Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application advocated by the reformers in the late Qing Dynasty was such a method. Such a reform is easily accepted by everyone because the fundamental concepts are not changed at all. However, whether it is successful or not depends on the degree of difference between the culture adopted that day and the old culture. The culture itself, like other organisms, has its own individual and its own life. Grafting is a common thing among plants, but the pear buds must be grafted onto the rootstock of the wild pear, and the peach buds must be grafted onto the rootstock of the mountain peach to thrive and bear good fruit. If it is reversed, the wild pear is grafted onto the mountain peach, and the peach is connected to the wild pear, the grafted buds will definitely wither, let alone bloom and bear fruit. Why is that? Because wild pears and pears, peaches and mountain peaches are different in kind but close in branch. There are not many physiological differences, so they can still be relocated to be good. As for plants that are physiologically far apart, it is really impossible to graft them. If there is no big difference in thought, it is not a difficult task to take the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses. Otherwise, the rootstocks are very different, and the grafting of branches and nodes is difficult to succeed. Studying science with the spirit of the eight-legged essay and the spirit of the market businessman enjoying profits to operate industries, no matter how diligent they are, the result is still going south by driving the chariot north! The method of Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application cannot work, which is also this simple reason.

The second stage: Everyone understands that culture has its own individual and its own life, and that there is no way to succeed in random cutting and grafting, so they advocate transplanting it whole with roots and leaves. In recent years, the call for complete Westernization has been quite strong, which is a manifestation of this trend. The advantage of this method is that its attitude is thorough and it will not create something that is neither cow nor horse, which is a big joke. The transplantation of whole plants is certainly more complete than the method of cutting branches and grafting, but are the soil in the transplanting place the same as the original? Is the climate the same as the original? These kinds of questions are all very important. Transplanting cold-zone plants to the tropics, although not impossible, is less than half as effective, and much of it is unnecessary. The people of Guangdong learn from Westerners to wear leather shoes, which causes a very special athlete's foot. This is not because their leather shoes are not well made and are not as good as Europeans and Americans. It is because the climate and humidity are different, and they should not imitate Europeans and Americans to wear leather shoes at all. Furthermore, the establishment of a culture has its own process. Because the starting points are different, even if they want to imitate each other, there is no way. People living in the east, west, south, and north of Mount Tai have the same purpose in visiting Mount Tai and climbing the Sunrise Peak to watch the sunrise, but because their starting points are different, the routes they take can be completely different in nature. The slope on the north side can be very steep, and the slope on the south side can be very gentle. On the east side, there can be a shop every three miles and a village every five miles, and there is no problem with food and accommodation; on the west side, it is not impossible to have dozens or hundreds of miles with almost no people, and there is a danger of freezing and starving without food. Whether it is allowed in practice for people in the East to use the experience of the West and people in the South to adopt the methods of the North is really a problem. Everyone easily admits that the nutrients in old corn porridge are not as good as milk. But how can China, which is densely populated and has no room to develop animal husbandry, obtain milk or milk substitutes? The development of social undertakings in Europe is to absorb the assets of different ethnic groups, first prosper the cities and then use the surplus power to prosper the rural areas. What methods can my country, which is in a semi-colonial state, copy the old articles of European countries to develop social undertakings? Most of the gentlemen who advocate complete Westernization are fascinated by the culture of Britain and the United States, but we must admit that the Russian culture, which is quite different in nature from the culture of Britain and the United States, is also an important branch of Western culture. Is complete Westernization to imitate Britain and the United States? Is it to imitate France and Germany? Is it to imitate the Soviet Union? They do not seem to have expressed it clearly. Even if there is an expression, there are many differences between their environment and China, whether it is Britain, the United States, France, Germany, or the Soviet Union. There must be many places to chisel a handle by copying other people's old articles. It is a matter of course that this road is still impassable. ——If it is said that there is a choice, then what does the word "complete" mean?

The third stage: It has freed itself from the shackles of old prejudices and also gotten rid of the shackles of any foreign prejudices. It tempers its own reason and allows it to develop as much as possible according to its own laws. It unconditionally accepts the harvest of human reason, which has gone through many hardships without stable national boundaries: the precise science of modern times, and constantly strives to make it continue to grow and increase. It puts the entire history of mankind, whether its own or others', on the same horizontal line, and uses extremely objective methods to study the causal relationship between these phenomena in order to determine its own future retention and abandonment. As a result of such careful selection, what will be retained in the future will inevitably be a mixture of old and new. At first glance, it may not be far from the method of advocating Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application. However, the viewpoint of that stage is to follow the law of social inertia, and reason is not used at all. The method of this stage is completely the result of the active use of reason and careful work. Therefore, the two are fundamentally heterogeneous and incompatible. They unconditionally accept the precise science of modern times, and from the outside, they may look quite like the advocacy of complete Westernization. But those who want to enjoy the same benefits as foreigners as much as possible, regardless of the current national economy and people's livelihood, always have a place to escape under the banner of complete Westernization: they will completely melt away after the radiance of reason or the sun of science, leaving no trace. As for the division of national essence and national dross, Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union, after the sunshine, they will also merge together without any trace. This kind of helpless attitude of letting reason attack directly alone is very difficult and requires long-term continuous effort. However, "if you have a nine-year illness, you should seek mugwort for three years; if you do not save it up, you will never get it in your life." Other detours seem close but are actually far away; following the right path of reason, it is rugged first and then smooth. This stage seems to have been stepped on the edge by my country's intellectual circles in recent years, but they have not been able to completely clarify their own consciousness, so other detours are still inevitable to seduce everywhere. I hope everyone will hurry up and recognize the path, and proceed firmly, bravely, and without hesitation. Then the future of my country's reform will take a bright and flat road, which is beyond doubt.

### Soaring Prices in Japan Cause Anxiety in People's Lives

Political Parties Advocate Budget Cuts

Mabashi Explains Financial Policy

[Tokyo] The parliament, which has reopened this time, will launch its debate on the unprecedented large budget at the outset. However, the government is concerned about the digestion of this large budget and the management of the yen exchange rate, so the market is confused, which promotes the sharp rise in domestic prices and completely overturns the stability of national life, which is the foundation of the current cabinet's political program. Even the political parties are gradually paying attention to the salary living problem in the face of high prices. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

[Tokyo] The central issues to be discussed in this parliament are diplomacy, increased taxes, state-owned electricity, and the extension of the education period. Political parties are also considering countermeasures on these issues. However, recently, the soaring prices and the people's anxiety about life have become a problem. In view of this fact, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties advocate active review, and the opinion on the budget plan is gradually becoming stronger, and a discussion on budget cuts has arisen. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

[Tokyo] Finance Minister Mabashi explained the content of his financial policy speech to be delivered at the beginning of the parliament at the cabinet meeting on the 15th and requested understanding. The main points are as follows:

(1) Explanation of the budget plan: The budget for the twelfth year of Showa places its emphasis on national defense expenses and the expenses for implementing important national policies. At the same time, it considers ways to increase revenue in terms of taxes and other aspects in order to promote national progress and strengthen finance. Therefore, it will implement the reorganization and renewal of the central and local tax systems and establish a system for the distribution of local finance. At the same time, it will pay close attention to the stability of national life and the promotion of industry and trade, and will fully consider the content of the budget to avoid becoming a so-called lopsided budget that overemphasizes national defense expenses.

(2) Content of the financial plan: The expenditure budget will inevitably continue to expand in the next few years. However, the increase in revenue generated by this tax increase and other plans this year, and the natural increase in revenue generated by the increase in national income, etc., can make up for the lack of revenue. It is inevitable that government bonds will have to be issued in the next few years. However, once the period of reduced national defense expenses arrives, the number of government bonds issued can also be reduced, so there will never be a danger to the financial foundation.

(3) The situation of the economic world: Recently, the state of industry and trade has been proceeding smoothly. However, regarding trade, there are many points to consider in terms of the import of raw materials and other matters in terms of the balance of international payments. Therefore, it will adopt a trade policy based on seeking reciprocity, revise the tariff system, and strengthen the exchange control law in order to ensure that there are no regrets.

### The 17th Extraordinary All-Russian Congress Opens

Will Approve the New Constitution

Kalin Presents Report

[Moscow] The 17th Extraordinary All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened today in the Kremlin here to approve the new Constitution of the Soviet Russian Republic. The congress was attended by 1,200 representatives from 24 regions and provinces, 14 autonomous republics, and 15 autonomous regions. When Stalin, Kalinin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Andreyev, Zhdanov, Sulimov, and other party and government leaders attended, the whole scene burst into warm applause, which lasted for a long time. Kalinin then presented a report. Yesterday, the entire Soviet Union once again listened to Stalin's historical report at the 8th Extraordinary All-Soviet Congress, because the report had been made into a sound film and broadcast on radio stations across the country. Hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, employees, and scientists in factories and collective farms across the country gathered in squares and in front of loudspeakers in apartments to listen carefully to the speech by the author of the new constitution. (TASS dispatch from the 15th)

### US Navy

New Battleship Construction

Most Elite in the World

[Washington] Senior naval officials announced today that the two new battleships that the United States is about to build are actually the most well-equipped warships in the world and are completely designed to meet the special needs of the United States. Britain and Japan are both island countries and must rely on their navies to protect maritime traffic and maintain the supply of food. Therefore, the speed of warships is an important condition. But the United States is different. Its navy is nothing more than protecting the first line of national defense. The equipment of the new battleships will be kept strictly secret. (National News dispatch from the 15th)

### Soviet Cultural Construction

[Moscow] According to records published by various newspapers, the work carried out by the Russian Republic on the cultural front in recent years has been exceptionally vast. In 1936, there were 106,000 schools throughout Russia, with over 17 million students. In the academic year 1935-1936, Soviet Russian universities had a total of over 329,000 students. The majority of students study using local dialects. There are approximately 6,500 newspapers throughout Russia, of which 457 are printed in languages other than Russian and in the languages of various ethnic groups. The total circulation of all newspapers reaches approximately 4.4 million copies. In 1935, a total of 31,441 books were published, of which approximately 5,000 were published in ethnic languages. As of October 1936, there were approximately 32,000 libraries throughout Russia, holding 76,915,000 volumes. Compared to 1923-1924, the number of libraries has increased fivefold. As of January 1, 1937, there were 494 theaters throughout Russia. In 1936, there were over 16,000 kindergartens and 114,000 nurseries. At the beginning of the same year, there were 14,788 hospitals throughout Russia, with over 350,000 beds. (TASS dispatch on the 15th)

### Spanish Rebels Suffer Setbacks, Germany and Italy Feel Uneasy

Mussolini and Göring Talk, Seeking a Way to Step Down?

[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Göring continued to discuss the issue of aiding the Spanish Nationalist forces today, and to study ways to expel the Red menace without endangering European peace. (Guomin dispatch on the 16th)

[Rome] Mussolini and Göring will continue their talks tomorrow and on Sunday. The discussions will largely concern the Spanish Civil War. It is heard that the Italians are quite uneasy about the failure of the Spanish Nationalist forces to advance directly into Madrid. Furthermore, the meeting between Mussolini and Göring will not bring about any changes to the existing political situation. As for the rumors that Göring's visit is intended to get Italy's tacit approval for Germany's invasion of Morocco, this has been denied by both sides. Italy's reply to the British proposal to ban volunteers from entering Spain will likely be submitted next week. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

[Rome] Regarding the matter of banning volunteers from going to Spain, the British government recently presented a new proposal to the governments of France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia, asking for their respective replies. It is learned that the Italian government's reply will be ready early next week. It is said that Prime Minister Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Göring exchanged views on this reply. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

[Rome] German Aviation Minister General Göring came here for consultations. Yesterday, he held two talks with Prime Minister Mussolini. According to German sources here, the talks yesterday did not result in any concrete decisions regarding the Spanish issue, and Germany does not need Italy to mediate to bring Britain and Germany closer together. Therefore, observers generally believe that the aim of Italy and Germany in forming a united front with Britain is merely to seek a dignified way out, so that Germany and Italy can step down from the hard-line stance they have taken on the situation in Spain. In addition, official sources are keeping silent about the details of the talks between Germany and Italy and are unwilling to comment. The Italian newspapers did not even report on the second talk between Mussolini and Göring yesterday evening. As for the German reporters accompanying Göring, they have all been ordered to minimize the information released regarding the political aspects of Göring's visit. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

### French Chamber of Deputies Authorizes Cabinet to Issue Order Banning Volunteers

Enlisting to Fight in Spain, Valid for Six Months

[Paris] Regarding the matter of banning volunteers from going to Spain, the Chamber of Deputies today unanimously passed the government's proposed bill with 591 votes to zero. The bill authorizes the government to issue orders at any time within six months to ban the recruitment of volunteers in France or their departure from France to enlist in Spain. Before the Chamber of Deputies voted, Prime Minister Léon Blum attended and gave a brief speech, stating that the British and French governments had repeatedly negotiated jointly with the governments of Germany, Italy, Russia, and Portugal, in order to have each country conclude an agreement to ban volunteers from going to Spain. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

### Spanish Rebels Fail to Attack Capital

Government Forces Advance

Madrid: The National Defense Committee recently issued a communique stating that the rebel forces recently concentrated all their efforts on the area of Arravaca and Las Rozas northwest of Madrid. As of today, government forces have advanced two kilometers in that area. Although the rebel forces have launched fierce attacks on the approaches to Madrid, especially the town of Carabanchel in the southern suburbs and the university area in the western suburbs, they have all been repelled by our forces. Some locations in the university area, which had been captured by the rebel forces for a long time, were recaptured by our forces today. However, there was heavy fog today, so the air force could not take off. In addition, General Miaja, Chairman of the National Defense Committee, told this agency's reporter that there have been no changes in the overall situation today. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

### British Secretary of Commerce Arrives in New York

Will Meet Roosevelt

[Washington] President Roosevelt's invitation to British Secretary of Commerce Runciman to visit the White House on January 23, the end of the week, has caused much discussion here today, as it is believed that the President may negotiate a British-American trade agreement with him. Runciman arrived in New York on Monday. (Guomin dispatch on the 15th)

[Washington] According to forecasts here today, British Secretary of Commerce Runciman will arrive in Washington next week and will meet with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. Although the authorities have not indicated whether Runciman is under orders to come here for negotiations, it is generally expected that Runciman will conduct informal trade and financial negotiations with the US authorities. The British cabinet is currently using Runciman's trip to learn about the US's attitude towards the above issues. The negotiation of a British-American commercial treaty will be the most complex of all the reciprocal commercial treaties completed by Hull. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

[London] The departure of Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, for the United States next Wednesday is of great interest to political and financial circles here, especially because British Secretary of Commerce Runciman is currently en route to the United States by sea. It is said that both will travel to Washington to discuss revisions to financial policy because the Anglo-French-American monetary agreement has failed to achieve the desired results. The rumor that a tripartite conference will be held in Washington is therefore very strong because French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet is a famous French financial expert. (Guomin dispatch on the 16th)

### British and French Fleets Hold Exercises Separately

In the Mediterranean and off the Coast of Africa from Today Until the End of February

[Paris] The entire French Atlantic Fleet, totaling thirty-eight ships, set sail today for the coast of West Africa to conduct annual exercises. The Mediterranean Fleet is also preparing to set sail from Toulon to the Gulf of Lion for joint maneuvers. (Guomin dispatch on the 15th)

Brest: The French Atlantic Fleet has departed from this port and is sailing towards the western coast of Africa. It is estimated that it will arrive off the coast of the Portuguese capital this Sunday, where it will conduct exercises. The theme is that a fleet consisting of the submarine supply ship Jules Verne and the second squadron of light warships will be attacked by the main fleet, with the participation of several large seaplanes of the Southern Cross type. It is scheduled to be completed at 2:00 PM on the 17th, and the fleet will immediately disperse and continue to advance towards West Africa. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

[London] The US Home Fleet is scheduled to depart on the 18th of this month for its annual voyage. It will meet with the Mediterranean Fleet in the port of Gibraltar. Some of the warships will sail to North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean to conduct visits. A mixed exercise will be held by warships from both fleets at the end of February. The British Home Fleet includes: (1) six battleships, (2) two aircraft carriers, (3) three cruisers, (4) two destroyers, as well as the fourth, fifth, and sixth destroyer squadrons, (5) the second submarine squadron, and (6) several other small warships. After these ships join the Mediterranean Fleet (which has five battleships, eight cruisers, thirty-one destroyers, six submarines, and twenty-six other warships), the British naval strength in the Mediterranean will be greatly increased.

[Berlin] The government has ordered all newspapers nationwide to reduce the paper they use by one-tenth in order to save wood for the manufacture of textile fibers and food (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

### Philippine Commerce Flourishes

Gold Production is Especially Abundant

[Manila] Major merchants here all expect this year's Philippine commerce to be excellent. The business community is unanimous in saying that all industries in the Philippines prospered last year. Gold mining is the most prominent feature. According to Mr. Balmaseda, president of the Chamber of Commerce, the prosperity of Philippine commerce in 1936 was one of the most satisfactory years in the history of commerce after the European War. In all twelve months of the year, various businesses were overwhelmed with business. Foreign trade was also one of the best in five years. Currency circulation is increasing daily. Domestic retail sales are soaring. Philippine-produced sugar, tobacco, abaca, etc. are selling well at home and abroad. Government tax revenue is very abundant. Passenger and cargo transportation is very prosperous. Bank lending is more relaxed than before. The most prosperous industry is gold mining. All sectors are investing in it. The amount of gold produced has increased greatly. In the first ten months of 1936, the total value of imports and exports increased by 33% compared to the same period last year. Exports increased by 46.5%. Sugar exports increased by 92%. Imports increased by 18%. Various manufactured goods made significant profits. Retail sales increased by 76%. The construction industry increased by 50%. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Detroit: According to John L. Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, the temporary solution to the General Motors strike is quite satisfactory. The terms stipulate that the striking workers occupying the factories must withdraw and negotiations for a permanent solution will be conducted. The outcome of the negotiations will inevitably recognize the status of the union. General Motors has also assured the union leaders that after the striking workers withdraw from the factories on Sunday, the two factories that have been closed will not resume work until the strike is resolved. However, the factories that have not been affected by this strike must continue small-scale production. The negotiations will last for two weeks. The above-mentioned temporary solution was decided after four hours of discussion between union leaders and General Motors representatives and then announced by Michigan Governor Murphy. It is heard that Labor Secretary Perkins was also present as an observer during the meeting. Labor and management have agreed to hold negotiations in Detroit and have set Monday to begin. The withdrawal of the striking workers occupying the factories is one of the prerequisites put forward by General Motors, saying that if this illegal conduct is not corrected, there is no need to continue negotiations.

### Northern and Southern Ireland Cannot Unite

British-Irish Talks Also Difficult to Agree On

[London] An official statement was issued today denying that the talks between Dominion Secretary Malcolm MacDonald and South Irish Free State President de Valera had discussed the unification of Ireland. At the same time, North Irish Prime Minister Viscount Craigavon announced in Belfast that the division of Northern and Southern Ireland was the only way. Thirty-two years ago, Norway split from Sweden. The past is almost entirely forgotten, without a trace. Ulster and Southern Ireland are now halfway through this era. In another sixteen years, both sides will live peacefully under their own governments. The boundary of Ulster must remain as it is today and must not be changed. The official statement on the talks between MacDonald and de Valera said that there are several outstanding issues between the South Irish Free State and Great Britain. The two discussed this time involved the talks. After the talks, a communiqué was issued stating that the discussion was purely informal and did not negotiate all issues. The two exchanged views at the time, so the talks were only an explanation. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

[London] It was reported that Dominion Secretary Malcolm MacDonald and South Irish Free State Executive Council President de Valera considered the possibility of merging the North Irish Ulster Province with the South Irish Free State during their talks yesterday. This statement was denied by officials, who said that no agreement would be reached between Britain and the South Irish Free State recently. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)

### Germany Bans Foreign Ships from Navigating the Kiel Canal

[Berlin] A naval communiqué announced today that foreign warships will no longer be allowed to freely navigate the Kiel Canal. If they wish to pass through the canal, they must first obtain permission from the German government. It has now notified the governments of the countries concerned of this matter. Officials claim that this step is not surprising, as it is actually a natural result of Germany's abandonment of the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles that controlled German waterways. According to the treaty, the canal became an international canal after the end of the European War. It is 61 miles long and approximately 29 feet deep. Construction began in 1887 and was opened to navigation in June 1895. However, the entire project was not fully completed until July 1914. The Kiel naval mutiny in the late stages of the war was a precursor to the collapse of the German Empire. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

### Japanese Side Increases Establishment of Special Service Agencies in China

Widely Established in Seven Provinces, Work Intensified, Army and Navy Have a Total of Twenty-Two Locations

Tianjin Correspondence: Since the second half of last year, Japanese special service agencies have been established all over the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, and the various banners of Inner Mongolia. As of the current time this year, these special service agencies have gradually developed towards the provinces of Henan and Anhui on both sides of the Yellow River. The recent cracking of the Zhengzhou special service agency is one example. According to what has been heard here, the Japanese special service agencies have all been strengthened and expanded this year. Each agency has three sections: investigation and intelligence, foreign affairs. The number of staff depends on the importance of the location, ranging from fourteen or fifteen to more than twenty. In places such as Pingjin, Beiping, Suiyuan, and Tongzhou, where affairs are complicated, there are also deputy chiefs of special service agencies. The formal staff are all military personnel. There are also so-called temporary agency members, who are mostly employed by seeking suitable candidates for their planned use and paying them special fees. Those who are hired in this way are mostly idle soldiers and politicians. Therefore, it is not known exactly how many people are serving in each special service agency. After the September 18th Incident, diplomacy in North China lost its normal track. The leaders on the Japanese side are mostly special service agencies. Therefore, under the evolution, this kind of military secret work organization that openly operates within the territory has become particularly developed. Eventually, our diplomatic targets also have to treat them as counterparts, gradually becoming a situation under the illegal negotiation and control of the other party. After the rectification of the special service agencies this year, in addition to being directly under the jurisdiction of the military headquarters in the area where they are stationed, they are also closely connected with each other. They strive to transmit news quickly and exchange all information with each other. At the same time, if there are important matters, they are directly telegraphed to the army headquarters in Tokyo. From this, it can be seen that their work is becoming more advanced. The deployment of Japanese special service agencies north of the Yellow River is roughly as follows: A. Belonging to the Kwantung Army: (1) Chief of Puzhou Agency: Lieutenant Colonel Shigeki Hosoki; (2) Chief of Beishi Agency: Major Asano; (3) Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama stationed in Shanhaiguan; (4) Colonel Mutō stationed in Gabusi (former employee Nakajo Yoshichika was dismissed); (5) Major Ueyama stationed in Doron; (6) Major Kuwahara stationed in Zhangbei; (7) Captain Yokota stationed in Ejina Banner; (8) Major Takahashi stationed in Tianjin; (9) Captain Inoue stationed in Pingliang; (10) Captain Kimura stationed in Qinghai. B. Belonging to the North China Garrison Army: (1) Major Shigekawa stationed in Tianjin; (2) Colonel Matsui stationed in Beiping; (3) Major Ueno stationed in Tongzhou; (4) Lieutenant Colonel Kawano stationed in Taiyuan; (5) Major Ishino stationed in Jinan; (6) Major Taniodi stationed in Qingdao; (7) Major Ōmoto stationed in Zhangjiakou; (8) Lieutenant Colonel Hayama stationed in Suiyuan. C. Belonging to the Navy: (1) Colonel Kubota stationed in Tianjin; (2) Lieutenant Colonel Kuwahara stationed in Beiping; (3) Major Sato stationed in Qingdao. D. Belonging to the Puppet Manchukuo: Captain Matsuoka stationed in Tianjin. The above four types of special service agencies number as many as twenty-two. The ones that are planned to be established but have not yet been determined are not counted. A moment of meditation will reveal the intentions of the Japanese side and the impact on our diplomacy, politics, and military.

### Shantou Discovers Suspected White Russian Spies

Brought Their Own Car from Guangzhou to Shantou  Disguised as Medicine Sellers, Secretly Drawing Maps  Three Individuals Currently Detained in Shantou

Shantou Dispatch:  For several days, foreign vagrants have been infiltrating the coastal areas of Chaozhou and Shantou. Recently, these vagrants were replaced by White Russians who have resided in the north for a long time.  They are conducting espionage work to avoid attracting our country's attention. On the morning of the 8th of this month, three White Russians traveled from Guangzhou City in their own car, number 2392, along the first arterial road of the province, passing through Huiyang, Haifeng, Lufeng, Huilai, Puning, Chaoyang, and arriving in Shantou.  They stayed in Room 51 of the Yongping Hotel and wandered around, inquiring about the addresses of military and political organizations.  They even inquired at the 12th Police Precinct about the location of the highest administrative body. The precinct chief immediately sent a policeman to guide them to the municipal government. However, the White Russians suddenly declined the police escort and requested that a young boy be sent instead. This aroused the suspicion of the Second Precinct.  The precinct chief, Chang Wan, subsequently led officers to inspect various inns, preventing criminals from infiltrating during the winter defense period and disturbing local public order.  They learned that the three White Russians were staying at the Yongping Hotel, and the registration card bore the name "Hirao Na."  The police officers immediately entered Room 51 to inspect. The White Russians initially resisted, but the police officers, in order to implement the winter defense martial law, stipulated that all suspicious individuals must be inspected to maintain public order. During the search of the White Russians' luggage, multiple privately drawn maps of the coastal topography of Jieyang, Puning, Liusha, Chaoyang, Huilai, Shantou, and other places were discovered.  After discovering these maps, the precinct chief, considering the seriousness of the suspected international espionage case, telephoned Xiong Xiaji, the chief of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Division, and Wu Zhuoyou, the director of public relations, requesting that they come to the Yongping Hotel to conduct a detailed investigation and determine the truth. According to the White Russians, they came to Shantou in their own car for the purpose of selling medicine along the highway and had no other intentions or missions.  As for the maps they drew, they claimed it was just a casual game. However, their words were hardly credible. Furthermore, among the three individuals, two carried expired passports, and one had no passport at all.  Moreover, the medicines they were selling were not well-known in the market and had not been inspected and registered by the government. Shantou Mayor Huang Bingxun, considering the importance of the matter, personally accompanied Wu Ciyan, the head of the Health Department, and medical officer Li Xi to inspect the medicines.  Moreover, since the White Russians were not doctors or nurses and were selling medicine along the way in their own car while carrying a complete set of medical equipment, this point was indeed highly suspicious. Whether their medicines were related to germ warfare was currently being tested. The three White Russians and their car have been placed under surveillance by detectives, and they are not allowed to move freely. If no other significant circumstances are found, the three White Russians will be deported.  All sectors of society in Chaoshan are paying close attention to this suspected espionage case, as a few years ago, there were rumors of someone poisoning a well.  These three White Russians, posing as medicine sellers, are certainly no ordinary people.

### Songjiang Issues Wanted Notice for Major Robbery Suspects

Zhang Shanzheng and his younger brother, Shancheng, residents of three households, third Jia, Sixth Bao, Nantang Township, Eighth District, Punan, live adjacent to each other. Their family is considered wealthy, attracting the attention of bandits. Around You time last night, more than twenty bandits suddenly arrived, armed with rifles, box guns, pistols, iron rods, and speaking in a strange accent. They broke into the house, forbidding the residents from making any noise, and ransacked the premises for about two hours before making off with their loot. It is reported that Zhang Shanzheng suffered losses of 475 yuan in legal tender, two pearl hairpins, a gold watch, cotton clothing, and dozens of pieces of silk fabric. Zhang Shancheng suffered losses of 3,611 yuan in legal tender, 574 yuan in silver dollars, a pair of gold bangles, gold and silver jewelry, more than two hundred pearls, pearl earrings, two leather suitcases, cotton clothing, and dozens of other items.

### Suzhou Precinct Police Officer Murdered Late at Night

At Xingqiaogou, outside Yanmen, at around 10:00 PM on the 15th, a person wearing a gray uniform knocked on the door of the Tongxing rickshaw shop, requesting four jiao in small silver coins. Because it was late at night, there was no response to the knocking. At that time, Li Xinfu, a guard stationed at the third branch of the third precinct of the Public Security Bureau, told the person that it was late and that they could come back tomorrow. This angered the person, who immediately pulled out a kitchen knife and began slashing at the officer's head and other parts of his body. The officer was stabbed more than ten times, severely wounded, and collapsed in a pool of blood. The assailant, realizing the severity of the situation, fled the scene. After the incident was discovered, the officer was rushed to Jin Yong Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Gu, after examination, the officer died at 3:00 PM on the 16th due to excessive blood loss and his life was hopeless. The Public Security Bureau is conducting a thorough investigation to apprehend the perpetrator and file a case for prosecution. Although the cause of the murder is as described above, the Chang Bureau believes that the full details may be more complicated.

### Nanhui Gang of Bandits Attempt to Rob Funds, Injuring Four People

Du Nanzhu, a farmer in the southeast of Cangzhen, Second District, received more than 300 yuan in society funds the day before yesterday. That night, six or seven bandits broke into his house, tied up his entire family, and threatened him to hand over the money. Because Du refused to comply, he was stabbed by the bandits, injuring four people. Neighbors then sounded the alarm, and the bandits fled. At that time, members of the water security patrol team were patrolling and, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene. They encountered a person who appeared flustered and arrested him. The woman Du identified him as one of the bandits present at the scene. He was taken to the county for interrogation yesterday.

Those who fail to complete the collection will be summoned and forcibly pursued without leniency.

### Another Robbery Occurs in Changshu City

Recently, robberies have been occurring frequently in this city. The day before yesterday, Yue Hui, posing as a military officer, brazenly brandished a gun and robbed people in the bustling downtown area. The perpetrator is currently being tried by the military division stationed here. Unexpectedly, last night, the home of Li Sunyu at No. 45 Lihai River outside Nandou was also robbed by bandits. There were only three bandits. They first knocked on the door of the Li residence when it was not yet late at night. Zhang Daizhi went out to open the door, and the bandits went straight in. A seemingly knowledgeable person first went to the kitchen to get a kitchen knife and then entered the inner room, demanding that the mistress, Li Xu, hand over the keys. When she initially refused, she was repeatedly slashed in the face with the knife, resulting in four wounds. Her left eye protruded, and her nose was severed, causing her to collapse from severe injuries. The bandits then arbitrarily looted the home, taking a gold bracelet, a gold ring, and more than 1,300 yuan in legal tender. After about half an hour, the bandits packed up and left. Afterwards, the victims reported the incident to the authorities, requesting an investigation, but no one was apprehended. The injured mistress was sent to Jishan Hospital the next morning. Due to her advanced age, she is still in critical condition.

### Changzhou Conducts General Re-investigation of Opium and Drug Offenders

### Muyang Captures Large Number of Traitors

In the first ten days of this month, the county government received a secret report that many traitors were hiding outside the city, intending to launch a violent uprising. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Qi Lunjie immediately dispatched hundreds of security guards, police officers, and community members to guard the urban areas and conduct a thorough search. In the residence of a traitor named Ye outside the city, more than 20 accomplices and more than 1,000 yuan in legal tender were seized and handed over to the county government for safekeeping.

### Hangzhou Allocates Funds to Relieve Bandit Disaster

The Zhejiang Provincial Disaster Relief Committee has allocated 4,000 yuan each to Taishun and Suichang counties in the border region to relieve the bandit disaster. However, due to the unresolved bandit situation in the area, the funds were delayed for several months. Now, after repeated urging, the distribution has been largely completed. Furthermore, Changhua County was captured by bandits last month, and the homes of the residents in the county seat were burned, resulting in significant losses. The provincial government has decided to allocate 30,000 yuan to the Civil Affairs Department to formulate a distribution plan and send personnel to jointly investigate and distribute the funds to aid the disaster victims.

### Ningbo Putuo Apprehends Suspected Traitor

Wang Deliao, from Heishan County, Liaoning, arrived at Putuo by boat from the port on the afternoon of the 11th. Upon landing, he immediately unfurled a white cloth flag with the words "Sincerely Vowing, South Sea Jin Qiao" written on it. He was about to enter the Quanqian Temple to worship when he was noticed by someone in the reception hall of the temple, who found his actions suspicious. They questioned him, but his answers were evasive. They sent him to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched officers to inspect his bag and small box. In his blue cloth bag, four small wooden tablets, each less than ten inches wide, were found, seemingly for the purpose of disguise. The bureau sent him to the county government for interrogation, after which he was sent to the Ningbo Garrison Command for further investigation.

Rotting Corpse Found on Hongxing Steamer

On the afternoon of the 11th, the new Hongxing steamer of the Daxing Shipping Company, located on the Binjiang Road in this port, sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo. At around 2:00 AM, Wu Songling, a fireman, was collecting coal in the coal bunker when he suddenly discovered a human leg in the pile of coal. He was greatly startled and immediately screamed. His colleagues reported to the first mate, Huang Rongsheng, who dug out the body of a man, about twenty years old, from the coal pile. He was wearing a cotton-padded jacket and trousers, covered by a blue cloth shirt and trousers, and running shoes. The body was rotting, emanating a foul odor, and his face was blurred. The cause of death was likely due to being crushed while secretly hiding in the coal pile. The next morning, after the steamer entered the port, it was reported to the customs, which sent a doctor to examine the body. After confirming that he had been crushed to death, the body was taken ashore after anchoring and reported to the court for examination and a coffin.

### Jiaxing Chunli Seeds No Longer a Problem

The planned amount of spring silkworm seeds for Jiaxing this year, including mountain silkworm and mulberry area changes, is a total of 359,000 sheets. The money has been collected and handed over to the county for transfer. Currently, due to the system of control, only 160,000 sheets have been issued, with a shortage of 100,000 sheets. There will inevitably be disputes when distributing the silkworm tags. Cao Xianzhang and Yu Dajing, representatives from the County Agricultural Association, and Zhu Zhenfan, Yuan Lianpeng, and Chen Jingxian, representatives from the silk cocoon industry, went to the province to petition yesterday. Luo Yinxia, a member of the Provincial Government, met with them and promised to provide a solution to make up the shortage of silkworm seeds. The petitioning representatives requested the number of silkworm seeds be increased.

Poor Environment Causes Flour Market to Decline Steadily

Down More Than 2.5 Jiao in Half a Month  Down 4 Jiao Compared to Highest Price Earlier This Year

Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for all months uniformly plunged. Because the Chicago wheat market report for foreign wheat showed small fluctuations and an uncertain trend, the market price declined due to poor exports. Foreign wheat floating was mostly settled, and the foreign wheat market showed weakness, resulting in a drop of 0.25 to 1.135, while the national currency continued to decline by 0.13. Canadian wheat declined by 0.5 Jiao in the near term and 0.2 Jiao in the long term. Therefore, after the opening price, foreign wheat prices fell continuously, and the market environment became extremely poor again. Most of the outside capital of public companies could no longer support the floating, and they could no longer hold on, so the opening price drop was fierce, dropping 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 fen compared to the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the trend had already been established, and the bulls were weak and forced to retreat step by step. The lowest price for this month fell below the 4 yuan mark, with the lowest being 3.57 yuan. February also reached 4 yuan, with a difference of 6 or 7 fen compared to the previous day. This situation was purely due to the fact that the actual sales were inactive, and the floating forces were no match for the actual chips of the manufacturers, so they were naturally killed. There was nothing they could do. In the past half month, the decline in each month has reached 0.25 to 0.27 or 0.8 Jiao. Compared to the highest price earlier this year, it has fallen by almost 4 Jiao.

Hoarding Wheat is Difficult

Continuous Rises Turn Into Steady Declines

Yesterday, the wheat futures market also saw a consistent and disastrous decline in all months after the market opened in the morning. Because the foreign wheat price continued to ease and decline, and domestic flour sales stagnated invisibly due to the high prices, and because the flour market had already declined, the wheat market price could not but follow suit. Therefore, the opening prices for all months uniformly fell by 0.5, 0.6 fen to 0.1 Jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, the actual wheat market also showed an odd easing, and the decline in the flour market worsened, causing the asking price for each month to fall by another 0.3, 0.5, or 0.6. Since last year, prices have risen continuously without any signs of reversal, but the actual situation has now changed significantly. Therefore, those who hoard and speculate are also caught off guard. In the actual wheat market, because the standard has declined again, the asking price has fallen by about 0.1 Jiao. Six yuan, four Jiao, and six fen was opened for Susu and Bengbu wheat. Jiangbei wheat was opened for six yuan, three Jiao, and nine fen, a total of more than 8,000 bags that were processed by various factories.

Sales of Ke Xian Rice Were Not High Yesterday

Yesterday, the digestion of Ke Xian rice was quiet again. The total number of transactions for the day was less than 1,000 bags, while the Yangtze River source was from 13,000 to 20,000 bags per day. Because Guangdong assistance lacked ships and suspended operations, only Shantou responded to more than 1,000 bags. Xiamen embellished more than 200 bags. This street's transport department was also watching and not moving forward. Hoarders were completely inactive. Only 1,327 bags of Jiangxi rice, 400 bags of Yongyuan rice, and 200 bags of Siam rice were opened in the unified market. The market price was slightly lower than the previous day, ranging from 0.1 Jiao to more than 0.1 Jiao.

Downriver Rice Trading Not Smooth

Hupan Mostly Small, Ranging from a Few Fen to One Jiao

[South Shanghai] Yesterday, there were a total of 40-odd sources from various gangs, totaling 8,700 or 8,800 shi of goods. Among them, thin rice accounted for 24 or 25 sources. The market remained normal and sluggish. The Tianjin Qingyan and other gangs collectively processed 2,500 to 2,600 bags of thin rice. The thin rice market showed no honor or disgrace. The route for thick Japonica rice was more sluggish, and the price varied by a few fen. The market outlook seemed to lack change.

The Dead End of Silver

India Will Levy Import Tax on Silver Ingots  Roosevelt is Tired of Silver Policy  Silver Prices Will Only Continue to Fall

London, 15th (Reuters) - London silver traders expect the last shipment of silver to be loaded onto the Bombay-bound mail ship on February 4, to arrive before the Indian budget is discussed. After this shipment departs, silver prices will continue to fall. It is widely believed that India is the main supporter of the current silver market. However, there are rumors that the Indian government will levy a silver import tax to reduce the budget deficit. Therefore, the Indian silver import rate may not be sustainable. A total of 5 million ounces of silver were shipped to Bombay last week. London's current reserves are only 3 million ounces, the lowest record in the past two or three years. There are also rumors in Washington that President Roosevelt is tired of the silver purchasing plan because the ratio of gold to silver of three to one is difficult to achieve. It is heard that pro-silver legislators will be satisfied if the price of newly mined domestic silver is maintained at 77.75 cents per ounce.

The Central Bank's official exchange rate revealed that the British and American currencies were both flat, the customs gold unit narrowed by 0.3 fen, and the standard gold price fell to 1,151.3 yuan.

### Securities

Government Bonds Break the Dull Situation

Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange evening market and bond market conditions shifted from dull to bright. The market sentiment was quite firm, and large investors were very enthusiastic about buying. Counter chips tended to be tight again. Many small investors also poured in to hedge and float short. The evening market became lively, and market prices slowly increased. Due to the excitement of people's hearts, there was a promising trend. The long-term opening of the Fuxing public bond was up by one yuan, to 74 yuan. However, those who inquired were still scarce. At the opening yesterday morning, the 115th, etc. were buying quite a bit. Most of the small investors were actively hedging, and the market prices all tended to rise by 5 fen to 0.2 Jiao. Only the Dingzhong long-term was slightly weak by 5 fen. The second round market conditions still showed an increase. The 43rd and 38th, etc. increased their appetite. The 23rd was heavily hedged.

### Yarn Flower

Multiple Parties Holding Firm, Recent Yarn Market Slightly Higher

Future Depends on Actual Sales

The yarn market is trending weak, with the decline in forward contracts rekindled. However, recent months have seen multiple parties holding firm, creating a slightly higher momentum. But the decline in Osaka's Sampin cotton yarn is unsettled, and at the same time, sales of spot yarn are sluggish, with short sellers unusually active. Market prices are therefore decreasing step by step. The future will depend on demand. As spring fabrics sell briskly, the situation for fine yarn is increasingly solid, while the condition of combed yarn is very weak.

Forward Contracts for Marked Yarn Continue to Decline. At the opening of the marked yarn market, near-term contracts saw a slight increase because large players were absorbing chips and holding them firm, supporting the market. This prompted the Sampin yarn market to decline step by step, softening sentiment. In addition, sluggish spot yarn sales lacked excitement, so the market structure shifted back to near-high and far-low. However, trading in the market was unusually thin. The result was that near-term contracts were up five cents from the previous day's close, and far-term contracts were up 2.8 cents. At the afternoon opening, Sampin yarn still fell from the morning close. In addition, spot yarn business was slow, and bulls were selling off. Changfeng sold in large quantities. Near-term prices were still high, but far-term prices softened and continued to decline. The result was that all months fell by 0.3 to 1.23 yuan compared to the morning close. It was found that Jinchang sold 1,150 bales, Mingde 600 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,800 bales, Chengji 1,100 bales, Yuan Yi 1,650 bales, Fukang 650 bales, and Runkang 500 bales. Yuda bought 900 bales, Juxing 600 bales, Senkang 1,300 bales, Shenji 700 bales, Dachangcheng 1,000 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, Xincheng 800 bales, Hexing 500 bales, and Renfeng 450 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.

Fine Yarn Enters Inland Areas Exclusively. Sales of spot yarn are average, but the domestic trade in fine yarn futures is particularly strong. It was found that a total of 1,156 bales were traded throughout the day. Prices were flat for yarn, up 3 yuan, with the following purchases by various domestic groups:

Cotton Futures Lack Excitement

Bulls and Bears Struggle to Sell. Trading in the Market is Sluggish.

The cotton market is weak because overseas cotton markets are uniformly trending downward, dampening sentiment. In addition, the yarn market is retreating, and the market situation is becoming softer. Demand from spot cotton mills has also stagnated, but sellers in various producing areas are reluctant to loosen prices, and bulls have not yet shown signs of giving up.

Price Fluctuations for Marked Cotton are Also Very Narrow. The market situation for marked cotton is unusually quiet, with no excitement at all. Bulls and bears are struggling. However, the overseas Indian Jiang cotton market is uniformly declining, but the market has not been affected. Trading in the market is quiet, and fluctuations are very small. The result was that all months rose or fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day's close. At the afternoon opening, the yarn market rebounded slightly, and there was still no good news from foreign cotton. There were many short covering settlements. This month broke through the 3 yuan mark. The result was that all months fell by 0.15 to 0.35 yuan compared to the morning close. It was found that Changfeng sold 6,500 dan, Fengtai 1,500 dan, Tongji 3,000 dan, Dafeng 1,000 dan, Daji 1,000 dan, Gengfeng 2,500 dan, Taichang 1,000 dan, Runkang 4,400 dan, Fukang 2,400 dan, Yuanyu Chang 3,600 dan, and Changhe 1,100 dan. Yikang bought 12,900 dan, Yuan Yi 1,000 dan, Chengji 1,000 dan, Changxing 1,800 dan, Yuda 1,400 dan, Jinchang 1,200 dan, Taixing 1,800 dan, Changji 1,700 dan, Xiecheng 2,300 dan, Shengyuan 1,300 dan, and Jinkang 1,400 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.

Many Bulls in the American Cotton Market Are Closing Positions

There is Concern About the Government Selling Stockpiled Cotton

Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, the Liverpool market was firm. Merchants had a favorable view of labor strikes and foreign political situations. Dealers and foreign groups bought, and prices rose. However, the public believed that the government's sale of stockpiled cotton would disrupt the market, and confidence was reduced. Later, many one-month contracts were closed out because today was the last trading day for January contracts. Brokerages and foreign groups rebalanced. New Orleans was selling, and prices fell back. Fortunately, dealers bought to settle prices, and resistance was still good. Finally, short covering led to frequent purchases by dealers, and the market turned stable. Spot prices rose 3 points, and futures fell 10 points to rise 3 points. British cotton spot prices were unchanged, and orders rose one point. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by mainland merchants and exporters, but later softened due to selling by Japanese merchants and short sellers. Pingguo fell 1.25 to 1.75 rupees, Oumula fell 1.5 to 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 1 to 1.25 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (telegram of the 15th).

The Downward Trend of Sampin Yarn and Cotton Has Not Abated

Osaka, 16th: Sampin cotton yarn futures fell 1.4 to 3.9 yuan. Near-term contracts are 272.5 yuan, and far-term contracts are 254 yuan. Cotton futures fell 0.35 to 0.5 yuan. Near-term contracts are 73.95 yuan, and far-term contracts are 76.6 yuan.

The Tianjin Yarn Industry Makes Substantial Profits

In 1936, the Tianjin cotton yarn industry made substantial profits. Market prices were favorable in the first half of the year. Fine yarn earned more than 40 yuan per bale. For example, 10-count coarse yarn was 188 yuan in the first half of the year, but reached 237 yuan in the second half. 16-count yarn rose from 217 yuan to 274 yuan. 32-count yarn rose from 275 yuan to 355 yuan. 42-count yarn initially cost 342 yuan, but reached 410 yuan in the second half. This rise was unprecedented in recent years. Especially between summer and autumn, yarn mills secretly reduced production due to empty cotton reserves. Market demand was strong, but supply was exhausted, and the market became increasingly firm. Although sentiment initially weakened with the launch of Changxin cotton, it ultimately trended upward due to active spot sales. In addition, labor strikes in Qingdao and other places provided opportunities for further increases. Therefore, most players profited greatly throughout the year. Although short sellers suffered losses, the largest profits ranged from 400,000 yuan to 35,000 yuan.

### Piece Goods

Cotton Cloth Merchants Stockpiling for the New Year

Trading in Spring Fabrics is Very Brisk

The cotton cloth market has become increasingly relaxed in Shanghai due to the continuous decline in the Sampin yarn market, especially the drop in spot yarn. White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill continue to fall by about 0.05 yuan per piece. Native cloth and coarse twill are still sluggish. Shanshang is stable. Heavy coarse cloth has changed due to news of military uniforms being procured. The market situation has changed, and the decline has stopped. All kinds of grey fabrics, such as spring-selling satin, poplin, stripe bleached cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth, are being actively prepared. A large amount of futures for February and March have been transacted one after another, resulting in a strong demand for raw materials, such as 42-count, 60-count, and 80-count fine thread. Yarn mills are unable to supply enough, and thread prices are expensive. The spring futures market is increasingly firm. Current goods, such as serge, real thread wool, and dark-colored printed goods, were initially feared to be out of season, and market prices were weakening, but they have now rebounded. Customers from Shandong, Jiangxi, Hankou, Sichuan, and other provinces are increasing their intentions, especially the Chongqing group in Sichuan. Floral goods, such as blue cloth, grey twill, and drill, are also being absorbed in quantities of 300 to 400 pieces. The Ningbo group in Zhejiang is also purchasing coarse cloth, thread wool, serge, and printed goods in quantities of more than 500 pieces, all because the market is firm, and futures are expensive. They are stockpiling for the New Year.

There Are Many Orders for Woolens

Spot trading of woolens has gradually decreased due to the nearing of the end of the line. Only sporadic purchases are being made by various parties on this street for immediate use. Because there are not many stocks in other cities, the market is still firm. However, the order business of foreign firms is very prosperous. A large number of goods sold in summer, autumn, and winter, such as Palace, Flannel, Tricotine, Melton, Gabardine, overcoat wool, women's wool, Habilene, and flat thick wool, have been ordered. Shanghai's British, German, American, and Polish firms have all placed considerable orders. Japanese firms, such as Daifuku, Yiki, Mitsui, Iwai, and Tamaya, have also placed many orders. Spring goods, such as light flannel and serge, have not been delivered in time by ship, so except for Japanese goods, no Western goods have been ordered. Because heavy serge in Hailin involves national loans, orders from colleagues have been greatly reduced.

### Silk and Tea

Japanese Rayon Imports Continue

Japanese rayon continues to be imported. Yesterday, the Asama Maru brought 1,500 bales, and today the Seiyo Maru arrived in Shanghai with another 960 bales, scheduled to be unloaded at the Toyo Company pier warehouse (ie, the Mitsubishi warehouse).

### Sugar Market

Huizhou White Rises Sharply

Yesterday, the sugar market trended stable. The guild's price was 23.3 yuan for spot 24 coarse sugar, unchanged. Transit goods were 7.85 yuan, with transactions, up 0.05 yuan. Dongyou No. 4 spot was 23.4 yuan, and No. 8 transit goods were 8.1 yuan, both up 0.1 yuan. TM Mark was 7.95 yuan, up 0.05 yuan. There were no other changes. The factory's refined white sugar, Zhenji No. 1, was 22.2 yuan, with the remainder following the retreat. Cantonese groups offered hundreds of packages of Huizhou white, with the Ding Shang Bai character at 21.8 yuan and the Shi character at 21.4 yuan. Because of the rise in coarse white sugar and the scarcity of arrivals, prices rose by 1.6 to 1.7 yuan compared to the previous price. Chaoqing's original price slightly increased. It is heard that although the production price has not risen further, there is no possibility of a loosening in the short term.

### North-South Goods

Black Melon Seeds Rise Sharply

Both Local and Inland Areas are Active. Dealers are Also Starting to Buy.

Recently, black melon seeds have been actively traded in both local and inland areas. Dealers see that stocks are dwindling and are also buying, in addition to new buyers, so the rise is very strong. The recent market price for Jikui seeds has reached 26.6 to 26.7 yuan, Xuzhou Tizhuang seeds are 25.5 yuan, higher-quality Xuikui seeds are 25 to 24.5 yuan, and Mingguang seeds are 22 to 21.5 yuan. In turn, they have also risen. The increase has already been 2 to 3 yuan. In terms of stock levels, it is indeed difficult for the market to loosen in the future. It is expected that there will be another rise in the spring market, and the estimated price should be in the range of 30 yuan, with a straight upward trend.

Orchid Seeds Rise by 2 to 3 Yuan

Recently, orchid seeds have been scarce and there is considerable demand, so the posted price has suddenly risen. Higher-quality goods have risen by 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous price. Posted goods are sold as soon as they arrive, and dealer stocks are also limited. If there are special yellow and bright goods in the next batch, they may rise further.

### Metals

The London Metal Market Shows Signs of Loosening

However, the Copper and Zinc Markets Remain Firm

According to a Reuters report from London on the 15th, a large number of profit-taking settlements occurred in the copper, lead, and bismuth markets, and all markets loosened. Rubber opened, and news of progress in the American strike kept prices firm, but they softened slightly. Cocoa was initially firm but ultimately weak. Prices are as follows: Spot copper is selling for 53 pounds, down 0.03125. March futures are selling for 53 pounds, down 0.0375. Lead is 27 pounds 0.06875, down 0.04375. March futures are 27 pounds 0.0625, down 0.04375. Zinc is 22 pounds 0.05625, down 0.0625. March futures are 22 pounds 0.075, down 0.0625. Spot rubber is bid at 10 pounds 0.08125, down 0.0125, and offered at 10 pounds 0.0875, down 0.0125.

According to a Reuters report from London on the 13th, the copper market opened weak but then turned firm. Although restrictions were lifted, there was not much of an impact. The zinc market was quite firm due to frequent increases in demand from speculators.

### Citizens' Association of the Special District Telegraphed to Request Severe Punishment of Traitors in the Zhengzhou Case

Order All Provincial, Municipal, and County Governments to Strictly Prevent and Control

File a Serious Protest with Japan and Effectively Stop It

According to the New Voice Society, the Zhengzhou Japanese ronin conspiracy to riot has aroused national indignation. The 76th, 27th, 38th, and other district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Association of Shanghai jointly sent a letter to the General Association yesterday morning, requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Government, ordering all provincial and municipal governments to strictly prevent and control the situation to prevent chaos from breaking out. The original letter stated, "Respectfully, on the 5th of this month, the Zhengzhou First District Commissioner's Office cracked a case of Japanese ronin endangering the Republic of China's institutions at No. 9 Tongshang Lane and arrested the traitor Long Tian and Japanese ronin Shiga, Yamaguchi, Tanaka, etc. After personal interrogation by Commissioner Ruan, it was learned from the traitor Zhao that certain foreign ronin were disturbing and conspiring against our country, colluding with more than 1,000 Liu Guitang bandits lurking in the mountains of Yuxian County, secretly plotting riots, sabotaging transportation, robbing express trains, and arranging for more than 100 ronin to come to Zhengzhou to set up drug sales agencies and take the opportunity to riot. The evidence and witnesses are completely conclusive and deplorable. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese authorities have wantonly invaded our country, conspired to sabotage it, spread rumors, and incited violence, using every means possible. This incident in Zhengzhou fully exposes their ambition for aggression. They are using armed force to threaten us and are also encouraging ronin to lurk in the hinterland and secretly plot sabotage. Their purpose is to annex our country. We request that the Association quickly forward this matter to the Central Government, ordering all provincial and municipal governments to strictly prevent and control the situation to prevent chaos from breaking out, and instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a serious protest and effectively stop it. Traitors who participated in the conspiracy should be severely punished to serve as a warning. This is our earnest plea."

### U.S. Consular Police Arrests Drug Offender

American Pitt Salt

According to a translation from the Times by an overseas news agency, an American named Pitt Salt was arrested by the U.S. Consular Police for vagrancy and is currently being held in the Ward Road Gaol. He may soon be handed over to the U.S. Court for trial. Prior to the arrest, the U.S. Consular Police had received numerous complaints alleging that he was begging along Nanjing Road and its vicinity. It is said that the suspect is a habitual drug user who has been arrested multiple times on drug charges along the Pacific coast. The U.S. Consular Police in this port received these arrest records from the Washington Crime Investigation Bureau. The reporter immediately investigated the outcome of this case. According to Consul General Fairbanks, the Chinese authorities are rigorously enforcing the anti-drug campaign, and the U.S. Court is willing to cooperate fully in cases involving American nationals. Most of the drug offenders from our country are peddlers who actively encourage people to buy and use drugs to further their trade, posing a major threat to both the morality and economy of society. It is reported that the suspect was arrested on March 5th of the year before last and sentenced to ninety days of imprisonment, which he served at the Xiamen Road Gaol. The sentence was terminated when the suspect left China. At that time, the suspect agreed to be transferred to Manila, but later returned to Shanghai.

### German Cruiser Emden to Arrive in Shanghai on the Second of Next Month

German Officials and Residents in Shanghai Prepare a Grand Welcome; One-Week Stay Includes Public Tours

To enhance diplomatic relations with China, Germany has dispatched the cruiser "Emden" to visit China. According to news received by German officials and residents in Shanghai, the ship carries a crew of 700 and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the second of next month. It will be berthed between buoys No. 3 and No. 4 off the Gonghexiang Wharf. German officials and residents in Shanghai are preparing a grand welcome and have arranged a schedule: a banquet will be held at the Race Club at 7:30 PM on the 2nd; the Hitler Youth will host a reception at 3:00 PM on the 3rd; the German Amateur Association will stage "America's Luck" at the Lyceum Theatre on the evenings of the 3rd and 4th; the entire crew will take a special train to Suzhou for sightseeing on the 4th and return to Shanghai that evening; German residents will tour the ship on the afternoon of the 4th; German children will visit on the 5th; and a dance will be held at the German Garden Club at 8:00 PM on the evening of the same day. A ball game and dance will be held at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. At 9:00 AM on the 7th, the entire crew will attend a service at the German Church to commemorate the fallen soldiers of the European War. At 10:30 AM, there will be a viewing at the Grand Theater. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, there will be a luncheon and sports day at the German Association, with prizes awarded at 5:30 PM. The ship will be open to the public for tours on the afternoon of the 8th. The ship will stay in Shanghai for one week and is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 9th.

Another report states that during the European War, the German cruiser Emden escaped from Qingdao and operated in the Indian Ocean for several months, sinking numerous warships and merchant ships, earning a great reputation. Its unpredictable tactics were particularly admired by the naval community. However, it was eventually overtaken by the larger Australian cruiser Sydney near the Cocos Islands. Despite the vast difference in fighting strength, it fought to the death. The ship was riddled with bullets and eventually sank, becoming a heroic and moving page in naval history. The German government later renamed another ship Emden to fill the void. After the armistice, the German government scuttled the warship among the allied countries, and the ship was among them. The German government later named a new ship Emden. The ship is currently circumnavigating the world and will arrive in Shanghai on the morning of February 2nd, staying for a week. The German community in this port is currently preparing a large-scale welcome, with banquets, theatrical performances, dances, and sports competitions. The ship's crew is also scheduled to travel to Suzhou on February 4th by special train and return to Shanghai that evening. The ship will be open to the public for tours on the afternoon of the 8th and is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 9th. The reason why the German community respects the ship is probably because they admire the past heroic achievements of the Emden.

### Shanghai Bank Collects Small Station Funds for Two Railways

The funds for various small stations along the Jin-Hu, Hu-Hang-Yong railways were previously collected to ensure safe and speedy receipt and remittance. In July 1930, the accounting department and the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank entered into a collection agreement. According to the agreement, large stations were to be notified by the bank's branches in each location to send personnel nearby to collect the funds. For small stations, the stationmaster was to pack the funds into sealed bags and hand them over to the train conductor on duty that day for delivery to the cashier's office of the accounting department for verification. The Bank of Communications was then to send personnel to collect the funds and issue a bank draft the next day, which was to be delivered by the accounting department to other banks for deposit into the railway account. It is now known that the railway accounting department recently entered into an agreement with the Shulu branch of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, whereby, in addition to the funds for large stations still being collected by the Bank of Communications, the funds delivered to the accounting department each day will be collected directly by the bank. All funds from the stations along the Jin-Hu railway will be transferred by the bank to the railway account. For the Hu-Hang and Su-Jia railways, the bank will first exchange the funds for bank drafts on the same day and deliver them to the accounting department for delivery to the local banks.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (7)

㊀ Mr. Daoming from Xiangtan asks: 1. Regarding sending money from Xiangtan County to Osaka, Japan, what procedures are required? Can national currency be remitted, and what are the remittance fees? 2. I plan to purchase a hand-operated flour mill from Osaka, measuring 20 inches high and 17 inches wide, weighing four *guan* (approximately 15 kilograms). Can it be directly mailed to Xiangtan, and what would the postage be? 3. Please provide a copy of your publication, "Postal Knowledge Q&A."

Answer: 1. You should obtain two copies of the "International Money Order Application Form" from the local (Xiangtan) post office. Follow the procedures for filling out the 'Domestic Money Order Application Form' as described in the previous Q&A, filling in each item (the amount of Shanghai taels must be specified in Japanese yen, for example, '100 Japanese Yen'). Submit it to the post office exchange staff, who will convert it to national currency according to the prescribed exchange rate and calculate the remittance fee. Then, pay the required amount. For other information and remittance fee rates, please refer to the Postal Regulations and the attached International Money Order Fee Schedule, or inquire at the local post office. 2. This type of hand-operated flour mill can be sent as a parcel directly from the Osaka post office to Xiangtan. However, the weight limit for parcels sent from Japan to China is 10 kilograms per item. If the machine can be disassembled, it can be divided into two or more packages for mailing. The postage for parcels from Japan to China is approximately 1.8 Japanese yen for a 10-kilogram parcel. The size limit is approximately 1.25 meters in length and width. 3. The "Postal Knowledge Q&A" compiled by our company is published serially in major newspapers in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou and is not available as a standalone publication.

㊁ Question: How many types of Simple Life Insurance are there? What is the highest and lowest insurance amount? How is the premium paid, and until when?

Answer: Simple Life Insurance is divided into two types: Whole Life Insurance and Term Life Insurance. The term of Term Life Insurance is divided into four types: ten years, fifteen years, twenty years, and twenty-five years. The insurance amount ranges from 50 to 500 national currency. The premium is paid monthly, and the payment date is based on the date stated on the policy. Payments should be made on time. If a delay is necessary, it must be paid within one month after the due date, and no further extensions are allowed. Otherwise, a late fee will be charged. Premiums can also be prepaid, and if prepaid, preferential treatment can be enjoyed. That is, those who prepay for six months can pay half a month's premium less, and those who prepay for one year can pay one month's premium less. For example, if the premium is two yuan per month, those who prepay for half a year only need to pay eleven yuan, and those who prepay for one year pay twenty-two yuan. Each premium can be paid by the policyholder to the post office insurance window, or the post office can send someone to collect it from the policyholder. This can be indicated in the insurance application form. If the policyholder pays to the post office on time every time and has not been delayed for a full year, he can also pay half a month's premium less. Term Life Insurance premiums are paid until the end of the term or until the death of the insured before the end of the term. Whole Life Insurance is paid until the death of the insured.

### The Jiangsu Provincial Government Considers Wang Binyan's Hardship

Requests the Ministry of Finance to Reimburse Advanced Funds - Telegram Replies that Yu et al. Should Negotiate Directly

New Voice Society reports that Wang Binyan suffered hardship due to public service. All circles in Zhabei once formed a support association. Yu Qiaqing and others also acted as mediators, telegraphing to the provincial government to reimburse the advanced funds. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating, "To Mr. Yu Qiaqing of Shanghai and to Mr. Du Yuesheng: Your telegram regarding the military advances by Zhabei Ciyang Qing Jiazi has been noted. We have requested the Ministry of Finance to reimburse the advanced funds. A copy of the original draft is attached for your perusal, and it is hoped that you will contact the Ministry of Finance directly. Chen Guofu, Yang Yin." Also attached is a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the Ministry of Finance stating, "According to telegrams from Yu Hede, Du Yong, Xia Zhen, Chen Qicai, Zhang Yin, Wang Xiaoqi, Lin Kanghou, Shen Yong, etc., when the Su-Zhe War ended and troops retreated, Zhabei was in great disorder. Jiangsu Governor and Superintendent Han telegraphed Wang Dong, the head of the Zhabei Defense Corps, to quickly maintain local order and raise military supplies. At that time, funds were raised in the name of the Zhabei Ciyang Corps. The task was completed in March of the following year, and a register was submitted, showing advanced funds of over 228,000 yuan (interest calculated separately as specified in the contract). The Director of the Jiangsu Finance Office was sent to Shanghai to sign a contract, stating that these large sums of money were specifically for military affairs during the war. Local groups were not obligated to guarantee the above expenses, which should naturally be the responsibility of the central and local officials, and should be repaid in full or equivalent property should be designated as legal compensation. A resolution was passed at a meeting of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and it was approved by Director Zeng telegraphically to the Provincial Government. The proceeds from the sale of all land owned by the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau should first be used to repay the advanced funds, with any surplus returned to the state, and any shortfall to be made up. All procedures such as bidding are to be handled by the parties to this contract, and no disposition or use of the proceeds will have legal effect without the consent of the parties. The contract was also copied by Jiangsu Province and sent to the Army and Finance Ministries for review and filing, etc. It has been twelve years, and those who advanced the funds are suffering from the addition of interest and are in extreme hardship. Wang Dong, in particular, has mortgaged his own house to the Cun De Money Shop, the Hong Kong National Bank, and the Guangdong Bank, etc., and has been repeatedly sued. The situation is very serious. The principal and interest amount to 84,000 national currency, and the auction is now being carried out, having been postponed more than ten times. We have repeatedly consulted with Minister of Finance Kong, hoping to prevent Wang Dong from being harmed for his public service and becoming homeless. The government is in a time of economic hardship and may not have time to take care of these factory properties. Other gentry in Yangbei who advanced funds are even greater in number and have already suffered heavy losses and are unable to advance any more. In terms of real estate, the scope is extremely wide and the value is very high. Although it has not been estimated, it is certain that it will be more than enough to repay the debt. Since this money and factory have been reported to the Ministry, it is appropriate for local officials to come forward and take charge. After considering the matter, we should present the details of the matter to Your Excellency. If funds are allocated for relief, we earnestly hope so. If the provincial treasury is temporarily unable to allocate funds, we respectfully request that you consult with the Ministry of Finance to borrow negotiable securities, which Wang Dong can receive to repay the 84,000 yuan for his private property mortgage, so as to have the lawsuit dismissed and save the imminent danger. After Your Excellency sends personnel to Shanghai after the general conclusion to join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to measure and value this factory property for auction, the proceeds will be used to repay the temporarily borrowed Ministry funds and the original commercial mortgages. Any surplus should be recovered by the Provincial Government to settle the outstanding case. If you approve, please send a telegram to facilitate a meeting with Minister Kong to proceed on both sides. The case of Wang Dong being sued and sealed up is imminent, and the situation is extremely urgent. Therefore, we earnestly request that Your Excellency show special consideration and relief to ease the public opinion that is being harmed for public service. There is no other way out, so we urgently submit this request and await your telegram reply with anticipation. Regarding the Su-Zhe War of 1924, when the troops retreated from Zhabei, the Zhabei Charity Group advanced over 220,000 yuan. At that time, the Jiangsu Provincial Military and Civilian officials and the Finance Office signed a contract to repay with all the land of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. This contract was also copied by the former Jiangsu Military Commander and sent to the former Army and Finance Ministries for review and filing. By nature, this advance was for the use of national troops during the war. The contract stated that it would be repaid with national property and had been reported to the Ministry for record. It should belong to the central government. In fact, Wang Dong, the head of the reading group, has been harmed for public service for more than ten years and should not be ignored. If Jiangsu Province has sufficient financial resources, the provincial treasury should clear it. It is a pity that Jiangsu's finances in recent years have been unusually difficult, which your Ministry is well aware of, and it is really unable to do so. Now, according to the telegram requesting the return of 84,000 yuan to clear Wang Dong's private property mortgage, the language is very urgent. In addition to the telegram reply, we enclose photos of the original contract and respectfully request that your ministry verify and allocate the funds for reimbursement."

### Wang Peide, an Employee of the Shanghai Branch, Is Convicted of Embezzlement

Embezzled More Than 7,000 Yuan - Sentenced to One Year and Two Months of Imprisonment

Wang Peide, a Ningbo native (29 years old), an employee of the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank branch at 1124 East Broadway Road, between June and December 26 of last year, successively embezzled deposits from the Shanghai University of Jiangwan Road, totaling more than 7,500 yuan. After the case was discovered, the Huishan Patrol Division was notified, and Chinese Detective Ma Wenda went to his home at 17 Huade Road, arrested Wang, and escorted him to the First Special District Court. He confessed that he was fooled by his landlord and fellow townsman, Shao Mingshan (broker at Jinkang 70, Gauze Exchange), into privately engaging in speculative cotton yarn trading, resulting in losses. He was ordered to be detained and remanded for further investigation and verification. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen presided over the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated that after investigation, the total amount of money embezzled by the defendant was 7,872 yuan and 54 cents, and the method of embezzlement was: ㊀ Not entering the money handed over by the depositors into the accounts; ㊁ Forging the signatures of depositors on withdrawal slips and secretly withdrawing the money. He claimed at the patrol station that Shao Mingshan, the landlord, instigated him to do so. He was summoned to confront him. Shao claimed that at the time, the defendant was willing to engage in cotton yarn trading and that there were four shareholders. Shao bought and sold on their behalf, sometimes making money and sometimes losing money, etc. Interrogated, the defendant confessed that he regretted being young and weak-willed. At that time, Shao Mingshan told him that the business was quick to make profits, and he was confused and induced by him to resort to this underhanded tactic. He now pleaded with his guarantor and family to find a way to repay the money. If sentenced, what would his old mother and wife do? He immediately broke down, his voice filled with tears, his appearance pitiful, and asked the court to impose a lighter sentence. Judge Xiao sentenced Wang Peide to one year and two months of imprisonment as a warning.

### The Disastrous Situation in Huangchuan County, Henan Province, is Extremely Severe and Awaits Rescue

The Manchuan Branch of the World Red Cross Society - Cables the Charity Rescue Association for Relief

The Manchuan Branch of the World Red Cross Society and other organizations telegraphed the United Charity Rescue Association in this city yesterday, stating (titles omitted): "Our Huangchuan is unfortunately beset by frequent disasters. The market is depressed, families are bankrupt, the wealthy have suffered under the red scourge for many years, and the poor farmers have suffered from strange famine for three years. Disease is everywhere, and families crying for food can be seen everywhere. Wildernesses are full of refugees. Moreover, houses are in ruins, and there is nowhere to live. The old and weak will fill the ditches, and the strong will scatter in all directions. At this time, the north wind is blowing hard, and the severe winter is approaching. The lives of these disaster victims depend entirely on relief. This is the reason why our association is holding a winter meeting. However, the association's funds are limited and the relief is not extensive. It is thought that one stream cannot support a large building, and the combined will of the people can form a city. Without the donations of the group, it is difficult to save the countless sufferings. We beg your association to extend your compassion, spread the rain of benevolence, or provide clothing to protect against the cold, or provide food to relieve hunger. If you extend your great compassion and spread your benevolent nectar, so that the disaster-stricken people of Huangchuan can survive this remaining winter, then we will forever be grateful. We weep in desperation and await your orders with utmost urgency. Manchuan Branch of the World Red Cross Society, United Charity Committee of the Buddhist Research Society of Huangchuan County, Henan."

### Three Indians Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Murder

Attempted to Kill to Silence the Victim - The Previous Case is Concluded

Indians Garam Singh, Sate Singh, and Laitam Singh, on October 22nd of last year, lured a Chinese hotel employee, Hu, to a certain place in Pudong. Garam Singh shot him in the head, but fortunately, the bullet was slightly off course, piercing through his jaw, and he did not die. After the three Indians were arrested, the Court of the British Assessor held several trials. All three defendants denied being in Pudong that day, but there was no conclusive evidence. At the final hearing a few days ago, Assessor Jones announced the end of the debate and asked the jurors to retire to the back of the court to decide whether they were guilty. The jurors deliberated for a moment and then returned to the court, declaring that the defendants were guilty. Therefore, Jones sentenced the three defendants to life imprisonment. According to Hu, one of the three defendants confessed to him that he had shot and killed the Sikh watchman Bishan in June, and then feared that he would spread the news, so they tried to kill him to silence him. According to the investigation by the patrol station, the bullet that killed Bishan was indeed the same as the one that wounded Hu. Therefore, the final verdict in this case concludes the previous case.

### Chen Boliang's Testicle Was Injured and Protruded

The Injury is Extremely Severe and His Life is in Danger - The Cause of the Attack May Be a Love Affair

Chen Boliang, a 32-year-old native of Ningbo, wearing a dark gray line spring lambskin robe, a dark blue striped cotton-flannel long gown, a black satin melon-skin cap, and black velvet shoes, was hired to hire a rickshaw at 4 AM yesterday from Dadongmen in the city, traveling near Qiaojiabang Road inside Dananmen. The municipal police Xiao Binlin saw that he was suspicious, and when he questioned him, his answers were irrelevant. Upon closer inspection of his robe and crotch, fresh blood was flowing, and he was in too much pain to speak. It was obvious that he had been attacked by an enemy. He ordered the rickshaw to the police station immediately. He gave his name as Chen Dong, a peddler, with no wife or address. He had a seal with the inscription "Chen Liangqiao Seal" in his possession, but his words were incoherent, and he seemed to have a mental illness. He was sent to Qu Zhifu Hospital for treatment by the police in the same rickshaw. It was discovered that the left testicle of Chen's lower body had been protruded, having been stabbed with a knife, about three centimeters long. However, due to excessive bleeding, the injury was extremely serious, and his life was in danger. As of late at night, no family members had arrived at the hospital to take responsibility. As for the reason for the attack, it is inevitable that there was a love affair, and the police station is secretly investigating.

### Ma Changshou, the Assassin in the Yin Bingen Case, Apprehended

Arrested in the Natural Bathhouse - Awaiting Transfer to Court for Further Interrogation

Yin Bingen, a native of Anhui who previously served as a patrolman, was assassinated on the night of October 11th of last year in front of No. 168 Wujia Lane, Qianjiatang, in the French Concession. The French Patrol Department arrested the murderers, Wang Dianhua (also known as Wang Laowu) and Wu Weicai, both from Anhui, and prosecuted them in the Second Special District Court. According to their confessions, Ma Changshou and Wang Kaifu, who had also escaped, also killed Yin. However, after Wang was transferred to the detention center, he suddenly retracted his confession. After investigation and interrogation of the witnesses, a date was set for sentencing. Subsequently, Wang, the presiding judge in the case, in order to thoroughly clarify the case and ensure that no one was wronged or let off, announced the annulment of the conclusion of the debate and set a date for reopening the debate. As noted in this newspaper at 3 PM yesterday, Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the Second Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought for re-trial. According to the report of the detectives handling the Chu case, Ma Changshou, the accomplice in the defendant Wang Dianhua's previous confession, could not be found.

He is currently detained in the First Special District Court, requesting a postponement to bring Ma to court for questioning. After verifying the report, the court ordered a postponement to the 23rd to transfer Ma Changshou to the court for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Zhang Hengyan Was Splashed With Acid - The Reason for the Grudge Was the Picked-Up Leather Suitcase

Disputes Over Sharing Reward Money and Recommending Business Are Complex - Shen Xisheng Denies Being in Anhui

Zhang Hengyan, a 30-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 36 Sanxin Lane, Ailai Ge Road, French Concession, was splashed with nitric acid while passing the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Caishi Street in the French Concession at around 9 PM on August 5 of last year. He was seriously injured, and the assailant fled. Zhang went to the French Patrol Department to seek medical treatment at Renji Hospital. The Patrol Department ordered the arrest of the assailant. While Zhang was being treated in the hospital, his injuries slightly improved. He claimed that the assailant was Shen Xisheng, a local he knew. The Patrol Department reported to the court and obtained an arrest warrant. On December 3rd of last year, Shen Xisheng (27 years old, Shanghai native, residing at No. 94 Weier Meng Road) was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court. Because the victim had not fully recovered and was discharged from the hospital, the defendant was ordered to be detained and a date was set for a later hearing after the victim recovered from his injuries. As reported in the previous newspaper, yesterday morning, the Second Special Court's Chen Shuoying brought the case to the First Criminal Court for further hearing. Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case and prosecuted the defendant for assault. According to the victim Zhang Hengyan, after being injured, he stayed in the hospital for 161 days and was only discharged today. At around 9 PM on August 5th of last year, while passing the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Caishi Street, he heard someone shout, "It's him! It's him!" The voice was very familiar. He turned around and saw the defendant Shen Xisheng standing by. He directed two other people to splash acid on me and then fled. The reason for this grudge is that a villager surnamed Li who ate at a restaurant picked up a leather suitcase containing more than 40 yuan in banknotes, two checks, and a notification from Qianniu Zhaohui in the French Concession. There are two such notifications in the French Concession, so each is worth more than 8,000 yuan. The total value of all items in the leather suitcase was more than 10,000 yuan. Not knowing who it belonged to, he took it back to his hometown. He mentioned this matter to a friend, who suggested that Li could investigate. So two friends accompanied Li to Shanghai and went to the home of A'wu, a servant in a wealthy family, asking him to help find the owner. A'wu called the bank to inquire and learned that it was lost by an apprentice of Yuan Shanbao. The two friends sent the lost items to Yuan, who gave them a reward of 200 yuan. The two friends were polite and only accepted half, 100 yuan. As a result, the two friends embezzled 60 yuan and gave 40 yuan to Li, falsely claiming that although the owner only thanked them with this small amount, he would also recommend them for business. Later, they did not recommend them for business, and Li asked me to inquire about the actual reward amount. After repeated inquiries, I found out that the 60 yuan was embezzled by the two friends. When I asked the two friends, one had already died, and the one who was still alive said that the deceased had used the 60 yuan. Later, I stopped asking. I heard that Li then asked a third party to inquire with A'wu. At that time, I persuaded A'wu to give more money, and A'wu's friend gave 10 yuan. At that time, Shen Xisheng was standing by and said that I was meddling in matters and that this caused a grudge. He used this vicious method to harm me. I used to work with Shen in the Anti-Smoking Supervision Office, so I knew Shen's voice very well, and at that time, I turned around and saw him directing by the side. I request a thorough investigation. Interrogated, the defendant Shen Xisheng denied instigating the splashing of acid to harm the plaintiff. He said that during this time, he was in Anhui, as evidenced by his store owner, etc. He also hired lawyer E Sen to defend him in court. The court also summoned Wu Genrong, the owner of the carpenter shop at No. 94 Weier Meng Road, where the defendant was employed, to testify. According to Wu, Shen Xisheng is indeed a clerk in my shop, but I do not know that he has harmed anyone outside. The court verified the confession and ordered a postponement. The hearing will be resumed at 9 AM on the 20th. The defendant was returned to custody.

### A Baffling Lawsuit Between Lu Qixiang and His Daughter

Grandson Accused of Robbing Grandfather's Property; Wang Yangyu Hired a Lawyer to Sue

Lu Qixiang, the owner of Renfeng Timber Firm on Gumazhi Road in the Nanshi area and a Haijian native, is of advanced age. He has a son and a daughter. His daughter, Ms. Lu, is 48 years old and married to a man surnamed Wang. They have a grandson, Wang Xingrong, who is also an adult but does not engage in legitimate work and instead associates with bandits. Because Lu Qixiang is old, he has entrusted his business and property to his son, Lu Youchen. Consequently, Ms. Wang Lu and her son, Wang Xingrong, could not get their share. Last December, Wang Xingrong gathered a gang of thieves and robbed his grandfather's house. The police arrested Wang Xingrong and Wang Lu and detained them in the local court, where the case is being investigated. Now, Wang Yangyu has hired lawyer Xu Jiashi on behalf of Wang Lu, suing in the local court to order Lu Youchen to pay 50,000 yuan in alimony. He has also requested free legal aid. The court hearing was held yesterday, and the defendant hired lawyer Huang Jiyuan for the defense, claiming that the lawsuit was a nuisance and requesting that Ms. Wang Lu be brought to court. She claimed that she had not filed a lawsuit and had not hired Xu Jiashi as her lawyer, which is truly baffling. When the magistrate questioned lawyer Xu, he stated that Wang Yangyu had commissioned him and that it was a pro bono case. Since the party involved did not file the lawsuit, it should be considered a withdrawal of the lawsuit. The court ordered that the lawsuit be treated as withdrawn and returned Ms. Wang Lu to custody.

### Huang Youbin Has No Right to Sue Zhou Ajiu for Adultery

Shui Qitang Also Appeared in Court; Huang Changed the Lawsuit to Accuse Extortion

Huang Youbin, the elderly owner of Longmen Shipyard, has certain ailments. Several years ago, he became involved with a young woman named Zhou Ajiu, and they had a child. They spent years in a lawsuit at the local court over identity and alimony, eventually resolving with her becoming his concubine. They lived together in Yangchang Alley on Fushan Chang Street near Xiaonanmen, with a monthly living allowance of thirty yuan. However, not long after, Ms. Zhou, finding Mr. Huang old and repulsive, fell in love with Shui Qitang, a foreign goods broker, and secretly lived with him at No. 36 Xiaozha Bridge near Xiaonanmen. Not willing to let the old man off easily, they pretended to be cousins and negotiated a separation with Huang, demanding a lump sum of 5,000 yuan as alimony. Huang, knowing that he had no relatives by that name after so many years of cohabitation with Ajiu, had people track them, revealing their secret. On the morning of the ninth of this month at three o'clock, he reported to the police. They rushed to the scene and found Shui and Ajiu in bed together. Their sweet dreams were shattered, and they were arrested and taken to the local court. The prosecutor investigated and determined that since the two were not formally married, Huang had no right to sue. Shui and Ajiu were released on bail. Huang, feeling resentful after spending a lot of money over the years and ending up with a cuckold’s hat, hired a lawyer to change the charges based on Shui and Ajiu's demand for 5,000 yuan in living expenses, accusing them of extortion to vent his anger.

### Joint Compensation for a Coolie Crushed by a Safe

The French Municipal Council Was Negligent in Supervision; Ordered to Pay One-Quarter of a Thousand Yuan in Compensation

On October 8th last year, a truck transporting goods in the French Concession was driving on a certain road when it hit a hole dug by the tram company (not yet paved).

The court ordered a compensation of one thousand yuan to be paid to He's wife, half by the truck company due to its negligence in loading the goods. The remaining half was to be shared by the French Municipal Council and the French Tram Company because the tram company failed to mark the dangerous location, and the French Municipal Council was negligent in supervision and could not evade responsibility.

### Dike Built in Racecourse Pond

Due to the accumulation of sewage in the pond inside the racecourse, which constantly breeds mosquitoes, the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department has raised many small fish in it to eat mosquito larvae and built wooden beams to prevent the fish from being washed away by the tide.

### Continued Arrest of Key Suspects in the Jingyun Building Robbery Case, Including Deng Shaochen

Deng Brought Back from Nantong for Custody; Yu Fengsen Also Arrested

On December 31st last year at 11:30 AM, the accounting office of Liu Jingdetang, located in Room 505 of the Jingyun Building on Beijing Road, was robbed of over 5,000 yuan in national currency. The robbers were pursued as they fled, resulting in the death of Western police officer Sirat and Jingyun Building doorman Pan Shoulong, who were shot by the robbers. The police captured robber Wang Jinsheng alive and killed robber Wang Bingsheng. They recovered a handgun, a Mauser pistol, and a portion of the stolen money. Following this, Chinese and Western detectives from the General Police Station continued to arrest 15 individuals related to the case: Wang Zhongdao, Wen Yongbao, Xu Honglin, Chen Sandi, Yang Longgen, Lu Xu Xiuzhen, Wang Fusan, Xu Yang Linmei, Cao Tongkun, Shi Mingcai, Wang Zhaogu, Wang Qinshi, Yu Weishi, Li You, and Lai Liguang. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Wang Jinsheng confessed that Deng Shaochen, a former detective of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was his mentor. Deng had repeatedly discussed the robbery with him, and Deng had also supplied the firearms. Police detectives went to Deng's house at No. 3 Jingqin Lane, Guangxi Road, to arrest him, but he had already fled. They learned that Deng was hiding at the Qinyuan Inn in Lianshui Town, Nantong. Chief Detective Zhang Mingde and Detective Jiang Shangpei went there and, together with local police officers, arrested Deng and brought him back to the police station for detention yesterday. It was then learned that Yu Fengsen (residing at No. 23 Qia Xing Lane, Kaifeng Road), from Anhui, was also heavily involved. They then found a way to arrest Yu. Yesterday morning, they sent them to the First Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the circumstances of the arrests and stated that Yu was also guilty of writing threatening letters and that he had previously been sentenced by the Second Special District Court to four months and one year and two months for extortion. Deng's female servant, Jin Ajin, had also been found by the police. She could testify that Wang Jinsheng had indeed spoken privately with her master for an hour or two. Jin Ajin testified that Wang Jinsheng had come to the house and had spoken to her master privately in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. Wang Jinsheng confessed that on the 30th of last month, he had gone with one of the fugitives to his master's house (Deng Shaochen) to discuss the matter. When questioned, Deng Shaochen claimed he was being framed, that Wang Jinsheng was not his apprentice, but that when he was a detective, Wang served as his informant. Recently, Wang had asked him for help with a certain case, but he was planning to arrest him and hand him over to the authorities, which is why Wang was falsely accusing him. Judge Qian Hongye decided to postpone the case for a joint trial with Wang Jinsheng and others.

### Lawsuit to Confirm Parentage Involves Nothing But Money

Lu Shunxing Shop's Business is Flourishing; Adopted Son Requests Return to the Family

Lu Ashi, a 68-year-old Wuxi native who owns a three-bay Lu Shunxing Machinery Shop at No. 109 Wanyu Street, Wanyu Pier, Nanshi, gave his third son, Lu Ali, 31 years old, to Tang Guigen at No. 47, Mud Ferry, 93rd Alley, Pudong, to be raised at the age of three. Now, his adoptive parents are both dead and the family is struggling financially, while his biological father's business is thriving. Although he has two older brothers, he still hopes to

Get a Piece of the Pie.

He hired lawyer Zhou Lianze to file a lawsuit in the local court against his biological father, Lu Ashi, to confirm their parentage. The original complaint stated: "The plaintiff is the biological son of the defendant, and their relationship is indeed that of father and son. However, the plaintiff's maternal grandmother and the defendant were swayed by superstitious fortunetelling beliefs, claiming that the plaintiff's destiny, specifically the 'birth date and time', clashed with his biological mother, Ms. Lu Zhu. Therefore, when the plaintiff was three years old, and his biological mother was still alive, the defendant, acting as the biological father, had the plaintiff registered under the name of

Tang Guigen's Family.

Fortunately, the Tang family treated him with love, allowing him to grow into adulthood. However, he maintained contact with the defendant, attending to his needs. Last January, Tang Guigen passed away, and the family's fortunes have been declining. The plaintiff lost his job and has no means of livelihood. He was forced to ask the defendant and his biological brothers, Lu Guanlin and Lu Genfa, for housing and work to support himself, but he was severely rejected and almost poisoned. For over a year, he has been wandering around, in great pain.

Despite Being Blood Relatives,

They treat him like a stranger, as if he were not their own. In fact, the plaintiff's face, voice, and demeanor are very similar to those of the defendant and his two older brothers, which can be verified upon inspection. Yet, they are so indifferent to the plaintiff, showing their heartlessness and disregard for natural human relationships. The plaintiff is now in a precarious situation, without a place to call home, and is ridiculed by the world. He hired a lawyer to send a letter of advice, but it was ignored. Therefore, he is requesting the court to rule," etc. Yesterday, Judge Yu held a hearing. Lu Ali recounted the events. The defendant hired lawyer Wu Wenjun to defend him, stating, "The plaintiff is his biological son. When he was two years old, he was given to Tang Guigen.

There Has Been No Contact Since.

I absolutely do not recognize him and will not take this son back. Furthermore, my parents passed away when I was thirteen years old. I went out to learn blacksmithing, working hard to operate the bellows, and even sold sorghum stalks. To succeed, one must work hard and cannot be lazy and greedy for wealth. He already carries the surname Tang, and the Tang family arranged his marriage. Moreover, I still have two sons, Guanlin and Genfa," etc. The plaintiff stated, "I was only registered under the name Tang, but I have always used the surname Lu outside, and I have often visited. I married Pan Yinzhu at the age of twenty-one and have a son, Genfu, and a daughter. I am now unemployed and want to return to my father's family." The judge noted that his claim was all about money. Lu Ashi was not exactly willing to take on an extra son for fear of riling his two sons. So they decided to postpone the trial and summon the two sons, Guanlin and Genfa, to court to hear their opinions before making a decision.

### Everyone is Happy: Military Academy Beats Sintoon by Two Points

Thirty-one to Twenty-nine, A One-Ball Difference

The Overall Game Situation Was Extremely Tense

Military Academy Leaves Shanghai for Soviet Union This Morning

The Central Military Academy basketball team suffered a great defeat by the Sintoon team in Nanjing. The entire team arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to respond. Last night, they played a second match against Sintoon at the Shenyuan basketball court and again defeated Sintoon by 31 to 29, two points more. In the first half, the Military Academy led by three points with 19 to 16. In the five minutes of the game, the competition was extremely tense. Sintoon took the lead for the first time, and Wang Yuzeng, the center of the Military Academy, was also fouled out at this time with four fouls. Both sides were panicked. In the end, because the Military Academy had good luck, Bao Wenpei made two long shots, scoring two goals in a row, and reversed the defeat. Last night, due to the rain, the audience was not very crowded, about a thousand people or more. The entire Military Academy team is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the Soviet Union this morning. Other games in Shanghai have been cancelled.

Military Academy's Basketball Skills

Last night's performance by the two teams was neck and neck. The outcome can be said to have depended on luck. Both sides had shortcomings. The Military Academy was better than Sintoon in passing skills. The Military Academy also had more shooting opportunities, but unfortunately the shooting was too poor, only two or three out of ten shots were made. Speaking of Wang Yuzeng, he made only three goals in the net out of dozens of close and long shots. Guo Zhen was very good. Bao Wenpei could not show his color at all. If the shooting was a little more accurate, the Military Academy would have won a great victory early on, without waiting for the tense situation that followed. The two guards were the most outstanding, with Zhao Zhihua being slightly better than Wang Shixuan.

Sintoon's Performance

As for the Sintoon team, it also suffered some obstacles. The biggest one was the unfamiliarity of the court. Sintoon abandoned the familiar ground of West Qing and suddenly enlarged the court. As a result, the short passes in West Qing all failed. The tall player Ryan also greatly reduced his effectiveness, almost to zero. Only Carson, Skwia, and Besser were still as imposing as ever, brave and terrifying. Sintoon's defense last night was extremely tight. This is why the three forwards of the Military Academy could not penetrate Sintoon's basket.

Leading All the Way

Referee Zhang Guoxun and Dai Changling blew the whistle to start the game. The Military Academy took the offensive first and entered the basket. Guo Zhen made the first shot, but it was not successful. Wang Yuzeng continued to make a shot, but it also failed. Passing back and forth, Guo Zhen got the ball and flew in, opening the record. Cheers erupted. Carson returned a goal. Wang Yuzeng, Guo Zhen, and Bao Wenpei scored three goals. The Military Academy took the lead with eight to two, and the momentum was very strong. Sintoon launched a fierce counterattack. The Military Academy always took the lead, 13 to 5, 18 to 11, 19 to 13. Carson scored two goals. The first half ended with a score of 19 to 16.

### The Military Academy's Basketball Team

— (International News Agency)

Sintoon Exceeds

At the start of the second half, Sintoon changed to a violent offensive. Wang Yuzeng and Guo Zhen still caught them unprepared, scoring one after another, making the score twelve to three to sixteen. Wang Yuzeng was fouled for the third time at this time. Carson scored. After the Military Academy suffered this major impact, Sintoon took the opportunity to attack, and Skwia and Carson scored each other, actually chasing the score to a tie of twenty-five. The panic of the Military Academy was already apparent. With Pisel's one goal, Sintoon took the lead for the first time.

Final Change

The central player Wang Yuzeng was suddenly fouled out for the fourth time at this time. Fortunately, he was not fouled in. Li Shenchun entered, and the two sides fell into an extremely tense and chaotic mixed war. At this time, there were still three minutes left to the end. The emotions of the audience also reached a boiling point. Guo Zhen threw far from the left corner and scored first, tying the score. The viewers were greatly relieved. Bao Wenpei shot far away and again entered the net. Sintoon raised its head again. However, Ryan made a shot under the basket, tying the score again. The Military Academy had great luck. In the last fifty seconds, Bao Wenpei's second long shot was successful. The Military Academy won by this goal.

### Self-Governance

— Wanwen

The self-governance I'm talking about today isn't local self-governance. To narrow the scope further, it's about how individuals can govern themselves. This is because local self-governance is created by individuals who can govern themselves and help each other. So, individual self-governance is much more important than local self-governance.

Whether a person can govern themselves is most clearly expressed in a group. A group is formed by a number of people. If someone can't govern themselves, they'll disrupt the order, and it's easy for people to notice. This damages their own reputation.

Children spend most of their lives at school. School is also a group, so whether children can govern themselves will be known in daily life.

Ordinary students' self-governance can be divided into three situations:

The first type of person can't govern themselves at all. They disrupt the order no matter what the situation. Teachers need to strictly discipline these people, because going to school is not only about learning, but also about learning to be a person. Eventually, this person will reform and start anew.

The second type of person is very well-behaved in front of teachers, but when the teachers aren't around, they make noise arbitrarily. I think this type of person is more hateful than the person who can't govern themselves at all. Teachers can still supervise the former to reform, but the latter is unknown to the teachers. The encouragement of classmates is treated as irrelevant, and they say that others are meddling. What good is that? I hope these people wake up quickly!

The third type of person can govern themselves completely. Of course, they deserve our admiration. But I still hope that you help others. Even if you are sometimes ridiculed, being able to do your best to persuade others to reform is also a joy.

In this way, if everyone can govern themselves as individuals, local self-governance will be easy to implement, and the order of the country will not be difficult to maintain permanently.

### The Story of Qi Jiguang Pacifying the Border

— Dazhong Bing

Children! Do you know that during the Ming Dynasty, there was a famous general who defeated the Japanese pirates several times? That famous general was named Qi Jiguang, courtesy name Yuanjing, and he was from Dingyuan. From a young age, he liked to read military books and gained a lot of military knowledge. So, in his prime, he became a Deputy Commander-in-Chief and went to Shandong to defend against the Japanese pirates. In the thirty-sixth year of Jiajing, the Japanese pirates disturbed the Zhejiang border. Jiguang was ordered to be transferred to Zhejiang and led his troops to suppress them fiercely. He won nine consecutive battles, captured more than two thousand prisoners, and killed countless Japanese pirates. Jiguang was rewarded for his merits and was promoted three ranks. A year later, the Japanese pirates invaded outside the Great Wall, Chifeng and Duolun, and gradually spread to Dehua and Shangdu. So, Suiyuan was in urgent need of help. Jiguang was ordered to suppress them again and won a great victory. When Jiguang entered Wuchuan City, southeast of Bailingmiao, the local people were slaughtering cattle and pigs, and those who were brewing wine were delivering dishes. The streets showed cheers: "Long live General Qi, long live Qi's ever-victorious army." Also, to commemorate his achievements, a Pacifying the Border Terrace was built, and his achievements were engraved on a stone tablet on the Pacifying the Border Terrace. For more than ten years, everything was safe and sound. Unexpectedly, there was a treacherous official named Zhang Dingsi who said, "Jiguang is not suitable for the north." The ruler transferred him to Guangdong. Throughout his life, Jiguang had two important words on managing troops: "Orders are strict, rewards and punishments are clear."

Children, the story of General Qi Jiguang pacifying the border, less than a hundred years after the event, Suiyuan was again invaded by bandits. General Fu Zuoyi is determined to defend Suiyuan for the country with his comrades in the north, vowing not to retreat a step. They are fighting for the country under the freezing snow, seemingly upholding the heroic legacy of Qi Jiguang. But we can't help but worry, can General Fu alone defend Suiyuan? I hope that all the children in the country can save their candy money and donate it to Suiyuan. This is material assistance. At the same time, everyone should be of one mind and work together to defend Suiyuan, not allowing an inch of land to be taken by the enemy.

### General Fu

General Fu,

Has a great name,

Ten years ago,

Firmly defending Zhuozhou was known throughout the world;

Now defending against insults outside the Great Wall,

Striving for the survival of our nation.

General Fu,

High in courage,

On the battlefield,

Angrily rides an iron horse with a knife at his waist,

Freezing wind and snow cuts,

One battle drives straight into the bandit's lair.

General Fu,

Truly patriotic,

Admires Wu Mu,

His ambition is to eat the flesh of the barbarians when hungry;

The golden goblet is broken and cannot become a country,

Vows to wipe out this great shame with death.

All the generals,

Lead the soldiers,

Fighting in bullet rain and piercing through the forest of spears;

Wiping out the bandits on the border,

The revival of the nation depends on you.

### A Page from the Diary of a Soldier on the Front Line

— Yu Ji

Today the temperature has dropped a lot. Everything is in a silver world. My hands and feet are so cold that they have lost their sense of touch and can no longer be controlled. But my heart is much warmer than usual. Thinking about this now still makes me feel happy. Damn it! That dwarf is really useless. After being caught by me, he actually knelt down and kowtowed to me, and babbled some ghost words that I couldn't understand. Looking at it, I felt both angry and amused. God really gave him a man's body in vain. When I first came to the front line, I was still a little timid, thinking that those guys were always much more powerful than our compatriots. Haha! It turns out they are just some cunning little mice.

Just now the front line was fighting fiercely. We were lying in the trenches, waiting leisurely. Seeing them rushing towards us in large numbers, a few rows of guns were fired, and one by one they fell down, the snow was dyed red, and it was really enjoyable for me!

Commander Chen gave a speech to our team, saying that all provinces in the country are enthusiastically comforting us, and there are often funds and winter clothes delivered. He encouraged the brothers to be especially brave in killing the enemy, and not to think that we are satisfied with the recovery of Bailingmiao. We must also recover all the lost land and wash away all the insults we have suffered before we can be satisfied. Huh! Needless to say? My blood is already boiling. I used to suffer from not having a chance, but now I don't have a good time to do it. When will I wait? It's also good to let me vent my anger.

I wonder how Xiao Wu Zi and his mother are now? That sturdy woman, when I left home that day, her crying face also turned into a smile. Damn it! Don't think about those things. When we are slaves of the devils, what kind of home is there? Xiao Wu Zi's mother will have to be taken by someone else to be his wife. Xiao Wu Zi, this little thing, even if he doesn't die, will no longer be my son. Damn it! It's still everything, kill him cleanly. Even if I lose my life, it is glorious to be a ghost. This time I am fighting to protect the integrity of the territory, and I am fighting for the survival of the nation, not for the leaders to fight for territory. Even if I am a sacrifice, die on the battlefield, and my family is scattered, I can still be worthy of the Great Republic of China and every compatriot of the Great Republic of China!

I'm so excited, December 6th diary

### Hand Shadow Play

### Roar, China!

— Big Kid

Dear children:

The war in Suiyuan has been going on for more than two months now. In these two months, the efforts of the loyal and brave soldiers on the front line to resist the enemy, and the enthusiastic assistance of the patriotic people in the rear, have raised the glorious, great, and national self-salvation banner high. The torch of the nation has been held by every member of the country, and the fire has shone all over the world, making monsters disappear, making villains tremble, making ordinary strongholds dare not act recklessly, and making nations that despise us also know to respect us. We should take this opportunity to wash away many past shames.

Suiyuan is the front line of our national defense. We must protect our territory, we must protect our sovereignty, we do not want to be slaves, so we cannot ignore the war of resistance in Suiyuan. Although Suiyuan is far away from us, its pain is very deeply felt. Therefore, we should consider this a matter of the survival of our entire country and nation. Perhaps this is the prelude to the start of a major war. Therefore, we hope that the soldiers and civilians, young and old, throughout the country will rise up together to deal with it. We must be prepared to resist to the end, because their ambitions are undying and their tricks are many. If the Suiyuan side is not successful, they may suddenly try to launch another attack from elsewhere. At present, we must prepare for defense as soon as possible!

Dear children, how do you feel if our China unfortunately becomes the second Korea, Taiwan, Annam, or Burma one day? If this place becomes the Northeast, and you are a compatriot of the Northeast, would you also feel sad! Now, our country is in danger, and the survival of our nation has reached the last juncture. If we do not rise up to seek self-salvation quickly, if we do not rise up to resist together, the great Republic of China may become the second Korea, Taiwan, Annam, or Burma, and we will follow in the footsteps of our compatriots in the Northeast. Just imagine, how terrible is this!

Although we are still some minors, we should also be concerned about the survival of the country. Although the responsibility for saving the country should be borne by the adults, the idea of loving the country must be cultivated from childhood.

Look! The alarm bell of our national self-salvation has sounded all over the world. The Battle of Suiyuan is still our first bell sound -

Roar, China! We must roar from this corner and make the whole country roar!

"A Corner of Roaring China"! We must roar from this corner and make the whole country roar!

### A Letter from Chinese Children to Japanese Children

— Zhu Yiju

Dear children:

We suddenly gave you this letter, you must be surprised to receive it? But don't be surprised, we wrote this letter because we saw the current tense situation between our two countries, and wanted to connect the feelings of the children of our two countries to promote the national relations between the two countries and to be friendly. I think you would also be willing!

We often hear the teacher say that the people of our two countries are both yellow people, and also have the same writing. It is not a good phenomenon for people of the same race to have hostile behavior! We should connect and be friendly, and struggle together with other races in the world, so that we can show the status of our yellow people in the world.

Now your government is putting heavy pressure on our government. Large numbers of troops have been sent to the North China area and are constantly practicing. In Shanghai, sailors are landing and showing off their power, it really looks like a big war is about to begin. Have you seen this situation? Are you satisfied with this behavior?

Our children are the masters of the two countries in the future, and are responsible for the construction and survival of the two countries in the future. Therefore, we should urge the government to implement friendship with each other. We hope that you will advise your government on this reason: change the current attitude of pressure and replace it with a policy of equality and mutual benefit, then we will really clap our hands and celebrate. I wonder what you think?

Sincerely, I wish you good health!

### Deep Sea Dream Journey

— Jiang Zhongyu

(22) After a while, a deep-sea fish with a white peacock head came. The fish swam very slowly and looked very gentle. (23) Min'er watched for a while. Then he became bold. (24) He rode on the back of the fish and traveled back and forth in the sea with the fish. (25) He was having a great time riding when he encountered a small and terrible sea snake. (26) The scare made Min'er fall off the white fish's back.

Children's World

### Shark

— Zhongmei

Today, after Min'er finished preparing his homework, he was flipping through a book about various large and small fish. He looked at each page very carefully, but when he turned to the last page of the book, he didn't understand what kind of fish it was. So he took the picture to ask his brother, and his brother replied, "This is a very fierce fish that lives in the ocean called a shark. Its body shape is slender and about twelve or three feet long. The back is light gray with white spots and contains granular fine scales. The nose is protruding, and the nostrils and white part are open on the underside of the body. This is the characteristic of a shark. There are five pairs of gill slits on the left and right sides of the body, with gills inside, but no gill covers on the outside. Its dorsal fin is divided into two parts, front and back. The front fin is larger than the back line and is far away from the back fin."

"What shape are the shark's abdominal fins, anal fins, pectoral fins, and caudal fins, and where are they located?"

"Its abdominal and anal fins are very small and grow on the underside of the abdomen and anus. The pectoral fins are triangular and grow under the five pairs of gill slits. The shape of the caudal fin is irregular, with the upper lobe very large and the lower lobe very small, called a lopsided tail. This caudal fin is of course on the tail."

"What is the shark's method of reproduction? Does it reproduce by laying eggs?"

"The shark's method of reproduction is not by laying eggs, but by giving birth to small fish viviparously. The fetus is covered by a cyst. Each cyst produces two small sharks. Therefore, in May and June each year, a total of about ten sharks are produced each time."

"So, what is the shark's use in industry or food?"

"The function of sharks in the king's industry is to use their rough and hard skin, which can be used to polish various objects. In terms of food, their fins are made into shark fins after a series of manufacturing processes, which are valuable foods on banquets. Their meat is not very tasty, but it can also be eaten. The cartilage in their heads and gills can be used to make bright bone, which can also be used for food. Their livers can be made into cod liver oil, which is a medicine to strengthen our bodies, and the eggs are rich in yolk and can also be used as food."

### How to Raise Funds for Suiyuan Relief?

Reply to Li Renhe of Zhongshan County

Renhe, my brother:

We were very excited and pleased to read your letter filled with patriotism in one go. We have decided to reply to your questions as soon as possible.

How exactly should we raise funds for Suiyuan relief? This is indeed the most pressing concern for every Boy Scout right now. In our opinion, within a Boy Scout troop, there are at least the following methods:

(1) Save on Daily Expenses: If we want to raise funds, we must first start with ourselves. We should save any unnecessary expenses every day. If your troop has considerable savings, isn't now the time to use them?

(2) Solicit Donations from Others at Any Time: In addition to our own donations, we should also encourage others to donate at any time. Whenever there is an opportunity, we should encourage people to support Suiyuan. As for whether donations are collected by you on our behalf, or delivered by them to local collection points, it doesn't matter, as long as we achieve the goal of supporting Suiyuan.

(3) Sell Works and Valuables: Well-preserved items made as class assignments, handicrafts we make ourselves, and personal valuables (such as toys, valuable stamps, etc.) can all be sold, and we can ask enthusiastic people to purchase them. We believe that enthusiastic patriots will definitely give you a higher price than the cost. We have already suggested this method to the China Boy Scout Group 177.

(4) Collect Natural Objects for Sale: Don't we have assignments to collect natural objects in our advanced courses? We can now collect various natural objects, such as beautiful flower branches, pretty shells, and exquisite pebbles, as well as wild herbs for medicine, and we can collect them and sell them for money.

(5) Solicit Daily Necessities for Peddling: We can also solicit various daily necessities and books from major stores and peddle them to the outside world. We believe that enthusiastic merchants will definitely support you.

(6) Fundraising Entertainment Performances: You can join with other troops to hold campfire gatherings (which are still suitable in your southern region, because the weather is not very cold) or entertainment fairs, sell tickets, and use the proceeds to support Suiyuan.

The above points are the majority of the many methods we can implement. We believe you will design many more clever methods. However, before proceeding, there must first be an organization, and the steps for implementation must be carefully discussed. Due to space limitations, we cannot tell you in detail here.

In addition, we also want to tell you some news, which is that we recently wrote a letter to the General Association of the China Boy Scouts, proposing two general mobilization plans for national Boy Scout support of Suiyuan. First, we hope that the General Association will order the Boy Scout governing bodies in various parts of the country to gather Boy Scouts in their respective areas to collect local waste materials (such as bottles, old clothes, broken utensils, etc.), and call on waste merchants to auction them off for cash to contribute to the government. We call this the National Boy Scout Waste Collection Suiyuan Relief Mobilization. Second, we hope that the General Association will set a date for the Boy Scout governing bodies in various places to prepare campfire gatherings or entertainment fairs, and have Boy Scouts across the country hold them simultaneously on the designated date to collect funds to support Suiyuan. We call this the National Boy Scout Campfire Performance Suiyuan Relief Mobilization. We hope that the General Association will adopt our suggestions. Do you think our methods are feasible?

Farewell, we are waiting here for news of your Suiyuan relief efforts! Wishing you every success!

Respectfully replied by the China Boy Scout Self-Help Society

### Suiyuan Relief Song

### Filial Piety (12)

— Hai

She did not forget the two old gentlemen who had been exiled to Siberia with her father; they had treated her exceptionally well. She mentioned them to many people, but people often advised her not to bring them up with her father's case, because too many requests might be detrimental to her father. However, before long, she received news that the emperor had issued an edict, pardoning her father. Moreover, the emperor was willing to know if Bosikefei herself had any requests. She replied in haste that she was deeply grateful for the grace she had received and dared not ask for anything else, only hoping that the emperor would show further grace and pardon the two poor old gentlemen. The emperor, seeing that Bosikefei had no selfish motives whatsoever, was even more moved. He investigated the crimes committed by the two men and found that they were all political in nature and had already been exiled for many years, so he issued an edict pardoning them as well.

Boshenkefei, to express her gratitude to God for her father's pardon, voluntarily devoted herself to becoming a nun. She was drawn to the nunnery in the Nihi area, because she had previously been treated there when she was ill. However, first, she had to go to Kiev, the place where the first Christians in Russia were initially trained. The tombs of the devout Empress Saint Urga and the idol-destroying Saint Fotimo were also there, and she prepared to visit them. After worshiping, Bosikefei took her vows of monasticism there. It was somewhat strange that such a filial daughter would become a nun without the permission of her parents. However, when she went to Beijing to seek permission from her parents, she had secretly vowed to repay God in this way. Now that she had achieved her goal, she fulfilled her vow. She returned to Nihi from Kiev, hoping to meet her parents, as she estimated that the two old people would be returning from Siberia at this time. When she saw the abbess of the nunnery, she asked earnestly if there was any news of the two old people. The abbess said quickly, "The news is very good, come to my room and I'll tell you more." Bosikefei quietly followed her into the reception room and saw her father and mother standing there! When they saw their hardworking daughter, they were so moved that they knelt down without realizing it. She hurriedly knelt down as well and exclaimed, "What is this? Know that this is all God's help, we should thank God for the grace He has bestowed upon us."

Colonel Lauboluo husband and wife and their beloved daughter reunited for a week, enjoying the happiness of family. They then agreed to return to their hometown together. Bosikefei spent the rest of her life in the nunnery. However, the long journey in earlier years, having experienced all kinds of hardships, had damaged her health, and she grew weaker day by day. Although she survived several years and saw her parents again, her body was very weak. Once, she went to St. Petersburg, where someone saw her and said that she had a beautiful oval face, a pair of jet-black eyes, and a broad forehead. Her expression carried a melancholy smile, but her demeanor was very calm.

On December 9, 1809, Bosikefei's ailing body could no longer support itself. That morning, she was lying quietly in her bed in the chapel, surrounded by the nuns who were talking beside her, watching her gradually wither away. They hurriedly left her and went out to pray, leaving only one person singing hymns aloud. Bosikefei begged her not to sing so loudly, because the sound disturbed her prayers. That night, they let her lie there, not daring to disturb her again. The next morning, they saw that she had already passed away, her hands crossed over her chest in the shape of a cross. (The End)

### An Analysis of the Moroccan Crisis

— Luo Qun

The world situation is becoming increasingly tense day by day. Although 1936, which was generally considered a year of international crisis, has passed, the world, full of the smell of gunpowder, continues to show its turbulence and unrest. Take the Spanish Civil War, for example. Although the two sides have been fighting for four or five months, and hundreds of thousands of people have been sacrificed, there is still no sign of ending. Not only is it not ending, but because various countries have actively participated in this war, the content of this war has become increasingly complex, and its international impact has become increasingly broad. Until recently, it has become even more chaotic and serious due to rumors of German troops entering Morocco.

According to a Havas dispatch from the 9th, "In the past ten days, a large number of German troops have landed in the Spanish Moroccan port of Melilla and are stationed in the port. These German troops are fully armed and wear military uniforms. In addition, three German destroyers and several submarines are docked in the port of Melilla, and there are many German engineers and workers." At the same time, a Reuters dispatch from London stated, "In the past few days, two to three hundred German troops have landed at various ports in Spanish Morocco." In addition, newspapers in London and Paris have repeatedly published news of German troops landing in Spanish Morocco and building defensive fortifications. Although Berlin has repeatedly denied it, it is probably not without reason.

Morocco is an important place in North Africa and a key point where international relations are complicated. The German invasion will undoubtedly immediately arouse protests from France. The French government has publicly stated that if Germany sends more troops to Morocco, France will consider military action. Moreover, there is news that Defense Minister Daladier will lead staff to inspect the area in person. At the same time, diplomacy is frequent between London and Paris, and German and French newspapers are engaged in fierce written battles. From all aspects of the situation, the entry of German troops into Morocco has become a serious international problem.

Morocco is a colony in Africa, located in the northwest corner of Africa. Before 1912, it was an independent kingdom, but because of its political and economic backwardness, it later became the object of contention among the great powers, especially because it was close to the borders of France and Spain, which made it the focus of the struggle between the two countries. In 1902, France and Italy concluded a secret agreement, in which France allowed Italy to occupy Tripoli without interference, and Italy would not oppose France seizing Morocco. In 1904, Britain and France established compromise conditions, in which France allowed Britain freedom of action in Egypt, in exchange for Britain's commitment to France's freedom of action in Morocco. Soon, France and Spain signed a treaty dividing the two countries' spheres of influence in Morocco. Although Germany and France had major disputes over the Moroccan issue, resulting in moments of war, after a settlement was reached, France ceded a part of Equatorial Africa to Germany and completely seized Morocco for itself. In 1921, France declared Morocco its protectorate, making Morocco its property.

After France acquired Morocco, it made every effort to strengthen its rule there, such as adding defensive fortifications and intensifying the suppression of the Riff people, mainly because this place is very important to France. First, it occupies the northwest corner of Africa, just south of the Strait of Gibraltar, and has significant control over traffic in the Mediterranean and even in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Second, its southern basin is a gathering place for camel caravans and a key point for political traffic in North and West Africa, which is essential for ruling the entire West Africa. Third, many cities along the Atlantic coast in this place are commercially prosperous, rich in products, have a mild climate, and have a large population, making it economically valuable. Because of this, Morocco is simply France's important base in the Mediterranean and the nerve center for its rule over the West African colonies. France undoubtedly attaches great importance to this place. No wonder Paris felt so uneasy when it heard the news of the German invasion.

We know that since the outbreak of the Spanish war, Germany has been doing its best to assist Franco's Nationalists. Its role, on the one hand, is to want to support a country similar in nature to itself in the Iberian Peninsula, in order to expand its camp, and on the other hand, it is precisely to take the opportunity to extend its power into North Africa and seize colonial interests on the north shore of the Mediterranean. When it first began to assist the Nationalist army in Spain, it was rumored internationally that Franco had agreed to cede the rights of Morocco to Germany. Although this may not be absolutely credible, Germany's desire to obtain a portion of its power in North Africa is an undeniable fact.

If Germany really obtains some kind of military base in Spanish Morocco and strengthens its power, then the traffic in the Strait of Gibraltar in the Mediterranean will inevitably be threatened by Germany, and France's colonies in West Africa will also face a crisis, and France's power, which has always dominated the western Mediterranean, will inevitably be greatly affected.

According to a Reuters dispatch from the 10th, "French officials said that the continuous influx of Germans into Spanish Morocco in Africa has caused a very serious situation. Berlin's denial of the existence of German troops in Morocco has made people even more alarmed. According to a firm statement here, the German power in Morocco is a serious hazard to France's defense arrangements." From this, we can see how apprehensive the French side is.

The future development of this incident mainly depends on the attitude of the UK. If the UK firmly stands on the same line as France, then Germany's actions can be temporarily restrained; otherwise, the future will become even more chaotic. According to the current situation, the UK's attitude is somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, for the sake of the safety of its own imperial traffic, it certainly hopes to be consistent with France in preventing Germany from developing towards Morocco. But on the other hand, it also hopes that German troops can help Franco, so at present, it has repeatedly stated, "The stationing of German troops in Morocco has not reached the level necessary for the UK to actively intervene." This means that it is not very important at present. Naturally, if the number of German troops increases further and its power becomes even more developed, the UK will never sit idly by. In short, the situation in the western Mediterranean, due to the outbreak of the Spanish war, has already been very turbulent. Now, due to the Moroccan issue, this turbulence has become even more urgent.

### Chairman Chiang During the Northern Expedition

— Liu Xin

The first time I "met" this leader of a million troops was at the grand gathering held by the Huangpu Military Academy to welcome the representatives of the Second National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang. That afternoon, I arrived at the Huangpu Military Academy by small boat with the representatives from Guangzhou. As the students of the fourth term lined up outside the school gate and saluted with their guns, I felt the weight of the Party's mission on my shoulders. At the same time, I also felt a bit proud, because I was probably the youngest among the representatives, although in terms of qualifications, I might not be as good as them.

This "leader of a million troops," who was also the principal of the military academy, was standing in front of the hall of the military academy waiting for us. So we entered in single file, and he smiled and shook hands with us in turn. At that time, although I was already twenty-three years old, I still had the innocence of a child, not to mention that old-fashioned ideas of localism were also filling my head. Even now, it is still the same sometimes. When he shook hands with me, I was having such despicable thoughts:

"Principal Chiang, I am also from Fenghua!"

In the evening, in the rectangular hall, countless dining tables were arranged in long, neat rows of four, which could accommodate two or three hundred people. The flowers in vases on the white tablecloths shone brightly under the strong electric lights. Western meals costing five Guangdong silver dollars per person were being delivered to the representatives' seats one after another. The yellow belts on the young military officers' bodies and the golden badges on the representatives' chests seemed to be predicting the great and glorious future of China. In everyone's firm eyes, calm faces, impassioned tones, and decisive attitudes, there was a hidden and irresistible force, as if these two or three hundred people were two or three hundred bombs that would soon be classified and explode everywhere.

The female comrades were silent, the male comrades were lively. There were no beautiful songs or dances, no charming music, and nothing that could disturb the revolutionary atmosphere was allowed into the room, but everyone's heart was filled with revelry. Here, hermits will retreat, poets will remove their garlands, laymen will grasp butcher knives, and scholars will be inspired. Here, although there is fine wine, it does not intoxicate; although there are beautiful women, they do not seduce. Three parts of romance are mixed with seven parts of solemnity, and a small amount of sadness is mixed with a large amount of generosity. In this way, wise men gather, and many wills become one. The life of the nation is nourished, and the foundation of the party and the state is established.

Thus, in such an indescribable mood, Principal Chiang, with his piercing eyes, slightly dark complexion, high forehead, and lean face, dressed in military uniform and straw sandals, smiled and raised his wine glass, urging us to have another drink. As the wine reached a state of half-intoxication, a thunderous "Comrades!" broke through the noisy voices of the representatives. At the same time, I glimpsed a certain Mr. So-and-so, a representative of a certain military special party department in the next seat. His clenched left hand seemed to shake violently. Yes, Principal Chiang was beginning to make an impassioned speech.

The content of his speech that day focused on foreign and domestic policies. The wording was concise and stimulating, earning the representatives and a group of Huangpu students standing outside the hall continuous applause. Often, after saying only one or two sentences, a burst of thunderous applause interrupted his speech. Whenever this happened, he always looked at the dining table, hoping that the applause would stop. At the same time, his firm gaze showed that he could not only talk the talk, but also walk the walk.

When the army went to Nanchang, due to changes in the objective situation, the entire revolutionary route was slightly different from before. During this period, we could even more see that Chiang was a great military leader with strict military discipline. Therefore, whenever the General Headquarters held a memorial week for the Premier, I never dared to stand in the front row frankly, for fear that he would find some flaw in me and scold me. On this day, I always had to wear my green military uniform more neatly and cleanly than usual, and every button was buttoned properly. The military cap on my head was also worn appropriately, neither crooked nor leaning to the left or right, making sure that the position of the black lacquered brim was exactly in place, like a duck's bill. Usually, I was always too lazy to wrap my leggings. In fact, most of the time it was because I was too busy with work. The pair of Chen Jiageng rubber shoes on my feet (these shoes were very convenient for marching. One day I wore these shoes and ran a distance of one hundred and sixty li day and night, and my feet did not even get blisters) were not often washed, but rather allowed the grayish-white mud to lie comfortably on the green shoe surface. Only on this day would I put on my leggings, and wrap them evenly and firmly. At the same time, I had to use a scrubbing brush to clean all the mud off my shoe surface.

One day, it was again the day of the Premier's memorial week. Chiang, wearing the red duty officer's sash, stepped onto the stage to deliver a military and political report amidst the drawn-out "Attention!" of the duty officer. He first looked at the officers standing in the audience participating in the memorial week from left to right, with two majestic lights unique to military leaders radiating from his eyes, and then began to speak. That day, he spoke about the issue of military discipline. He first scolded the guards severely, saying that they often huddled their hands together when standing at the door, with absolutely no spirit. Suddenly, his angry eyes swept over the officers standing solemnly in front of him, like searchlights seeming to search for something. Then he asked loudly:

"Where is the commander of the guard regiment? Why is he not here today?" The air suddenly became tense, as if something serious was about to happen.

But there was no reply. Everyone was silent, not daring to make a sound. So Chiang reprimanded the commander of the guard regiment to the crowd.

That day, I happened to be standing in the first row. His eyes, burning with the fire of anger, flashed like lightning, especially clearly and terrifyingly in front of me. His thunderous voice hit my eardrums like a barrage of lead, wave after wave. Almost not a single word was willing to escape from my ears easily. Of course, he was not scolding me, but I did feel a terror - the terror of suddenly encountering a storm on a cloudy street. I felt as if I was standing there taking the blame for someone else. I can say that during that memorial week, I stood woodenly throughout, without moving at all. My eyes stared blankly at his face, not daring to look left or right, to show that my full attention was being focused unreservedly on his speech. Although he had lightly and casually shouted a command that seemed like a command but wasn't a command, "At ease!" before he began his speech, in fact, I stood in the "attention" posture, with my chest out and my belly protruding, for a full hour.

### The Origins of Southern Chinese Ethnic Groups

— Le

Although China's ethnic groups are broadly classified into Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan, there are actually more than just these five. Moreover, each of these groups can be further divided into several types. For example, the Hui can be divided into "cooked" Hui and "raw" Hui. However, the most complex ethnic system in China, apart from Xinjiang, is probably that of the various ethnic groups in the south. The "south" here refers to the area south of the Yangtze River, with its main regions being the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Judging from the complexity of the language systems of Fujian and Guangdong, one can also understand the large number of ethnic groups there.

The indigenous ethnic groups of China can be roughly divided into more than a dozen types, including the Jing, Yue, Hakka, Dan, Yao, Zhuang, Li, Luo Luo, Miao, Bai Yi, Xifan, as well as Nu Yi, Lisu, Mo Xie, Minjiazi, and Zhong people. Now, let's briefly describe the origins of each ethnic group.

The Jing people occupy Hubei and have blood ties with the Miao people. The Chu state was also a branch of the Jing, with its base in present-day Zigui County in Jingnan Dao, Hubei. Later, they occupied a large part of Hubei and confronted the Han Chinese during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Their ancestor was Yuxiong. The Shu people were affiliated with the Jing, as mentioned in the Book of Songs: "Jing and Shu are punished." They were located around present-day Lujiang and Fengyang in Anhui and were destroyed by Chu. During the Spring and Autumn period, they were assimilated by the Han Chinese. The Wu people occupied the area south of the Huai and Si rivers to Jiaxing and Huzhou in Zhejiang. Their founding ancestors were Taibo and Zhongyong, the grand-uncles of King Wu of Zhou. They led a portion of the Han Chinese southward from Shaanxi, passing through Hubei to Jiangsu, and called themselves Gou Wu.

The so-called Minyue were descendants of Goujian. The Min became attached to Yue in the late Spring and Autumn period and to Chu during the Warring States period. Emperor Gaozu of Han enfeoffed them as the King of Minyue. Later, they moved to Jianghuai and lived among the Han Chinese. At the end of the Jin Dynasty, due to the Wu Hu rebellion, many Han Chinese returned south to Fujian, which greatly opened up the culture of Fujian. Some believe that the Min people were descendants of Aryans who migrated there, but this is not yet a settled conclusion. Guangdong was the ancient land of Nanyue. "Yue" and "Yue" were originally the same and were also called Baiyue. It was not until the Han Dynasty that they were pacified and Zhao Tuo was enfeoffed as the King of Nanyue. The Han Chinese first arrived in Yue during the Spring and Autumn period, with their destination being Panyu. When Yue was destroyed by Wu and Chu destroyed Yue, some remnants flowed in. Emperor Qin Shi Huang opened the Five Ridges and sent 400,000 soldiers. Later, Emperor Wu of Han pacified Nanyue and repeatedly moved its people to Jianghuai. As a result, the composition of the Yue people had long been mixed with the Han Chinese.

In present-day Fujian and Guangdong, there are so-called Hakka people, who have special customs and habits. But what is their origin? The Hakka people of Guangdong came from the North River and the East River. Those from the North River were the soldiers sent by the Qin Dynasty to conquer the area. Soon after, the Qin Dynasty was destroyed, and the soldiers remained in the area around present-day Daqing Ridge. The Han Dynasty summoned Tai Hou, the general of the Qin southern expedition, to Wu Pass, and left Qing Sheng to guard the southern border, hence the later name Tian Shou Ling. It is said that the soldiers at that time were the ancestors of the present-day Cantonese people. The Hakka people of the East River came later than those of the North River. They probably migrated south due to the Wu Hu rebellion at the end of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, settling in southern Fujian, and then moved to southern Guangdong because Zhang Shijie and Wen Tianxiang were driven out by the Yuan Dynasty at the end of the Song Dynasty. Their number now far exceeds four million.

The so-called Dan people, also known as Danhu, are still found in large numbers on wooden boats on the rivers and coasts of Fujian and Guangdong. According to various historical records, the Dan people are descendants of the pirate Lu Xun from the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Lu Xun was originally a Han Chinese, so the Dan people have Han Chinese elements. At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Shijie and others led an army of 170,000 people, 300,000 militiamen, and 10,000 Huai soldiers to Yamen in southern Guangdong. Later, they were pursued by Yuan soldiers and dispersed east and west, wandering at sea. This is also one explanation for the origin of the Dan people. Another theory is that the Dan people were black people from the Indochina Peninsula who migrated to the coast of Guangdong. In short, the Dan people are a kind of rootless ethnic group in Guangdong, and their origin can be said to be multifaceted.

The ancestors of the Yao people are no longer traceable. Most of them are distributed in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The Yao people of Guangdong also came from Guangxi, and their original population was very small. From the Song to the Ming Dynasty, they increased to hundreds of thousands, living in the mountains near Lianshan. The largest number of Yao people are in Guangxi. There used to be a saying, "Four-tenths are people, six-tenths are barbarians." During the Ming Dynasty, Wang Shouren raised troops to suppress and pacify them, and they began to submit to the Han Chinese. The Zhuang people are scattered throughout Guangxi, divided into "raw" and "cooked" types. Their deeds are only found in various records from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, and their ancient ancestors are no longer traceable. In addition, there are two other types of people, the Fan people and the She people, who are also branches of the Yao people. The former are distributed in the northwest of Chaozhou in Guangdong, and the latter are distributed in Tingzhou in Fujian. There are also 200,000 She people in Kuocang Mountain in Zhejiang.

The Li people on Qiongya Island are now well known. The Yao people are divided into several different types, including Li, Qi, and Cun. The Li people are also divided into "raw" Li and "cooked" Li, living in places such as Wuzhi Mountain. The Li people are naturally simple and honest, and not like barbarians. They are probably ancient Han Chinese left behind here.

The Luo Luo are also a well-known ethnic group in the south, also called Guo Luo, Lao Luo, Lu Lu, and Liao Liao, and also called Manzi. There is also a name "Independent Luo Luo," which was added by Western ethnologists in recent times. This is because they are not controlled by Chinese political forces and have become an independent group. As for their origin, some say they are a type of Miao people, while others say they migrated from the border area of Tibet and Myanmar. Judging from their customs and habits, the former theory is more appropriate. The Luo Luo are distributed in a wide area, as far west as Kangding, as far south as Simao, and as far east as Guizhou, with Jianchang in Sichuan as their center. They are also divided into "raw" and "cooked" types. The "cooked" Luo have now mostly been assimilated with the Han Chinese.

The Miao people have the earliest origin, as mentioned in the Book of Documents. There are many names for the Miao people, and their surnames include Song, Cai, etc. According to the region, they are divided into Bazhai, Gaopo, Xixi, etc. According to clothing, they are divided into Qing, Hua, Bai, Hei, Dujiao, and Duanqun, etc. Their distribution area is: the Red Miao are located at the junction of Hunan and Guizhou, with the area near Tongren as the center. The White Miao and Qing Miao are distributed in central Guizhou and the Jinsha River in Yunnan. The Black Miao are also called the Raw Miao and are distributed in Liping and Duyun. The Flower Miao are near Guiyang. In short, the distribution of the Miao people is centered in Guizhou and extends to Guangxi and Yunnan.

The Bai Yi are similar to the Lao and Siamese people and are descendants of the former Nanzhao Dali Kingdom. They now exist in southern Yunnan. The Xifan are a branch of the Tibetan people, living in the Xikang Special Region and distributed in northwestern Sichuan and the border of Sichuan. Other Nu Yi, Lisu, Mo Xie, and Minjiazi are all distributed in southern Yunnan, and the Zhong people are distributed in the Zhaotong area of Guizhou. These are some small ethnic groups, mixed with the Xian Luo, Miao, and others, and their origins are not easy to trace.

Looking at the origins of the above ethnic groups in general, they probably have two sources: one is that they migrated from the so-called Central Plains in ancient times, and the other is that they migrated from overseas. According to world anthropologists, the races of the world (referring to the Eastern Hemisphere) probably all originated from the plateau of the Caucasus and the Pamir Mountains. Then, it goes without saying that the various ethnic groups in southern China, whether they came from the mainland or from overseas, all originated from the Pamir Plateau. At the same time, according to the above, we also see that the various indigenous ethnic groups in the south have been greatly assimilated by the Han Chinese through the cultural and political influence of past dynasties, especially in recent decades. If we can actively promote education and develop wasteland, I think that soon there will be no difference between the various southern ethnic groups and the Han Chinese.

### How to Live a Traveling Life

— Sang

As the ancients said, "Heaven and earth are originally an inn, and life is like a passing traveler." This saying is very appropriate as a motto for travel enthusiasts. In this way, the first thing to pay attention to in travel life is a perpetually joyful state of mind! If you think, "Alas, the road to Shu is difficult, more difficult than ascending to heaven!" "Trampling east and west, eventually becoming a ditch," "Wading is very hard, and pedestrians stop," then why not sit at home and not suffer this unwanted sin? Moreover, in reality, this kind of mentality is extremely wrong! Therefore, if you plan to visit famous mountains, great rivers, strange caves, and scenic spots, you must always maintain a consistent optimistic attitude and persevering spirit. You must never give up halfway, nor can you force yourself to be perfunctory, making the fun become tedious—first, you must have a mind like the sea and the sky, like leisurely clouds and wild cranes. Dream that everywhere is your hometown, feel the wonder at any time, taste the harvest from the hardship, and explore the purpose from the difficulty. This is the first essential to correct the mentality in the process of travel life.

The correction of mentality can be said to be not much noticed at present, right? Because transportation is convenient, it is indeed advancing a thousand miles a day! It can not only enable people to actually enjoy the miraculous shrinking of the earth, but also enable people to live in peace and eat well, feeling comfortable everywhere, which will often make travelers naturally change their fearful mentality and encourage courage instead. However, in what I have experienced and seen, I have also found many regrets: for example, some people think that because Mount Lu, famous for its high rocks and winding paths, actually has a mountain road for cars on the side of Haihui Temple, they can infer from their mentality and one-sided views that Mount Lu, which is difficult to see its true face, does not need straw shoes and shorts. Just walking slowly in a car, you can see everything. Indeed, there are several friends of mine who underestimate Mount Lu too much. They wore clothes that were very unfavorable for walking: the female companions were naturally high heels and cheongsams. When they arrived at Haihui Temple, they looked casually at the layers of peaks and ridges of Mount Lu, and felt that there was no way to pass through, and they could not help but feel a lot of disappointment. Some people flipped through travel guides, and although they saw many special adjectives, they did not feel any deep interest. Looking up at the Five Elders Peak and the Daughter Peak, they only felt that the dangerous rocks and broken ravines must not have an easy path to climb at will, so they gave up their courage to explore the secluded and seek the strange. He is also like a pilgrim visiting Hangzhou, having been there dozens of times, but never carefully explored the caves or crossed the mountains. Except for the existing scenic spots outside the ready-made Lingyin Temple, Six Harmonies Pagoda, and Hupao, the good places hidden in the well-known inner mountains and outer mountains of West Lake, they have no way to inquire about! Therefore, in the current situation where transportation is convenient, in addition to correcting the mentality, there must also be a second essential for hunting for novelty and choosing the best.

Travelers are also like hunters and hunting dogs. When walking on the road, do not forget that there are still undiscovered paths hidden beside the road. There must be undiscovered miracles waiting for you to admire. Scenic spots cannot be based on other people's legends. Going there once as a matter of having already known about it is not enough. It is necessary to maintain an exploratory attitude that is new every day, to hunt for miracles from the ordinary, and to choose from the garbage-like famous monuments things that you think are worth appreciating. In order to maintain this spirit, we must turn from travel psychology to the scope of travel physiology.

For example, if someone is going to visit Mount Emei in Sichuan, it takes 60 miles of mountain road to walk from the foot of the mountain to the ridge, and it is necessary to change the climate of spring, autumn, and winter. If you are not prepared in terms of physiology, unless you do not plan to continue the journey, forced support will definitely affect your health. There is also an incidental fact that can be used as a lesson for travelers. Six years ago, a friend of mine with lung disease went to Guling, Mount Lu, to recuperate. I had already introduced him to a local friend to take care of

him up the mountain. However, because the sick man was eager to climb the mountain, he did not wait for his friend to take care of him, so he hired a sedan to go up the mountain by himself. That kind of sedan is just a rattan armchair tied to two hard wooden sticks. Without being informed that he was a patient, the porters did not care about the life or death of the sedan rider, and threw this friend with lung disease and heart failure like a basketball for dozens of miles. By the time he was thrown to Guling, he was already on his last breath. He was immediately sent to the hospital. After the doctor asked about the situation, he was greatly complained, and several injections of cardiotonics were ineffective. He died on the mountain in less than a week! This is such a sad thing! But in the past, whenever a patient went to Mount Lu, as long as they contacted the sedan company in advance, they could avoid this danger. They prepared soft sedans, and the sedan poles were not made of hardwood but of long, thick bamboo poles. They used bedding to tie up a bed-like soft pad, put the patient in the pad, and carried him very carefully by experienced porters, so that the patient could sleep to the top of the mountain like sleeping in a cradle, without feeling tired at all. This kind of soft sedan is most popular in the travels of Sichuan and Tibet, commonly known as a "sliding pole". Because travelers in Sichuan and Tibet live in towering mountains every day, it is necessary to arrange travelers in this way, especially people with heart failure, and it is necessary to take care of their physiological maintenance in all aspects.

As for the supplies that should be carried during travel, of course, many books and magazines about travel, as well as people who are experienced in travel, often announce it to people there. In my opinion, there are necessities and unnecessary things. Sometimes, in order to seek perfection, you often have to increase the weight of your luggage, which invisibly hinders the work of exploring and selecting scenic spots. There are also times when you miss an item, which will cause endless pain to people's psychology and physiology. I think that except for traveling overseas, most of them are climbing mountains and mountains, and most of the miracles and beautiful scenery are in deep mountains and dense forests, so I will especially mention some of the necessities for mountain travel to serve as a reference for those who live a traveling life.

It is common knowledge that you can never wear leather shoes when climbing mountains. But ordinary rubber-soled basketball shoes will often have accidents. Because the soles of these shoes are extremely slippery when they touch water, it doesn't matter if you step on the mud, but on the way of climbing mountains, you often have to cross streams, waterfalls, etc., and the soles of these shoes often ask their owners to eat the pain of falling forward and backward, and even endangering their lives. I think if you are used to wearing straw shoes, grass shoes are the best. However, new leather shoes will cause blisters on the feet, so it is usually better to wear cloth-soled flat shoes! It's best to have them custom-made according to your own feet. In addition to shoes, medicines for first aid for minor injuries are the most important! Because breaking the skin and spraining, etc., this is almost a compulsory course in every trip. Gauze, cotton wool, band-aids, iodine ointment, balm, and turpentine, disinfectant skin-rejuvenating powder, Lysol or small pieces of potassium permanganate, etc., must be prepared in moderation. In addition, sewing needles and cotton are also necessary, because tearing clothes is also common; and the tear gets bigger and bigger, so it is better to sew it up quickly if you get a small place. Food is also necessary, "Carry dry food with you, and don't be afraid of being uncomfortable!" This is the essence of the motto of travelers.

Of course, other things depend on the traveler's own experience at any time. For example. a diary, etc., if you find something, write it down, or leave some handwriting in extremely desolate places, etc. In short, being able to solve psychological and physiological problems appropriately is the taste of traveling life.

### After Reading "Digest Monthly"

— Gong Bi

Edited by Fudan University Digest Society, General Sales by Liming Bookstore

In recent years, Chinese magazines have made significant progress in both quantity and quality; therefore, some people have hailed 1935 as the "Magazine Year".

Although Chinese magazines are gradually progressing, magazines that digest valuable articles from various magazines, such as Readers' Digest, have not yet appeared. I remember that two or three years ago, Mr. Liang Desuo edited a magazine called "Culture", which was of the nature of selecting good articles from national magazines and editing them, which had the flavor of a "magazine of magazines": however, Mr. Liang's work only reached the step of selection: In fact, specialized selection is not enough, we must further "shorten" it. It is very gratifying that the "Digest Monthly" is now taking on this task. Therefore, the appearance of the "Digest Monthly" is undoubtedly urgently needed and is a gratifying event in the Chinese magazine industry.

Magazines are important to a person, and magazines of magazines are even more important to the general public. A magazine reader must have a very high desire for knowledge, but no matter how superb his reading ability is, it is of course impossible for him to browse through the articles of various magazines, and he may not even need it completely. Most magazine readers are "busy people", and they usually have very heavy work every day. They can only flip through magazines when they are free from work. If they are asked to read a long article of several thousand or tens of thousands of words after extreme fatigue, they will not only feel tired, but also time will not allow it. If there is now a magazine that can indicate the valuable articles in national magazines to them and tell them the importance of a lengthy text in extremely short words, then how suitable is this magazine for the needs of readers?

In fact, the general public, whether they read books, newspapers, or magazines, their purpose is always to acquire a wide range of knowledge, and they do not want to prepare like scholars. Therefore, a magazine that can provide them with the important points of each valuable article, so that their reading time can be used very economically, is what they most urgently need at present.

The general public of readers sometimes encounters such a difficulty, that is, sometimes they find that there are one or two articles in a certain magazine that they want to read, and that magazine only has these one or two articles that they want to read. If they are to buy them one by one, it is very difficult for the economic capacity of the public. And the "magazine of magazines" can just remedy this difficulty.

The content and organization of the "Digest Monthly" are very novel, divided into five major columns: 1. General Discussion, 2. World Politics and Economics, 3. Relations between China, Japan, and the Soviet Union, 4. China's Past and Present, 5. General Academics. I think that at present, the "Digest Monthly" can pay special attention to the materials of the China-Japan-Soviet relations and the past and present of China, which has its own unique insights.

The "Digest Monthly" digests a wide range of content and is very rich, and almost all the articles in the magazines published nationwide are digested in it. It includes two major departments: social sciences and natural sciences. Social sciences include philosophy, sociology, history, politics, economics, etc., and natural sciences include engineering, physics, chemistry, etc. Therefore, the "Digest Monthly" is no different from a large melting pot, a library in magazines. It is all-encompassing, and it includes not only serious remarks, natural science papers, philosophical theories, but also relaxed and meaningful texts, giving readers every opportunity to choose.

I think that the "Digest Monthly" has a very fair attitude towards the standard of selecting magazine articles. It does not specialize in selecting articles from famous publications, nor does it rely solely on whether the author is famous or not. The texts it digests are completely based on whether the article itself is valuable. Because there are often many valuable articles in many non-famous magazines, and the works of many "unappreciated" authors do have a value worth reading. I think everyone who has read the inaugural issue of "Digest" will feel it.

In addition, the "Digest Monthly" has another feature, that is, the articles it digests, whether from the perspective of capitalism or from the perspective of socialism, as long as the argument of that article has its basis and reason, it puts it in front of readers, allowing readers to automatically criticize it and decide what to choose.

Because I feel that this kind of magazine, "Digest Monthly", has its advantages, I am happy to introduce it to readers. Naturally, the inaugural issue of "Digest" still has places that cannot completely satisfy people. I hope that the Digest Society can continue to work hard to "improve".

### Aphorisms

— Shi Xiong

When someone stumbles, don't immediately erect a cross on top of it.

When the time is not yet ripe, don't brag or negate self-criticism first.

There is no way, the organism of mankind grows up while being poisoned, while completing the internal means for that poisoning. There is life in that. If you are dried up like a herring in your mouth, then there will be no poisoning, but there will be no growing up either, and there will probably be nothing at all!

The outer garment of love is taken off, leaving only the pursuit of sex.

What evil can't be done in seclusion? Laziness of spirit, aimlessness, is the abyss of all evils, and it is where villains are unscrupulous.

If water does not accumulate thickly, it can never carry a large boat.

If there is a kind of violence that "makes people inhuman", not only not as humans, but not even as cattle and horses; when people envy cattle and horses and sigh that "in troubled times, people are not as good as dogs in peaceful times", giving them a price slightly equal to that of human cattle and horses, then people will be sincerely convinced and congratulate the prosperous age. ——People are extremely easy to become slaves!

### Unprecedented Hollywood Event

Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the Chairman of Paramount's Service

Paramount Pictures, a Hollywood production company that has been established for 25 years and has many famous stars, held a grand banquet at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on December 1 last year to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the company's chairman, Mr. Zukor's service. The initiators were all stars, such as Mary Pickford, Louis B. Mayer, Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Lloyd, Claudette Colbert, Katharine Hepburn, Carole Lombard, and William Powell, etc., with the stars shining brightly. On January 7, Mr. Zukor's 64th birthday, a banquet was held at the Paramount Company Colleagues Club.

However, since Paramount Pictures is unanimously screened in major cities around the world, the scope of the celebration is also global. The company has long planned to "perfect match", which is the first film to commemorate, starring Spencer Tracy and Myrna Loy, scheduled for the 22nd of this month, the official founding day of the company, to be screened in major cities around the world, and in Shanghai, of course, it is the Grand Theater.

When the Grand Theater opens "Perfect Match" next Friday, Spencer Tracy will also appear on the screen at the same time in Washington, the capital of the United States, and New York and other important places. Mr. Zukor will personally go to Washington on that day to participate in the opening of that famous film. After the event, he will travel around the United States, accompanied by many Paramount Company employees.

### A Certain Man's Confession (6)

— Original by French writer André Gide, translated by Xiang Shi

One morning, Marceline entered smiling at me.

"I've brought you a friend." Behind her, indeed, came a small Arab boy with dark reddish skin. He was called Basil, and his pair of calm, large eyes were fixed on me. I don't know why, but I felt somewhat uneasy, and this uneasiness made me weary. So I didn't answer a word, as if I were angry. The child, seeing my coldness, was embarrassed, and hurried to turn to Marceline, clinging tightly to her, grasping her hand, and kissing her exposed arm. I furtively saw that under his white robe and large cape, he was completely naked.

"Come! Sit here," Marceline, seeing that I ignored him, said to the child, "Just play quietly."

The child then sat on the floor, pulled a small knife from his large cape, and also took a piece of wood from the hood of his cloak. Thus, he whittled his wood. I guessed that he was probably going to make a flute.

After some time, I was no longer uneasy about his presence. I looked at him as if I had forgotten he was there. His feet were not wearing shoes, and the bracelet on his wrist was very beautiful. He used his "clumsy" little knife in a very skillful way. Really, was I interested in this? His hair was cut in the Arab style, and he wore a small round hat on his head, with only a small hole in the top of the hat. His robe was a little too large, revealing his lovely shoulders above it. I really wanted to caress them. I leaned forward, and he hurriedly turned to look at me. I gestured for him to give me the flute he was making, and I held it, looking very admiring. At this time, he was about to leave. Marceline gave him a piece of pastry, and I gave him twenty cents.

The next day, for the first time, I felt melancholy; I was waiting. What was I waiting for? I only felt idle and restless. Later, I couldn't bear it any longer:

"Isn't Basil coming this morning, Marceline?"

"If you want him to come, I'll go find him."

She left the words and went downstairs. But after a while, she still came back alone. What had illness made me become? Seeing that Basil didn't come with her, I almost shed tears.

"It's too late," she said, "School is already dismissed, and the children have all scattered. But it doesn't matter, you know there are many other lovely children, they are all familiar with me." (To be continued)
