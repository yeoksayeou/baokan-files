### Chairman Wang's Speech on the Three Foundations of the National Assembly

[Nanjing] (Continued from yesterday) Why can individuals create discipline with an automatic spirit and spontaneous emotions? This is because each individual has a common feeling. Generally, a kind of creature inevitably has a common feeling in a common environment. Feeling pain inevitably leads to thinking about how to relieve it, and feeling danger inevitably leads to thinking about how to avoid it. The higher the creature, the stronger its feelings and the larger the scope of its feelings. Therefore, the feelings of animals are superior to those of plants, and the feelings of humans are superior to those of all other animals. The smarter humans are, the more intense their feelings. Common feelings give rise to common understanding, common understanding gives rise to common belief, and common belief gives rise to common action. This kind of common action looks like discipline, like a machine, but its source comes from common belief, understanding, and feeling. Therefore, it is said that discipline is created by the automatic spirit and spontaneous emotions of each individual. Since China has been invaded by foreign forces, the people have felt the disaster of national extinction at every moment, pressing on their eyebrows. Since the September 18th Incident, this common feeling has intensified day by day. This is the first foundation of the National Assembly. Common feelings give rise to common understanding, knowing that only unity and solidarity can save the country and survive. Therefore, the slogan of spiritual unity and jointly facing national difficulties has spread throughout the country. Not only do party members know the importance of their responsibilities and missions and that they cannot bear them without unity and solidarity, but also people from all walks of life who are not party members also know that at this critical moment of survival, only unity and solidarity can bring hope of salvation. They spontaneously support the government or even participate in the government's work out of their own free will, trying to jointly shoulder the current difficulties. This is the second foundation of the National Assembly. So, what remains is only the third foundation, the so-called common belief. As far as our party comrades are concerned, the common belief is the Three Principles of the People advocated by the Premier. Before the 1911 Revolution, we worked hard to create a country based on the Three Principles of the People. After the founding of the Republic of China, although the signboard of the Republic of China had been hung up, its content and reality were quite the opposite. In addition, all the counter-revolutionary elements at that time, with Yuan Shikai's military force as the center, formed a united front and attacked the party. Since then, this situation has been overwhelming. Until the bribery election in the 12th year of the Republic, not only did our party comrades feel very heartbroken about this situation, but the people across the country also felt very disgusted with this situation. Therefore, when the Premier convened the First National Congress of our party in January of the 13th year of the Republic, he promulgated the Outline of National Government Construction, requiring the use of the revolutionary Three Principles of the People to build the Republic of China. Since then, party comrades have made renewed efforts. Over the past ten years, the blood shed can form rivers. The purpose of the military and political era was to remove obstacles to the Three Principles of the People. The purpose of the tutelage era was to open up the path for the construction of the Three Principles of the People. The purpose of the constitutional era is to complete the construction of the Three Principles of the People. The people across the country are extremely disgusted with the situation before the 12th year of the Republic, so they extremely support the party's efforts since the 13th year of the Republic, hoping that it will succeed in turn. As for some people's belief in the Three Principles of the People, there may inevitably be different attitudes. Judging from what each person has heard and known, it seems impossible to force them to agree. However, on careful thought, nationalism is to enable our nation to achieve freedom and equality in the international arena and to help each other to advance to Great Harmony. Democracy is to determine that the people are the foundation of the country while preventing the various malpractices of the current democratic system. Livelihood is to enable the country's survival and the people's lives to be improved and developed while preventing the various malpractices of the current economic system of mutual exclusion and mutual bullying. The meanings contained in them do not have any fundamental differences. Even if there are some differences in the details, when this moment of crisis and survival comes, using one ideology to unify the actions of the people across the country is the only way to save the country. Because it is impossible for two ideologies to exist in the same free time. If we want to realize another ideal ideology, we must first overthrow this existing ideology. Therefore, we must not only actively seek the birth, growth, and universality of the ideal ideology, but also passively seek the destruction and elimination of the existing ideology. The disputes it causes and the power that disappears due to conflict are all losses to the entire nation. This loss to the entire country and the entire nation is still tolerable in peacetime, but is it not even more painful in times of crisis and survival? For example, the emotions and interests between laborers and entrepreneurs in the entire industry are originally different. If they can consider the emotions and interests of the entire country and the entire nation and harmonize with each other to achieve unity, how can there be reason for those in the intellectual community to stick to their own opinions and refuse to accommodate each other? Therefore, if we support the existing ideology and hope that it will develop so that it can achieve the goal of saving the country, powerful members of the intellectual community will surely be happy to do so without any hindrance. Then, the third foundation of the National Assembly will also be established here. In short, we look forward to the future of the National Assembly with full enthusiasm, hoping that party comrades will work together to complete the construction of the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, we look forward to powerful members of all walks of life who are not party members working together to complete the construction of the Three Principles of the People with full enthusiasm. We believe that party comrades will be able to uphold the spirit of recommending the worthy and delegating the competent to concentrate talent to save the country. At the same time, we believe that powerful members of all walks of life who are not party members will be able to uphold the spirit of shared destiny and struggle together under one ideology, under one Three Principles of the People that can truly save the country, in order to carry out the mission of the National Revolution and complete the construction of the Republic of China.

### London During the Coronation (Part 2)

— Special Correspondent Zheng Nanwei of this Newspaper

The seats in the temple are made of blue velvet, decorated with golden lines. Another special golden globe is placed in the rear hall. In the center of the temple is the coronation platform, surrounded by brocade railings. Another carpet, 173 feet long and 17 feet wide, is laid for the new Emperor and Empress to walk into the temple. The ground in the temple is covered with felt carpets, covering the tombstones and bronze plaques on the ground. A layer of wool blanket is laid on top of the felt carpets.

For several months, the London Police Department has been considering how to maintain order and manage the crowds on the day. This is a major traffic problem that has never been encountered before. The regulations are very strict. Diplomatic officials must get up before dawn, dress in formal attire, and be seated in the temple by 7 o'clock. At least 12,000 police officers will be deployed in the city center on the day.

On the eve of the coronation day, or perhaps the day before that, people were sitting, standing, or sleeping in Hyde Park all night, or sitting in front of the temporary coffee shops drinking coffee.

Dozens of extra trains across the English Channel to the European continent were also added temporarily to transport all the foreign guests to London on the eve of the coronation. The underground trains will run non-stop all night to transport the audience to the coronation area. (Normally, the trains stop at 12 o'clock at night.) On the eve of the coronation day, London was as lively as the Chinese New Year's Eve, with people going to the City God Temple to offer incense. From 6 o'clock in the morning, people began to rush to the coronation site, which was crowded and impassable. By the time they reached the nine new shops, they were completely frozen, shoulder to shoulder, without a place to stand. Those who came later could not get into the crowd, and the atoms that were united in the crowd could not jump out, and even turning around was impossible. After 9 o'clock, nothing moved except the coronation procession. The official start of the procession was at 9:30.

When the time came, all the trumpeters blew loudly, and the band set off from Buckingham Palace and proceeded directly to the temple, followed by a large team of red-clad knights. After that came a large group of cars. This was the procession of the powerful nations, or the first procession. Among them were Kong Xiangbao, the special representative of the Chinese National Government, as well as Weng Wenyan, Zeng Rongpu, and Guo Bingwen.

The rooms in many large and small hotels were booked long ago. The windows facing the street where the coronation procession passed were bought for extremely high prices. The total rent for buildings with such excellent locations was more than 7,000 yuan on the day, and those who paid high prices could only squeeze out a head from the crowd to look out the window and could not sit comfortably to watch.

There were also many people with vested interests in this coronation. The mint made many badges and commemorative medals for people to collect. The government also issued various commemorative stamps for transmission to countries around the world. Fireworks and firecrackers have been rushed to make since last year for use on the day. Flag merchants have already made millions of British flags and colonial flags. Birmingham in the factory area manufactured a large number of coronation commemorative spoons, and porcelain merchants also manufactured countless commemorative cups.

Other brooches and powder boxes for women, cigarette boxes and calendar cards for men, etc., all had images of the new emperor and empress or their names. Various toys specially made to commemorate the coronation, as well as children's colored velvet hats, colored paper covers for electric lights, and other small items like these, were all sent out from Birmingham in large quantities and distributed to various parts of the country.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Is Italy Tired of the Results of the Spanish Civil War?

— Han

The recent international situation is extremely bizarre. Sometimes it is tense, sometimes it is relaxed, sometimes it is estranged, and sometimes it is united. However, a deep examination of the internal affairs of each country reveals that there is a consistent policy. The so-called relaxation, tension, estrangement, and unity are just a means of dazzling people's eyes and should not be regarded as the truth.

The Spanish Civil War can be taken as an example. The so-called Spanish Civil War is just a pseudonym. The so-called General Franco is just a tool. In fact, Spain could never have started a civil war. Even if there were a civil war, it would never have been prolonged for so long. The inside story is about to come out, so there is no need to say more. But how fortunate Spain is to have the light of these esteemed guests, offering countless heads and countless properties as sacrifices on both sides. This is because the feng shui of Spain's location is not good. Spain is located on the Atlantic coast and guards the throat of the Mediterranean Sea. Its international status is extremely important. The British colonies are all over the world. The Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal are the important lifeline of Britain. No matter what, it will never be abandoned. Italy's terrain extends into the Mediterranean Sea. Now that it has crossed the Mediterranean Sea to seize Abyssinia and possess it, the hegemony of the Mediterranean Sea is bound to be contested. This plan has been swirling in Mussolini's mind for a long time. Deliberately, an Italian spokesman said that the name of British maritime hegemony has become a historical relic. Italy will take its place without giving way. The implication is already obvious.

Now that Italy has obtained Abyssinia and wants to include Spain in its pocket, it is not only intolerable to Britain and France, but also to Germany. The so-called two heroes cannot stand side by side, and the strength of a neighboring country is the weakness of my country. It cannot but have scruples. However, since Germany and Italy have become the momentum of transporting chickens, if Germany acts alone, it will never be able to run rampant for a while. If Italy does not cooperate with Germany, it will not be able to be reckless abroad. Therefore, what various countries fear is not any one of Germany and Italy, but the alliance between the two countries. Therefore, the reason why Germany and Italy are singing the high tune of consolidating the axis of European politics lies in this. However, the relationship between the interests of the two countries has different depths. They are never willing to disregard their own interests and be used by anyone. Hitler has also planned this matter well. Therefore, in the high-profile cooperation between Germany and Italy, there is inevitably a situation of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. The recent proposal to consolidate the axis of European politics is enough to show the cracks between the two countries, and they are trying to eliminate them.

Based on this, the recent attitude of the two countries towards non-interference in the Spanish Civil War and the withdrawal of volunteers is already obvious. Germany has expressed its support, while Italy has not yet responded. Since the relationship between the interests of the two countries is very different, their attitudes naturally emerge. However, according to a recent dispatch from Paris, Italy has gradually revealed its weariness with the issue of pre-war, saying that the reason for its weariness is due to the losses on the front lines. This statement cannot be said to be without considerable basis, and perhaps the fact that Germany has not taken the same steps is also a reason. And who knows if the reason for spreading this statement is a kind of give and take policy, expressing passive inaction while secretly becoming more tense. Since Italy's participation in the Spanish Civil War has become an open secret, Italy's losses are already considerable. If Italy's leader is really tired of it, not only will its far-reaching goals be impossible to achieve, but its major losses will be impossible to compensate. Therefore, Mussolini's statement that he is tired of interfering in the Spanish Civil War is probably not enough to convince people.

### Special Envoy Kong Leaves England for Geneva, Saying That Sino-British Relations Are Becoming Closer

Expresses gratitude for the hospitality of British circles. Vice Minister Zeng and financial experts remain in London.

[London] The Chinese delegation left London for Geneva today. Many British dignitaries saw them off at Victoria Station. The British King also sent a representative to the station to see them off. The British government's chief economic advisor, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, and former British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, also came to say goodbye. Before his departure, Special Envoy Kong told Reuters reporters that he was extremely satisfied with the hospitality he had received on this trip and that he was leaving with fond memories of his three weeks in London. He also said that Britain's observance of ancient customs, the solemn and magnificent coronation ceremony, and the friendly feelings of government, business, and financial leaders towards China have left a deep impression on him. Before I arrived in England, I decided to fulfill the mission of goodwill that the Chinese government and people entrusted to me to the greatest extent possible. Now I can happily report that the response given by Chinese friends has made my work easier. I hope that this trip to England has further strengthened the ties of friendship and cooperation between China and Britain. I am very grateful for the hospitality and assistance of all friends. Kong will go to Nochm, Germany, for medical treatment after leaving Geneva at a later date, and will still come to London. Chinese Railway Vice Minister Zeng Rongpu and representatives of China's financial experts are currently staying in London. (Reuters dispatch from London, 25th)

### Japanese Policy Toward China Still Awaits Detailed Review

The Content of the New Instructions to Kawagoe Will Be Based on Existing Facts

[Nanjing] Diplomatic sources report that discussions between the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities and Ambassador Kawagoe regarding diplomatic policy toward China are still awaiting detailed review due to various factors. Previous reports that Kawagoe would bring new instructions to China on May 5th have now been postponed. Our Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, is gradually recovering from his ear ailment, and due to urging from the authorities, he has decided to advance his departure, now scheduled for early June. He is also scheduled to visit Acting Dean Wang in Beijing at the end of the month to bid farewell. (May 25th Special Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Regarding the specific instructions that Ambassador Kawagoe to China should carry back to his post next month, the Army Ministry and the Foreign Ministry have agreed in principle, but concrete details have not yet been decided. The Japanese Embassy in China's Counselor, Kuwashima, is currently participating in a conference of Japanese consuls from various parts of North China being held in Tianjin. Shibayama, Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, and Nagatsu, Chief of the China Section of the General Staff Headquarters, are currently in Qingdao investigating military affairs. All three will provide important materials to prepare for the so-called new trends in China. After the three return from their investigation, the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Navy, and Army will conduct a detailed study of their reports on the recent situation in China, as well as the opinions of military attachés of the Japanese garrison, heads of special service organs, local consuls, and the Kwantung Army. Then, the final instructions will be drafted for Kawagoe to carry back to his post. It is widely rumored that the principles of the future instructions to Kawagoe will focus on the following points: Although the political relationship between China and Japan has fallen into a stalemate, commercial relations are unexpectedly satisfactory. The fact that Japan's exports to China in the first four months of this year increased by 50% compared to the same period last year can be noted. Therefore, the authorities believe that the occurrence of new friction should be prevented, and the current state of modest stability should be mutually maintained in order to gradually improve the situation. The Japanese government instructs Kawagoe to insist on the note presented to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 3rd of last year and to compel the Chinese government to implement the points contained in the note. However, the attitude and method of proceeding will be very different from those adopted by Kawagoe last autumn when he presented the seven demands. In addition, only smaller and easier-to-solve concrete problems will be sought for resolution, such as reducing tariff rates and opening an air route between Shanghai and Fukuoka. At the same time, Japan will guarantee to assist in stopping smuggling in North China and in making the Chinese tariff system complete, to demonstrate Japan's so-called spirit of reciprocity. Regarding the problems of eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, the government will instruct Kawagoe to try to avoid negotiating these issues with China. In short, the fundamental spirit of Japan's new policy toward China seems to be to seek the development of legitimate, gradual economic power on the basis of existing facts, while at the same time trying to adjust relations with China in conjunction with the adjustment of relations between Japan and Britain, and Japan and Russia.

### Sato Speaks on Diplomatic Aspirations

War is Not Beneficial to Japan

[Tokyo] The Tokyo Free Trade Association held a dinner party at the Bankers Club yesterday, inviting Foreign Minister Sato. The Foreign Minister spoke on his aspirations at the meeting as follows:

I believe that the starting point of Japan's diplomatic policy is to avoid war. War will never bring us benefits. Whether we win or lose, it will only bring us a tragic fate. However, if the honor and authority of our country are damaged, and when survival is at stake, then we must resolutely go to war. Once that time comes, no one will think that Sato is yielding to foreign countries. Therefore, before such an eventuality occurs, I still intend to take the normal path of diplomacy. However, how do we deal with the annual increase in population? In the end, the enrichment of domestic resources must be said to be the best way to solve the population problem. To achieve this goal, there is no other way but to demand the acquisition and development of overseas raw material resources and the opening of overseas commodity markets. Recognizing this demand is the path to peaceful construction and the elimination of war. The second Raw Materials and Resources Investigation Committee will be held in Geneva next month. I will instruct the Commercial Officer Suto to advocate the above demands. Currently, overseas trade is greatly hampered by various trade barriers. Countries should first show a fair attitude in trade in order to remove these obstacles, etc. (May 25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### Report on Soviet Aviation Team's Arctic Expedition

Sunlight Obscured by Heavy Snowstorm, Floating Ice Drifts at Half a Mile Per Hour

[Moscow] The leader of the Soviet Arctic Expedition, Schmidt, and his team of twelve arrived near the Arctic and set up camp on an ice floe to conduct scientific work. Today, they sent a message by wireless, saying that they are now drifting away from the Arctic at a speed of half a mile per hour. The Soviet government has prohibited three other expedition aircraft from carrying food from Rudol'f Island to that location, as the Arctic region is experiencing heavy snow and visibility is difficult, and they fear accidents. According to the wireless message sent by the expedition team, the Arctic sunlight is now completely obscured by heavy snowstorms. The ice floes are three inches thick and still stable, but the team has been slowly drifting away since landing on the floe twelve miles from the Arctic after flying over the Arctic last Friday. (May 25th National News Dispatch)

[Moscow] A wireless message has been received here from Academician Schmidt, stating: "Yesterday, the advance team of the expedition, consisting of thirteen people, listened to congratulatory telegrams from party and government leaders on a floating ice floe near the Arctic. We gathered in the airfield amidst a storm, but did not feel cold, because we were moved by the words and kindness of the great Stalin, and could almost feel the warm breath of our great motherland. We continued our work, and opened an ice hole to measure the thickness of the ice layer. After drilling for a long time, we learned that this ice floe is three meters thick, which is quite reliable. Until now, the ice floe on which we live has been blown by the wind to the west of the Rudolf Island path, traveling about half a mile per hour. We initially landed near the Arctic, but on the day of landing, that is, on the evening of May 21, our location was at 87 degrees west longitude and 89 degrees 41 minutes north latitude. After midnight on May 23, it moved to 58 degrees west longitude and 89 degrees 35 minutes north latitude. Since then, due to the trace of the sun, we have been unable to determine our location. As of now, the weather is still not suitable for other aircraft to come here. (May 25th TASS Dispatch)

[Washington] U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Westover, on behalf of the entire military, sent a telegram congratulating Soviet hero pilot Vodopyanov and all members of the Arctic expedition, stating: "This flight undoubtedly not only proves the great ability of pilot Vodopyanov and his team, but also demonstrates the glorious achievements of Soviet aviation designers and mechanics. This flight will shorten the route of the world's air routes." (May 24th TASS Dispatch)

[London] At 9:00 p.m. on May 23, British radio stations broadcast the first weather forecast from the Arctic. All newspapers published detailed news of the flight and the organization of the Arctic station.

### Britain Abandons Mediation of the Spanish Civil War

Both Sides of the Conflict Show No Regret, Britain Urges All Countries to Withdraw Volunteers

[Geneva] British officials at the League of Nations announced today that the plan to mediate the Spanish Civil War has now been virtually abandoned because both sides of the conflict in that country have expressed opposition. The British government, with the support of France, will do its best to establish an agreement between countries to implement the withdrawal of volunteers. (May 25th National News Dispatch)

Bayonne The Spanish Nationalist Army Command announced today that if the government forces do not surrender unconditionally, they will continue the war without mercy. This has firmly dispelled the possibility of a ceasefire in Spain. The attitude of the government forces is also very resolute, determined not to negotiate peace until the rebels are completely defeated. (May 24th Reuters Dispatch from Central News Agency)

[London] Regarding the British proposal for a temporary truce in Spain so that volunteers from various countries can freely withdraw, responsible persons recently declared that, according to news from various countries, this proposal has little hope of success. So far, only France has supported it without reservation. Germany has only expressed its approval in principle, but it is not known whether it will raise many reservations or objections in its reply. The Soviet Union will probably wait for the attitudes of Germany and Italy to become clear before submitting a reply. The Portuguese reply was sent to London yesterday, and its content points out all kinds of difficulties in implementing the British proposal, without mentioning anything else. As for the Italian reply, it will also express its approval in principle while raising some reservations. In addition, as far as the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War are concerned, the Nationalist Army has clearly expressed hostility towards the peace government, although not very resolutely, but it is also not conducive to the British proposal. People in the Republican government here also said that volunteers from various countries should be withdrawn first, and then peace talks can be discussed. It is generally believed that the issue of withdrawing volunteers can only be implemented after the Spanish Civil War has reached a stalemate and neither side has any hope of winning. At this time, the sub-committee of the Adjustment Committee is drafting technical withdrawal methods so that they can be implemented as soon as political obstacles are removed.

The Basques Have Not Yielded for 700 Years, If All Men Are Killed, Wives and Daughters Can Resist the Enemy

[London] The sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War decided today to call on both sides of the conflict in Spain to do their best to consider humanitarian concerns. (May 24th Reuters Dispatch from Central News Agency)

[Geneva] The Spanish National Government will publish a white paper on the 26th, detailing Italy's intervention in its internal turmoil since it broke out on July 15th of last year, and attaching photos and various documents seized from Italian prisoners as evidence. The former Spanish Foreign Minister, Vallejo, will also deliver a speech at the League of Nations Administrative Council. Well-informed sources claim that the content of the white paper is that although the Italian government has formally denied its support for the Nationalist military, it has actually continuously supplied the Nationalist military with weapons, ammunition, aircraft, pilots, and troops, and listed the circumstances of the Italian army participating in the war within Spanish territory. The Italian army has also occupied the western Spanish island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean Sea, and its warships are active in the southern waters of Spain. The fall of the port of Malaga was due to these warships. Most of the various documents attached to the white paper were seized from Italian prisoners on the front line of Guadalajara Province, while other parts were confessions from Italian prisoners. Their content is related to the front-line battles in Biscay Province and the Nationalist bombing of Guernica. (May 25th Havas Dispatch from Central News Agency)

£410,000 per year, Opposition Motion Rejected

[London] Today, the House of Commons discussed the royal expenses bill. First, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain gave an explanation, saying that the total royal expenses amount to £400,000 per year. Opposition leader Attlee moved an amendment to limit the royal expenses regulations to one year, criticizing the royal family for still emphasizing pomp and ceremony, and saying that the British King's daily life should not be exaggerated in ceremonial discussions. Churchill then spoke, hoping that Attlee would not insist on this motion, saying that in recent weeks, there have been absolutely clear indications that the majority of all parties are willing to keep the solemn ceremonies associated with the monarch, etc., and should not be omitted. Liberal leader Sinclair said that he believes that the monarch is fulfilling his important duties, but the general public generally believes that a simpler plan should be applied to the monarchy. Then, Attlee's motion was put to a vote and rejected by 204 to 102 votes. Subsequently, the monetary resolution on royal expenses was unanimously passed. The second resolution regarding the revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall was also unanimously passed.

A reporter stationed in Berlin for the Daily News recently declared that commercial treaty negotiations between France and Germany have been going on for a long time without reaching an agreement. The French government now intends to sever economic relations between the two sides and has notified the German government that if the current negotiations break down, the iron ore produced by France will no longer be sold to Germany.

If so, then the issues between Germany and France, especially the German-French economic negotiations, will undoubtedly be the subject of discussion. Dr. Schacht is scheduled to return to Germany on May 27. (May 24th National Maritime News Agency Dispatch)

### Roosevelt Suggests Congress Improve Laborer's Lives

Regulations for Maximum Working Hours and Minimum Wages Seek Social Progress to Reach an Ideal State

[Washington] President Roosevelt recently submitted a message to Congress, suggesting that Congress pass a new federal bill to control the labor conditions in various states. Its contents include the following four items: ㊀ Limiting weekly working hours, ㊁ Establishing a minimum wage, ㊂ Prohibiting child labor, ㊃ Regulations for the circulation of industrial products between states. (May 24th Havas Dispatch from Central News Agency)

[Washington] President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, requesting "the expansion of the realm of social progress" and the implementation of active standards regarding wages and working hours for American workers. In order to achieve this goal, the President advocated that the workers' treatment when manufacturing goods for interstate trade must meet the highest standards, otherwise it must be prohibited. After receiving the President's message, government leaders in Congress immediately formally moved the President's proposal in both the Senate and the House of Representatives by Senators Black and Representative Connolly. However, the proposal did not specify the minimum wage and working hours, which will probably be decided when the committee reviews them. The President said in his message that the initial standards he proposed were far from ideal, so if the initial standards are established, efforts must be made to create fair and reasonable minimum wage standards that can be adapted to the conditions in various places. The President also asked the states to cooperate, because one-third of the American people still lack adequate food and clothing, and he firmly believes that this plan is suitable for the national constitution. (May 24th National News Dispatch)

[Washington] The contents of the proposals in the Senate and House of Representatives are roughly as follows:

㊀ The maximum weekly working hours should be from 35 hours to 40 hours, depending on the circumstances of each industry. The minimum wage should be set at 40 cents per hour. ㊁ Each factory should have a general management office, organized by five people. In addition, there should be an advisory department. ㊂ No factory may reduce its weekly working hours to less than 35 hours, but temporary workers may work more than 40 hours per week, and overtime wages should be paid at one and a half times the original rate. ㊃ The maximum wage should be set at 80 cents per hour and $1,200 per year. ㊄ Factories may hire apprentices. ㊅ Factories are prohibited from taking work home. ㊆ Factories with fewer than 15 workers are not subject to this law. According to various congressmen, the purpose of this new law is to enrich the labor unions' rights to organize workers stipulated in the Wagner Labor Act. President Roosevelt notified congressional leaders today to put aside other documents so that this law can be passed as soon as possible. (May 23rd National News Dispatch)

[Washington] President Roosevelt's message to the Senate regarding the problem of hard labor was commented on by Democratic Senator Guffey, who said, "I would like to express my sympathy for President Roosevelt's methods and purposes." Farmer-Labor Senator Norris said, "This is the best way to prevent unemployment." Republican Representative Taibai did not think so, saying, "This will cause several million people to lose their jobs. Soon everyone will recognize this as the most regressive suggestion of the government." Republican Representative Snail said, "I am quite shocked. Where is the so-called great progress that President Roosevelt talked about?" (May 24th Reuters Dispatch from Central News Agency)

### Did Someone Carry a Handgun to Assassinate Roosevelt?

West Liberty, Kentucky At a school in West Liberty, Kentucky, today, President Roosevelt attended the opening ceremony and gave a speech to thousands of people. One person in the audience was carrying a handgun and was arrested by detectives. He was then released on bail. President Roosevelt initially did not know about it. After the speech, he was informed of the matter. The arrest of this person was because several bystanders saw that he was carrying a heavy weapon under his clothes and reported it to the detectives, who searched him.

### Paris Exposition Officially Opened Yesterday

French President Lebrun Delivers Opening Address, Hopes to Promote International Understanding

[Paris] The International Exposition of Modern Life Art and Technology held its official opening ceremony this afternoon in the auditorium of the venue. Those attending were government ministers, dignitaries from the diplomatic community, delegations from various countries, and celebrities from all walks of life, totaling more than 5,000 people. President Lebrun delivered a brief opening speech, which roughly stated, "In the name of the French Republic, I extend my sincere thanks to the countries participating in the exposition. The fact that several countries have responded to our invitation to participate in this grand event of modern life art and technology has greatly added glory to France and Paris, which is something we should be grateful for and never forget." The President then expressed his hope that the results of this exposition would be sufficient to promote mutual understanding and respect among nations. The General Commissioner of the Exposition, Le Blanc, followed with a speech, saying that this exposition is sufficient to consolidate world peace, just like the ancient Greek Olympic Games. Representatives from all over the world gather together, which is sufficient to enhance mutual feelings among nations. Compared with the Paris Exposition of 1900, the display of foreign products is more important in terms of quality and quantity, which is particularly gratifying. Finally, he said, "Paris is now dressed in its incomparably beautiful new attire and is waiting for foreign guests to visit." Then, the Italian Commissioner to the Exposition, Bissi, delivered a speech on behalf of all foreign guests, saying that the Exposition is a venue for international festivities and a place to display human labor and virtue. French Commerce Minister Bastard also delivered a speech, forcefully stating that the Exposition is the crystallization of art and technology, the common achievement of artists, scientists, and ordinary laborers, and that the free contact between nations is an important condition for the world economic organization, and he hoped that this point could be proven by this Exposition. In the afternoon, President Lebrun, accompanied by many cabinet members and guests, took a steamboat to cruise along the Seine River and inspected the entire panorama of the Exposition for a week. Hundreds of newly built buildings on the west bank of the Seine River were magnificent and unlike anything seen before. Finally, after the President finished the tour, he returned to the public house. The spectators on the roadside applauded and cheered. According to reports, today's exposition only held the opening ceremony. It will officially open tomorrow. However, because some of the exhibition halls must wait until noon tomorrow to be completed, the public will only be allowed to enter the venue for a tour in the afternoon tomorrow.

### A Bird's-Eye View of the Exhibition Grounds

[Paris] The World's Fair grounds are located on the banks of the Seine River, with over a hundred pavilions arranged in close proximity. They are divided between both banks, stretching for four kilometers. The entrance consists of sixty gates, among which are located the exhibit hall of ancient art and a model theater. Nearby is the exhibit hall of modern art. Various artistic treasures belonging to the French government and the city of Paris are currently exhibited in different locations but will be combined and displayed here in the future. Across the Seine River on the Left Bank, opposite the Palais de Chaillot and the Champ de Mars, is the center for modern living arts and technologies. Publications, movies, wireless radio, photography, phonographs, and various other items are located there. Foreign pavilions are situated at both ends of the Pont d'Iéna. The Soviet pavilion occupies a large area on the right bank of the river, with statues of workers and farmers holding hammers and sickles on the roof. The German pavilion faces it across the way, bearing an eagle and the swastika emblem of the Nazi Party. The Japanese pavilion is located behind the Soviet pavilion. On the opposite bank are the exhibits from various French provinces and colonies, adjacent to the navigation, industry, and railway exhibits. (Havas News Agency, 24th)

### Vice-Chairman Feng Talks About Commemorating the Anti-Japanese Allied Army of Chahar Province

The Spirit of the Anti-Japanese Soldiers Is Worth Continuing – Drive Out the Robbers and Recover Our Territory and Sovereignty

Tai'an Dispatch, 26th of this month, is the fourth anniversary of the oath-taking of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army of Chahar. Nanjing and Mount Tai are planning to hold grand commemorative meetings. Mr. Feng Huanzhang, who was the commander of the Allied Army at that time, happened to be visiting Tai'an. A reporter from the Central News Agency immediately went to pay respects and was granted an audience. Mr. Feng was wearing a yellow military uniform, which made him appear even more robust and energetic. He spoke amicably for about half an hour before the interview ended. The collected remarks are summarized below.

Thoughts on the Allied Army

The reporter began by saying, "We know some of the history of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army of Chahar, but there are still some unclear areas. Could Mr. Feng briefly tell us about the reasons for its formation, the process, and your thoughts?" Mr. Feng immediately replied, "Certainly," and began to speak. He said, "When I think about the anniversary, the first thing I feel is that we received help from many soldiers and civilians, and fortunately, we recovered the four counties in eastern Chahar. However, I personally did not make any great contribution and there is nothing worth commemorating. However, the spirit of the thousands of soldiers who died or were injured is worth commemorating, and the unfinished task is worth our continued effort."

The Formation of the Allied Army

"Let me give you an analogy. While we are talking here, if some robbers suddenly came, not only stealing everything they see but also killing people outright, what do you think we should do? Should we let them slaughter and rob us without resistance, or should we seek help from neighbors and friends? Should we run away, or should we pick up teapots, teacups, tables, and chairs and fight them? I think, of course, the last option is the most appropriate and the most effective. The formation of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army was exactly this kind of situation. At that time, our national enemies seized the three northeastern provinces, burned and plundered Shanghai, occupied Jehol, ravaged the area around the Great Wall, and successively occupied Dolon, Guyuan, Lianbao, and Heshibao, which were only 150 miles away from Zhangjiakou. The people of Zhangjiakou, the local national army, and the volunteer army that retreated from the Northeast were either filled with righteous indignation or at a loss, and the situation was very dangerous. I have always recognized the enemy's tricks: they bully the weak and fear the strong, and they yield to force but not to persuasion. The more you give in, the more they will bully and intimidate you with all sorts of tricks, unless we become slaves who lose our country and our race according to their wishes. In October of the twenty-first year, I lived in Zhangjiakou. At that time, some friends advised me to leave to avoid danger, but even though I was living there in retirement, how could I run away, abandoning the land and my brothers and sisters, when the national enemy was attacking us? Therefore, I resolutely accepted the demands of the military and civilians, organized the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and stayed together with the local military and civilians, fulfilling the duty of a citizen to defend the country."

The Course of Resistance

"The organizational components of the Allied Army included four parts: first, the national army, such as the troops of Tong Lingge and Peng Guozheng who were stationed in Zhangyuan of the Twenty-ninth Army; second, the volunteer army, such as the troops of Deng Wen and Li Zhongyi; third, the militia, such as the Chahar People's Self-Defense Army led by Zhang Lisheng; and fourth, the troops of Liu Guitang who defected from the puppet army. These tens of thousands of people, who were hungry, cold, and of mixed backgrounds, united and invigorated under the spirit of resisting the enemy and recovering our territory. The first step was to protect Zhangjiakou, and the second step was to recover Kangbao on June 22, and Baochang and Zhanyuan on July 1. Then, we prepared to recover Dolon, the important military, political, and economic town in northern Chahar. From July 4, when the vanguards made contact, to July 7, when the fierce attacks began, we fought fiercely for five days and nights because the Japanese and puppet troops were strongly defended. At 10:00 AM on the 12th, we completely recovered Dolon, which had been lost for seventy-two days, and restored the integrity of Chahar Province. In this battle, 312 officers and soldiers were killed, 453 were seriously injured (including one regimental commander), and 927 were slightly injured, for a total of over 1,600 casualties. These martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country were truly magnificent. Not only were their guns and equipment inferior and their supplies insufficient, but some even wore leather clothes and hats in the hot summer. However, the value of their sacrifice was very great. Their value was the recovery of 600,000 square miles of territory."

The Meaning of the Fourth Anniversary

"The achievements of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army at that time were as described above, such magnificent achievements, so it is worthy of our commemoration. And the firm belief at that time was that the guns of the whole country must be pointed at the enemy in unison. This condition has the hope of being achieved on the fourth anniversary of the Allied Army. To give another analogy, the enemy's aggression against us has not only not stopped but has also become more cunning. They want to use the basis of possessing the looted objects to further plunder us. However, we are like a family that has been robbed. Although the robbers have broken into the front door, we have temporarily held them back at the second gate. We should take this opportunity to call upon our family members as much as possible, contact our neighbors and friends, and purchase, manufacture, and organize various weapons to concentrate manpower and financial resources. Everyone must deeply recognize and support the central government, unite in spirit, and all troops, all financial resources, and all spirits must be under unified leadership in order to drive the robbers out of the house, recover all the looted territory and sovereignty, and complete the goal of freedom and equality that the Premier has shown. This is the meaning of our commemoration of the Allied Army, and it is also the consistent understanding and effort that our country, from top to bottom, should have today." (Central News Agency)

### Foreign Warships Conduct Covert Operations in the Waters of Huian, Southern Fujian

Arbitrary Surveying and Photography, Receiving Bulky Objects

Xiamen Dispatch: In the Weitou waters of Jinjiang County, Quanzhou, there was an incident last month where warships from several countries were secretly surveying the coast. On the 21st of this month, at dawn, a foreign warship was discovered on the Tutu waters of Huian County, about five miles from Houzhu. The warship was dark gray, narrow, long, and low. It had radio antennas crisscrossing on board, and black smoke billowed from its twin chimneys. Eight fishermen who were netting fish near the sandbar thought it was strange, so they sailed closer to the warship, about a hundred paces away, and observed it. They saw three young men in Western suits on the deck, one tall and two short. Two of them had tripods and telescopes set up on the deck, looking towards the western shore in the distance. Another person was using a handheld camera to take pictures of the deck, as if they were surveying and photographing. After about half an hour, a sailboat sailed towards them and approached the warship. More than ten people dressed as workers immediately jumped off the sailboat, carried six large square wooden boxes onto the warship. Each box required seven or eight people to lift, and they seemed to be bulky objects. After unloading, the sailboat turned its rudder and sailed east very quickly. The warship also sailed away at about five o'clock. Also, in the Xiutu area, such as Fashi, Dongxing, and Weishan villages, there have recently been people dressed in rags with foreign accents carrying leather briefcases, calling out to exchange old silver and small change. Others carry loads on their shoulders, buying broken copper and scrap iron door-to-door at high prices. Even the iron rings on the doors of rural residences have often been stolen recently. (May 23)

### Prospects for Zhejiang Province's Finances

The following is a summary of the report by Zhu Jiaju, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, to the first Committee on Final Accounts:

"I have spoken briefly about the past financial difficulties of this province and how to improve them in the future during the first and second meetings of the Financial Research Committee. There are also research reports from Mr. Liang Jingxian and Mr. Zhou Shouliang, which I believe everyone has already read. I believe that after implementing my current considerations and the recommendations in the reports during this year, the finances of this province will definitely be greatly improved within one year. Moreover, the banking community and the Ministry of Railways and Communications in this province are earnestly understanding the financial difficulties of this province and have expressed their willingness to provide as much assistance as possible. Therefore, in the next year, the finances of this province can at least breathe a sigh of relief, and fundamental reorganization will definitely be successful in the future.

What we feel most difficult now is to look at the revenue numbers directly managed by the Finance Department. The revenue in a normal year is only about 18 million, but the debt alone accounts for 6-7 million of the expenditure. Even if we say less, removing 6 million, only 12 million can actually be spent. However, ordinary administrative expenses (including counties and commissioners), education expenses, judicial expenses, security expenses, and police expenses borne by the provincial treasury (inland rivers, outer seas, provincial capital) alone already exceed the actual available expenditure by a large margin. Even if we want to tighten our belts and reduce salaries by cutting and discounting, I am afraid we cannot reduce much. Because this province has convenient transportation, developed areas, and a relatively high general standard of living, with a population of 21 million and 75 county units, if we hope that politics can truly get on the right track, I am afraid that under the austerity policy, there are still places where we cannot ignore the facts. Therefore, if we can ensure that next year, although we still owe debts, we do not increase the debt burden compared to this year, that will already be our success.

In terms of increasing revenue, in addition to actively striving for production and construction, in terms of taxation, we can only streamline our efforts and improve financial administration so that every penny goes to the public. We will reorganize tax collection without increasing tax rates or creating new taxes. This way, the burden on the people does not need to be increased, and the revenue of the province can be expected to be abundant. As for hoping that the finances of this province will truly have a solution, we need to cultivate tax sources, which means we need to talk about actively developing production industries. The heavy industry in this province is limited by raw materials, so there is not much hope. Therefore, our construction can only be based on agriculture. I attach great importance to the improvement of water conservancy. First, we have restored the original Water Conservancy Bureau and gradually made a comprehensive plan for water conservancy in this province and strived to implement it. In addition to focusing on water conservancy, I now want to take silkworms and fisheries as the central industries for production and construction in this province. This province has always been the main area for silkworms. We can now use this existing historical and geographical environment to create a textile industry center, at least starting with further efforts in improving seeds. We expect to achieve the goal of providing all the improved seeds needed by the province by ourselves in the 28th year. (We want to establish a sericulture research institute next year to conduct pure scientific research on silkworm breeding from the perspective of cell genetics and to improve mulberry planting from the perspective of plant breeding). Now we cannot completely weave silkworms into silk to supply others. At least the first step is to be able to supply semi-manufactured products to markets outside the province. So I have already notified the Sericulture Control Committee to first make a plan for ten silk factories. On the one hand, we also want to promote cotton weaving, wool weaving, rayon, wool, etc. According to the report of the 25th year, the cotton produced in Zhejiang ranks seventh in the country. A considerable cotton textile industry is still needed in this province. The Cotton Textile Experiment Hall of the Academia Sinica has already drafted a plan for a cotton textile factory with 100,000 spindles and attached looms. In terms of wool weaving, this province is certainly not a wool-producing area, but when we think of the export of wool, doesn't part of the wool used by the Weihua Wool Weaving Factory in Shanghai come from Jiahu wool? Therefore, we are now planning to set up a woolen mill and have discussed it with many experts. In terms of rayon, we are also planning to set up a manufacturing plant with an output of 3 to 5 tons. I intend to use the silk weaving industry as the center and the weaving of cotton, wool, and rayon as auxiliary to create the foundation of the textile industry in this province. (To be continued)

### Kunshan

Various Organizations Retain the Party Committee

Zhu Jingzhi, the special commissioner for clearing up matters of this county, was ordered to switch places with Zhu Xuedian, the special commissioner of Baoshan. Various public organizations and lower-level party branches in this county, upon hearing this news, believed that Commissioner Zhu had been in office for more than two years, leading the people and promoting party governance, and that the public was pleased with him. They jointly appealed to the provincial party headquarters the other day to revoke the order and respect public opinion.

### Suzhou

Cocoon Dealers Open Scales One After Another

The spring silkworm industry in various villages in Wu County has successively started cocooning, with the earliest cocooning already taking place yesterday. The county's 46 cocoon dealers, three of them have already opened scales to collect cocoons on the 25th. The rest will open scales around today and tomorrow. Cocoons are expected to fetch a high price, around thirty-seven or thirty-eight per picul. It is said that the spring cocoon harvest this year is still good, and the cocoons are also of good quality.

The Xuan Sheng Case is Reopened for Debate

In the case of the Japanese national Xuan Sheng's mining work in Shanghai, Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Jin Daoquan, Zhu Shusheng, Chen Siming, and others refused to accept the original judgment of the Shanghai District Court and appealed to the High Court. After approval by the High Court, the defendants were brought to Suzhou. The Third Criminal Court of the High Court has held court several times and the debate has ended. The original plan was to pronounce the verdict at 4:00 PM on the 25th. However, because the case still needed to be further investigated, Judge Wu brought the defendants to court and announced that the debate was terminated and that it would be reopened for debate at a later date. The defendants were still sent back to prison.

### Changzhou

Spring Silkworm Harvest is Still Good

Although the weather has been warm and cold at times in the four villages of Wu County this year, there have been no drastic changes, and the harvest is expected to be still good. Native species are mostly cocooning, and improved species are mostly sleeping and growing leaves. There are more cocoon scales opening in this county than in previous years. More than 100 cocoon scales have registered in the improved area, with more than 1,700 cocoon stoves. The improved area has submitted a report to the province for verification. The Provincial Construction Department instructed to verify and approve 1,500 cocoon stoves. The more than 200 stoves that exceeded the limit would be randomly selected and opposed according to regulations. However, there are practical difficulties in doing so, so they discussed solutions with the Cocoon Industry Association. The Cocoon Industry Association decided to convene a meeting to discuss the matter and then give a reply and handle it.

Petition Regarding Salt Workers' Demands for Transportation is Inquired Into

The Shiwei Salt Union previously pushed its representatives to Yangzhou to ask officials and merchants to rush the transportation of salt within a time limit because the salt ponds were empty and there was no salt to produce. It was decided that the companies in Jinan would rush the transportation, with a minimum of 400,000 bags stored for reserve. The representatives were satisfied and returned. However, even when the salt boats arrived at the ponds, it was still not enough for distribution, and the production was stopped again. The workers blamed the union for being fooled by the merchants' written reply, which was perfunctory. They decided to ask the merchants to pay attention to the fact that those waiting to produce salt could not be stopped and that there should always be 5 million bags stored as a guarantee of work. If the merchants did not accept, they decided to go to Beijing and Yangzhou to present their petition. The Field Merchants Association has received a letter from the union requesting the field merchants to comply, and it is said that they have also sent telegrams to various agencies in Beijing, the province, and Yangzhou to state the previous reasons and make the same request.

### Hangzhou

Hangyu Section of the Railway Track Replacement is Postponed

The replacement of heavy tracks on the Hangyu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, originally scheduled to begin in June, is now postponed because a large batch of materials ordered from abroad, the steel rails alone amount to about 10,000 tons, and the ties were previously transported by American sailors, but later, due to increased shipping costs, no suitable ships could be found. Recently, a telegram was received from the American company stating that it is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of August and then be transported to the construction site. The fastest time to start work is around mid-September. Steel beams were originally banned from export by Germany and were reordered from the United States, and it is expected to arrive in July. Therefore, the track replacement will be delayed until the end of this year. The Nanping section project is actively underway. The earthwork has been fully completed, and 70% of the bridges have been completed. The transportation of track-laying materials is more difficult. Now, ties are being purchased locally in Jiangxi for application to provide assistance. It can be fully completed and open to traffic by the end of July.

Various Counties Supplement Summer and Autumn Silkworm Breeding

This year, the spring cocoons in various counties of Zhejiang Province have generally been a poor harvest due to the impact of the weather. The harvest of improved species is about 60%, and the native species are only about 40%. Due to the small yield, merchants are competing to buy, and the price of improved cocoons has risen to 50 yuan per picul, and the price of native cocoons has also approached 40 yuan. Farmers are not losing money. The provincial authorities plan to greatly promote the breeding of improved species in the summer and autumn to compensate for the small harvest of spring cocoons. According to reports from various counties, 100,000 sheets of summer silkworm seeds are needed, and staff have been sent to purchase them from Jiangsu Province. About 70,000 sheets can be supplied. It is planned to expand to 1.5 million sheets in the autumn. Jiangsu Province will supply 600,000 sheets, and the cocoon factory in this province plans to supply 800,000 sheets.

### Zhide

Black Tea Quality Increases

The black tea produced in Qimen, Fule, and Zhide counties is commonly known as Qi Hong. However, Zhide tea merchants have traditionally not known how to improve the operation of black tea, resulting in less popular sales of finished products. After the establishment of an inspection office in this planting area, inspections were implemented. The factory supervisors, heads of farms, and tea masters of each tea factory mostly followed the guidance and made improvements. Although there was too much rain at the end of last month, the tea produced did not have any musty, charred, or smoky odors, and the quality was higher than in the past. The first batch of black tea, more than 5,530 boxes, has been loaded and transported out of the country.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern,

The Changshu Dispatch "Power Plant Plans to Purchase Electricity from Outside" news published in your newspaper on the 22nd is inconsistent with the facts.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Statistics for the 24th Year of the Republic: Yangtze and Sea Voyages

Coal Consumption Gradually Decreasing, Showing Progress: 7,543,000 Nautical Miles

Shipping companies in various Western countries attach great importance to the voyage mileage of sea vessels and have annual statistics. Our country has rarely paid attention to this. Since the reorganization of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, there has been significant progress in the voyage mileage of all Yangtze and sea vessels. The coal consumption of each vessel has also been relatively reduced. According to the bureau's investigation, in the 24th year of the Republic of China, all 23 Yangtze and sea vessels traveled a total of 7,543,000 nautical miles throughout the year, burning 96,513.5 tons of coal. In the 25th year, 23 Yangtze and sea vessels traveled a total of 8,374,471 nautical miles, using 103,238.5 tons of coal. On average, each nautical mile consumed 0.127 tons of coal in the 24th year and decreased to 0.123 tons in the 25th year. According to the Four Seas vessels, each vessel travels approximately 50,000 to 56,000 nautical miles per year, while Yangtze River vessels such as the Jiangshun and Jiang'an travel approximately 40,000 to 42,000 nautical miles per year.

### Bogomolov Lectures on the New Soviet Constitution

International Research Institute and Others Jointly Host Banquet, Analyzing the Contents of the New Constitution in Detail

The International Problems Research Association, jointly with the Pacific League and the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, held a luncheon meeting at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon and invited Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Mr. Bogomolov, to speak on "The Problem of the New Soviet Constitution." Those who attended, in addition to Mr. and Mrs. Bogomolov, included Li Zhaohuan, Chairman of the International Problems Research Association, Mr. and Mrs. Su Xin, Commercial Officer of the French Embassy, Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell, President of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. and Mrs. Niskanen, Finnish Consul General in Shanghai, Mrs. Spiranova, Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. and Mrs. Smansky, Vice Consul, and Qian Xinzhi, Liu Hongsheng, He Dekui, Zou Bingwen, Dai Zhiqian, Yan Fuqing, Wen Yuanning, Xu Peihuang, Xia Jinlin, Chen Heqin, Wu Jingxiong, Lu Bohong, Zhu Shaoping, Liu Shifang, Miao Zhongxiu, Liu Huarui, Jiang Jianbai, Dai Baobao, Cheng Haifeng, Huang Zongdong, and more than 200 Chinese and Western guests. The scene was bustling and lively. During the meeting, Chairman Li Zhaohuan presided over and delivered an introductory speech, saying that the Soviet Union is our neighbor, with a vast territory and abundant resources. In recent years, various constructions have made rapid progress. On December 5 last year, the Eighth Soviet Extraordinary Congress decided to promulgate a new constitution, which has attracted the attention of scholars around the world. The International Problems Research Association and other groups in this city specially invited the Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Mr. Bogomolov, to come here to speak on the spirit of the constitution, so that those who are concerned about international affairs can participate. Then Ambassador Bao gave a speech, saying that since the founding of the Soviet Union, nearly twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye, and the international community's lack of understanding of the Soviet Union remains the same as before. I have always regarded this as a great regret, but since the promulgation of the new Soviet Russian Constitution at the end of last year, I have deeply felt that the general public in China has a clear understanding of the important nature of the constitution. I am also very happy. Looking at the editorial of the Shen Bao on December 5 last year, it said that the completion of this new constitution is the fruit of the successful social construction of the Soviet Union in the past ten years. The implementation of this democratic new constitution not only has great significance internally, but also has great effect externally, because in this world where fascist forces are rampant, democratic politics has become the end of the crossbow, but now a new force has been added, which has great contribution to the maintenance of world peace, and this amendment of the Soviet Union's constitution makes it easier for it to get closer to the three major democratic countries of Britain, France and the United States, forming a grand alliance of democratic countries to cope with the aggressive behavior of international fascism. The impact on the international political situation is also very significant. This shows that the Chinese people have a clear understanding of the existence of the facts. The progress of the Soviet Union in recent years is amazing. The agricultural products in 1936 increased by one and a half times compared with the period of the European War. The industrial products in the same year also increased by more than seven times. In terms of value, the increase in industrial output in that year was worth 1.9 billion rubles. Compared with the products of other industrial countries, in 1935, the Soviet Union's machine industry products ranked first in Europe and second in the world, electricity ranked second in the world, coal production ranked third in Europe, iron ore ranked second, oil ranked first in Europe, wheat and sugar ranked first, and gold mines also ranked first. The result of the rapid development of industry is that on the one hand, the Soviet Union's economic and political status is becoming more and more consolidated, and on the other hand, the domestic cultural life is becoming more and more beautiful. The importance of material construction can be seen here. As for the completion of the new Soviet Constitution, Stan's contribution is very great, because the drafting and formulation of the Constitution are directly related to Stan, so it is also called the Stanlin Constitution. If we compare it with the Constitution of 1924, we can know that the Constitution of 1924 deeply possesses the transitional color of marching towards socialism on that day, while the new Constitution directly indicates that the socialist economic structure of the Soviet Union is an undeniable fact. The main characteristics of the new constitution are nothing more than the principle of "each according to his ability, each according to his need". In today's Soviet Union, there is actually no class. The workers and peasants no longer have the ills of mutual hatred and mutual crushing. The welfare of the workers is the welfare of the peasants, and the poison of the peasants is also the poison of the workers. Therefore, there is no class struggle phenomenon. I still remember that before the new constitution was passed by the Eighth Soviet Congress, from June to December last year, the people of the Soviet Union, whether in factories or rural areas, had to freely discuss and express their opinions. As a result of the discussion, the Central Executive Committee received thousands of concrete suggestions. The establishment of the new constitution is the most democratic constitution in the world. As far as the election qualifications are concerned, Article 135 of the constitution stipulates that all citizens who have reached the age of 18, regardless of their race, creed, educational level, or property status, have the right to participate in the election and to be elected. Article 137 stipulates that women enjoy the same rights as men in elections and to be elected. As for the basic rights of citizens, including the right to work, the right to rest, and the right to material security when old, sick, or incapacitated, Article 125 also stipulates that the law grants Soviet citizens the following guarantees, such as freedom of speech, ㊁ freedom of publication, ㊂ freedom of association and assembly, ㊃ freedom of parade and demonstration, etc. As for the organization of the Soviet state, it currently includes a republic, and these affiliated countries retain the right to freely withdraw from the Soviet Union. Finally, regarding the status of Soviet women, in law, economy, politics, and culture, women enjoy absolutely equal rights with men. The progress of Soviet women in recent years is truly amazing. Not only are there more than 400 female representatives in the Eighth National Soviet Congress, but also women hold important positions in politics. Article 122 of the new constitution further stipulates that "the state's protection of motherhood shall grant pregnant women holidays with pay and establish widespread maternity hospitals, nurseries, and kindergartens, etc." The Soviet Union's maintenance of women's interests can be seen here, so that women and men can have equal opportunities to move towards socialism and seek true happiness for mankind.

### Zhu Qinglan Cables Gansu Province Disaster Situation

The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association of this city recently received a cable from Zhu Qinglan, which reads: (Wei Lvehao cable reports that Ma Yang's two cables have been received, and I am fully aware of the huge amount of money you have raised and borrowed, which will be distributed to various provinces. I am extremely grateful for your benevolent donation and continue to urge the Gansu Province relief donation to be remitted to the Beijing Relief Association in Lanzhou. The disaster in Gansu is particularly severe in the Hexi region, where the remaining inhabitants are living in a living hell. The Social Supervision Commissioner Shao Peng has been appointed to supervise all the Social Supervision Staff, and the province has selected county inspectors and county inspectors have selected district inspectors to train them, strictly implementing the Social Relief Regulations set by the Association. In addition to the Beijing Association sending the Gansu Province disaster reports for verification, the disaster reports sent by the counties along the Hexi route are being sent by post. Please review them. Lan You Ri Fei Ning Xia will then transfer to Southern Shaanxi and return. Zhu Qinglan respectfully kowtows. The Association also received a cable from the Task Committee yesterday reporting on the disaster in Gansu Province, which reads: It has been found that in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the counties of Zhengning, Huanxian, Ningxian, Qingyang, and Heshui in eastern Gansu were occupied by bandits such as Yang Sen and Liu Zidan. By last year, bandit leaders Mao Zedong and Peng Dehuai led tens of thousands of people from Sichuan to Gansu. After passing through Hanxian, Weiyuan, Xihe, and Gangu, bandit leader Xu Haidong fled from southern Shaanxi into Gansu and joined forces with Mao Peng and other bandits. They occupied Qingyang counties in eastern Gansu and joined forces with Liu Zidan, Yang Sen, and other groups, gaining great momentum. The damage was severe, either occupying and searching or looting and hanging. Many strong men and women were coerced. The people's food reserves, cattle, horses, and mules were all plundered. Those who were killed because of resistance were even more tragic. It is estimated that 45 counties were ravaged by the Communist bandits. 237,881 people died, 2,155,485 yuan worth of food was lost, and 10,376,032 yuan worth of livestock was lost. The disaster-stricken population was 2,591,851. Other losses of houses and property are even more difficult to calculate. In addition, the disaster situation in Gansu Province has been frequent in recent years, and the disaster this year is particularly serious. It has been repeatedly hit by drought, wind, hail, and earthquakes, and the weather has been greatly damaged. If relief is not planned in advance, the remaining inhabitants after the disaster will have no way to survive. It is requested that people from all walks of life show compassion and provide generous relief.

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce Cables Rejection of Liu River Transfer

The Resources Committee has replied by letter, agreeing to transfer it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for joint handling. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Coal Industry Association, saying: The Shanghai Coal Industry Association has read the Qi Dai telegram and the Resources Committee has forwarded the association's Hao telegram. The Ministry has learned from various newspapers that the Liujiang Company intends to sell the mining rights and all assets to Taiji, etc. The Ministry has previously notified the Liujiang Company that if the above situation occurs, the Ministry will definitely reject it. Please be informed. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce also learned that the Liujiang Company authorities have expressed their willingness to comply with the orders of the central government.

### During the Emergency Relief for Sichuan Disaster, Provincial Government Still Levies Taxes

The Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association Telegraphed the Provincial Government to Strictly Order All Counties to Release Detained People

The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai received reports from various parties in Sichuan that during this emergency relief period, various counties in the disaster area are still collecting various taxes and old debts, and often detain people. This is contrary to the purpose of helping the people. Therefore, at 4 PM yesterday (the 25th), a meeting was convened at the association's meeting place. Li Dongfu, Li Qingfan, Mei Xinru, Yang Jifu, Fan Zhongqu, Zhuang Julu, Gui Rongfen, Lu Feng, Tang De'an, Tang Jinbai, Li Boshen, Zhang Shulin, Lei Yuchun, Pu Fengma, Zheng Yushu, Xiao Yanbin, Yang Dequan, Yang Zehuan and other more than 30 people attended. Ji Qingfan presided over the meeting and Yang Zehuan recorded it. The following important cases were discussed and decided: ㊀ Telegraph the provincial government to consider the severity of the disaster and order all counties to release the people detained for arrears of taxes. ㊁ Regarding the million-dollar bond relief donation, a letter should be sent to Juxingcheng Bank to request a detailed reply on when it will be remitted and where it will be remitted to dispel doubts. ㊂ The two Fellow-Provincials Associations in Beijing and Shanghai should notify each other of important cases discussed and decided in the future. Ren Hongjun, the president of Sichuan University, resigned, and the Association should telegraph the Ministry of Education to pay attention to the selection of successors. The meeting adjourned at the appropriate time. Attached is a telegraph to the Sichuan Provincial Government: Chengdu Chairman Liu's Xunjian, the Sichuan disaster is serious and emergency relief is being implemented. Your government will issue a notice that the collection of grain taxes will be suspended from May onwards to show compassion. However, various parties report that various counties in the disaster area are still actively collecting taxes and often detain those who are in arrears, sometimes more than hundreds of people. Each person is charged an押费 (detention fee) of 5 jiao or 1 yuan per day. If this is the case, how can emergency relief be supplemented? It is requested that your government issue another strict order to all counties that all taxes and old debts should be suspended, and those who were detained for arrears of taxes in the past should also be released during the pacification and collection period to save the lives of all people and comply with previous orders. The telegraph is urgent, and a reply is awaited. Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association respectfully kowtows.

According to the technician of the Taikoo Shipyard, who is responsible for the rescue, the Haiyuan ship is expected to float to the surface today and be towed to the shipyard for repair. The bureau immediately forwarded the telegram to the Ministry for reporting. On the one hand, Zhou Hengfu, an engineer of the bureau, was dispatched to Hong Kong on the President Coolidge of the Da Lai Company today to be the commissioner for supervising the construction of the Haiyuan ship.

### 江靖 Steamer Aground

Awaiting High Tide for Towing

The Jiangjing steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, returning to Shanghai from Hankou, unloaded all its cargo and passengers yesterday morning. It then set off to anchor near the Hongchang Machinery Factory in Nanshi, preparing to enter the dock for repairs. However, as the steamer reached the riverbank and was about to drop anchor, its stern ran aground, the hull deeply stuck in the shallows, making it impossible to move. The crew urgently telegraphed the company for help. The company immediately dispatched the Hengji small steamer to tow it. After several hours, until 4 p.m., it was still unable to tow the steamer off the shoal. It is now waiting for the high tide to attempt towing again, it is said.

### Scheduled Telephone Call Method to Be Implemented on June 1st

The Ministry of Communications, to facilitate long-distance telephone users in making appointments for calls in advance, has specially formulated a scheduled telephone call method, which will be implemented from the first day of next month. The scheduled telephone call method is recorded as follows: ㊀ The nature of scheduled telephone calls is divided into three types: call number, call person, and calling. Registration must be made three hours before the scheduled time, and the telephone bureau must be informed of the scheduled call time, from a certain hour and minute to a certain hour and minute. ㊁ The caller and receiver of a scheduled telephone call should be prepared for the call between five and ten minutes before the scheduled time, so that they can talk as soon as the telephone bureau calls. ㊂ All types of scheduled telephone calls are divided into peak hours and non-peak hours according to the line business situation. Peak hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day. The prices of all types of scheduled telephone calls are charged according to express fees, plus additional fees. Non-peak hours are from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. the next day. The prices of all types of scheduled telephone calls are charged according to ordinary fees, plus additional fees. ㊃ For continuous calls more than twice, from the second time onwards, regardless of the type of call, the express or ordinary call number price will be charged, and no additional fees will be charged. However, during peak hours, the telephone bureau may limit the number of consecutive calls to three times. During non-peak hours, there is no limit to the number of times. ㊂ If the long-distance telephone line is already occupied at the scheduled call time, the call should be connected after the ongoing call is completed. If the caller or receiver abandons the call, regardless of the nature of the call, or whether the call is during peak or non-peak hours, the telephone bureau will only charge the ordinary cancellation fee and will not charge additional fees, it is said.

### Participation in the National Exposition Products to Be Shipped to France on the 12th of Next Month

China's participation in the Paris International Exposition, previously informed to the country by Ambassador Gu via telegram, has been formally agreed upon with the French authorities, and the location for the display of Chinese products has been designated. However, due to time constraints, shipment has not yet begun. It is now known that although the Paris International Exposition opened on the 24th of this month, the original closing date of November this year will be extended to January next year. Furthermore, some of the countries originally scheduled to participate have not yet sent their products. On the Chinese side, only overseas Chinese in Paris have sent domestic products for display. Therefore, representatives of the exhibitors, Wang Zhisheng, Wang Hanqiang, Guo Xiuzhi, Wu Bofen, and Chen Fengwu, specifically met with the presidium, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, and others, requesting that a meeting of all exhibitors be convened in the shortest possible time to discuss participation methods. According to Wang Zhisheng, the matter of participating in the exposition will be decided after Chu Minyi and Li Shizeng arrive in Shanghai. Chu and Li are expected to arrive in Shanghai this week. Once a decision is made, shipment to Paris can be made on the French postal ship "Felix Roussel" on the 12th of next month, it is said.

### Both Perpetrators in the Tang Youren Assassination Case Sentenced to Death

Both Perpetrators Remained Silent After Hearing the Verdict; Both Were Put in Shackles and Imprisoned in Maximum-Security Prison

The former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Communications and Foreign Affairs Advisor, Tang Youren, a native of Hunan, was shot and assassinated by thugs outside his private residence in Gancun, Route Gustaves de Gamale, French Concession, at around 5 p.m. on December 25, 1935, after arriving by private car. After the incident, the authorities offered a reward for the arrest of the perpetrators. Subsequently, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the French Concession Police successively arrested the perpetrators Liu Zhennan (32 years old this year, native of Hubei, residing at 228 Robertison Road, British Concession) and Qiu Jiyu (26 years old this year, native of Shengxian County, Shaoxing). Because the incident occurred in the French Concession, the French police transferred them to their custody. It was found that the two perpetrators had previously committed a kidnapping case and were sentenced to five years in prison by the former French Public Concession Tribunal. After serving their sentence, they were sent to the inland authorities for interrogation. Subsequently, the Second Special Court reviewed the case and ruled that their sentence had expired and they were released. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Due to the importance of the case, it took two months to complete. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. The former presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Wang Gangxu, interrogated the two perpetrators, who both confessed to carrying out the shooting and murder. The judge, considering that the case had been fully investigated, ordered the two perpetrators to be transferred to the detention center. When the current presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Liao Ying, opened the court to interrogate the two perpetrators, they completely reversed their previous confessions, denying the murder and claiming that their previous confessions were due to torture by the police. The court reopened the investigation, summoned witnesses for questioning, and appointed lawyers Yu Zhongluo and Peng Qi to defend Liu and Qiu. The debate was finally declared closed on the 19th of this month, and the date for sentencing was set. This was reported in this newspaper yesterday. When the sentencing date arrived, at 2:30 p.m., presiding judge Liao Ying arrived at Criminal Court No. 1 and ordered the two defendants to be brought to the case for a brief interrogation of their names, ages, and origins. The judge then stood up and read the main text of the judgment, stating that Liu Zhennan and Qiu Jiyu, as repeat offenders, committed murder together and were each sentenced to death, and each was deprived of their civil rights for life. The two defendants remained silent with their heads bowed after hearing the verdict. After the verdict was pronounced, the judge informed the two perpetrators that if they were not satisfied with the judgment, they could file an appeal within ten days after receiving the judgment. After the judge finished speaking, he ordered the two perpetrators to be returned to the detention center. At that time, the perpetrator Liu requested the court to allow him to meet with his family in the detention center. The judge said that they had been sentenced to death and could not meet. The judge then declared the court adjourned, and the French police took the two perpetrators down, put handcuffs on them, and escorted them back to the detention center for detention. It is reported that the detention center considered Liu and Qiu to be maximum-security capital offenders and immediately put them in shackles and detained them in the maximum-security prison ward, ordering experienced guards to take good care of them.

### Collapse of the Yiyuan Garden Wall Injures People

Ye Asheng Seriously Injured

At around 3 p.m. yesterday, a materials warehouse of the Shanghai South Road Lighting Management Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, located at No. 136 Ninghefang in the city, collapsed, injuring two workers. The site of the warehouse was formerly the site of the old Yiyuan Garden, built more than 200 years ago, so the walls were dilapidated and old. Subsequently, the Shanghai Public Works Bureau used it as a warehouse for materials and miscellaneous items for the Shanghai South District Road Lighting Management Office. Recently, the Public Works Bureau authorities also considered that the bungalow had been in disrepair for many years and was deeply concerned about causing disasters. A mason was hired a few days ago to repair it, and the outer walls were also demolished. Due to the recent continuous rain and occasional sunny intervals, the long-standing houses and tiles were scattered and loose. Yesterday afternoon, when the workers were working, the demolished wall suddenly collapsed and pressed on the warehouse and office buildings, causing the roof to collapse and the entire house to be destroyed. At that time, Ye Asheng, a mason from Chuansha (51 years old), was scratched all over his body and covered in blood due to not being able to dodge in time, appearing very miserable and seriously injured. Wang Zhiquan, a painter from Zhejiang (29 years old), who was working downstairs, saw the wall collapsing and tried to escape, but it was too late. His face and feet were also scratched, but his injuries were relatively minor. The West District Fire Brigade was also informed and immediately dispatched Director Xia Guoliang, senior staff Hua Nianzhu, Zhu Shunlin, Zhu Zhifeng, Zhou Guitang, and more than a dozen firefighters in ambulances to the scene of the accident to take care of the situation. However, the two injured workers had already been sent to the hospital for treatment by the bureau's own vehicle.

### Air Defense Drill in Shanghai County

Held for the Past Two Days, Performances Were Realistic

Shanghai County Chief Li Zhifu, in view of the serious international situation and the need to prepare for national defense, designated Minhang Town to hold air defense drills on the 24th and 25th of this month. The town was divided into three teams, with Hengjing East as the first team, West as the second team, and Hu Min Road as the third team. Personnel were dispatched from the public security, security, and militia to organize teams, each with about 50 people, for a total of more than 500 participants. At 1 p.m. on the 24th, air defense commander Li Zhifu issued orders, and the participants moved out separately. The Minhang Fire Brigade, Wu Yeru and Zhang Boliang, were responsible for firefighting. Party committee members, Zhang Jingye, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Jingling, and the public pretended to be refugees and injured, and were rescued by county scouts to the temporary shelter of the Chamber of Commerce. Director of the Education Bureau, Zhu Han, directed the placement of refugees and the injured were transported to the temporary hospital. The hospital director, Wu Deji, and his assistants nursed, treated wounds, and applied medicine diligently and seriously. The Director of Public Security Bureau, Yin Xiongfei, the District Director of Water Police, Zhang Jingqing, the Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Zhang Wugong, and others led the police to direct and maintain order, all with high spirits and courage. At 4 o'clock, everything ended. They gathered at the sports field, where County Chief Li gave a speech. From 9 p.m. to 12 p.m. on the 25th, a night exercise was held. During the exercise, all the lights in the town were turned off, and personnel were dispatched to control the situation at the time, which suddenly became tense. It is expected that the performance will be even better than the previous day and will be deeply admired by the public, it is said.

### Illegal Handling of Trade Union Officials, Workers Sentenced

Wang Tongxing and Five Others Sentenced to Eight Months Each

Zhang Xianglin, a native of Shaoxing, had been a worker at the Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory at No. 36 Jiangqingli, Yulin Road, and a member of the Shanghai Hudong Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union at No. 138, Lane 131, Jiren Road. Since a strike broke out in the factory on the 16th of the month, and the demands of labor and management were far apart, the factory had to close down. Zhang Xianglin, under economic pressure, found it difficult to maintain a living. He sneaked back into the factory to work and was discovered by the director of the trade union. At 5:30 p.m. on the 12th of this month, the enforcement team, Wang Tongxing, Zhao Jinkang, Liu Hanmei, Si Baoliang, and Zhu Chengxun, all natives of Yihe, Zhejiang, lured Zhang Xianglin to the trade union on Qiwupu Road. The chairman, He Yao, and the executive member, Lou Zongfang, decided on a handling method. They wrote on a piece of white paper the words "Zhang Xianglin is a running dog of the Jinxin Factory, selling his conscience," and pasted it on his chest. More than ten members, including Wang Jihua and Du Meihe, held wooden sticks and forced Zhang to kneel on the ground for a photo before imprisoning him for three and a half hours before releasing him. Zhang, insulted, reported to the Yulin Road Police Station. The Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the trade union and arrested Wang Tongxing, Wang Jihua, and suspects Huang Wenxian, Qian Fusheng, and 21 others, along with photos, slogan pamphlets, and six wooden sticks, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Zhong Qingwei presided over Criminal Court No. 3 and sentenced Wang Wenxing, Zhao Jinkang, Liu Hanmei, He Baoliang, and Zhu Chengmei to eight months of imprisonment each. Wang Jihua, Du Meihe, and Zou Borong were sentenced to six months each. Li Yubin, Zhang Jingjun, Du Youcai, Yang Shibiao, Yu Apin, Jin Xiuer, Jin Zherong, Jiang Jinde, Yi Shuijin, Meng Xiyi, and Yu Tinglong were sentenced to ten days of detention each. The exhibits were confiscated according to the list. Huang Wenxian and Qian Fusheng were released.

### Ma Changshou, the Assassin of Yin Bengen, Executed by Firing Squad in Anhui

Ma Was the Leader of Bandits in Hefei, Repeatedly Committed Major Cases, So He Was Sentenced to Death

Detective Yin Bengen, a native of Anhui, was shot and assassinated in Qianjiatang, French Concession, at midnight on October 11 of last year. Later, the French police arrested Wang Dianhua, a native of Hefei, who confessed that Wang Kaifu and Ma Changshou (i.e., Ma Hanqing), who were at large, had invited him to kill Yin, and that Ma had provided the pistol, etc. Wang was sent to the Second Special Court for trial. Ma Changshou was the leader of bandits in Hefei, repeatedly committed murder, arson, robbery, and other major cases, and fled to Shanghai. The Hefei County Government sent detectives to Shanghai to cooperate with the Public Concession Police to arrest Ma and send him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The French Police Department learned of this and transferred Ma to their custody and sent him to the Second Special Court for joint prosecution and trial with Wang Dianhua. The trial concluded with Wang Dianhua being sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, and Ma being sentenced to seven years in prison. After the sentence was pronounced, Ma Changshou was taken from the Second Special Court by detectives from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and transferred to Hefei County, Anhui Province, to be brought to justice. It is now known that Ma was sent to Hefei, interrogated and found to be true, sentenced to death, and reported to the Anhui Provincial Government for approval. Ma has been executed by firing squad according to law. The Hefei County Government has sent a letter to the First Special Court for record.

### Most Corpses Floating in the Huangpu River Are in Hot Weather

Found Continuously in Recent Days, No Other Reason

Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been getting hotter, and the number of unnamed corpses floating in the Huangpu River has been continuously discovered in various places. However, this is a common occurrence every year. The Nanshi Lifesaving Bureau has several patrol boats that travel back and forth in the river every day to salvage corpses, and the Water Patrol Police Department and the Water Patrol Team also assist. From Longhua Mouth to Songkou, including a section of the Suzhou River, corpses are found successively starting from February and March every year, with the peak period being in the hot summer months. They gradually disappear by late autumn and early winter. Those who drown in cold weather are trapped at the bottom of the river, and only float up in the spring after the sound of thunder. In hot weather, they can float to the surface after 20 to 30 hours. This is due to the weather. Among the corpses, there are men, women, old, and young, but those who are dressed in old clothes and look like workers are more common. The causes of death for these corpses are either suicide, accidental drowning, or abandonment of corpses in the river due to lack of coffin burial after death, which is also a common occurrence, so there is nothing strange about it. The reporter also telephoned a staff member of the Lifesaving Bureau yesterday morning, who said that the bureau has salvaged hundreds of corpses from the river every year, sometimes two or three hundred, and sometimes five or six in a month. The bureau prepares coffins, collects the corpses, and transports them to the cemetery for burial. Those who come to identify and claim the corpses are very few. Therefore, the continuous discovery of corpses in recent days is not a coincidence this year. Some outsiders, who do not know the truth, suspect that they were secretly murdered and thrown into the river, or compare them with the floating corpses in the Haihe River, which is a misunderstanding, it is said.

### The French Concession Area Defense Corps Requests Negotiations on the Case of Vietnamese Police Shooting and Injuring People Across the Border

On the morning of the 21st of this month, at around 2 a.m., the Vietnamese police of the French Concession's Beidang Road Police Station shot and injured Hou Yishan, a member of the Defense Corps, across the border, and illegally arrested Hou Jianshan and other members of the Corps. Now, Li Chao, a member of the Fahua District Defense Corps, reported to the Shanghai Defense Committee, requesting that it be forwarded to the Municipal Government for negotiations. The text of his report is recorded as follows: The report is submitted to report the situation of the Vietnamese police relying on their power, shooting and injuring members of our corps, Hou Yishan, etc., across the border. We respectfully request your review and forwarding to the Shanghai Municipal Government for serious negotiations to maintain national authority and protect the lives of ordinary people. I, on the 21st of May of this year, according to the report of Yao Jitao, the captain of the third team of our corps, now according to the report of Hou Deliang, the platoon leader of the first platoon of our corps, "At around 2 a.m. on the 21st of this month, Hou Tongshan, a villager from Houjiazhai, Haige Road, Fahua District of this city, suffered from illness, following the superstitious custom of burning paper in the countryside, invited neighbors Hou Guisheng, Xu Pinshan, and Hou Yishan, and Hou Jianshan, who are now members of our corps, to help respectfully send paper horses to an open space near Houjialong, Haige Road, for incineration (commonly known as 'sending gods'). After incineration, except for Hou Jianshan, who was watching over the remaining fire and remained at the scene, the other three had already gone to Xingfu Village. At this time, two Vietnamese police officers, No. 832 and No. 424, from the Beidang Road French Police Station arrived. Without asking the reason, they wanted to arrest Hou Yishan, Hou Guisheng, Xu Pinshan, etc. Hou and others argued that the location was in the Chinese territory and they had not committed any crimes, so the Vietnamese police had no reason to illegally arrest innocent people across the border. Ignoring them, they saw that the police were menacing and pointing guns at them, so they started to run away. Unexpectedly, the police relied on their power and continuously fired multiple shots with live ammunition, hitting Hou Yishan in the right foot, with the bullet passing through the instep. Hou Guisheng was hit in the left leg, with the bullet passing through the front of the leg, causing profuse bleeding. The two Vietnamese police officers, seeing that they had caused trouble, immediately left. Later, nearby residents heard the gunfire and rushed to the scene, calling for ambulances to arrive. Hou Yishan, Xu Pinshan, Hou Siquan, and others escorted the injured Hou Yishan and Hou Guisheng to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After washing and bandaging by the hospital, they were transferred to Zhongshan Hospital due to a lack of available rooms. However, the hospital stated that the injuries of the two were not to the bone and did not require hospitalization, so they hired a car to return home. Unexpectedly, the car was blocked by several Chinese and Western detectives sent by the French Police Station when it arrived at Beidang Road. They were not allowed to go home and were ordered to send the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Hou Jianshan and Hou Siquan, who were escorting the injured, were arrested and taken to the Beidang Road Police Station for detention and have not been released. I have investigated that the Vietnamese police relied on their power to illegally shoot and injure people across the border in this way. If we do not negotiate seriously with them, where can the lives of the people be entrusted and where can national rights be preserved? In addition to reporting the incident to the Xujiahui Police Station for handling, I hereby report the details of the incident and respectfully request the captain to review and promptly negotiate seriously with the French Police Station, and to rescue Hou Jianshan and Hou Siquan, who were arrested for no reason, from danger. In addition, the three recovered bullet casings and one bullet head have been sent to the Xujiahui Police Station, and this is attached." According to this, I personally went to Houjiazhai and the location where the Vietnamese police caused the trouble for a detailed investigation, which was consistent with the report of platoon leader Hou Deliang. I hereby submit a written report with the facts and respectfully request your review and prompt forwarding to the Shanghai Defense Committee, and request the Shanghai Municipal Government to negotiate seriously to maintain national rights and protect the lives of the people. According to this, I immediately ordered Sun Shulin, the coach of our corps, to go to Houjiazhai and the location where the Vietnamese police caused the trouble to conduct a thorough investigation and submit a detailed report. According to the reply, "Following the order to investigate the case of Hou Yishan and other members of our corps being shot and injured by Vietnamese police, I have thoroughly investigated and found that it is very consistent with the report of Captain Yao. It has also been surveyed that the location where the Vietnamese police caused the trouble is Lane 684, which is more than 50 meters from the French Concession and 41 meters and 5 centimeters from Haige Road. The first bullet head is 16 single steps from Haige Road, behind the back door of No. 1 Xingfu Village. The second bullet casing is 34 single steps from Haige Road, behind the back door of No. 5. The third bullet casing is 46 single steps from Haige Road. The fourth bullet casing is 52 single steps from Haige Road, all leaning against the bamboo fence on the north side, and markers have been made for investigation. Another bullet, I heard, was picked up by detectives from the British Concession Police Station. The location crosses the border to build roads and is completely within the Chinese territory. Since this case occurred, it is heard that the public is extremely indignant. I should report the results of the investigation truthfully and respectfully request your review and handling. In addition, Hou Jianshan and Hou Siquan, who were arrested, have been released one after another from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. today, and this is stated." According to this, after my review, the Vietnamese police relied on their power to shoot and injure members of our corps, Hou Yishan, and villager Hou Guisheng, across the border, and searched and arrested irrelevant members Hou Jianshan and villager Hou Siquan, etc., which not only despised human rights and treated human lives like grass, but also infringed on our national rights and humiliated our national system. If this is not negotiated, how can we redress the grievances of the injured and insulted, and how can we calm public anger? For this reason, I submit a written report with the facts and respectfully request your review and prompt forwarding to the Shanghai Defense Committee, and appeal to promptly negotiate seriously with the French Consul in Shanghai. In my humble opinion, the main points of the negotiation are proposed as follows: (1) Punish the Vietnamese police who caused the trouble by shooting. (2) Order the French Consul in Shanghai to guarantee that there will be no similar cases in the future. (3) Order the French Consul in Shanghai to issue a written apology to the injured and those arrested innocently. (4) Order compensation for the medical expenses of the injured and the loss of work, and give appropriate consolation money, etc. Are these appropriate? I also beg for your review and await orders to follow. Respectfully submitted to Yu, Chairman of the Shanghai Defense Committee, Li Chao, Head of the Fahua District Defense Corps, Seal.

### Pacific Freight Rates Increase

US Scrap Iron to Japan Doubles Compared to Last Year

The level of world steel panic has reached its peak. Due to the surge in demand, countries are trying their best to collect and buy at high prices. However, in this golden age of steel, business and profits are the opposite. According to shipping industry news, the reason why the steel industry cannot profit is due to the sharp increase in sea freight rates. The Pacific sea freight rates between the UK and Japan were only two or three yuan per ton last year, but now they have risen to ten yuan per ton. Some merchants have increased the tonnage of ships from the US to Japan by about twice as much compared to the same period last year. US steel merchants are lobbying members of Congress in the hope that they will support a ban on scrap iron exports. However, the old shipping industry is opposed to this measure due to conflicting interests. Therefore, the iron industry is unlikely to realize the above plan and is planning to request the President to order the promulgation of regulations on licensed transportation in order to restrict exports. Therefore, it is generally believed that the supply of scrap iron will not suddenly become scarce and there is no need to worry too much, it is said.

### Recent Situation of the Rockefeller Foundation in China

Donated 340,000 US Dollars Last Year, Will Continue to Operate Without Change

The death of oil tycoon Rockefeller in the United States recently has attracted the attention of people in our country. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency went to the Rockefeller Foundation Committee at 346 Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road, yesterday to inquire about everything. According to Dr. Grande, the Deputy Director of the Committee, the following items were reported:

Policy Unchanged According to Dr. Grande, Rockefeller has now passed away, but the policy of the Rockefeller Foundation in China will remain unchanged and everything will continue according to the original plan. The Rockefeller Foundation in China was established in 1913. Its initial work was to study the needs of medicine in China. In 1934, it used one million yuan to carry out a three-year plan for rural construction in China. Currently, the foundation is working hard on the literacy movement in the mainland. At the same time, it is also sparing no effort to assist Yenching, Nankai, and Jinling Agricultural Colleges in order to cultivate useful rural talents to guide farmers. The committee has also assisted the Ministry of Education in public health matters to increase the number of talents in China's public health undertakings. Expenditure Last Year Dr. Grande continued, "Over the past 20 years, Rockefeller has donated a total of about 50 million US dollars. Last year, it was a total of 342,540 US dollars, of which the donations can be divided into: ㊀ Literacy movement: 90,000 US dollars; ㊁ Ministry of Education: 12,240 US dollars; ㊂ Scholarship fund: 95,000 US dollars; ㊃ Lingnan University of Guangzhou: 10,000 US dollars; ㊄ Nankai University of Tianjin: 15,000 US dollars; ㊅ Agricultural Research Institute: 13,000 US dollars; ㊆ Central University: 11,675 US dollars; ㊇ National Economic Committee: 13,350 US dollars; ㊈ Health Department: 28,350 US dollars; ㊉ Survey items: 30,000 US dollars; ㊉㊀ Jinling University: 29,000 US dollars; ㊉㊁ Yenching University: 24,575 US dollars."

### 川沙 Young Widow Xu Xiuying Sues for Seduction and Abandonment

Demands Alimony and Education Expenses; Defendant Denies Cohabitation

Yang Shouqing, a wealthy man of 49 years from No. 6, Liuzaowan, Nanhui County, though nearing the age of fifty, has fallen into the web of love. He is now being sued in the local court by Xu Xiuying, a young widow of 27 years from Chuansha, whom he previously considered his lover, for seduction and abandonment. The lawsuit alleges that in the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], while living at No. Xilin Road, Qingren Lane, she and the defendant cohabited. He falsely claimed his first wife was deceased and repeatedly expressed sweet words and earnest gestures, leading her to believe, given the defendant's age of over forty and his seemingly mature nature, that he could be relied upon. Thus, she fell into his trap and cohabited with him in Tianxiang Lane, Jin Shenfu Road. The following year, she gave birth to a daughter named Jin Di, who unfortunately died young. In March of this year, she gave birth to a son named Xuan Xin. However, the defendant fled to Tonglu, Zhejiang, due to a criminal matter. He sent one letter and then disappeared without a trace. She went to the defendant's hometown to find him, only to discover that he had a wife and a concubine, a complete deception. Now, mother and child are destitute, with a bleak future, wandering astray, truly lost sheep. Therefore, she requests a judgment ordering payment of 24,480 yuan in alimony and 6,000 yuan in child support and education expenses. The defendant's response claims that he never cohabited with the plaintiff, only encountered her at the Great World amusement park in the 22nd year of the Republic. They rented rooms six times, each time paying a nightly fee of ten yuan, as she was of a "divine woman" nature. He claims she is falsely accusing him because she saw that his family is wealthy. Yesterday, Judge Wu Jiaxing held a hearing, and after the debate concluded, the matter was adjourned for judgment.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Seeks Loan from Shanghai Banking Sector

To Cover Government Expenses in Addition to Repaying Old Debts

The Zhejiang Provincial Government, needing funds for government expenses over the years, has borrowed 5 million yuan from banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. However, due to insufficient provincial treasury revenue to repay the debts, the government has repeatedly requested interest waivers and extensions. According to inquiries by a Shen Shi News reporter, the Zhejiang provincial financial authorities are planning to issue new loans, reportedly amounting to a substantial 13 million yuan. They intend to use the province-wide business tax revenue as collateral. Preliminary discussions have been held with the Shanghai banking sector. This substantial loan will be used to repay some of the old debts, with the remainder used for the province's administrative construction expenses. The provincial government's plan to establish a yarn factory in Xiaoshan, seeking 8 million yuan in investment from the Shanghai banking sector, is unrelated to this debt. It is also understood that the Zhejiang Local Bank is not involved in this new loan.

### Zhejiang Province Abolishes "Coloring" of Salt for Fishing Purposes

Ministry of Finance Approves

The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Liangzhe Salt Transport Commissioner, citing the detrimental effects of coloring salt used for fishing purposes on the color and taste of fish. This matter has been reported previously. It is now learned that the association received document number 13292 from the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Received the telegram from the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai in May of the 26th year [1937], requesting permission to abolish the coloring of salt for fishing purposes to alleviate the fishermen's plight. The Ministry has reviewed the matter and approved the exemption of salt used for fishing purposes from coloring in Zhejiang Province. The Salt Affairs Administration is ordered to instruct the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Bureau to comply accordingly. This notification is hereby issued."

### Hangzhou-Yushan Section to be Replaced with Heavy Rails; Materials Shipped to Shanghai for Transfer to Hangzhou

Construction to Begin Early Next Month, Completion in Three Months; Zhe-Gan-Hu Railway to Open on New Year's Day

The Zhe-Gan Railway Bureau, to replace the 35-pound light rails on the Hangzhou-Yushan section with 63-pound heavy rails to match the Yushan-Pingxiang and Nanchang-Pingxiang sections and facilitate traffic, borrowed 2.8 million yuan in construction funds from a Shanghai banking syndicate and 6 million yuan in materials from the Czech company Vítkovice Ironworks. After the success of these loans, the required 8,000 tons of sleepers and 25,000 tons of heavy rails were ordered from the Czech ironworks' Shanghai representative. The first batch of sleepers and 4,000 tons of rails arrived in Shanghai at the end of April and were transferred to the Zhe-Gan Railway construction site via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The remaining materials will be shipped in batches. A reporter learned from the banking syndicate that the rail replacement project is scheduled to begin in early June and will be carried out in three stages, starting with the Yushan-Quzhou section.

### Over Twenty Trade Associations Request Interpretation of Trademark Infringement

Over twenty trade associations in this city, including the cosmetics industry, iron can industry, leather goods industry, woolen mill industry, electrical appliance manufacturing industry, pharmaceutical industry, Chinese cigarette factory industry, alkali industry, and knitting industry, jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting it to forward a request to the Judicial Yuan for a reinterpretation of trademark laws. The letter stated: "We have read the Trademark Gazette No. 132 of the Ministry of Industry and are concerned about Order No. 162 of the Judicial Yuan, which states that, according to the unified interpretation of trademark laws by the Legal Interpretation Conference of this Yuan, the act of adopting another person's well-known registered trademark and using it on non-identical goods, if their nature is the same or similar, is likely to mislead consumers into believing that the trademark belongs to the other person's products. This constitutes a form of public deception and should be subject to the provisions of Article 2, Clause 4 of the Trademark Law. The actual meaning of the interpretation is too broad and lacks standards. In the future, this will inevitably lead to endless disputes and harm the future of trademarks. Therefore, we jointly request the Chamber to forward this letter to the Judicial Yuan, requesting that it promptly define the meaning and scope of the interpretation to provide guidance and avoid disputes."

### Judicial Yuan Explains Responsibility of Bank Directors and Supervisors

Claims Belong to Creditors

The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan regarding whether bankruptcy administrators have the right to apply for provisional attachment of assets, given that directors and supervisors of savings banks are jointly and severally liable for the shortfall amount after the bank's bankruptcy, according to the law. The Judicial Yuan replied by telegram, stating: "Received your telegram of December of last year regarding the question of bankruptcy administrators applying for provisional attachment. The Legal Interpretation Conference of this Yuan has resolved that directors and supervisors of savings banks are jointly and severally liable for the shortfall amount after the bank's bankruptcy, according to Article 15, Paragraph 1 of the Savings Bank Law. However, this claim belongs to the creditors and is not within the powers of the bankruptcy administrator. Therefore, the bankruptcy administrator cannot directly apply for provisional attachment of the assets of directors and supervisors. This is hereby notified by telegram." The Judicial Yuan seal is affixed.

Qian is currently establishing the China Machine-Made Shoe Factory on Gelan Road, producing about 300 pairs of men's and women's shoes daily. Currently, sales are expanding, and demand exceeds supply. Therefore, within the possible range, he plans to discuss cooperation with the institute to provide more skills to vagrants and expand the scale of production to meet social needs.

### Girl Who Attempted Suicide in Huangpu River Has Been Claimed by Family

Real Name Mao Wang'ai, Lives on Qingyun Road; Eager to Learn but Unable to Fulfill Wish

The student-dressed girl, Mao Aibao, who attempted to commit suicide at the Bund Customs Wharf on the afternoon of the 23rd, was sent to the Ningbo Native Place Association for relief by the Fourth Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, she was claimed by her family. The claimant was the girl's father, Mao Caishang (from Fenghua, Ningbo), who works at the Zhikang Western Pharmacy on the upper floor of the China Industrial Bank building on Beijing Road. According to Mao Caishang, his daughter's real name is Mao Wang'ai, and she is 20 years old. She used to study at a school in Shanghai, but recently, due to the large number of younger siblings and difficult family circumstances, she dropped out of school. Because she was eager to learn, she repeatedly applied to free schools and hospitals, hoping to ease the family's financial burden, but she was not accepted. This led her to contemplate suicide. The family was extremely anxious after she left home on the 23rd and did not return. They reported the matter to the police station for assistance and were informed by police officers that she had been sent to the Association. Therefore, he came to claim her.

### Autopsy Conducted Yesterday on Russian Police Officer Who Committed Suicide

Around 7:30 p.m., while patrolling in front of the company building at No. 11 Zhubao San Road, he suddenly said he needed to urinate. After five minutes, he had not come out. His colleagues went inside to check and found him in the restroom, having shot himself in the right temple. He fell to the ground. His colleagues reported the incident to the police station, and he was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. These details were reported briefly in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Russian police officer died from his injuries at the hospital around 10:00 p.m. The police station transported the body to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital in Taras Road for autopsy. The deceased's family is far away in Harbin. Yesterday, the police station reported the matter to Prosecutor Wang Qian of the Special Second Court, who arrived with a forensic doctor to examine the body and ordered it to be buried by the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is rumored that the cause of the suicide was due to unrequited love.

### Meat Industry Executive Director Huang Yexin Accused of Embezzlement

Reported Over 40 Yuan for Over Ten Yuan Worth of Food and Drink; Accountant Testifies to Everything in Court

Huang Yexin, owner of the Lao Wanxiang Meat Shop on Dadongmen Street, Nanshi, is an executive director of the Fresh Meat Industry Association. In October of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], he was elected chairman of the Slaughter Improvement Fund Management Committee after Shen Tong. In November of the following year, he was ordered to close the committee. He then submitted a register of income and expenses, along with receipts, to the Municipal Government. Five months before the closure, meat industry representatives Zhou Chengxiang and others suspected that Huang embezzled funds. They filed a civil lawsuit to have the court preserve the evidence. They then accused him of embezzlement and breach of trust at the Prosecutor's Office, but he was not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. Later, Zhou and others submitted an audit report by an accountant, listing changes made by Huang to the resolution, discrepancies between income and the Health Bureau's reply, alterations and erasures on the Tongxinglou Restaurant bill, overspending of association funds, and the payment of relief funds to the families of the 19th Route Army without receipts issued by the recipients. The receipts for ice expenses from Zhenru, Xujiahui, Caojiadu, and other places also indicated that the funds had not been received. They then sued him again at the Prosecutor's Office and continued to accuse Huang of embezzling funds for the construction of slaughterhouses, distribution of relief rice, purchase of refrigerators and ice scales, and payment of education subsidies for his children. Prosecutor Li investigated the matter and, in addition to dealing with the changes to the resolution separately, publicly prosecuted him for embezzlement and forgery of documents under Article 210 and Article 336, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Wang heard the case. Zhou Chengxiang paid 30 yuan to file the lawsuit. Accountant Zhao Zuwe testified to everything, saying that a meal worth over ten yuan was reported as over forty yuan. Lin Ziqi, the accountant of Tongxinglou Restaurant, testified that there was no meal worth over forty yuan. The defendant did not appear. Lawyer Zhang arrived in court and said that it was due to illness. The court ordered that he must appear in court. The case was adjourned for further hearing.

Column - Random Thoughts

### Fruit and Coffee

— Zhu Xi

It is said that Chinese people can be divided into two major categories: one is the "national essence devotees" who cling to ancient things and refuse to let go. For example, a principal of a certain middle school in Yangzhou, seeing the increasing consumption of foreign paper, painstakingly researched and invented new-style stationery in exquisite small ivory boxes, saying that it could resist fountain pens and foreign paper, while also preserving the "national essence." The other is "everything foreign is superior," even the moon is better than the Chinese one. The former are "muddled," while the latter are "incurable." Indeed, the national essence is not entirely impossible to preserve, and foreign goods should also be adopted for their convenience. The so-called "take the best from others to make up for one's own shortcomings" is the right approach.

For example, when it comes to eating, various European and American countries praise the exquisite and palatable nature of Chinese cuisine, but we insist on kneeling on the ground to eat "four covers are also covers" and are not afraid of cutting our tongues with knives and forks. Out of curiosity, occasionally trying a Western meal is fine, as long as it fills the stomach and the bill is settled. However, taking eating Western food as a sign of wealth and fashion seems to indicate that the foreign moon is better than the Chinese one.

Twenty or thirty years ago, eating Western food was indeed a sign of wealth and fashion. Those sons of wealthy families, after drinking a cup of tea at Zhang Garden or Enkai, would take the leading female entertainers of the time and hop onto a horse-drawn carriage, first circling around Jing'an Temple Road or the Bund, and then going to Old Jinjiang or Yijia Chun to "eat big dishes." The cost of a meal was equivalent to ten years' worth of food for a poor man, indeed both wealthy and fashionable. However, this kind of fortune was not something everyone could enjoy, but "big dishes" could not be avoided. Thus, the "company big dish" was invented, allowing one to taste the flavor of "big dishes" for a very small price. Nowadays, this pro-foreign mentality is even more evident. On the glass windows of Cantonese restaurants, "Company Big Dishes, 30 cents per person" is written in large red characters. In reality, it is just a shredded chicken soup, a pork chop, and a fried rice, with no foreign flavor and feeling extremely shabby. But after all, one has used a knife and fork and eaten a "big dish." However, they have another saying, which is: "Eating big dishes is more hygienic." The so-called "hygienic" does not refer to each person having their own utensils, but to the fruit and coffee that come after the big dish, which is the foreigners' "way of hygiene."

This is correct. Fruit and coffee can help with digestion, although each person's physiological structure is different, and some people experience stomach pain after eating fruit after meals. But it is more reasonable than "a cup of tea after meals" which inhibits digestion.

Yesterday, the International Trade Bureau released the import figures for fruit and coffee from January to April, totaling 117,234 yuan for apples, 91,320 yuan for oranges, and 121,556 yuan for coffee. This astonishing number may be a phenomenon that has emerged after learning the foreigners' "way of hygiene." However, those who eat the 30-cent company dishes are not fortunate enough to enjoy these Jinshan apples and Flower Flag mandarin oranges. They eat a rotten banana and a cup of coffee water. Of course, the wealthy sons are still the ones who enjoy the blessings. They do hire a "big dish steward" at home, specializing in big dishes, but they still cannot forget the "Chinese dishes" of shark fin and sea cucumber. Thus, after eating their fill, they peel a Jinshan apple or a Flower Flag mandarin orange, and sip a cup of Cuban coffee, immeasurably hygienic.

Later, even when guests come, after offering cigarettes, they also treat guests with fruit and coffee, because that is the custom of foreigners.

A foreign reporter who came to China published his impressions, "The prosperity of China is no less than that of New York." The China he was referring to was, of course, Shanghai. This "international honor" should be attributed to the "pro-foreigners" who believe that "the foreign moon is better than the Chinese one."

### Azaleas

— Kelai

I was annoyed by Tian's words in the letter. Yes, the azaleas in Jiangnan at this time must be burning red on the hillsides.

I am very angry at Tian's insensitivity. Why did he have to tell me this? In the city, I don't need to know these things now, especially since for the past half year, friends have avoided mentioning these words in front of me! They know that this seems to be a cruel punishment for me. If they happen to mention it in conversation.

I tore Tian's letter into pieces. I felt like there were eaves dripping on my cheeks. Why did he have to tell me this? The white poplars in the mountain town, like pagoda tops, the small river complaining to the morning breeze, the beach exposed under the blue sky and sea... These things that sometimes float to my sea of memory, why are they stingy and don't mention a single word in the letter?

--Did I not know that it was already tea-picking time?

I clenched my lips to keep myself from thinking about it, but suddenly the whole room was full of azaleas, and I felt like I was floating in a red lake. Her painful face reappeared, covered in blood, hands full of mud, struggling on the tea mountain.

I remember, I remember clearly: Last year, this time, Ju was raped by the tea mountain owner on the tea mountain.

I remember that night she put the floral headscarf on her head and told me happily that the tea mountain owner had happily agreed to let her pick tea. So many people were going that she couldn't say she wasn't having good luck and was actually hired. Her cheeks flushed, and she smiled happily, the flesh on her cheeks trembling, and the dimple like the evening star that appears as soon as dusk arrives.

She hardly slept all night, just chattering like a little bird, and she kept kissing the floral headscarf. At night, she often got up and examined the bamboo basket and the borrowed short clothes of the village girl under the light. After a while, she put on her clothes and stood in front of the mirror, laughing, and after a while, she took off her clothes again, sat on the chair in anger, and looked out the window. I knew that she was complaining that the fish-belly color had not yet appeared outside the window.

As soon as it dawned, she ran to the tea mountain. When she came back in the evening, she sang the song she had just learned outside the door:

The younger sister picks tea, and the lover picks flowers,

The younger sister picks red and green tea;

The lover picks azaleas;

Lover!

Is my face as good as the flower?

As soon as she entered the door, she smiled and asked me if the folk song was good or not. She just childishly grabbed the azaleas brought back in the basket and stuffed them into my hand, making the flowers fall all over the floor, and she picked them up and put them on my head.

For more than two weeks, she made such a fuss every day. She was happy that she had a job, but sometimes she clung to my neck and sobbed:

--We don't have a home, is sorghum better than azaleas? Alas, there are no enemy iron hooves in Jiangnan!

At this time, besides hugging each other tightly and crying, no one was willing to say a word.

However, that cruel night, that indelible stain, soon grabbed us like a sinful black hand.

In the darkness, I saw her with disheveled hair, running over to grab me and cry. I was very surprised by her action. Borrowing the starlight, I could see the blood on her face and the dirt in her hands in the courtyard. I suspected that she had fallen into a mud pit, but she grabbed my hand and cried:

--Tell me! Why don't we have a home? Our compatriots have forgotten us! Home! My home in the Northeast!

She cried even harder, and I just shed tears excitedly. Isn't that right? We have been away from home for six years, and our parents and sisters have all died at the hands of the enemy. "We have nowhere to return!" I cried loudly.

But she suddenly sat on the ground, tore the basket apart, and sobbed:

--I want to go home, I can't wander anymore, this pig, he raped me today! He, the tea mountain owner!

I fainted. At first I thought my ears had heard the wrong words, and then I felt that the world was spinning wildly. I fell to the ground and vomited blood.

When I woke up, she told me that she didn't want to pick tea anymore, and she didn't want two cents a day either. Of course, I agreed, but how would we live? A few days ago, I was also fired from the small shop. We were unemployed, we were all unemployed.

--Let's go, leave this quiet Jiangnan, our sorghum is much better than azaleas.

In the morning mist, we began our wandering life again.

### The Living Sai Jinhua

— Produced by Chen He

Twenty-three

Sai Jinhua handled grain procurement matters outside every day and witnessed the brutal killing of our compatriots by foreign soldiers. This caused her great distress. One day, Sai Jinhua informed Waldersee of the foreign soldiers' brutal killing of our compatriots. Waldersee was deeply moved and then ordered that civilians should not be lightly killed. The people in Beijing and Tianjin were spared in countless numbers.

### Edge

— Luo Quan

We are being shouted at, being expelled, we have come to the edge of this life, yearning for the gallop on the vast plains. But a deep ravine is right beside the road; a moment of carelessness will cause us to fall and never be able to struggle back up.

So we carefully trek along this edge, walking an endless road. This is how we have survived.

A dim dusk, the withered yellow sun sinks down. The city sky, flowing with impure colors, is adorned with scattered catkin-like glows, reflecting a magnificent dark red. Row upon row of melancholy black shadows are painted in the quiet room.

She and I—a poor friend—lie prone on the grass, our eyes looking straight ahead. A flock of sparrows, swooping down from the nearby treetops, chirps like toy birds.

He has a dark green face, and due to lack of nutrition, his body is often overwhelmed by illness. He wears a dirty black shirt and a pair of rubber-soled shoes with holes. His hair, unkempt for a long time, covers his ears in a tangled mess, even dragging down to his forehead, only to be pushed back with a finger from time to time to his nape. We are now holding dry, hard bread, chewing and swallowing it slowly. He still seems so greedy.

He always says the same sentence, the same sigh;

“Man, since he is born, he has to live on!”

I also say his words, in the same tired tone.

“That year,” he always tells the same story, “In Anhui, that lawless place, I didn't worry about clothes, I didn't worry about food, I lived a life that wasn't unpleasant, and I even played with 'flower girls'! I didn't care about family affairs, but I don't know if I offended someone or offended a ghost, a group of them came to arrest me. The death that I never expected suddenly appeared before my eyes, flapping wings of daylight...

"They were going to kill me.

"Because of seeing death, I thought. Yes, I have to live on. I grinded my teeth, I coughed stubbornly, I lowered my head and looked at my hands, which were tightly bound with rough ropes.

"Indeed, on a snowy morning, I saw two people standing in front of me. Looking out from the open door, the white snow covered the ground. The air was cold and gloomy. The god of endless slumber was flapping his white wings and flying again. They were going to take me out and kill me in a brutal way.

"I only thought that people shouldn't be killed so early, they have to live on. I struggled, I cursed. Someone strangled my neck, and someone else gave me a heavy kick, so I fell on the snow, I had no strength and couldn't get up again.

"What unfolded before my eyes was such a bright white snow field, the world was silent in slumber, but I was tied up and kneeling on the snow, a kind of torture was being carried out, the aiming of that free shooter, the muzzle...

"Confusion overwhelmed my composure, and from stubbornness, I gradually felt a little sadness. But I remembered that I always had to live on. I pounced down in response to the sharp gunshot, held my breath, and stiffly fell to the ground, my severely injured left hand pressed against my chest.

"The air was flowing with cold, without a sound. Only then did I vaguely hear them say: Chest... can't live... dead.

"Then do you also think about the distance between life and death? What if the bullet pierced your chest?" I interjected, feeling that he had come back from death.

"Yes, I was aware of death, but I clung tightly to life. I got up from the snow at that time, saw the snow water and blood stains all over my body, holding my injured left wrist, I thought that the distance between life and death was only a matter of inches, I felt a little sadness."

"How many years ago was that?"

"About ten years ago." Then he began to tear apart his dinner greedily.

What has he lived on for these ten years, and what has he relied on to decide to live on?

But he is a person worthy of blessing, sailing on the ship of will, drifting in the sea of people. Although life is abandoned on a terrible edge, one fall and you can never struggle back up.

"Let us recall those colorful dreams of the past, what color have they turned into?"
