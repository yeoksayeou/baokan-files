### Shanghai Falls Completely Amidst Wind and Rain Yesterday

Remaining Soldiers and Police Make a Final Sacrifice

The soldiers and police ordered to defend Nanshi resisted fiercely amidst the enemy's intense artillery fire. However, by 11:00 PM the night before last, their defenses were destroyed, leaving them with nothing to rely on. They were then ordered to retreat. However, yesterday, a unit of soldiers and police still fought to the death under the enemy's encirclement. Amidst the dismal wind and rain, sporadic gunfire could be heard. By around 4:00 PM, the gunfire ceased, and our great Shanghai had completely fallen into enemy hands. According to a reporter, the tragic details of the fall of Nanshi are recorded below as the final report on the fall of Shanghai. The enemy launched a general attack on Nanshi starting at noon on the 10th, concentrating bombing with twenty to thirty aircraft and naval and land artillery. Enemy troops also continued to advance. By around 2:00 PM on the 11th, the artillery fire had not stopped. The Zhang Brigade of the 55th Division, defending the first line of defense, endured the fierce artillery fire for more than twenty hours. However, due to the destruction of their defenses and heavy casualties, they were breached by the enemy. The entire line of our army was shortened from thirty-five li to fifteen li, the defensive position becoming increasingly cramped and the situation becoming critical. After receiving the alert, we immediately ordered the soldiers and police defending the Bund area of ​​the 16th Section to rush to the area of Jumen Road to reinforce the second line of defense at Lujiabang Road. After the enemy crossed the Rihui Port, they immediately used five tanks as a vanguard, covering a large group of infantry, which surged forward like a tide. Zhong Yang, the captain of our police squadron, personally led the police officers to defend Jumen Road, Huining Road, and other places to fight. Although the strength was disparate, they still responded bravely. Captain Zhong died in battle, and the enemy broke through, heading straight for the city. At that time, the enemy also bombarded our riverside positions with artillery, and used rubber boats to carry enemy troops to attack. Officials and police from the 16th Section and the Ximen Branch rushed to assist in the battle. However, two of the local defense works were destroyed by enemy artillery fire, and all the officers and police made heroic sacrifices. However, a solitary unit still fought to the death amidst the enemy's three-sided encirclement. The bloodiest battle was fought from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. They then received an order, and by 11:00 PM, they began an orderly retreat. However, there was still a team of soldiers and police who, disregarding the retreat, firmly sought to achieve their goal of martyrdom. They held out until 4:00 PM yesterday, and many sacrificed their lives.

### Our Troops Fight Hard in Yanpu

Zhang Brigade and the Police Headquarters, who steadfastly defended the last position in Nanshi, fought hard under enemy artillery fire and rain of bullets. They were eventually ordered to retreat the day before yesterday due to the destruction of the defense works and the lack of water and food. Most of the troops had retreated late at night, but a unit stationed south of the Wai Malu Customs Bridge and the municipal warehouses and Ning Shao godowns along the riverbank, because they had not received orders, still calmly resisted in the midst of the enemy's heavy encirclement, vowing to use their last drop of blood to fulfill their duty of defending the country. The enemy artillery fire continued all night, but their infantry did not rush in. Yesterday morning, several enemy rubber boats sailed from the Huangpu River towards that area, but after our army swept them with machine guns, they fled. Our army held out until yesterday afternoon and retreated in the direction of safe locations.

### Heroic Enemy Killing Near Bansongyuan

In the area south of Lujiabang Road in Nanshi, east of Chezhan Road, and near Bansongyuan on the banks of the Huangpu River, another unit of our defending troops, about several hundred people, continued to fight hard against the enemy yesterday because they had not received orders. Since the night before last, our troops there had been heavily surrounded by the enemy on three sides. In addition to using heavy artillery to bombard fiercely, the enemy also used armored vehicles as cover and charged our defending troops several times. However, because our batch of defending troops were determined to coexist with the position and were determined to demand a considerable price from the enemy, they occupied various high-rise buildings and densely swept the enemy with machine guns. After fierce fighting until the afternoon, our defending troops retreated in the direction of the rear.

### Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha Fall Simultaneously

Nanhui Bridge Suffers the Greatest Losses

The three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha had all fallen by yesterday. According to a report from a gentleman from Fengxian who escaped to Shanghai yesterday morning, the enemy's vanguard troops were all reorganized puppet troops, wearing black uniforms, and there were also those wearing plain clothes and large hats and carrying pistols. Upon arrival, they did not allow the people to evacuate, ordered guides, and searched everywhere. Anyone who was suspicious or whose answers were unclear was imprisoned. The enemy's formal troops were all wearing yellow uniforms, with gold threads on the edges of their hats. They came from Shengzimiao, Zhuangxing, Tuolin, Xinxishi, and other places, and the checkpoints at each key point were very strict. When a certain gentleman passed near Nanhui Bridge, he suddenly encountered enemy troops, who shouted to ask his profession. After he stepped forward to explain, a plainclothes agent speaking with a Taizhou accent explained and he paid a price of four yuan to get a pass to escape the disaster. As for the extent of local losses, Nanhui Bridge suffered the most. Fengcheng and Nangaobridge, among other places, have been bombarded by enemy ships and bombed by enemy aircraft in recent days and have been reduced to scorched earth. According to a certain flower factory scout in Dongxiang Qingcungang and other places, there is little disturbance locally, and small shops are still trading, because no traces of the enemy have been found so far. The Nanhui area also fell at the same time before the 12th. There are also rumors outside that a puppet organization and maintenance association has been found in Chuansha County, but the accuracy of this remains to be verified. There are more refugees fleeing to Shanghai from Nanhui, followed by Fengxian, and the least from Chuansha. Currently, Jiang Zhuoyun of Nanhui and others are working with the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association to find ways to provide relief. Yesterday, Fengxian held a meeting at the Paradise in this city to set up a registration office for refugees staying in Shanghai to conduct a preliminary investigation.

### The Total Number of Enemy Troops in Pudong Exceeds 10,000

Most of Them Head to Southern Pudong

Since the enemy's vanguard troops occupied Pudong the day before yesterday morning, reinforcements have continued to arrive, reaching more than 10,000 people. Half of them are Manchurian soldiers who are tall and speak Mandarin. Among every three people, there must be an enemy soldier monitoring them, carrying a large number of baggage and military equipment. They passed through Zhoupu yesterday morning and headed towards the southern border of Fengxian County, so that they could contact the enemy troops who landed at Jinshanwei and invaded Songjiang, and invade the area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road.

### Details of the Bombing of Pinghu and Zhapu

Fierce Fighting Near Dushan

According to Mr. Dai Tongqiu, the person in charge of the Pinghu Fellow Villagers Association, the news of the bombing of Pinghu and Zhapu is as follows: (This news was narrated by fellow villagers who escaped from Pinghu) On the 3rd of this month, we received alerts from Jinshanwei, Xincang, and other places. Some shops closed. On the 4th, five or six enemy planes scouted the urban area from morning to night all day long. The civilians fled to the outside of the West Gate and North Gate. The enemy planes did not drop bombs. Starting at 3:00 PM on the 5th, enemy planes began to bomb from outside the South Gate and the urban area, dropping more than 30 bombs. The post office, the telephone office, Wang Gongchang, Wang Xianghe, and the large and small streets were all destroyed. Other areas are not known because they were not witnessed. As for Zhapu, according to the members of Runyu Society who escaped from Zhapu, the Zhapu South Gate Railway Station, the Dawang Temple, the Yinglong Bridge, and nearby houses were all bombed. The Sanshan Guild Hall, the Central Elementary School, the Xu Family Ancestral Hall, and the West Gate Street and the North Gate Suspension Bridge in the city were also bombed on the 4th, causing many deaths and injuries. In addition, the association received a reliable report yesterday that Pinghu and Zhapu are still being defended by our army. However, there is fierce fighting near Dushan, nine li east of Zhapu. Dushan has nine peaks that stand tall on the coast. It will be difficult for the enemy to advance if they try to cross the mountain and invade Zhapu.

### After Abandoning Nanshi and Pudong, We Now Defend New Positions

Guangfu and Huangdu Defenses are Solid; Qingpu and Songjiang are Still in Our Hands

Reuters, Nanjing, 12th Central News Agency: According to news from Chinese sources here, after abandoning Pudong and Nanshi, the Chinese army is now defending new positions, with Songjiang on the right flank, Huangdu in the center, and Guangfu on the left flank. The Chinese army is currently fighting the Japanese army that landed in Hangzhou Bay near Sijing. The second line of defense is set up in Qingpu and Songjiang, which are still in the hands of the Chinese army. At the same time, a phone call from Ningbo here said that the Japanese army's landing in Guanhaiwei is not accurate. However, Japanese warships are very active near Haiyan.

### Three Brave Soldiers Defending Luzhai are Wounded but Repel the Enemy

The Military Affairs Commission Gives Special Bonuses and Two Ranks

[Nanjing] A battalion of our □□ Division, defending Luzhai, fought bravely in the battle on October 3, making many heroic sacrifices. In the end, only three soldiers, Geng Wanyou, Chen Wancheng, and Liu Liuer, remained. They continued to resist, and although wounded, they did not retreat, maintaining their position and waiting for reinforcements, repelling the enemy. Their resolute and brave spirit is truly commendable. The Military Affairs Commission has specially awarded each soldier a bonus of 200 yuan and promoted them each two ranks, and will also submit the case for discussion and commendation to show encouragement.

### The North China Daily News Publishes an Article Commiserating with Our Fellow Shanghai Compatriots

Success or Failure Still Depends on the Future; Seeking Self-Renewal Through Pain; Massacre and Destruction Cannot Harm Our National Soul

The North China Daily News published an editorial yesterday, saying: "The god of war who devastated the center of Shanghai has left this place and gone far away, but Shanghai must still be troubled by it and cannot escape the pressure exerted by the iron hoops that make the god of war go far away." The Chinese army's defense of the surrounding defense lines of Shanghai was initially thought to be no more than two or three weeks. Now that it has retreated, the general Chinese people cannot help but be frustrated. They may be encouraged by the bravery of their defense and because the soldiers fought to make the enemy's advance pay a high price. However, when the war outside Shanghai is still unfolding and success or failure still depends on the future, returning to the silence of a neutral attitude, the feelings they receive, all the people of various countries who are in the same situation, should express sympathy and respect to them. Although expressing sympathy in this kind of event does little good, the Chinese people should know that a large part of the foreigners here and elsewhere in China are deeply saddened by the difficulties faced by the Chinese people and deeply sympathize with the sacrifices they have made in resisting foreign aggression. The more than 3 million Chinese people in the world's sixth largest city, in this great national crisis, when temporarily cut off from direct and unconstrained contact with their government and country, maintaining political mortification is not to be criticized. An ounce of sincerity and understanding is worth a ton of advice and admonition. It may not be inappropriate to give spiritual encouragement to the tenacity and restraint required to adopt national dignity.

Shanghai as a whole, of course, regards the current change in the situation as a sign of its own difficulties entering another scene. Although the severity of the war panic is about to disappear, this kind of difficulty does not seem to be alleviated as a result. What is needed now is the development of civic cooperation, but this kind of cooperation often puts individuals and groups in a dilemma. In this kind of situation, foreigners should recognize that they have an obligation to adjust their daily lives to suit reality. Some people may think that the disaster in Shanghai is indeed due to the Chinese government's decision to use Shanghai as the main location to resist Japanese aggression because some people have suffered. To determine this matter, use wisdom to make good use of theory and facts. Ordinary people often make superficial legal estimates of the course of events. The Japanese claim that the drama in Shanghai was caused by the Chinese government's stubbornness and violation of treaties. This statement should not be taken lightly. This kind of thinking may mislead foreigners' opinions, so we should reiterate some broad reasons today. Japan's actions in North China actually forced the Chinese government and its people to choose between admitting to continuing to swallow its land and endangering the integrity of its country, and painfully resisting overwhelming force. Japan cannot think that it has the right to condemn the consequences of this choice. This is the most difficult point in the Shanghai issue today. The emotional impact on foreigners is certainly even greater, because the war between the two major countries, although not planned, has unfortunately damaged the huge interests of neutral countries on which Shanghai's economic security depends. Although this point cannot be accurately explained at present, it should not be ignored. In the foreseeable future, the misfortune suffered by those who are not third-party profiteers, that is, the many dangers that Japanese groups are forced to face to their lives and property, the final solution of such a major crisis in Shanghai affairs (although this matter may be a greater dispute between China and Japan, there are still just people who will propose to consider it.

Those who hold the view that the war should be limited to North China are actually trying to advocate the theory that China should choose another place outside the battlefield suitable for Japan to fight against Japan, which is not without blame. Shanghai does seem to have the Songhu Agreement of May 1932 as a refuge. It should be known that the agreement was not signed by both parties and was a temporary measure. Now it cannot accept China's destruction of the agreement and prepare for self-defense to resist Japan's policy in the area and elsewhere, which is obviously possible. This kind of criticism is entirely based on the inextricable entanglement of facts and fantasies. It is also not possible to explain in detail the topic of constant development, that is, the destruction of the agreement is not exclusively done by any one party. It is necessary to declare that China, when it encounters an armed attack on its sovereignty, examines all the circumstances, and it is perfectly justifiable to strike at the place where it believes it can inflict a powerful blow, even a destructive blow, on the aggressor. As for whether it has made appropriate considerations when it makes appropriate considerations for the fact that fighting in this big city will cause major losses, future commentators will have to decide. This point cannot be judged arbitrarily until the final outcome of the full-scale war from Guangzhou to Beiping is clear. Shanghai today urgently needs to consolidate itself to endure the major economic, political and social difficulties, and worry and pessimism fill the entire city. Shanghai is now being successfully besieged by the attacking army, but it should be remembered that outside this steel ring and outside the capital of Nanjing, there are groups of great fluctuations in Chinese humanity and Chinese courage. No matter how serious the disaster seems to have caused great corruption, and there is a concrete and practical existence, this is actually China's last restoration and liberation from foreign yokes. In the foreseeable future, China's major needs will inevitably be re-invested in this city and port, and will be responsible for helping it prosper and proving Shanghai's future as a commercial and financial aid to China's progress. This can be guaranteed for Shanghai. Furthermore, in terms of spirit, the facts are ironclad. Massacre and destruction can never harm the soul of this great nation, and will instead make them seek self-renewal by suffering common pain and eliminating all the mistakes that may have caused them to suffer. Today is the anniversary of the creators of the Republic of China, and it is especially appropriate for foreigners to make this sympathetic interpretation, because this is enough to be a comfort to China in this terrifying moment.

### How Brave are the Two Machine Gunners!

The enemy charged and they killed more than a hundred; after retreating, they also collapsed

The two machine gunners who were ordered to defend Rihui Port and Dapu Bridge were ordered to retreat the day before yesterday, but they were unwilling. When the enemy charged, the warriors shook their guns and killed a hundred enemies. Later, when the ammunition ran out, they climbed into the wall of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, and they also collapsed. After a Westerner asked, they had not eaten or drunk for three days, and were later sent to the hospital for treatment.

### We Mobilize a Large Army to Counterattack Fengjing Town

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 12th: After our army's defense line in Fengjing Town was broken by the enemy on the afternoon of the 10th, we immediately mobilized a large army to counterattack the enemy that night. After fierce fighting until the 11th, the enemy still tried to invade. We have sent heavy troops to block them.

### Deputy Brigade Commander Li of the 61st Division Dies

Li Zhong, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 18th Brigade of the 61st Division of the Army, whose style name was Dongliang, was 47 years old and a native of Hefei, Anhui. This time, he was ordered to resist the war and made many outstanding achievements on the Shanghai front line, especially his bloody battle against the enemy at the Patriotic Girls' School position. Although he was wounded at the position, he still led his troops to fight bravely. After our army moved to a new front line, the division inflicted heavy damage on the enemy in the area around Wujiaju. From the 3rd to the 6th of this month, Deputy Brigade Commander Li accompanied the division commander to the front line. Unfortunately, he was surrounded by more than ten enemy soldiers and was frequently strafed by machine guns. Although Regiment Commander Li of the 365th Regiment of the division led reinforcements to break the siege, he was unfortunately seriously injured and was immediately admitted to Binlong Hospital for treatment. He was then transferred to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but eventually died in the hospital yesterday. His body was carried into the Chinese Funeral Home and the funeral will be held today at 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM. Mr. Li has a wife and three sons in his hometown, and his funeral is extremely desolate, but his loyalty is something that people from all walks of life want to cry for together.

### British Officials Firmly Deny Rumors of British Military Actions in Shanghai

Reuters, Shanghai, 12th Central News Agency: Reuters is now instructed by responsible parties to declare that the rumors circulating in Shanghai that the British Navy and Army stationed in Shanghai have been authorized by the government to open fire on Japan immediately if it attacks the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek are completely unfounded.

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th Central News Agency: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today published an article issued by the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, which firmly denied the rumors spread by a certain foreign news agency that the British Navy and Army stationed in Shanghai had been ordered to open fire on the Japanese army if it attempted to enter the south bank of the Suzhou Creek.

### Enemy Ships Trying to Establish a Blockade are Damaged

The North China Daily News reported that at about 11:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), a small Japanese steamer carrying a team of soldiers tried to climb onto a merchant ship sunk in the river at the Huangpu River blockade in the 16th Section, with ladders placed on the side of the ship, and distributed rifles and machine guns in various mouths. At that time, rifles and light machine gun bullets rained down from the pier, obviously without hitting. The small steamer left the blockade and sailed downstream. Before sailing a few yards, a heavy machine gun on the riverbank in Nanshi suddenly fired, and the distance was very close. The bullets seemed to have penetrated the steel plate and broken its boiler. Suddenly, steam came out like clouds, and the bullets continued to pour in from head to tail, riddled with bullets. Two Japanese soldiers jumped into the river and were rescued by a Japanese Navy dinghy. The warship floated with the waves, and the soldiers in the ship were either dead or injured. Later, another small steamer towed it downstream. It passed in front of various foreign warships. In the afternoon, the blockade was set on fire by Japanese soldiers pouring oil on it. A sand ship caught fire and floated in the river, almost engulfing an oil tanker and two Japanese gunboats. Later, the fireboat Puji arrived and extinguished the fire on the two sand ships.

### The Enemy Transported Another Large Batch of Military Supplies

Another 5,000 Reinforcements Arrive

Yesterday, another enemy transport ship No. ○3○, the merchant ship-rebuilt transport ship No. 127 Binjiang Maru, and the transport ship No. 384 Nikko Maru arrived in Shanghai, docking at the Huangpu and Osaka docks, carrying countless enemy trucks, armored vehicles, war horses, and ammunition. In addition, the enemy warship Najima arrived at the Xinhuaishan Pier in Pudong yesterday, unloading a large number of military trucks, war horses, machines, bicycles, and other military supplies. Yesterday, another enemy merchant ship-rebuilt transport ship No. 140 Aioi Maru, transport ship No. 70 Tenyo Maru, and Shanghai Maru (Ienoa Maru) and four other ships arrived in Shanghai, carrying the fourth batch of enemy seventh reinforcements, totaling about 5,000 people, landing at the Huangpu Dock, Osaka Dock, and Huishan Dock. In total, the enemy reinforcements have reached more than 20,000 in the past five days.

### The British Press Mourns the Death of Stephens

The Japanese Ambassador to the UK Sends a Letter to the Daily Mail Expressing Regret and Personal Sympathy

Reuters, London, 12th Central News Agency: The Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Yoshitada Tokugawa, recently sent a letter to Lord Camrose, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail, expressing his great regret for the death of Stevens, the newspaper's reporter stationed in Shanghai, and his personal sympathy. The newspaper also published an article in memory of Mr. Stephens, saying that war correspondents like Mr. Stephens never put themselves first in the battlefields they described. Only his close friends knew about Mr. Stephens' many adventures. However, the records of these adventures, no matter how lightly written, show that Mr. Stephens had long been fearless in the face of danger. It is unfortunate that such a special and beloved person died prematurely, and all his friends mourned him. The London press has scheduled a memorial service for Mr. Stephens on November 17 at the Seamen's Church in Fleet Street.

### Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to Compatriots Across the Country

The War of Total Resistance Will Not Stop for a Day; Relief Work Will Not Stop for a Day

The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang published a letter to compatriots across the country yesterday, saying: "Dear compatriots across the country, everyone knows that the Shanghai War of Resistance is one aspect of the war of total resistance and one stage of the long-term war of resistance. It can even be said that the Shanghai War of Resistance is only the beginning of the war of total resistance and the long-term war of resistance, and is by no means its end. Looking back on the past three months, thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers at the front to kill the enemy and their heroic sacrifices, as well as the generous contributions and enthusiastic service of the entire city's people, the enemy has poured all their naval, land, and air forces, reinforced five times, and launched six general attacks, consuming a large amount of their combat power. Our heroic national army, although withdrawing from Shanghai due to strategic relations, can be said to have completed its mission quite well. Therefore, the withdrawal of our army from Shanghai cannot be regarded as a failure of our army's operations, nor can it be regarded as the end of the Shanghai war, and especially cannot be regarded as the final outcome of the war of total resistance. Only in this way, compatriots in the entire city of Shanghai and even compatriots across the country must not be shaken by the theories of traitors, and must clearly recognize that the tasks of the people in the future to resist the war will be more difficult and more great. We must persevere and move forward without retreating to overcome difficulties. Not only do displaced refugees need our relief everywhere, but also soldiers with broken arms and legs need our care, the families of martyrs need our education, the teams that charge into battle need our replenishment, the people who carry food and drink need our organization, the lifeless hinterland needs our propaganda, the skills to save the dying and heal the wounded need our training, the demons and ghosts of traitors need our sanctions, and even education and industry in times of emergency need our promotion and development, and the evolution and connection of the international situation needs our research and efforts... and so on. The war of total resistance will not stop for a day, that is, the work of our compatriots across the country to support the war of resistance will not stop for a day. We must not think that the Shanghai War of Resistance is over, and that we only need to do some post-disaster work and manage relief. If this is the case, then traitors like Jiang Chaozong will naturally pretend to be charitable and ingratiate themselves with the enemy. How can this be what all of us who are determined to resist the war expect? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said, "Our determination to defend ourselves has always been consistent. Even if there is only the last soldier left and the last inch of territory, we will not change our original intention." We, the comrades in the entire city and the compatriots across the country, encourage each other to never stop until we achieve the final victory."

### A Refugee Describes the Tragic Situation in the Southwest Countryside after Three Escapes from Death

Corpses Lying Everywhere Along the Shanghai-Minhang Road, Furniture and Farming Tools Looted

The southwestern countryside of this city, such as Longhua, Caohejing, Zhujiahang, Changqiao, Wujiabang, Meilong, and Qianliangmiao at the intersection of the city and county, etc., were successively occupied by enemy troops in the afternoon after our army withdrew from the positions on the south bank of the Suzhou River. Many farmers hesitated to leave because they could not bear to part with the crops in the fields and their property. Zhang Amao, a villager who recently escaped from the enemy's guns in western Shanghai after three narrow escapes, recounted the actual situation he witnessed as follows: Zhang Amao's ancestral home is Taojiatang, west of Caohejing Town. Because he did not know in advance that our army had already withdrawn, the residents of the house went to the nearby teahouse for tea as usual. On the afternoon of the 9th, the enemy troops arrived and fired machine guns in all directions. More than a dozen tea drinkers in the teahouse fell to the ground after being shot (all of them were residents of the Zhang family in Taojiatang). He knew that things were not good, so he immediately fell to the ground and fled east. At that time, thick smoke covered the sky in the southeast corner, and flames were soaring. He then took a small road to the Shanghai-Minhang Road and went south to Qianliangmiao. It was already dark when he was caught by an enemy sentry. They wanted to shoot him, but after repeated pleas, he was spared, but he was not allowed to go south. So he went north along the Shanghai-Minhang Road. Corpses were lying everywhere along the way, and there were many destroyed vehicles. Passing Shanghai Middle School in Wujiabang, he saw that enemy troops were stationed there. Later, because he was hungry and tired, he sat down to rest in front of the Huiling Bus Station. Unexpectedly, he was seen by the enemy troops in the school across the street, who suspected that he was a plainclothes soldier of our army. He was arrested again and sent to the enemy headquarters of Guanshengyuan in the whole Caohejing Town. There were already seven or eight people detained inside. Later, he took the opportunity to escape and saw that Yangjiagang had been reduced to scorched earth, with several corpses lying in the fields. There were also two or three female corpses on the ground at the east town entrance. Chen Yuanhe and other shops in the central market were burning fiercely. The residence of Yang Xinzheng, the municipal party committee member, was completely emptied. Several freight cars were parked at the town entrance, and the streets were filled with utensils and farm implements. Therefore, the losses in the town were very heavy. The houses on both sides of the lower building were destroyed by armored vehicles. Later, he went to Houshangbang and took a small road behind Xiqin Institute. When he reached Jinjianong, he was stopped by two enemy soldiers who opened fire at him. He fell to the ground in panic and fainted for a long time before he woke up. Fortunately, he was not injured and finally arrived at Xujiahui and escaped to Shanghai. Thinking of running for two days and three nights, and escaping from death three times, he couldn't help but feel terrified. In total, he saw no less than dozens of corpses along the way.

### The Second Invitation to the Beijing Conference is Rejected Again by Japan

Insisting on Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations, Arrogant Attitude Disregarding Justice, No Different from Slapping the Great Powers in the Face

[Tokyo] Japan has now declined the second invitation from Belgium to send representatives to the Beijing Conference. The reply has been approved by the cabinet and, after being approved by the Emperor this afternoon, will be delivered to the Belgian ambassador to Japan and telegraphed to the Japanese ambassador to Belgium. The Japanese government intends to publish an article at the same time to explain Japan's fundamental policy on the Sino-Japanese conflict. (Central News Agency, December Reuters)

[Tokyo] After several hours of discussion and drafting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs finally decided not to publish an explanatory statement on Japan's reply to Belgium. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)

Brussels The Japanese government has recently rejected the second invitation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and refused to attend the conference. Regarding this, Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, recently issued a statement to Havas, stating, "The Japanese government's attitude is arrogant, rude, and lacks sympathy. The representatives of the countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have a very moderate and compromising spirit, and even make concessions to seek perfection. Now Japan actually despises them. This is tantamount to slapping the entire Nine-Power Treaty Conference in the face. The Japanese government still values power and disregards justice, which can be seen here." (Central News Agency, December 12, Havas)

### Outline of Tokyo's Reply

[Tokyo] Regarding Japan's reply to Belgium's second invitation to send representatives to the Nine-Power Conference, it stated that the Japanese government cannot accept the invitation to participate in a conference convened under the Nine-Power Treaty after being condemned for violating the terms of the Nine-Power Treaty. The reply stated that the letter of November 7 has been received and the opinions of the participating countries stated in the letter have been learned. As a result of careful consideration, it is felt that these opinions are not sufficient to make the Japanese government change its views and policies that have been clearly expressed in the first reply on October 27 and the public declaration on the same day. The Japanese government has always believed that Japan's current actions in China are self-defense actions taken by Japan following China's provocative actions. Therefore, it is not within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty, and it is believed that there is no room to discuss the issue of applying the Nine-Power Treaty. Since the current incident originated in the special situation in East Asia, the most appropriate and fair solution can be obtained through direct negotiations between the two parties directly concerned. As for the attempt to negotiate in a collective institutional structure such as the Beijing Conference, it will only arouse the emotions of the people of the two countries and hinder the satisfactory resolution of this matter. This is the Japanese government's firm belief. If all countries fully understand the above views and help promote the stability of East Asia in a manner that suits the actual situation, the Japanese government will be happy to do so. Regarding the statement by the participating countries that all countries related to the Far East are affected by the current hostile actions, and the whole world is concerned about the repercussions of these hostile actions on the peace and security of all countries, the Japanese government now wishes to state that Japan is now doing its best to respect foreign rights and interests in China and has the deepest concern to establish peace with the satisfactory outcome of the current incident. Japan has clearly revealed all this in its repeated declarations. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)

### Representatives Decide to Cancel the Final Application to Japan

Brussels After the outline of the Japanese reply was transmitted here, it caused a deep impression. British Foreign Secretary Eden immediately discussed it with the representatives of the countries attending the Nine-Power Conference. Public opinion is that since the wording of the Japanese reply is so firm, it would be superfluous to request Japan again. Therefore, the plan to issue the last application has been cancelled. It is heard that tomorrow's meeting will consider preparing a draft of the entire situation statement. An informal meeting will be held tomorrow morning, and a public meeting will be held in the afternoon. Another informal meeting will be held on Monday to pass the statement, and then this statement will be sent to Japan as one of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty. There is currently no certainty about future progress. The official original text of the Japanese reply has not yet arrived. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)

[Paris] French Foreign Minister Dalbos departed from here at 2:00 pm for Beijing to attend tomorrow's Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, December 12, Havas)

Brussels Japan has now replied that it refuses to accept the second invitation issued by Belgium to attend the Nine-Power Conference. The countries will then proceed with the plan to deal with the current situation in Beijing, and plan to make a final application to Japan. This application is now being prepared and will be submitted to the plenary meeting of the Nine-Power Conference tomorrow morning. If approved, it will be issued immediately and request an immediate reply. When the Beijing Conference has exhausted its methods of reconciliation, it will face the difficulties that already existed when the meeting was convened, namely how to deal with this stalemate. Public opinion is that the answer to this question will come from Washington. People in Beijing believe that the Japanese reply has politely closed the door to the possibility of continuing negotiations with the Nine-Power Conference. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)

Brussels According to French Foreign Minister Dalbos's statement last night, "Once the Japanese reply is received, we can decide what steps to take. We have decided to act quickly."

### Japan's Use of Force Can Never Conquer All of China

British Newspapers Express Doubt About the Success of German Mediation, Ambassador Gu Says Cooperation Among Nations Can Thwart Violence

[London] The Manchester Guardian commented on the Sino-Japanese War today, saying that Japan cannot solve its problems through military victories. If it wants to continue fighting until the entire Republic of China is defeated and the Chinese army is completely collapsed, even the most warlike Japanese seem to be daunted by this. However, the most doubtful thing today is whether Germany can find a basis for peace talks that can be accepted by both sides. The Chinese army can never accept Japan's peace terms under any circumstances. (Central News Agency, November 11, Reuters)

Brussels Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, gave a speech on American radio last night, mentioning President Roosevelt's statement that 90% of the world's people want peace. Gu said that there are many ways to stop international trampling on laws and aggression and achieve results with the unanimous goal and common determination of the majority of the world's people without resorting to force. If peace-loving countries take any joint mutual assistance plan, it will be enough to generate spiritual, diplomatic, and economic deterrent power and thwart the forces of turmoil and chaos in international life. For the sake of lasting peace, we must ensure that war cannot obtain any benefits. (Central News Agency, December 12, Reuters)

### Japan Establishes General Headquarters

Military Authorities Draft Military Orders, Expected to be Implemented Within Days

[Tokyo] According to semi-official sources here, after a long period of negotiations, the government has reached a consensus on the establishment of a general headquarters, which will be established in Tokyo soon. This organization will be purely a military institution. The original plan to grant it the highest administrative power and wartime economic power in addition to military power has been cancelled. It is said that the reason for the delay in establishing the general headquarters is that the issue of reorganizing the cabinet is being considered at the same time, and opinions are quite divided. (Haitong Telegram, November 11)

[Tokyo] The general headquarters decided by the government to establish is not based on the wartime general headquarters regulations promulgated during the Russo-Japanese War, but is established in accordance with another military order. This military order is currently being drafted by the army and navy authorities and can be completed in two or three days. The army and navy ministers will submit it for approval. If the procedures go smoothly, it can be implemented on the 15th or 16th of this month. The government is conducting an in-depth study by the relevant authorities due to the opinions of all parties on the organization of the general headquarters, but this is related to the issue of reforming the cabinet system, and the research work is inevitably slightly delayed. However, recently, the opinions of the army and navy authorities have been unified, and due to the progress of the battle situation in Shanghai, it has been decided to set up a general headquarters in Tokyo in the near future in order to achieve the goal of punishing China. The government will issue military orders after its preparations and procedures are completed. (Domei Telegram, December 12)

### Preliminary Talks Between Britain and Italy to Adjust Relations Between the Two Countries

Chamberlain Will Send a Letter to the Italian Prime Minister to Discuss Four Issues

[Rome] British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, held a lengthy talk this afternoon at the invitation of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The preliminary stage of talks between Britain and Italy on adjusting relations has begun. It is heard that Ciano told the British Ambassador that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech at the New Mayor of London banquet expressed his willingness to promote relations with Italy, which Italy is very willing to realize and should be initiated by Britain first. Regarding the relations between Britain and Italy, Italian political figures have generally believed that British Foreign Secretary Eden is firmly opposed to rapprochement with Italy. Prime Minister Chamberlain is now preparing to hold talks with Italy. The Roman Diplomatic News published an article yesterday advocating that Britain should express its attitude and implement Prime Minister Chamberlain's claim to improve British-Italian relations. It is generally believed that this article was written by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Central News Agency, November 11, Havas)

[London] Regarding the talks between Britain and Italy to adjust relations, Prime Minister Chamberlain will soon send a personal letter to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The draft letter is currently being drafted by personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition, the British government also intends to have Foreign Secretary Eden and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano hold talks, but this must be decided after Mussolini receives Prime Minister Chamberlain's letter and expresses his attitude. As for the preliminary talks between Britain and Italy that are currently being conducted through diplomatic channels, it is heard that they have encountered considerable difficulties. Because Britain previously requested that the issue of the Italian Radio Bari broadcasting anti-British programs in September last year be resolved first before talks could be held with Italy. The Italian side refuses to accept any preconditions, which is the difficulty. (Central News Agency, November 11, Havas)

Regarding the British-Italian talks, there are four main goals for Italy: ㊀ to promote British recognition of the Italian Empire, and ㊁ to indirectly weaken the British policy towards the Soviet Union. As for the future talks between Britain and Germany, the colonial issue will be the most important. (Central News Agency, November 11, Havas)

### British Privy Councilor Will Go to Berlin

At the Invitation of the German Authorities

[London] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated in the House of Commons today that Viscount Halifax, Privy Councilor, will visit Führer Hitler in Berlin next week.

Halifax has accepted, and the German invitation is purely private, said a general person who recognizes Halifax's visit to Germany, is actually the most important development in British-German relations after the European War, and hears that Foreign Secretary Eden is quite dissatisfied with this matter. (National Telegram, December 12)

[Berlin] It was recently heard that British Privy Councilor Halifax will come to Germany in the middle of next week. The political circles here expressed a warm welcome upon hearing this.

### U.S. Closely Watching Developments in Brazilian Politics

President Takes Sole Control, Cabinet Resigns and Reorganizes

[Washington] U.S. State Department official Welles declared that the new Brazilian constitution is purely a Brazilian matter. However, he believes that U.S. officials are now closely watching developments in Brazil, but not without anxiety. (Reuters, 12th Central News Agency)

[Washington] Regarding the establishment of a dictatorship in Brazil, U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently declined to comment, stating that an important agreement was established at last year's Pan-American Peace Conference, stipulating that American countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. "If the U.S. government were to formally comment on the situation in Brazil, it would inevitably conflict with this agreement," he said. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)

⊙ Capital of Brazil: Following the resignation of the Brazilian cabinet today, President Vargas has at least temporarily taken control of all executive and legislative power. Soon, Brazil will become the first country in the Americas to create a fascist-like political system. The new constitution was promulgated yesterday, granting dictatorial powers to the president and his cabinet. The president's first step was to announce the dissolution of all nationally elected organizations, such as the parliament and local councils. Now that the cabinet has also resigned, the president's second step will likely be to organize a four-part government, with legislation, administration, national economy, and justice all under the president's guidance, indirectly elected by the people. The president's term is six years, after which he can designate one or two people as his successors. The parliament will also be bicameral, but the president has the power to dissolve or postpone meetings at any time. The National Economic Council is an organization of professional groups, similar to Italy's fascist professional group organization. The president declared today that all current measures are temporary, pending a final decision by the National Assembly. Vargas will remain in office for the time being. If the National Assembly approves the new constitution, Vargas's term will end. At the same time, Vargas also announced a temporary halt to foreign debt payments, stating that Brazil does not want to take on even greater new debts to repay old debts. (11th National Telegram)

⊙ Capital of Brazil: Following the promulgation of the new constitution, satisfaction was expressed throughout the country. The governor of São Paulo even sent a telegram to President Vargas, stating that everyone was united, and all military institutions were as calm as ever. Foreign Minister Felinto Müller explained the changes in the political system to the foreign envoys. The cabinet has submitted its resignation en masse, allowing President Vargas to reorganize it as he sees fit. It is reported that Army Chief General Góis Monteiro, Navy Chief Admiral Guilhem, and Justice Minister Macedo Soares will all be reappointed. In addition, Brazil had originally abolished the death penalty, but it has now been reinstated by the new constitution to punish certain criminals. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)

### Reactions in the Americas to Brazil's Implementation of Dictatorship

⊙ Mexico City: Regarding the coup in Brazil, the Mexican General Confederation of Labor has issued an appeal to labor unions in Latin American countries, calling for joint protests and advocating for the prompt convening of a Latin American labor conference to resist fascism. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)

[Washington] Diplomatic figures from South American countries recently commented on the coup in Brazil, saying that Brazil has benefited greatly from trade with the United States. If it leaves the U.S. sphere of influence, its economic life will be greatly affected, so President Vargas may not take it lightly and closely cooperate with dictatorial countries, thereby harming U.S. interests. The coup in Brazil has already triggered a reaction in the U.S. Congress. Senator Borah stated that the new Brazilian system has all the characteristics of fascism. He will resolutely oppose any actions that would help it succeed. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee is currently discussing the proposal to lease six destroyers to Brazil, and it may agree with Borah's opinion and reject the proposal. In addition, the agreement between the U.S. and Brazil in July, stipulating that the U.S. could sell $50 million worth of gold to Brazil, may not continue to be fulfilled due to Brazil's plan to suspend foreign debt payments. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)

### The True Meaning of the Coup is Not Yet Fully Understood

[Paris] Responsible individuals here recently commented on the coup in Brazil, saying that it is too early to say that the country has adopted a dictatorship, indicating that the true meaning of the coup is not yet fully understood. What can be said is that President Vargas's intention is clearly to revise the constitution, because under the original constitution, Vargas would not be able to be re-elected in next year's election. Vargas had already begun preparations months ago to ensure that his successor would follow his policies. However, the candidate Vargas supported, Américo de Almeida, had little chance of being elected. Conversely, his political opponent, José Américo de Almeida e Oliveira, was deeply supported by the business community and Brazil's three major newspapers, and was especially popular in Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Recently, José Américo even published a letter to officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, stating that if a coup were to occur in the country, he hoped that the armed forces would not support it. It is generally believed that President Vargas launched the coup because of this letter. However, whether Vargas's actions will succeed depends on the loyalty of the armed forces, and the attitude of Brazil's anti-communist "Integralist Action" is also very important. (The party has nominated Plínio Salgado as its candidate for next year's election. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)

### Fascist Victory: Germany and Italy Express Satisfaction

[Berlin] Regarding the coup in Brazil, German newspapers have praised it, saying that the conspiracies carried out by the Soviet Union in Brazil have suffered a fatal blow. The Berliner Tageblatt wrote, "Moscow has now lost another opportunity." As for the allegations in U.S. newspapers that the Brazilian coup was influenced by certain factions in France, they are malicious slanders. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)

[Rome] News of the coup in Brazil has been widely reported in the local newspapers, but few have commented on it. Most newspaper headlines focus on the anti-communist and corporatist nature of the new Brazilian constitution, and say that foreign newspapers believe this is a victory for fascism. (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)

⊙ Capital of Argentina: Brazilian Congressman João Neves da Fontoura, who fled here due to political differences with the Brazilian authorities, recently commented on the coup in his country, saying, "I firmly believe in the strength of the democratic forces in the country, and I am still optimistic even now. European fascism must seek support in South America in order to engage in war. Vargas fell into their trap because of indecision, which is regrettable. Vargas's so-called new system is actually fascism." Argentine Senator Alfredo Palacios said that Brazil has been played by the reckless, and that the so-called "corporatism or totalitarian government is absurd." In addition, the Argentine newspaper La Prensa reported that "the future of the American continent is bleak, and the signs are already visible. Fortunately, Brazilian farmers are inherently strong and will resist fascism." (Havas, 11th Central News Agency)

It is said that the Duke originally intended to participate, but after hearing that the church minister, Dr. Darwell, said that the church's attitude towards divorce and remarriage was very strict, and that while he respected the Duke very much, he thought it would be better for the Duke not to participate in the religious service.

Special Essay

### Maintaining and Cherishing the Great Spirit of the Nation

— Jin Zhonghua

Our troops on the Shanghai-Songhu battlefield, after three months of bloody battles, have moved and defended the second line of defense the day before yesterday. This second line of defense is the real national defense line on our eastern battlefield. From now on, our military's resistance will be much more convenient and much stronger than the bloody and arduous struggle on the temporarily built defense line over the past three months. This is something to be comforted by. However, for the past three months, our compatriots in Shanghai have heard the sounds of guns and cannons on the surrounding battle lines and seen the wounded soldiers covered in blood. Our fervent emotions for national independence and liberation have been constantly rising with this direct stimulation. Now, as the battle line moves further away, the sounds of our guns and cannons and our heroic soldiers are also gradually moving away from us. This may arouse feelings of grief and indignation in many compatriots, and these feelings of grief and indignation are a profound expression of our love and cherishment for our nation. However, what we want to encourage the millions of compatriots in Shanghai to do is that pure feelings of grief and indignation are useless. From now on, we should maintain and develop our great strength in cherishing the nation with a more tenacious and calmer spirit.

There is one point we need to recognize at present, that is, at least temporarily, the compatriots in Shanghai will be separated from the front line of the war of resistance. This situation will inevitably place the compatriots here in a more difficult life. Real news of the war of resistance will not be easily and quickly transmitted; certain tangible and intangible threats will gradually tighten; and some people who only care about their own interests and do not care about the overall situation may indulge in the immediate comfort and gradually forget the great struggle for national independence and liberation. Precisely because of this situation, we must remind the many compatriots here to strive to maintain the great spirit of cherishing the nation.

Everyone should remember that around Shanghai, our hundreds of thousands of soldiers have shed blood in the struggle for national liberation. Tens of thousands of heroic souls remain forever in the Shanghai-Songhu area. We cannot forget them, so we cannot forget our nation in the arduous struggle. On the other hand, on a wider front, our countless soldiers are still constantly fighting with the invaders. The sound of war drums will be transmitted far into our ears, and the cries of our countless newly emerging soldiers of the entire nation will continue to motivate us. As long as we grit our teeth, remain calm, and work hard, even though we are far from the front line of the war of resistance, we are not necessarily below the battle line.

The emotionally agitated period of the early stages of the war of resistance has passed; from now on will be a period of using reason to calmly and arduously fight. In our nation's long-term struggle for liberation, we cannot hope for short-term, unexpected great victories; but as long as the whole country is of one heart and perseveres, we will surely win the final victory. Therefore, we should more earnestly encourage each other, hoping that every compatriot will maintain the great spirit of cherishing the nation!

### Liu Xiang Arrives in Beijing and Gives a Speech

[Nanjing] Liu Xiang, Director of the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Commission, arrived in Beijing by boat from Hankou on the morning of the 12th. He is scheduled to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the coming days to report on the military and political affairs of Sichuan and Kangding and to seek instructions on anti-Japanese strategies. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him, and he gave the following speech: Japanese imperialism's policy towards our country is to eliminate our nation as the ultimate goal. However, our country is united from top to bottom, and under the leadership of the supreme leader, we are implementing a comprehensive and long-term war of resistance. It has only been three months, and the enemy's consumption has exceeded what they expected. Therefore, final victory will undoubtedly belong to our side. Sichuan Province is an important rear area and can contribute a lot to the government. In addition to mobilizing to participate in the war of resistance, we are currently working hard to develop resources. My visit to Beijing this time is to pay a visit to the supreme authorities, seek instructions on anti-Japanese strategies, and approve the construction plans for Sichuan Province. I will go to the front lines in the coming days to supervise the resistance of my troops, and I will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. In short, our country will survive if we resist, and perish if we are humiliated. I do not believe that a Chinese nation with thousands of years of history and culture will be defeated by Japan. I hope that the great popular strength of our country will resolutely resist to the end and decisively inflict a fatal blow on the enemy. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)

### Joint Memorial Service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Held by the Central Government and the National Government

Lin Sen Reports on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Spirit of Resisting Japan

[Nanjing] The Central Government and the National Government jointly held a memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday in the Central Auditorium at 7:00 AM on the 12th. Seventy-one members attended. Chairman Lin Sen presided and gave a report. The report is recorded below:

"Fellow comrades, today is the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, which can also be said to be the anniversary of the birth of the Three Principles of the People, and even more so the anniversary of the birth of the Republic of China. Because of the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, the Three Principles of the People were created. With the creation of the Three Principles of the People, the Republic of China was established. Therefore, how joyful and enthusiastic should we be in celebrating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday? However, the Republic of China, which was created with such difficulty by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, is now being wantonly invaded by the enemy. Brave and loyal soldiers throughout the country are fighting valiantly to resist the enemy. At this time, when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we should be even more determined in our will, concentrate our strength, and resist to the end to protect the Republic of China, which was created with such difficulty by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The enemy has sent a large number of troops to invade us and is using the most brutal means imaginable, such as massacring civilians and bombing cultural institutions, hospitals for the wounded, and refugee shelters. Although they have been condemned by the world for upholding justice, they have not ceased their brutal behavior. There is no doubt that they will be abandoned by the world. Our frontline soldiers are loyal and courageous in defending the country and sacrificing themselves heroically. Military experts from various countries who have gone to investigate have all praised them. Therefore, even though we are in difficult circumstances, as long as we raise our spirits, gather all the strength of the nation, and follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of fearlessness, we will engage in a long-term resistance against the enemy. Final victory will surely belong to us." (Central News Agency, 12th)

### Seeking to Unite the Nation and the People

Chairman Wang Publishes an Article (Continued)

[Nanjing] There is no country in the world that does not pay attention to its own survival. Having paid attention to its own survival, there is no country that does not guard against becoming isolated. Especially when a country is forced to fight with others for its survival, it will seek help. Since the implementation of the New Economic Policy and the two Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union has gradually become a strong country in the world. And its country is geographically in a situation where it is least afraid of invasion. However, it is so eager to pay attention to diplomatic relations and seek allies. If we hear such high-sounding talk, we will be startled, shrug our shoulders, and stick out our tongues. This is by no means a fabricated thought. In addition, there are some people who hold the view that China should at least set aside fascist countries, which is also wrong. The countries in the world today are not what they used to be. There will be no crusades because of Christianity and non-Christianity, and no civil wars because of Protestantism and Catholicism. The elements of uniting because of the same principles are far less close than uniting because of the same interests. China's relationship with these countries, in terms of principles, has its own political freedom, such as people choosing the system that is most suitable for their own national conditions and adding or subtracting from it for application. There is no need to force each other. In terms of interests, there is no conflict of interests between each other. Friendship and commercial relations and economic relations are increasing day by day. What reason is there to set him aside? Isn't this what Mencius said, "driving fish into the deep, and driving birds into the forest"? Especially Germany, because after the defeat, it has tasted suffering, and wants to get rid of unequal shackles and restore equal status. Its efforts are even more admirable. As for other countries, even if they do not have a close relationship with China, it is beneficial to the world and also beneficial to China to make fair claims on justice and humanity. For example, when the League of Nations voted on the Sino-Japanese issue, only Siam had previously abstained from voting. This time, in addition to Siam, there was only Poland. This shows that all countries are enthusiastic about maintaining justice and humanity, deeply abhor the atrocities of Japan, and have deep sympathy for China's determined resistance. These are all things that we cannot ignore. In short, since China's foreign policy has been determined to follow the path of international peace, anyone who opposes aggression can be China's allies. China can only do its best to win the sympathy of all countries, and then get the assistance of all countries, and then jointly impose sanctions on the aggressors with all countries. This is the attitude that China should take on weekdays, especially during the war of resistance. Furthermore, the purpose of uniting the people to resist the war is to save China from its decline and revive it. To achieve this goal, we must unite the 400 million people with the determination to die and make the greatest possible effort. Where the effort lies, the first is naturally military. If the 400 million people are trained and go to the battlefield, one after another, then the war of resistance will be protracted and achieve final victory. The second is politics, economy, finance, education, and even literature, etc., regardless of spiritual or material, everything must be concentrated and intensified. To say it more realistically, these tasks should not only not be relaxed because of the war of resistance, but also intensified because of the war of resistance. Because the significance of the war of resistance is not only to consume the enemy's strength in a passive way, but also to increase our strength in a positive way. This is the foundation for the war of resistance to be prolonged, and it is also the foundation for resisting the enemy to achieve final victory. In this way, the war of resistance is not only the business of the frontline soldiers, but the business of the people all over the country. Whether the people work hard or not is the biggest key to whether the war of resistance can be protracted and whether it can achieve final victory because of protractedness. Therefore, uniting the people is necessary in peacetime, and especially urgent during the war of resistance. The question now is, how can we unite the people? Some people say that during the European War, such as England and France, the people of the whole country were united regardless of factions. No matter how different the various opinions are on politics and economy, as long as they recognize that the country is above all else, they can unite and work together. This statement can naturally be done in England and France, where the national foundation has been established and democratic politics has been successful. If China, which is in the process of establishing the national foundation, and where democratic politics is just beginning to be trained and has not yet matured, must not be considered again today. Because in today's precarious situation, there must be a center for uniting the people, and there must be a principle as the center. With a principle, the people can clearly recognize the past, present, and future, and have an accurate direction for the future, and hold on to it, and move forward. It was said above that the war of resistance is not only military but also extends to politics, economy, finance, education, and even literature, etc. Since there are so many aspects, there must be a principle to command it. Just in terms of military, since March, the facts show that the combat capability of the army that has been trained in the Three Principles of the People must be strong. We don't have to list the serial numbers of the army, just the all-group martyrdom of Nankou, the all-battalion martyrdom of Baoshan, and the enemy soldiers on various fronts who have died without retreating without orders, are enough to prove it one by one. In summary, since March, there has not been a day or a time when the flesh and blood of the soldiers, especially the flesh and blood of the elite soldiers, has not been used to build trenches to block the enemy's advance. Why do they have this spirit of heroic sacrifice? Because they have been trained in the Three Principles of the People on weekdays, they understand that in terms of nationalism, they must be worthy of their ancestors and worthy of their descendants, and they understand that in terms of democracy and people's livelihood, they know that moving forward will surely lead China to freedom, equality, and light and happiness, otherwise it will be trapped in slavery. With the Three Principles of the People standing in front, leading them and guiding them to move forward, they are both energetic and calm, using their own flesh and blood to build a trench to block the enemy's invasion, and at the same time build a happy road for 400 million compatriots and their descendants to walk together. We believe that every elite soldier, when he sacrifices his life, will take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as his greatest price and supreme comfort. The same is true for the army, and the same is true for all other aspects. With principles, there is faith, with faith, there is sincerity, with sincerity, there is unity, with unity, there is strength, and with strength can we persist, and can we achieve final victory. Therefore, we should not talk about unity, but if we talk about unity, there must be a center, and the principle must be the center, and the Three Principles of the People must be the center. The comrades of the Chinese Kuomintang have a deep responsibility for the failure to realize the Three Principles of the People. The Chinese compatriots must also recognize that at this critical moment of life and death, only the Three Principles of the People can unite the people. Therefore, the recent declaration of the Chinese Communist Party also earnestly stated that it is willing to fight for the realization of the Three Principles of the People. If we are happy to unite the body of 400 million people into one body, and unite the hearts of 400 million people into one heart, then the war of resistance will surely be prolonged, and the prolongedness will surely achieve final victory, which is undoubtedly true. Today, during the war of resistance, when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we feel infinite emotion and infinite excitement. I offer these words as a small contribution.

### Refugees Still Gather on the Streets in Bitter Wind and Rain

A Corner of the Old North Gate is Opened to Transport Food; Father Raoult's Tireless Efforts and Chivalry are Admirable

A Corner of the Iron Gate Transports Food

The Shanghai International Relief Committee is deeply concerned about the safety and sustenance of refugees in the South City. It has invited various charitable organizations for serious discussions and has asked Father Raoult to negotiate with the French Municipal Council to open the iron gate at the junction of the South City and the French Concession to transport food and settle refugees. However, the French authorities, considering the still tense situation in the South City, and to avoid accidents, have not yet agreed to do so temporarily. Only a corner of the iron gate at the Old North Gate has been opened, and the committee, together with various charitable organizations, is sending food for the refugees from there. However, many refugees who want to take refuge in the concession are still being blocked. Currently, along the Min'guo Road in the northern part of the South City, there are no less than 50,000 to 60,000 refugees gathered. For the past two days, they have been sleeping in the streets, exposed to wind and rain, and unable to eat when hungry. The situation is extremely miserable.

Since the change in our army's defense line, the South City has become a war zone. People are generally concerned about the refugee area set up by Father Raoult, which happens to be surrounded by the front line. Especially yesterday's report that the refugee area was cut off from supplies and the lives of more than 100,000 people were in danger. However, according to reporter investigations, the supply problem in the refugee area was handled the day before yesterday by the responsible persons of the city branch of the Refugee Relief Committee, together with He Fangli, a diplomatic expert from the Central Political Conference, and Lu Bohong and Wu Kaisheng, who negotiated with the French police. The French police issued a pass, and the Relief Association and the Charity Federation jointly prepared vehicles to transport bread and guangbing (a type of flatbread) from the iron gate of the concession at the Old North Gate, totaling 30,000 to 40,000 pieces, to distribute to the refugees in the reception center to satisfy their hunger, so there was no impact for the time being.

Suffering from Hunger and Cold is Unbearable

A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency went to the iron gate at the border yesterday and saw that the refugees looked haggard, and some were sitting on the ground weeping silently, which was very heartbreaking. Although various charitable organizations and enthusiastic people in the concession were handing over large cakes and bread through the iron gate for relief, there were too few monks and too little porridge, which was of no help. Until about 1:00 PM, it suddenly rained, and the refugees' clothes were all wet. Suffering from hunger and cold, the suffering was unbearable. Various charitable organizations tried their best to dredge up all parties in order to help the refugees out of danger and maintain humanity. However, as of 5:00 PM, these refugees were still gathered there and had not retreated.

Actively Seeking to Restore Water for Refugees

According to the person in charge of the International Relief Committee, the committee is currently engaging in multi-faceted contacts in order to ensure the comprehensive equipment of the refugee area in the South City. The most urgent matter at present is to raise sufficient supplies for the refugees and to restore the application of tap water in the area as soon as possible. The problem of tap water has now been discussed with the French authorities, who will send workers to connect the water pipes as soon as the situation turns slightly and within the possible range. The committee also plans to set up a permanent office in the area in order to handle daily affairs nearby.

### South City and Pudong Ravaged Amidst Smoke and Scorched Earth

South Wharf Completely Burned and Rice Ships Also Sunk; Reliance on Righteous Ferries and the Essence of the Area Turned into Ashes by Fire

South City Since the day before yesterday, the area west of Xie Bridge in the South City has been reduced to scorched earth due to the indiscriminate throwing of incendiary bombs. The area east of Xie Bridge, from Lujiabang to Haichao Temple, was wantonly bombed by more than a dozen Japanese aircraft from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, so the houses are not complete. The area around the South Railway Station is also half scorched earth. The Family Industrial Society (ie, Invincible Brand Tooth Powder Factory) west of the local court was destroyed, and the Disabled Welfare Home in front of the local court was also destroyed. The houses in Huairenli on Huining Road behind the local court were completely destroyed. Many houses in the Liyuan Road area were destroyed, and even the Bingshe of the Yixi Guild Hall was affected. There are no intact houses between Lujiabang and the South Railway Station. Many houses in the Nan Wharf, Dongjiadu, Dama Wharf, Dadongmen, and Xian’gua Street areas were also bombed. Dozens of houses on both sides of Taiping Street in the city, including the Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Fuxingyuan Restaurant, caught fire. Fortunately, the French Concession Fire Brigade connected the water to save them, so as to avoid affecting the refugee area. Therefore, after the entire street of Taiping Street to Dengyun Bridge was burned down, it was extinguished. Stray bullets hit the Dadongmen and Xiaonanmen areas, and many houses were also destroyed. The Bund area is almost half a pile of rubble. The South Wharf along the cordon was completely burned, and the ships on the shore, including rice ships, were all destroyed and sunk. The fires in Nanshi Manufacturing Bureau Road, Huining Road, Gaochang Temple, Longhua Road, and Sanpailou in the city have not been extinguished, and the fire is still raging. The black smoke in the sky is rising straight up, and it can be seen winding around. The scope is so wide that it is still burning at noon.

Starting at dawn yesterday morning, three enemy planes patrolled back and forth over the city of South City. Around 7:00 AM, two more planes flew in, and it took half an hour before they turned back. Around 10:00 AM, two more planes flew in to patrol.

Pudong There are currently about 5,000 enemy troops stationed in Pudong. Two-thirds have been assigned to the more than ten li along the Pu border south of Dongchang Road to fight against the South City. The large and small artillery positions arranged at each ferry port number forty to fifty. Yesterday, from morning to dusk, they launched a fierce bombardment of the Pu border area of South City. The destroyed warehouses and markets are countless. The Nanhangpu surface was filled with smoke. Looking from Pudong, the line of sight was blurred. There are still more than 2,000 enemy soldiers stationed in Yangjing Qichang Warehouse, Dongchang Road, Yangjiadu, and Tangqiao, carrying out their destructive work all day long. Relying on the righteous ferries, Dajie was still intact the day before yesterday. Starting from the Pudong Grand Theater in the north to the north of the Pawnshop Alley in the south, the essence of the area was turned into ashes after the fire yesterday morning. Although it rained continuously after noon, the fire did not diminish slightly. More than a hundred rooms on the Police Bureau Road west of Pudong Hospital and south of the hospital were also destroyed. Hundreds of houses in Wujia Alley were burned down. The Yihua Real Estate behind the Taikoo Company's warehouse was completely destroyed. Although the company tried its best to rescue it, it was of no avail. The Xiaoyangjing Temple was also burned down, and many houses on the Minfang Road of Nanshoutang in the south were also affected. No small number of rural villages such as Cao'an to Shengjiahang and Xijiazhai were destroyed. After the Huazhan of China Merchants Bureau was bombed and burned the day before yesterday, more than a dozen warehouses along the Pu border of the China Merchants South Station in Yangjiadu were also burned to the ground yesterday morning. All the local poor people who had not had time to escape were still numerous. Yesterday, they were all under surveillance. The young and strong were forced to fill hard labor, carrying military supplies, and the old and weak stayed at home and were not allowed to go out. Small enemy flags were distributed to each house to hang at the door.

### Yesterday the Entire City Celebrated Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday with Vigorous Spirit

All Sectors Hung Flags and Held Memorial Ceremonies Separately; Customs and Post Offices Were Closed for One Day to Mark the Celebration

Yesterday was the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. All sectors of the city hung flags to celebrate. Various government agencies, schools, and public organizations held memorial ceremonies at 9:00 AM separately. The people of the whole city, facing a strong enemy, were even more vigorous in spirit. Remembering the difficulties of Dr. Sun Yat-sen leading the revolution and creating the Republic of China, they decided to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and the bravely resisting soldiers, and continue to move forward without fear of any difficulties and hardships, in order to complete the great cause of national revival and freedom and equality, and to comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven.

In addition to holding memorial ceremonies separately at 9:00 AM, the various agencies and schools in the city, the representatives of the sectors held a joint memorial ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday morning (the 12th), with more than a thousand people attending. Zhu Xuechun and others served as the presidium. First, the whole body stood in silence for three minutes to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Then the chairman reported that the significance of commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday is especially today when the whole front is resisting Japan, and Shanghai has fallen into the hands of the enemy. Commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday in Shanghai, its significance is even more profound and significant. After the report, the whole body stood up again and stood in silence for three minutes for the national martyrs. Then the meeting adjourned after shouting slogans. Although the memorial ceremony was short, the atmosphere at the meeting was very solemn, tense, and dignified.

Also, the banks and money houses in the city were closed for one day yesterday to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday to show their celebration. The Jianghai Customs was closed yesterday and stopped closing the customs all day. The Shanghai Post Office, parcel and remittance departments, also stopped working all day, and other departments were handled according to the Sunday working hours. The various branch offices also handled business according to the above time. The First Special District Local Court also stopped working for one day as usual. The court authorities had notified the public concession various police stations a day earlier that the transfer of prisoners would be stopped for one day.

### Various Food Organizations Try Their Best to Maintain People's Food

Trying to Dredge up Sources and Adjust Prices; Soaring Prices Greatly Affect the Poor

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that food regulation is the most important thing at this time of tense situation and traffic obstruction, has ordered the four guilds of bean rice industry, rice shop industry, miscellaneous grain oil cake industry, and flour factory industry to try to dredge up sources and adjust prices. The above four guilds have ordered their members to try their best to maintain people's food. Rice shops such as Yuchengtai, Shunfeng, and Wanchang in the public concession and the French concession are selling as much as possible, with a limit of one yuan per person. The price of the first number is fourteen yuan. The retail price of flour on the market yesterday ranged from four yuan to four yuan and one corner. Flour factories such as Fuxin and Fufeng are rushing to produce flour to meet the needs of the market. The concession authorities have tried to transport the rice stored in the warehouses in the Hongkou District. Also, the foreign rice ordered by the concession authorities from foreign countries has arrived in Shanghai in the first batch and will be sold soon, so there is no need to worry about food in Shanghai. The situation in Shanghai has been tight in recent days, and transportation is difficult. Regarding the food problem, in addition to food, various salted fish and vegetables operated by the fish industry are essential ingredients. Now the fish shops in the Xiaodongmen Shiliupu area, in order to maintain the food supply, are trying their best to ensure that the sources will not be cut off.

In the past two days, the prices of various foods in the concession have soared. According to reporter investigations, the price of vegetables such as cabbage and turnips today reached 450 yuan per catty (previously, it was only sold for 70 to 80 yuan per catty). The prices of other vegetables, fish, crabs, etc. have also soared. The livelihood of the poor is greatly affected. According to the news from the local goods industry, it has urgently telegraphed to purchase vegetables from Shandong and other places, which will soon be transported from outside. At that time, the price of vegetables is expected to fall back.

### The City Need Not Worry About Rice and Grain

Rice Stores to Start Selling at Fixed Prices Today　Large Quantities of Rice to be Shipped to Shanghai in Five Batches　A Conversation with He De-Kui

Because the rice originally stored in the rice stores of this city has mostly been sold out, and the source of rice and grain has been suddenly interrupted due to the impact of the war, many rice stores have temporarily suspended business due to lack of goods. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. He De-Kui, Deputy General Manager of the Public Concession Works Bureau, yesterday and received the following statement. Mr. He first said that Mr. Zhang Nian-Xuan, Chairman of the Rice Merchants Association of this city, and others have requested assistance from the Public Concession Bureau due to the lack of rice and grain in the city. The Bureau has now reached an agreement with fifty retail rice stores to purchase rice from the Bureau starting from the 13th of this month (today), all of which will be sold at cost. The price is set at nine cents per catty, and each purchaser is limited to one yuan, in order to maintain the food supply for the general poor citizens. In addition, there are more than two hundred retail rice stores in the Public Concession, which are also planning to purchase rice from the Public Concession Bureau within the next few days and sell it at cost according to the above method. In this way, all retail rice stores in the Public Concession will have rice to sell, and there will be no more cases of business suspension due to lack of goods. The Public Concession Bureau still has 20,000 bags of rice in storage (each bag is 120 pounds, equivalent to 198 catties). In addition, a large quantity of rice will soon arrive in Shanghai. The first batch is 25,000 bags, which will arrive on the 19th of this month. The second batch is 30,000 bags, which will arrive on the 21st of this month. The third and fourth batches are also 30,000 bags each, which will be shipped to Shanghai on the 23rd and 25th of this month. The total of the above is 115,000 bags. In addition, there are more than one hundred inland rice boats docked on the Huangpu River, totaling about 20,000 dan (each dan is equivalent to 160 catties), which should arrive in Shanghai within a few days. As for those who do not eat rice but only eat wheat flour products, it is even less of a problem. There are currently more than 500,000 bags of flour (each bag is 49 pounds) and more than 800,000 bags of wheat in the safe area of the city. Each bag can produce two bags of flour, so the total amount of flour stored in the city should be more than 2.9 million bags. From the above, it can be seen that the rice and grain in this city is abundant, and there is no need to worry about shortage. The citizens of this city should not be overly concerned.

### 200,000 Refugees in the City

Urgently Awaiting Alms and Relief

As of this morning, the total number of refugees in the city is over 60,000 in the Public Concession, over 50,000 in the French Concession, and 100,000 in the Nanshi (Chinese City), totaling over 200,000 people who urgently need alms and relief. Yesterday, more than one hundred refugees from Pudong fled to Shanghai, a truly tragic scene.

### Coal Stored in Pudong Taken Away by the Enemy

### The Shanghai Concession Issue

— Should

Since our troops temporarily retreated from the vicinity of Shanghai for strategic reasons, the land transportation between the Shanghai Concession and the inland has been cut off. The citizens in the Concession inevitably have deep concerns about the political protection they receive. Therefore, the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission and Mayor Yu each issued earnest announcements yesterday to inform the compatriots in the city. What they said greatly encouraged and gave confidence to the millions of citizens in Shanghai. Every citizen should keep these words deeply in mind.

Although the Shanghai Concession is now completely under the control of the enemy's military force, various government agencies of our country still exist within the Concession. The Concession authorities also strictly maintain their original powers. Of course, there should be no problems with all our country's sovereignty within the Concession. If there is any wavering, it will be a matter of the fate of the entire Concession.

We believe that military force cannot conquer everything, and that world justice and peace are ultimately an irresistible force. Especially for Shanghai, where international relations are very complex, military force cannot solve political problems. Recently, representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France discussed the Shanghai Concession issue in Brussels. Although the content is unknown, it can be asserted that these three major countries will adhere to the principle of respecting our country's sovereignty. Because if they do not do so, those countries will not be able to protect their interests in China.

### Reconsidering the Method of Buying Bonds with Rent

A Special Task Force Sends a Letter to the Real Estate Association

The First Special District Team of the National Salvation Bonds Citizens Mobilization Corps sent a letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, stating: "The purchase of national salvation bonds with rent is unanimously hoped for by all sectors. Your association previously resolved and announced to landlords to use one month's rent in September to purchase bonds, which shows sincerity in patriotism and is deeply admired. However, considering the economic depression in the city in recent years, most tenants are in arrears with rent. It will be difficult to exchange bank bond receipts for rent receipts for September until the arrears are cleared. At the same time, although the case has been published by your association in newspapers to notify landlords, few landlords have notified tenants accordingly. As a result, most tenants are doubtful and afraid that after buying public bonds with rent, they will be rejected by the landlords. Therefore, the campaign to buy public bonds with rent, although noisy for several months, has had little effect, which is a major regret for the public bond raising. After discussion at the meeting of the team leaders of this team, it was agreed that in view of the severity of the national crisis, landlords should be responsible for contributing money to save the country. The Real Estate Association should be requested to reconsider as soon as possible and cancel the stipulation of designating the rent for September. Any tenant who uses one month's rent to purchase public bonds on behalf of the landlord will be allowed to exchange it for the rent receipt for the most recent month. The landlord should also announce the method to the tenants in advance to facilitate the implementation. etc." It was recorded in the minutes. In addition to making suggestions to the National Salvation Bonds Mobilization Headquarters, a corresponding record was made and a letter was sent to your association for verification and prompt reconsideration. In addition, in order to understand the real estate situation in the First Special District and to persuade the tenants, this team requests your association to provide a copy of the membership list and a statement of the members' assets for reference. Thank you very much.

### The United States Should Not Adopt an Isolationist Policy

Long History of Sino-American Relations　This Move is Harmful to China　Remarks at a Banquet by the US Commercial Counsellor

The China Press reported that officers of the US military stationed in Shanghai held a banquet at the American Club last night (the 11th) to celebrate the anniversary of the armistice of the European War. Mr. Arnold, the US Commercial Counsellor, was also one of the guests. In his speech, he mentioned the long history of Sino-American friendship and commerce in the last decade of the 18th century. At that time, only sailboats were used for development. It was not until the establishment of the states on the Pacific coast that the United States re-emphasized its interests in China. Many Chinese products are used in American manufactured goods, such as carpets, pillows, toothbrushes, soap, tin, paint, hairnets, eggs, etc. Therefore, the American people are unknowingly in daily contact with Chinese products. Mr. Arnold deeply regretted the United States' adoption of an isolationist policy, saying that the Great Wall of China is now collapsing, while the United States is building a Great Wall around itself. This is obviously harmful, but he hopes this is only a temporary measure and urged the audience to strive to promote commerce and build a larger fleet of merchant ships. These factors can break the isolationist policy.

Although the enemy has been constantly advancing along the Jinghu Road and Nanda Highway for days, they have been repelled by our army. However, on the right-wing, the enemy's offensive in the area from Sijing to Songjiang is extremely fierce. There have been fierce battles on all roads for several days, especially near Sijing and Songjiang. According to news obtained this morning, Sijing Town has been abandoned by our army because it has no defensible terrain. It is now firmly defending the south bank of Sijingtang and Wenguanbang outside the town along the Songjiang-Sijing Highway, and has blown up the three stone bridges of the bang. In addition, our army has close contact with the line from north of Qingpu to Huangdu.

### Blockade Line of the Huangpu River Destroyed

Three Enemy Shallow Water Warships Entered the Southern Huangpu This Morning

The Huangpu River between Xiaodongmen and Laiyidu in Nanshi has been blockaded by us since before the outbreak of the war as a precaution. The enemy warships have never been able to go deeper inland. Now that Pudong and Nanshi have fallen into enemy hands one after another, the enemy is trying to destroy the obstacles blocking the Huangpu River. According to reliable information, a section along the Pudong side has been destroyed by them. At about 6:00 AM this morning, three enemy shallow water warships, fully loaded with soldiers, entered the Southern Huangpu but have not been seen leaving.

Central News Agency reports that Pudong and Nanshi have completely fallen into enemy hands. The blockade line in front of the Ningbo-Shaoxing Wharf at the 16th Pier has been destroyed. The two municipal ferries, large sand boats, tugboats, barges, and other ships originally docked in the river have all been robbed by the enemy. One Zhonghe merchant ship has been towed away, and the others are still docked there, but all are flying the Japanese flag. One enemy warship, the one that shelled Nanshi the day before yesterday, and multiple shallow water warships and small boats, fully loaded with sailors and weapons, sailed upstream along the river at about 6:00 AM this morning to reinforce various places. The Ningbo-Shaoxing warehouses along the Pudong have been shelled by the enemy more than a hundred times, with many scars and serious damage. The waste along the Pudong and in the river is piled up in an extremely chaotic manner. The bustling area has become a dead city. Only eagles and birds can be seen circling over the water.

### Order in the Northern Concession of Suzhou Creek is Gradually Restoring

Large Numbers of Refugees Sent to Shelters　Residents and Factories Gradually Recovering

The area north of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, from North Jiangxi Road to North Xizang Road (which is the British military zone), has been extremely dangerous since the outbreak of the Shanghai war due to stray bullets flying around in the war zone. Therefore, most residents moved to the area south of Suzhou Creek or the French Concession, accounting for eight or nine tenths of the entire area. Only those who remained were generally poor and unable to move, and the situation felt obviously deserted. In order to maintain public security and stability, the police authorities specially announced a curfew as early as 6:00 PM and turned off all the street lights north of Suzhou Creek. Therefore, from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, it was completely dark. However, since our Zhabei garrison retreated on the 26th of last month for strategic reasons, there has been no danger of stray bullets in the area, and the situation has gradually become safe. Trolleybuses on Route 6 have also been running. The street lights on North Zhejiang Road, Qipu Road, and the alley lights in the lanes have also been completely turned on since yesterday, except for the section north of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road, which is still not lit. Peng Road Municipal Feihong Primary School and Qunyi Girls' School in front of No. 920 Haining Road have been designated by the authorities as refugee shelters. A large number of refugees have been sent in yesterday, and the number of returning residents is also increasing day by day. The problem is that the landlords in the area cannot collect rent from the tenants, so they have notified the water company to cut off the water. The water in the well-known North and South Gaoshouli on Haining Road has also been cut off. Most residents are taking water from the Suzhou Creek for use. Although the Chinese Ratepayers' Association has issued a notice, advising landlords to restore the water supply, but it has not been implemented. It is heard that the curfew time in the area may be changed to be later due to the recent gradual stability. However, it is not yet known whether it can be adopted to be at 11:30 PM as south of Suzhou Creek. De Xing, Li Xing Tobacco Companies, and the main factory of the Great Eastern Book Company in the area, as well as other factories, have all resumed work as usual.

### 弔鄭將軍

In Memory of General Zheng

— Wang Xiushen

General Zheng Tingzhen, Major General of the Army and Commander of the Independent 5th Brigade, bravely supervised the battle during the Battle of Dabaihui on the 16th of this month and sacrificed himself for the country. Zheng was a native of Tuocheng County, Henan Province, 42 years old. His father had passed away, but his mother was still alive. He left behind five children, all of whom were extremely intelligent. His wife was extremely virtuous. Zheng joined the army in the 6th year of the Republic (1917) and had a deep understanding of military science. He served as brigade commander in the Northern Expedition campaigns of the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and repeatedly made outstanding achievements. He had a reputation as a brave general during the Second Group Army era. In recent years, he led his troops to suppress bandits and made even greater contributions. Zheng was extremely generous, loyal, and upright. He had no private savings and distributed his salary to his officers and soldiers, which is why he gained the trust of his superiors and the respect of his subordinates. He usually trained his soldiers with strict discipline, but with a combination of kindness and authority, treating his officers and soldiers like his own children, so they were happy to give their lives when faced with battle. This summer, when I served as the commander of the Third Suppression Zone in the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, Zheng also served as the deputy commander and provided much assistance. Later, due to the Japanese invasion, he was ordered to go to war in late August. Zheng led his entire brigade of elite soldiers north before me, and then I also led my troops on an eastward expedition. Due to the urgency of time, I did not meet with Zheng for a final conversation. We encouraged each other in telegrams to strive to kill the enemy to repay the country, and then we said goodbye. Now that Zheng has died before me for righteousness, how can I not grieve? At this critical moment of the war of resistance, as we strive for final victory, the loss of this brave general is extremely regrettable.

### 日拒參加比京會議談判門戶完全閉塞

Japan Refuses to Participate in the Beijing Conference, Negotiations Completely Blocked

Breaking the Stalemate Depends on the Attitude of the United States. Japanese Sources Say US-Japan Contacts are Possible

⊙Beijing The rejection by Japan of the second request to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference leads many to believe that, apart from discussing the matter on Japan's own terms, any possibility of continuing negotiations with the Japanese government has been completely blocked. The current plan for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to hold a closed-door discussion today regarding the Japanese reply, hoping to adopt a memorandum that provides a complete account of the true situation of the Sino-Japanese War. A public meeting will also be held this morning or afternoon, where British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Chief Representative Davis are expected to deliver important speeches to the attendees. Representatives of the British Commonwealth may also make speeches. There is reason to believe that the meeting will be adjourned after today's meeting to allow the representatives to consult with their respective governments. Eden will return to London to welcome the King and Foreign Secretary of Belgium, Spaak. The first intention of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference after learning of the Japanese government's reply rejecting the request was to make a final appeal to Tokyo. However, after Eden consulted with the representatives, they felt that the wording of the Japanese reply was firm and that continuing to make requests would be futile. Therefore, this intention has been abandoned. Now, all methods of mediation have been exhausted, which has made the Nine-Power Treaty Conference difficult to handle. This difficulty has been lurking behind the scenes since the beginning of the conference, namely, how to deal with the stalemate. Many believe that the answer must await instructions from Washington.

The letter stated, "Recently, we received a letter from citizens stating that since our army withdrew from western Shanghai, a rice shortage has suddenly arisen in the Concession, and all large and small rice shops claim that their rice stocks are empty, causing extreme panic among the people. They ask for relief." "According to the current situation, it is feared that river rice boats will not easily come to Shanghai. However, Anhui Province has a good harvest and river boats are still open, so it seems possible to find ways to transport and aid. Your association should discuss and decide on separate purchase and transport methods to provide assistance and reassure the people. With regard to prices, it is especially important to adjust them, not allowing speculators to raise prices privately. We hope you will plan thoroughly and report back."

### 瑣評

Short Commentary

— Xiang

The war of resistance has now reached three months. Since the loss of Nanshi, the entire Shanghai war situation has been completely different. Now the war situation has expanded to Songjiang, Qingpu, Fengjing, Shihuozao, and other places. Our heroic soldiers are still fighting bloody battles. Recalling the past three months, the losses suffered by our people due to the war cannot be counted in numbers. As for the success or failure of the war, it is still difficult to predict. As for the millions of refugees who are displaced, homeless, without clothes to wear, and without rice to eat, this is truly one of the most serious and urgent problems at the moment. Is there no way to deal with the aftermath? To whom shall we turn for help? When I think of this, I cannot help but feel my heart break and my liver split.

### 饒神甫盡力維持難民給養秩序

Father Jacquinot Does His Best to Maintain Order in Refugee Supplies

Organizing a Vigilante Team to Maintain Order, Delivering Supplies Twice a Day, Many Refugees are Sick and Eagerly Awaiting Medical Treatment

Since our army withdrew from Nanshi under orders, the refugee area issue has been deeply concerned by all parties. A New News Agency reporter visited the Shanghai International Relief Committee this morning to inquire. According to the person in charge of the Committee, although Nanshi has been occupied by the Japanese army, there is absolutely no problem in the refugee area. Father Jacquinot, the initiator, is currently in charge of everything in the area. The rumors that the enemy army had entered the refugee area have been denied by Father Jacquinot. The refugees currently sheltered are very safe, and the order in the area is being maintained by a vigilante team organized after the police withdrew with our army. The water and electricity problems have also been addressed by Father Jacquinot, who has requested the French authorities to open them. Once the situation improves slightly, the water pipes can be connected as far as possible. As for supplies, the Committee has formulated a plan to transport them in two batches every day at 8:30 AM and 3:00 PM. If people from all walks of life donate supplies, they can go directly to Room 318, 3rd Floor, Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, to be forwarded. It is also learned that the refugees gathered in the area along the Republic Road are being relocated by various charitable organizations to the refugee area for settlement.

The Tzu Lien Hui Refugee Relief Association, considering that the number of refugees in the refugee area within the city and those who have not been able to enter the Concession is extremely large, made a special large batch of food last night and tried to deliver it to Republic Road to supply the refugees. Today, it purchased two or three thousand pieces of bread, Guangbing biscuits, and steamed buns and delivered them to the International Relief Committee for forwarding to the refugee area. In addition, the drivers of the British-owned trolley company in the city initiated a fundraising campaign to purchase food and send it to the relief effort.

It is also reported that since the area northeast of Fangbang Road was designated as a refugee area, refugees from various places have continued to arrive one after another. The Yi Temple, Yu Garden, Qianye Nei Garden, the Jewelry Industry Branch, and other places are full of refugees, especially along the main road. According to statistics, the approximate numbers are:

Pudong: 57,000 people

Along the Huangpu River at the Great Wharf: 10,000 people

Pengpu to Caohejing: 3,000 people

Rihui Port Xietu Road: 15,000 people

Southwest of Fangbang Road: 21,000 people

Transferred from the Concession: 30,000 people

Others: 50,000 people

The above totals 166,000 people. At the beginning of winter, with the cold air coming in, without shelter, without food, without clothes, and without water, the suffering of the refugees is indescribable. Before the 11th, the Fire Brigade, the Protection Corps, the Police Boy Scouts, the Red Cross Society, the Protection Corps, and others maintained order. On the 12th, there was no one in charge, and the refugees were crying out for food, and the situation was extremely tragic, especially for women and children. According to Dr. Hua Jun, who is at No. 8-10 Fuyou Road, three or four out of ten refugees are sick, and he is the only one who has the responsibility to provide free consultations in the past few days. Two pregnant women gave birth to a son and a daughter in front of the Bodhisattva in the City God Temple, and he delivered them. There was also a pregnant woman of four months whose abdomen was pierced by a shrapnel fragment, with about two inches of large intestine flowing out. He bandaged and stitched it up, and arranged for her to be taken by the fire brigade's ambulance next to Xinkai River to a hospital in the Concession for treatment and rest. There are also many cases of gastrointestinal diseases, nervous disorders, and so on. It is hoped that the traditional Chinese medicine community in the Concession will go to the refugees to relieve their suffering in the spirit of human mutual aid.

### Guerrilla Warfare and People's Organizations (Continued)

— Nianci

(4) Firmly Establish Clear Field and Organize Iron Masses: Since one of the greatest missions of the guerrillas is to clear the fields, they must have close contact with the local people to achieve the goal of uniting the military and the people. When they leave, they must find ways to hide the food so that the enemy cannot get anything to eat when they come and cannot settle in.

(5) Use Light Weapons: As mentioned earlier, the guerrillas' equipment should be as easy to carry as possible, so they mostly use light weapons such as rifles and machine guns. They do not have any heavy equipment, and they have to move around, so at most they only need a few small cannons and mortars. There is no fixed type of gun. It is best to use the same type as the enemy. If they intercept the enemy's bullets, they can load them into their guns and use them.

(6) Secret Movements: When the guerrillas set off, the destination is usually unknown to all the team members except the officers. Everyone just follows the leader forward. Only after arriving at the destination do they realize where they are going.

(7) Decentralization: When the guerrillas do not have a mission, they do not gather together. Because everyone has the ability to work, they disperse to all directions when there is nothing to do. But when dispersing, they agree in advance that everyone must gather on time at a certain time. Therefore, when gathering, it is very quick and there is no need to call them together.

The Tasks of the Guerrillas

1. Organize the People: When the guerrillas arrive in a place, the first step is to assign team members to organize the people. Because their food and geographical problems need to be solved by the people.

2. Disrupt the Enemy's Transportation: When they know that the enemy is going from one place to another or transporting money, they immediately send people to disrupt a certain section of the transportation in order to cut off the enemy's reinforcements and risk starvation, thus losing their combat effectiveness.

3. Restrain the Enemy's Forces: When the enemy is attacking a certain place, they immediately go behind the enemy to attack, or attack from the left and right flanks, causing the enemy to be attacked from both sides.

4. Tire the Enemy: After finding out where the enemy is stationed, they immediately go to attack. When the enemy counterattacks, they immediately retreat and then detour to the other side to attack. Repeating this continuously tires the enemy and makes them unable to figure out where their main force is, wasting a lot of ammunition and strength, and in the end getting nothing.

5. Starve the Enemy: The guerrillas hide all the food in the places they pass through so that the enemy cannot eat it. Moreover, the enemy's own food is often looted by them. Even the cloth wrappings are poisoned, and the enemy is not allowed to drink any water, forcing the enemy to retreat immediately.

The Necessary Conditions for Guerrillas

The life of a guerrilla is very difficult. Although there are no strict conditions, every team member must have the following:

(1) Able to Walk: Walking two or three hundred miles a day is nothing.

(2) Able to Endure Hardship: If there is food today, everyone should eat more. If there is none, it doesn't matter if they don't eat for one or two days.

(3) Familiar with Geography: Every time they arrive in a place, they must have a deep understanding of the paths and dangerous passes of that place.

(4) Gunmanship Must Be Absolutely Accurate: The number of guerrillas is not large, so they cannot carry a large amount of ammunition. They are very careful with bullets and will never fire a shot indiscriminately. Moreover, when shooting, they should focus on shooting the enemy officers, because an army without officers will suffer a considerable loss in strength. Therefore, gunmanship must be absolutely accurate.

(5) Able to Go Deep into the People: Because the guerrillas need to have contact with the people, every team member must have the ability to go deep into the people.

(6) Fight Even Without a Gun: Sometimes when they find the enemy, they must persevere even if they don't have a gun in their hand. On the one hand, they try to seize the enemy's weapons.

Enemy Army Categories

If we want to know which category our enemy—the Japanese army—belongs to, just look at their collar badges. Now I will describe them one by one:

A. Infantry: Red collar badge

B. Artillery: Yellow collar badge

C. Cavalry: Dark blue collar badge

D. Engineers: Purple collar badge

E. Supply troops: White collar badge

If you want to know how many people there are, just look at the flags. One "company" is about the same as two "companies" in our army. One "battalion" is equal to two "battalions." One "regiment" is equal to a "regiment."

Conclusion

In addition to their own conditions, the guerrillas must also hope that the people will help them in an organized way, so that they can achieve the effect of defeating the many with the few, waiting for the enemy to become exhausted, fighting anywhere, and destroying everywhere. Their combat is completely based on an active position and does not have the extravagant hope of occupying land. This kind of tactic is most useful in weak countries that are being invaded, because weak countries are always at risk of being invaded, and they do not have sufficient strength and armaments. Once they are invaded by the great powers and cannot resist, they can only use guerrilla warfare to gradually eliminate the enemy's entire strength, so that it loses its ability and ambition to invade. In addition, we can also adopt the principle of cultivating a huge army in the future, and our people, who are regarded as a heap of loose sand, can easily unite as a result. (End)

### China's Little Heroes

— Liu Yucai

In this war in Shanghai, most of the Chinese people have demonstrated their true and noble value!

The war clouds and turmoil are shaking this big city. The relief of war refugees, the supply of food, and all other wartime problems are enough to keep the Shanghai government authorities busy. At this time, there are many public-spirited people who are doing their best to serve the country and the people with their loyalty and efforts. Such a heroic and righteous spirit! We can hear and see it at any time from the outbreak of the war until now; but there is another large group of young people, their admirable, simple, intelligent, brave and martial spirit! It has been deeply recognized and praised by the general public.

Admirable Heroes

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, more than 1,500 boy scouts have been mobilized immediately to serve their motherland. This large group of boy scouts are the Chinese Boy Scouts who have performed countless valuable duties for their motherland, which has been invaded by the enemy! Most of them are only about sixteen years old. Since the outbreak of the war, they have dedicated all their time and strength to the motherland in distress.

Their work often takes them in and out of terrifying bombed areas. Their figures can be seen at any time in those bombed-out areas. They carry out their tasks with the inherent strong consciousness of young people, in situations where most older people are most cowardly. Whenever a tragic bombing of the masses occurs, these young people are always there. Whether they are dead or dying, as long as they can see them, they are duty-bound to rescue them. From this point of view, we can imagine how brave and strong the passion and patriotic feelings of these young boy scouts are! Here we must also remember that they are all teenagers who have not yet reached adulthood!

Work is Obligatory

Their loyal and patriotic sentiments are so intense and solemn that it seems there can be nothing more than this. One-third of their group is assigned to work in various military hospitals. The working hours every day often exceed 12 hours. The work situation of the brothers who serve in other areas is also equally intense! Because of the needs of the actual situation, they all live at the place where they serve. The funds received by the Boy Scout Headquarters from the superiors are completely used for essential work. The items donated by the people are all used for relief purposes. Even their uniforms are entirely paid for by themselves. They are definitely turning every penny over to the public and do not receive a penny for themselves.

Boy Scouts Help People

Under the anger and hatred of the Chinese people in Shanghai, when they hear the shout of "beat the traitors" in the streets, some people are often implicated wrongly. When boy scouts see suspicious crowds, they can be alert and help innocent people to avoid insult and beating. Some merchants take advantage of the fire to loot, deliberately raising the prices of daily necessities, which in turn will cause the anger of the masses and attack the shops. When boy scouts see this situation, they must investigate the truth of the facts and send them to the competent authorities for handling. Many shop employees are fortunate to avoid being beaten thanks to the mediation of the boy scouts. There are also countless displaced war refugees who receive travel expenses to return to their hometowns, which is also thanks to the help of these boy scouts, because the boy scouts can find ways to transport them to safe places. There are also many refugee families who have been dispersed due to the war, and boy scouts often have the opportunity to meet them and help them reunite. On the other hand, the boy scouts also collect donations from house to house for the items needed at the front line, and also take on other important work back and forth in the fire line.

The First New Martyr

The boy scout brothers are all happy to go to the front line to serve, but their military knowledge and young age are not enough to take on this kind of work. During the January 28 Incident, the Shanghai Boy Scouts did a lot of great work for the army, starting with setting up telephones, managing traffic, repairing telephone lines, and also helping to repair the walls of Suzhou and stacking sandbags for defensive works, and building a 20-kilometer military road from Kunshan to Suzhou. When the army was about to mobilize, the boy scouts were even busier with all the assistance work. For a period of time, they also carried guns and fought alongside the army!

Also in the places where various disasters remain, these little heroes will be sent there to work. When they were rescuing refugees at Yuqiaqing Road and Edward Road and other places, one of their brothers was a victim of the tragedy in front of the Great World. This admirable little Chinese hero, he is China's first new martyr!
