### Japan Plans to Expand Investigation of China's Economic Situation

Establishing a New Agency Within the Embassy, Preparing Various Preparations in Shanghai

[Tokyo] Regarding the issue of Japan controlling its economic activities in China, there have been various rumors recently, such as the establishment of a General Staff Headquarters for Work in China or the creation of an agency in Shanghai that is practically equivalent to an economic embassy. However, the above-mentioned rumors still seem to be far from the actual trend. However, after reviewing the report of Kodama Kenji's inspection in China, Foreign Minister Sato Naotake is said to have felt the need to conduct active and expanded investigations into the actual situation of China's economy and finance, and even the distribution of natural resources. For this reason, it is heard that it has been decided to establish a new agency, the China Economic Investigation Department, within the Shanghai branch of the Japanese Embassy in China, and at the same time strengthen the organizational strength of the existing China Economic Situation Investigation Section within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this way, a driving force can be formed to facilitate economic cooperation between China and Japan. A few days ago, Mr. Masuyasu, secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China, was ordered to start various necessary preparations in Shanghai. The newly appointed Japanese Embassy Counselor Okamoto Kibo, who will be going to China to take office, will be responsible for preparing this agency. In addition, this agency will maintain close ties with agencies such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yokohama Specie Bank, and Mantetsu in Shanghai, and will also be assisted extensively by Commercial Counselor Iwai to form a strong investigative line. Regarding the use of the results of the investigation, the Fifth Section of the Investigation Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under the guidance of the East Asia Bureau, will exercise supreme power. Regarding the prospects for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, although all parties in China hope to resolve political issues as a prerequisite, financial capital and other circles here do not seem to feel discouraged by this, but instead take an optimistic attitude, believing that it is only necessary to follow Japan's past success in economic development in China in the past one or two years without making special efforts on political issues, and greater results can be harvested. This level is extremely important. The establishment of this concept is due to the following factors: ㊀ The decline of the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods movement, ㊁ The increase in the purchasing power of the Chinese government and the people, ㊂ The shortage of surplus capital in Japan, which in fact cannot enable Japan to suddenly export large amounts of capital to China.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Spanish Civil War and the Surveillance Plan

— Fu

The Spanish Civil War, since it began in mid-July of last year, has now lasted nine months. In these nine months of mass slaughter, countless tens of thousands of Spaniards and foreign volunteers have died. The material losses are even greater, numbering in the thousands and millions. According to some experts, the great wounds inflicted by this civil war will prevent Spain from recovering for eighty years. Yet the end of the Spanish Civil War remains very distant. In recent war developments, the government forces have had a considerable advantage. However, to defeat the rebels and establish a central government whose power extends throughout the country will still require a very difficult struggle.

At this time of intractable warfare, various international mediation plans and proposals to shorten the war period have been put forward one after another. Some people (such as a part of the British Conservative government) advocate that the "powerful" government be organized by Spanish moderates. (The so-called moderates initially referred to General Miaja, the commander of the defense of Madrid, but later favored Robles, the leader of the Catholic Action Party, and Madariaga, a famous liberal.) Some people (such as British Conservative MP Churchill, who proposed it in Parliament on the 14th) advocate that the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union find ways to end the Spanish Civil War as soon as possible and restore the constitutional system in three stages within six years. The above two suggestions are still under consideration by some politicians, and the possibility of their realization is extremely small. What has now been realized and is definitely related to the future of the Spanish Civil War is the implementation of the Spanish Sea and Land Surveillance Plan.

The Spanish Sea and Land Surveillance Plan is a part of the work of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Conflict. Originally, since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Britain and France, in order to prevent the war from expanding, proposed the conclusion of a non-intervention agreement to prohibit the import of volunteers and military supplies into Spain. And in order to make this non-intervention method effective, they came up with a plan to monitor the import points of Spain's sea and land. This plan was approved by Germany, Italy, and Portugal after numerous discussions. The International Non-Intervention Committee decided on two points on February 16: (1) The ban on volunteers will take effect at midnight on February 20. (2) The sea and land surveillance plan will be implemented on March 6. However, the surveillance plan was repeatedly postponed due to differences of opinion among the countries, and it was not implemented until midnight on April 19. From then on, the import of volunteers and military supplies into Spain would be greatly hindered.

The implementation of the Spanish Sea and Land Surveillance Plan is, in principle, disadvantageous to the current government. Because the current government is a legitimately produced constitutional government, it has the right to freely purchase military supplies according to law. However, the implementation of the non-intervention method makes the rebel group's belligerent status gain international unanimous recognition. Isn't this an invisible damage to the government forces? However, in terms of the actual situation, if this surveillance plan can be implemented effectively, at least it can prevent the scope of the war from expanding and the war period from being excessively prolonged. Because the current Spanish civil war is actually a small-scale international war. Foreign volunteers have participated in the war on both sides. (Especially on the rebel side, a large number of Italian and German regular troops have participated in the war.) The military supplies of both sides are also imported from foreign countries. If the source of military supplies and volunteers will be cut off after the surveillance plan is implemented, the Spanish civil war can be ended as soon as possible without being excessively expanded.

However, whether the surveillance plan can be effectively implemented and produce practical results is still a big problem. Fascist aggressors never want to see the Franco government fail. If they see that the rebels are at a disadvantage, they may break the agreement and re-implement the intervention policy. At the same time, the surveillance plan itself has very limited effectiveness due to the slowness of the handling procedures. Therefore, the impact of the sea and land surveillance plan on the Spanish Civil War remains to be proven by future facts.

### Spanish Minister Criticizes International Surveillance Plan

Saying it Conflicts with International Law; Government Troops Will Protect Ships

⊙Valencia The Spanish maritime surveillance plan came into effect at midnight yesterday. The Republican Government's Navy and Aviation Minister Prieto recently issued a bulletin stating that the purpose of the maritime surveillance plan decided and implemented by the London Adjustment Committee is to prohibit military supplies from arriving in Spain. In fact, it treats the legal government and the rebel party as the same, which conflicts with international law. Moreover, this method should only apply to countries that have signed the non-intervention agreement. As for ships that still legally fly the flag of the Spanish government, the Spanish government cannot accept them being monitored. We believe that what the signatory countries to the non-intervention agreement are doing now is unfair to the Spanish government. However, we are not indiscriminate between the four countries of the United States, France, Italy, and Germany. The attitudes of the United States and France are upright and beyond reproach. As for Italy and Germany, their warships have been protecting the transport of troops and military supplies to supply the enemies of the Spanish government and have actually participated in the war against us. Under such circumstances, the Spanish government's navy and air force must protect the country's ships and ships that request assistance from the Spanish government. The following methods are hereby promulgated and ordered to be followed by warships and aircraft teams monitoring the coast: all ships of the national government shall be escorted by the navy and air force to prevent them from being intercepted. Foreign ships that request and accept our assistance shall be protected within the territorial waters, especially in the area monitored by Italy and Germany along the Mediterranean coast. We must fulfill the above responsibilities, even at the cost of the greatest sacrifice." (Central News Agency 20th Havas Telegraph)

Many Killed and Wounded

⊙Madrid Madrid has been bombarded by artillery for the eighth day. The rebels fire a cannon every two minutes, targeting the center of the capital, causing many deaths and injuries. (14th National Telegraph)

⊙Madrid The Nationalist army artillery once again shelled the capital city yesterday afternoon. Two houses were hit and caught fire, causing many deaths and injuries. Government army artillery bombed the engineering factories of the Nationalist army on the front line in Toledo Province south of the capital. A portion of the factory buildings caught fire and burned. In addition, government army aircraft bombed the concentration points of the Nationalist army on the front line in Guadalajara Province northeast of the capital and destroyed a large Nationalist army motor transport team near the city of Secunza. At the same time, they also bombed the town of Almatrona and the Quindura airfield south of the city. The gasoline depot attached to the airfield was hit and exploded. Government troops on the front line in Cordoba Province in the south have occupied many important positions in the town of Fuentevivuna. (Central News Agency 20th Havas Telegraph)

### Spanish Rebels Unite Various Parties

A Prelude to Restoration?

⊙Salamanca General Franco, leader of the Nationalist Government, recently issued an order by wireless, stating that (1) the Spanish Fear-the-Gun Association and the Carlist Party should merge into one, renamed "Spanish Traditionalist Phalanx and Youth Labor National Socialist Party," and be led by one leader. Other right-wing parties will be dissolved. (2) The new party should be led personally by the head of state, and a political committee should be established within the party to formulate the party program in conjunction with the Nationalist Government and the National Committee. (3) The party armies of the Phalanx and the Carlists should also be merged and formed into the "National Militia," with the head of state serving as the supreme commander of the National Militia. The original badges used by the party armies of the Phalanx and the Carlists may still be retained. (Central News Agency 20th Havas Telegraph)

⊙Salamanca The commander-in-chief of the Spanish rebels, Franco, merged the Spanish fascist forces today to form the Imperial Party, while dissolving other parties. The temporary leader of the Fascist Party, Hebbira, has been appointed as the permanent leader. This move implies that if the rebellion succeeds, it will implement restoration and eliminate internal divisions. (20th National Telegraph)

### British House of Commons Discusses the Spanish Port Blockade

Opposition Party Questions the Government; Another British Ship Breaks the Blockade

[London] The Spanish Nationalist army's blockade of Basque ports has become the target of criticism in the British House of Commons today. Foreign Secretary Eden, Naval Secretary Hall, and Trade Secretary Runciman have been questioned. The opposition party paid close attention to Runciman's statement that four merchant ships left the port of Bilbao last week. Opposition leader Attlee asked whether the Ministry of Commerce could say that the difficulty of preventing ships from entering does not hinder the departure of ships. Runciman replied that he had answered this question. Liberal Party leader Sinclair stood up and asked a question. At that time, the audience was noisy. The Speaker then spoke and asked the public to maintain order. Naval Secretary Hall stated that reports he had received from the captain of the British cruiser HMS Hotspur and other authorities had confirmed that the Spanish Nationalist army had in fact blockaded the port of Bilbao. The Labor Party believes that Attlee's statement that the Naval Secretary's reply regarding the protection of British ships was not satisfactory, so it was decided to raise the issue of adjournment tomorrow night. It is rare for a motion to adjourn to be made on the day the budget is presented due to other issues. (Central News Agency 19th Reuters Telegraph)

[London] Another British ship has now broken through the Western Nationalist army blockade line off the coast of Biscay. According to information received by the London Independent Labor Party, the British ship Seven Seas Sprays, loaded with grain, sailed from Saint Jean de Luz, passed through the Nationalist army guard line, and arrived safely in Bilbao. The first British ship to break the blockade line was the Thorpe Hall. (Central News Agency 20th Reuters Telegraph)

⊙Bilbao The authorities here received a wireless message today sent by the British ship Barson to the British destroyer HMS Blanche off the coast of Santander, reporting that the ship was prevented by rebel ships from transporting the coal it was carrying to Bilbao, and that another British ship sailing from Gijón was also detained.

### Many Obstacles Still Remain for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality in Egypt

Transitional Period, etc., Are Not Easy to Resolve

⊙Montreux After the Egyptian Extraterritoriality Conference resolved all the non-controversial points, it passed about half of the Egyptian judicial organization plan today. However, there are still obstacles ahead, such as the length of the transitional period before the complete abolition of extraterritoriality, the nature of the mixed court, and the conditions for the court's judges. Matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and the definition of nationality are the most difficult to resolve. Many representatives advocate that Egyptian courts should not hear marriage and divorce lawsuits, even those involving Egyptians. Lawsuits involving Muslims, Christians, and Jews should be heard by their religious authorities. There is also much debate about the issue of nationality. During the discussions, the representatives expressed deep concern that the Egyptian authorities might have feelings of discrimination against foreigners. Therefore, it was decided through consultation that the president and prosecutor of the mixed court should be foreigners. The prosecutor has two assistants, one of whom is Egyptian and is responsible for civil lawsuits, and one of whom is a foreigner and is responsible for criminal lawsuits. It was also decided that Arabic, English, French, and Italian could be the official languages of the mixed court. Tedeschi recently returned to his country to consult with his government and may return here today. He is very stubborn and has insisted on his position every time he attends the meeting. I don’t know if his attitude will be slightly more lenient this time he returns. (Central News Agency 20th Reuters Telegraph)

### Germany Willing to Participate in World Peace Conference

Hitler Tells Lansbury; Roosevelt Most Suitable as Initiator

[Berlin] British Labour MP George Lansbury today met with German leader Hitler. Afterwards, he told people that the purpose of his trip was to seek the German leader's support for a world peace conference. The sole theme of this conference would be how to eliminate the causes of war. French Premier Léon Blum and the Prime Ministers of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway had all discussed this matter with him and were deeply concerned about the arms race. Therefore, they all agreed to convene a peace conference, believing that if someone initiated such a conference, all countries would respond positively. He had presented this situation to the German leader. What he expected from the German leader has now been obtained, namely, Germany's willingness to join such a conference in good faith. As for the issue of Soviet participation, it was not mentioned during the conversation. He had asked U.S. President Roosevelt to convene this conference, and if the United States believed that this move could gain the consent of other major powers, then the U.S. President could often be the initiator. What this conference will deal with is the international management of the arms race, undeveloped lands, raw materials, and markets. This conference should also assist the Spanish people to resolve their own political system without interference from any side. German officials have not yet expressed their opinions on Lansbury's conversation with Hitler. It has not yet been announced here whether the German leader agrees with Lansbury's statement to foreign journalists. It is generally believed that Hitler's response to Lansbury was merely a restatement of his usual position. In other words, if Germany's political freedom is not hindered in the slightest, then Germany is prepared to promote international peace and economic cooperation. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 19th)

[Berlin] German leader Hitler received British Labour leader George Lansbury at noon today, and the conversation lasted two hours. Afterwards, a communiqué was released with the agreement of both parties, stating briefly that if U.S. President Roosevelt or the leader of any major power government could initiate a conference of a universal nature, Germany would be willing to send representatives to attend, seeking understanding with all countries and participating in economic cooperation. According to general observers, Hitler did not state to Lansbury during the conversation that if the Soviet Union were to participate in this conference, Germany would refuse to do so. This point is quite noteworthy. Lansbury also made a statement to the newspapers afterwards, saying that German leader Hitler has a profound understanding of world historical politics, and the impression he received was therefore extremely deep. He also said that he had always advocated direct talks with the leaders of various countries, which was the reason for his visit to German leader Hitler. He had traveled around the world, hoping to find someone who could initiate a large-scale conference. Finally, he said that although the British Labour Party supported his efforts, he was not here representing the Labour Party, but rather as a representative of the British "Society of Friends." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 19th)

[Berlin] British pacifist and leader of the Independent Labour Party, George Lansbury, conducted "peace talks" with German leader Hitler today, and then told reporters that the U.S. President is the most suitable initiator, because the United States is currently in a detached position, and President Roosevelt's economic policies in South America clearly show his concern for international cooperation. He very much hopes that the U.S. President can initiate an international conference, but fears that he does not intend to do so. Lansbury continued, saying that although he had not met with Stalin, he could guarantee that the Soviet Union would cooperate. (National Telegram, 19th)

### United States Extremely Interested After Hitler's Statement

Britain and France Believe the Situation is Improving; Soviet Russia Still Skeptical of Germany

[London] The diplomatic and economic circles here are carefully studying the German leader Hitler's proposal to participate in an international conference, believing that the second step of action must depend on U.S. President Roosevelt. The press believes that Roosevelt will not respond to Hitler until Ambassador Davies' investigation in Europe is completed and he believes that the international conference has a chance of success. (National Telegram, 20th)

[Washington] The United States is extremely interested in the news that Germany is willing to participate in the world conference. However, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have previously expressed their reluctance to initiate a world economic conference. It is generally believed that Léon Blum is the most suitable person to initiate such a conference. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull refused to criticize the conversation between German leader Hitler and British Labour figure George Lansbury in Berlin, saying only that any declaration, whether private or official, that expresses its willingness to promote economic recovery is welcome. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 19th)

[Washington] Congressman Dies is expected to introduce a bill in the House of Representatives this week, requesting President Roosevelt to convene an international monetary conference to determine fixed exchange rates for various currencies, redistribute the red gold concentrated in the United States, promote the restoration of the gold standard, and prevent gold from flowing into the United States, causing a serious crisis. (National Telegram, 20th)

[Washington] Senator Lewis declared in the Senate today that the State Department had instructed him to pay attention to resolving the trend of war debts. He had previously proposed that those who owed the United States war debts should not enter into trade agreements with the United States. The State Department's request to postpone this case proves that there is progress in the war debt resolution. (National Telegram, 19th)

[Moscow] The Soviet Russian authorities stated today that if various countries are sincerely willing to convene a conference, the Soviet Union is also willing to participate. However, there are doubts as to whether the German leader Hitler's proposal is reliable. (National Telegram, 20th)

[Rome] The news of Germany's willingness to participate in the world conference has created a good impression in Rome, but any international conference that can satisfy Italy must obviously have no relationship with the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)

[Paris] The spokesperson responsible today made some criticisms regarding Germany's attitude yesterday. The tone can be described as excellent. It is generally believed that this kind of good atmosphere before the conference is sufficient to benefit the situation. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)

[London] Financial experts here recently declared that unless the currencies of the major countries are stabilized, the issue of reducing tariffs cannot be negotiated beneficially. Moreover, the issue of stabilizing currencies is more complicated by the domestic situations of the countries concerned than by international negotiations. Even after the international economic conference is convened, it cannot be discussed. At this moment, the countries with balanced budgets and stable internal conditions are few. In addition, the United Kingdom and the United States have not yet reached a compromise on the value of the pound, so the move to stabilize currencies is still distant and difficult to achieve. Financial figures also said that the future government of the United Kingdom probably does not advocate convening an international economic conference immediately. There are two reasons for this: one is that the United Kingdom has not forgotten the failure of the first economic conference in 1933 due to inadequate preparation beforehand, and the other is that the United Kingdom is currently working hard to complete its rearmament plan and has no time to attend to other matters. In short, financial figures believe that after Hitler's last declaration, the countries may conduct a long period of diplomatic negotiations in preparation for holding an international conference, so that it can be convened smoothly when the time is right. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 19th)

[London] People here generally commented that the communiqué issued by German leader Hitler is a new factor that can be optimistic in the international situation, and is the same as Prime Minister Blum's investigative work, French Foreign Minister Delbos' speech yesterday, and the new trend of American policy. Therefore, an international economic conference can be easily convened, thereby preventing the arms race and promoting the United Kingdom to reduce its current import tax rates. However, whether this conference can be convened depends largely on the attitude of the United Kingdom. The British Cabinet should clearly state its position. Generally, the opposition Labour Party, Liberal Party, and free trade faction in the United Kingdom will strongly urge the government to make full use of the possibilities contained in the Hitler declaration. According to people in Congress, the British decision will depend on Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and not on Prime Minister Baldwin. Baldwin will resign after the coronation of the King, and Chamberlain will succeed him as Prime Minister. But Chamberlain is extremely opposed to the proposal to convene an international economic conference, meaning that tariff reduction issues cannot be seriously discussed unless the exchange market is stabilized. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 19th)

[London] Yesterday, the German leader Hitler's reply to British Labour MP George Lansbury's remarks received very widespread praise. The News Chronicle pointed out that this was Germany's first direct contribution to a willingness to participate in a world conference after withdrawing from the League of Nations, but people generally want to wait for further clarification on this matter. According to British critics, the German leader's proposal seems to be limited to economic discussions. Germany has always thought that economic isolation is not impossible, but the German public opinion in the past few months has clearly no longer held this view. The Daily Telegraph reported that President Roosevelt may not respond until it is certain that all parties have a solid basis for a compromise. If such a basis really exists, then Lansbury can be said to have really achieved something. The Daily Mail called the German leader's remarks extremely important and a new step forward in international easing. However, the Morning Post raised questions, believing that Lansbury is not qualified to speak for others except himself. Why does the German leader want to get Lansbury's cooperation is very questionable. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)

[Paris] Regarding the communiqué issued after the German leader Hitler met with British Labour figure George Lansbury yesterday, the newspapers here have recently commented on it. The right-wing "L'Écho de Paris" said, "The British House of Commons is about to hold an important debate on the country's rearmament issue. Is Hitler's declaration timed to alienate the British people? At this time, the United Kingdom and France agree that economic issues should be related to political issues. Germany's alienation strategy will only show its futility." The right-wing "Le Jour" stated, "Hitler's communiqué specifically mentioned President Roosevelt's name, which is surprising, because alienating the three major democracies of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States is the best strategy. We believe that if Hitler's proposal is submitted to the United Kingdom and France through normal diplomatic channels, it will naturally have greater value." The moderate "Le Petit Parisien" stated, "There seems to be a tendency in Berlin to cooperate with the major democracies economically or politically. If this evolution is sincere, we must not disappoint it, but all kinds of doubts are difficult to eliminate completely at present." The radical socialist party's newspaper "L'Œuvre" stated, "People in Berlin do not believe that German leader Hitler really intends to change his course, abandon his policy of economic self-sufficiency, and cooperate sincerely with the United Kingdom and France in politics and economics, unless the United States is willing to lend money to Germany, and other countries give colonies to Germany, without proposing political conditions for exchange, then we will talk about it."

### Hopes for Breaking the Stalemate Between Japan and Russia

Russian Ambassador Visits Japanese Foreign Minister for the Second Time; Acknowledges That Understanding is Not Very Difficult

[Tokyo] Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, after returning to his post last week, visited Foreign Minister Sato Naotake for the second time at 4:30 pm today, and talked for an hour and a half. The content of the conversation was kept strictly confidential. However, the Japanese semi-official side suddenly expressed hope for breaking the stalemate between Japan and the Soviet Union as a result of today's meeting between the Soviet Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister. According to their statement, Japanese-Soviet understanding is not extremely difficult to achieve to a considerable extent. It is heard that Yurenev and Sato have scheduled another one or two meetings within this month. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)

### US-Philippines Conference

Establishment of Subcommittees; Study of Philippine Independence Issues

[Washington] The joint conference of Filipino and American experts, studying the issue of advancing Philippine independence, held its first meeting at 10:45 am this morning. All American and Filipino members, except for Philippine Assembly leader Roxas who is still in Manila, attended. First, Philippine President Quezon and Undersecretary of State Sayre gave informal speeches, followed by the organization of small committees, divided into political, military, agricultural, and commercial groups. The meeting was adjourned at 12:30 pm. After the meeting, Sayre told the Associated Press that the expert committee may need to go to Manila to conduct a public review. As for the committee's power, although it is only limited to recommendations, it will be widely cited in the future and will be able to influence the opinions of Congress. The subcommittees will continue to meet and can submit reports early at any time. The report of the entire committee will be submitted to the Philippine Affairs Committee composed of government departments, and after being approved by President Roosevelt, it will be submitted to Congress. Although the committee's work does not aim to amend the Philippine Independence Act, its recommendations may affect that act. The subcommittees are all composed of American and Filipino members, but both sides are determined to control and discuss the relationship between the two countries, and there is no compromise. The date of the next joint meeting has not yet been determined. It is learned that the reports of the Tariff Commission and the Philippine government are likely to be used as a basis for discussion and can often save a lot of work. However, Sayre expects that it will not be completed until after the autumn. Today's meeting was not open to the public. Although President Quezon was very satisfied, he did not agree to make any statement. (National Telegram, 19th)

### Japanese Three-Minister Conference Reviews International Relations

Focusing on the China Issue; Opinions Are in Complete Agreement

[Tokyo] The Japanese Three-Minister Conference, which has been suspended for a long time, was resumed today. Foreign Minister Sato Naotake invited Army Minister Sugiyama Gen and Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa to the Foreign Minister's official residence at 9:50 am this morning to exchange views, focusing on diplomacy towards China and the Soviet Union. The core of the discussion on diplomacy towards China is whether Japan will make every effort to expand its economy towards China in the future, or follow China's wishes and negotiate on a part of the political issues. Sato has apparently decided to submit the conclusions of today's meeting to the Cabinet meeting on the 21st to seek the consent of the cabinet ministers, so its significance is very important. According to reports, today's meeting discussed for an hour and a half and was the first Three-Minister Conference since Sato took office as Foreign Minister. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)

[Tokyo] At 10:00 am this morning, Foreign Minister Sato, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai gathered at the Foreign Minister's official residence to hold a Three-Minister Conference, focusing on the China issue, and exchanged views on international relations with the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

### Japanese Government Establishes Planning Agency

Privy Council Expresses Opposition; Believes It Is Superfluous

[Tokyo] The government has decided to establish a new Planning Agency to integrate national policies, but the Privy Council has expressed opposition. According to the Privy Council, the Planning Agency was planned and established by a part of the reformist forces during the Hirota Cabinet. If there is a political bigwig with considerable knowledge and means at its center, there is no problem. Otherwise, only with a state minister兼任 job, it will never be able to be a powerful institution for deliberating on important national policies. In addition to the cabinet, setting up an institution for deliberating on national policies is like building a house on top of a house, which is not only meaningless but also may hinder the smooth progress of national affairs. However, because the government regards the Planning Agency issue as an important national policy, the Privy Council cannot express its opposition head-on, and intends to conduct a serious review when the case is transferred to the Privy Council.

### Purpose of Japan's Cash Shipment to the United States

Statement by the Ministry of Finance Authorities

[Tokyo] In order to replenish overseas funds, the Ministry of Finance plans to ship approximately 50 million yen to the United States for the second time. The first shipment, scheduled to be loaded with 16 million yen on the Kansai Maru on the 21st, will depart from Kobe for the United States on the same day. The remainder will continue to be shipped separately by convenient vessels. Regarding this matter, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement in the form of an authority as follows: "Under the current currency system of our country, it is necessary to maintain a considerable amount of cash to maintain it, needless to say, and to strengthen national defense and implement other policies, thereby expanding productivity. In this kind of prospect for our country, in order to procure the necessary materials, it is inevitable to ship out a certain amount of cash to replenish overseas funds, which should be an appropriate policy at this time. However, the internal and external impact of cash transportation must be carefully prepared. In particular, the fundamentals of international loans must be adjusted to avoid the occurrence of such situations that endanger the foundation of our country's currency system. The government hopes to get the assistance of the people in order to fully and properly handle this matter." (Domei News Agency dispatch, 30th)

### General Election Situation in Japan

Number of Candidates Roughly Determined; 54 Fewer Than Before

[Tokyo] The registration of candidates for the general election ended on the 19th, and more than a dozen people also resigned. Although the legal date for registering candidates is the 23rd, there seems to be no major change after the 19th, so the state on the 19th can be considered the final situation. At present, the number of candidates from various parties has reached 824, which is 54 fewer than the number at the same time during the previous general election. This is one of the peculiarities of this general election, because all parties were unprepared to deal with the general election due to the government's sudden dissolution of the parliament. Also, because the political situation is particularly unstable, many people doubt that there will be a second dissolution. The general public's attitude towards the general election is negative. One more thing that is noteworthy is that the number of incumbent deputies among the candidates in this general election is more than in the previous general election, but the number of newcomers is 60 fewer than last time.

The number of candidates from each party is: Minseito 267, Seiyukai 268, Showakai 35, Shakai Taishuto 65, Kokumin Domei 20, Toho Kai 19, Rikken Kyoseikai 16, Seiji Kakushinkai 7, Nippon Musanto 4, Kokoku Nomin Domei 2, Kodo Kai 2, Kokoku Jichi Kai 2, Aikoku Musanto 1, Zaikyo Gunjin Doshikai 1, Dai Nippon Seinen To 1, Kakushin Domei 1, Kokumin Kyokai 1, Kinro Nippon To 1, Shiga Kinro Minshu Domei 1, Tottori Musan Kokutai Hyogikai 1, Kyoto Minseikai 1, neutral 108, totaling 824.

### International Labour Office Publishes Annual Report

Pessimistic About the International Situation

[Geneva] The International Labour Office's annual report, published here, is very pessimistic about the international situation. Although commercial conditions have improved, it is doubtful whether they can continue to be maintained. It is said that stability and balance have not been achieved. It is also doubtful that reducing tariffs and abolishing quotas are methods of increasing international trade, because this method is the most gentle first step, and its significance and importance have been overestimated. The report continued to discuss the arms issue, stating briefly that in times of emergency, arms plans are the same as other public works and can allow commerce to survive the recession. However, if there are signs of progress in private industry, public works should be stopped. The arms race in Europe and Asia indicates a general sense of unease, which is sufficient to hinder the development of commerce. Germany's four-year plan was also discussed in detail. Regarding the issue of raw material allocation, the report believes that the free exchange of international goods and capital helps the appropriate allocation of raw materials, and that efforts to manufacture raw material substitutes are beneficial and harmless. (National Sealand Telegram, 20th)

[Geneva] The Director-General of the International Labour Office recently published the 1937 report, which is scheduled to be submitted for review at the International Labour Conference in June. The report stated that the plan to hold a labor conference for Asian countries proposed by the previous International Labour Conference was very beneficial. "It is hoped that the Governing Body of the International Labour Office will submit a satisfactory and concrete plan for this conference. In short, although the International Labour Office is feeling financially exhausted, it has done its utmost to make some efforts and has extended the scope of its work beyond Europe."

### British Ship Drug Case Conviction in New York Court

[New York] On March 6 of this year, a large quantity of opium, worth US$250,000, was found on the British cargo ship "Qin Pengke". The principal offender, Bo Nangqi, has been sentenced to ten years in prison. Several Chinese, all crew members of the ship, were among the accomplices and were also sentenced separately. One of them, named A Nan, said that if he was deported back to his country, he would be executed, so he requested a longer sentence. The judge then ordered imprisonment for three years and six months, by which time no one would remember the incident when he returned to his country. (19th, National Dispatch)

[Paris] The Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper's plane "Kamikaze" arrived at Le Bourget Airport outside the city this morning from Berlin. Many French and Japanese people were there to welcome it. The two aviators, Kawa and Tsukakoshi, were invited to lunch by the Minister of Aviation, Gute, at noon. The French aviator Yabi is scheduled to host a banquet in the evening.

### The Arrest of Dong Fangcheng, a Suspected Traitor in Zhengzhou

Dong Was a Puppet of a Certain Country, Gaining Millions in Profit; After Being Arrested, He Was Sent to the Bian Sui Headquarters for Investigation

Zhengzhou Correspondence: Dong Fangcheng, the manager of the Zhengzhou Dazhong Packaging Factory, was arrested on suspicion of being a traitor and is currently being investigated by the Yu-Wan Sui Headquarters. Dong's associates, Zhang and others, are trying to help Dong and are asking people to intercede in an attempt to escape the law. However, the facts are all there, and it is feared that it will be difficult to cover up Dong's crimes. The following is a record of the investigation by relevant parties into Dong's relationship with a certain country.

In the early years of the Republic of China, people from a certain country, seeing that Zhengzhou was located in the Central Plains with access to all directions and was extremely important, wanted to set up a store in Zhengzhou to cover up their work. They immediately entrusted Dong to purchase a piece of land on the west side of the north end of Fushou Street in his name. The people of that country had to use Dong as a puppet because they were limited by international law. At that time, Dong was just a foreman of a plasterer, and for his own benefit, he was willing to be used by others. After the land was purchased, Dong contracted to build the buildings (i.e., the houses in the area of the current Dazhong Packaging Factory), making a huge profit. People from that country then set up a foreign firm on Fushou Street. From then on, Dong and the people from that country became increasingly close, and Dong became a millionaire. When the "September 18th" Incident occurred, the people from that country left Zhengzhou one after another. The Zhengzhou National Salvation Association then sealed up the foreign firm. Later, after Dong worked hard and produced evidence, the foreign firm's houses were spared from confiscation and were allowed to be unsealed and changed into the Dazhong Packaging Factory. However, because of dissatisfaction with him from all sides, Dong did not dare to openly associate with the people from that country again, so he entrusted his housekeeper, Luo, to take his place. As time went on, things got worse and worse. After the loss of the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, Chahar North, and Eastern Hebei were also seized. The organization of that country in Zhengzhou then resumed its activities in the midst of this invasion. A large number of people from that country came to Zhengzhou from Hankou (it is said that Dong once took a Eurasia plane to Hankou to welcome them) and worked in Dong's wife, Gao's, house at No. 132 Fushou Street for several months before moving out. On the morning of the 14th of last month, the侦控队 of the Henan District Security Command arrested Zhan Zhuotang, a traitor who attempted to steal maps in Zhengzhou, and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the First District Commissioner's Office for interrogation. At that time, Zhan confessed the process of contacting a certain spy agency and said that the spy agency had instructed him to contact them at Zhang Gouzi's house on Fushou Street at 8:00 p.m. that day. The Commissioner's Office also found a note in Zhan's diary book written by a certain spy agency to Zhan indicating the contact location as "Zhang Gouzi's house at No. 134 Dong Residence, Fushou Street". After a thorough investigation by the Commissioner's Office, on the 15th, it notified the Zhengzhou Garrison Headquarters to propose an interrogation. The Garrison Department immediately brought Zhan to the department for interrogation. In addition to searching Baochangli Inn for the maps that Zhan had brought, they also searched No. 134 Fushou Street. Unexpectedly, although the number was Dong's house, Dong and his family did not live there. Instead, Yang Yishan opened the Guangren Hospital there. Yang had fled, having somehow found out about the search. The Garrison Department personnel then went to the neighbors to check and found that the house number at No. 132 was registered to Dong Fangcheng, 58 years old, from Hubei Province (the house number was issued last year), with detailed information about his family and servants. They went inside to check and found that Dong's wife lived at the house, and the family of Zhang Gouzi and the daughter of Prince Hao, the manager of the Fuyuan Store, also lived there. However, no evidence of treason was found in the written materials. They then went to Dong and his concubine's residence in Guochengli to search and found 14 jars of opium paste, weighing about 90 catties, and three large packages of opium, and seven opium pipes. Dong was then taken to the department. According to Dong, he had not been in contact with Gao at No. 132 Fushou Street for several years and knew nothing about her actions. He did not know Zhang Gouzi at all. As for the large amount of opium paste he possessed, he admitted that he had violated the law because he did not understand the anti-smoking regulations. However, Dong was a millionaire with great influence. After this incident, his associates all came out to help him. After interrogation by the Garrison Department, he was temporarily released on bail. Unexpectedly, Dong and his associates requested the Yu-Wan Sui Headquarters to exempt him from being interrogated in Zhengzhou. Liu Zhi, the director of the Sui Headquarters, approved the request and sent a military judge from the Sui Headquarters to Zhengzhou to investigate. As a result, Dong was sent to Bian for interrogation. It is said that the Sui Headquarters is currently studying the following points: ㊀ The "four" in the note found in Zhan Zhuotang's diary, "No. 134 Fushou Street", is different in ink color from the other characters and seems to have been changed from the character "two". Who changed this character? ㊁ Zhang Gouzi has been following Dong Fangcheng as a servant for more than ten years and is now working in an organization organized by a certain foreigner. Why does Dong Fangcheng deny knowing Zhang? ㊂ If No. 132 Fushou Street is not Dong Fangcheng's residence, why is the house number registered to Dong Fangcheng? ㊃ In addition to commercial relations, what other political relations does Dong Fangcheng have with a certain country? The above points are being studied. It is also heard that the Military Commission has plans to interrogate Dong. Dong's associates, Zhang and others, are currently traveling back and forth between Zheng and Bian, working hard to help him. However, the facts are all there, and it is feared that they will not be able to buy his crime of endangering the country. As for those who advocated protecting Dong before, they have been silent since Dong was sent to Bian. (17th)

### Overview of the Work of the Beijing Municipal Government in the Past Two Years (Continued)

And the Future Policy Directions - Mayor Ma's Report

㊄ Expanding the drug rehabilitation hospital: The city's drug rehabilitation hospital originally had 100 beds. In the 25th year, in addition to expanding the Chuanban Lane drug rehabilitation hospital to 800 beds, a branch was opened on Chaosu Street, which could accommodate 200 people. ㊅ Testing work: In the summer of the 25th year, a building was constructed for application. The internal equipment was also specially expanded. The chemical part covers various analyses and physical tests. The inspection of other drugs and food products has also increased annually. The bacteriological part includes various serum, biological, and bacterial tests. More than 6,000 items are tested each month, and more than 600 chemical analyses are performed. "(C) Health care work: ㊀ Promoting midwifery work: To reduce the mortality rate, we should ㊂ promote new-style midwifery. The number of births delivered each month has reached more than 400, accounting for an estimated 25% of the total births in the city. ㊁ Expanding school health: The city's school health program has a Health Education Committee responsible for handling it. It started with 15 schools and then expanded to a total of 136 schools in the city, involving more than 40,000 people. In the 25th year, short-term schools were added, so the scope of school health reached 181 schools, with the number of students increasing to more than 60,000. With the division of provinces and cities, 25 schools in the new urban area were implemented, with about 3,500 students. A study class on school health for private school teachers was also held. ㊂ Establishing a social health service department: Since the pilot operation, it has seen some results. In the 15th year, the service work was specially expanded. ㊃ Conducting factory health: Factory health is still in its infancy in the capital. In June of the 14th year, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and the Central Factory Inspection Office jointly convened legal factories in the city to establish the Nanjing Municipal Factory Health Implementation Guidance Committee. The factories that have implemented it include 18 companies in the printing, brick and tile, and flour industries.

Regarding the Municipal Railway:

In order to ensure the safety of vehicles and pedestrians, a traffic safety propaganda week was held, new barriers and traffic lights were added to the newly built roads, guard posts and sheds were added along the roads, the houses and vehicles at each station were renovated, and electric lights were installed in passenger cars and locomotives. Eight or nine thousand sleepers were replaced successively, and the roadbeds of Central Road and the Ten Temple Intersection of the Executive Yuan were raised to balance with the roads. In order to develop the city's transportation and facilitate joint transportation with the Jiangnan Nanjing-Shanghai West Road, the cloth railway was extended to outside Yuhua Gate to connect with the Jiangnan Railway. It is now officially open to traffic and is implementing joint transportation with the Jiangnan fiber road. At the same time, preparations are being made for joint transportation with the Beijing-Shanghai Road. The total operating income for the 24th year was 69,064.07 yuan, and the expenditure was 69,761.11 yuan. In the 25th year, the income was 100,922.20 yuan, and the expenditure was 97,027.23 yuan, which is a great improvement compared to the previous years when large subsidies were needed.

Regarding the Slaughterhouse:

(A) Preparing to build a new site: The original slaughterhouse was not enough to meet the demand. In June of the 24th year, more than 70 mu of private land in Dashichating East Street outside Shuixi Gate was surveyed and designated as the site for a new-style slaughterhouse. It has been submitted for approval and announced for requisition. The requisition procedures are currently being processed. (B) Expanding the inspection of meat products in rural areas: Previously, the scope of meat product inspection was limited to the urban area. In March of the 25th year, it was extended to rural areas. Xinxingzhen, Sanmeihe, Maqun, Xianhezhen, Cangbomen and other places were added in December of the same year to inspect the entire Yanziji area.

Regarding Parks:

(A) Xuanwu Park: Rebuilding greenhouses, rebuilding the entrance building and workers' dormitory, installing water pumps, repairing the asphalt road around the lake, building Cui Zhou rattan racks and planting flowers and trees. (B) First Park: Repairing the fountain, building flower rooms and wisteria racks. (C) Beian Dipu: Ditching for drainage, cultivating soil and building ridges, and adding workers' dormitories. (D) Regarding the appearance of the city: Increasing the planting of street trees, totaling 4,717 trees, decorating recreation roads, planting 68,200 holly trees, and creating scenic forests in Yuhuatai, Qingliangshan, Yanxiang Temple, and Siwang Mountain, planting 435,700 trees.

Regarding Tap Water:

(A) Business: Urging various public places and food stores in the city to install tap water within a time limit, formulating measures for installing tap water in installments, expanding 9 mm and 13 mm water meters, still waiting for households to reduce the minimum water meter reading, distributing free water coupons for the poor in the summer, and reducing the retail price of tap water in the summer. According to the tap water business, before April of the 24th year, there were only more than 1,600 users, with a monthly water bill revenue of more than 31,000 yuan. As of the most recent date, the number of users has increased to more than 4,200, and the monthly water bill revenue has increased to more than 63,000 yuan. (B) Engineering: Adding sand filtration ponds, sedimentation ponds, clean water storage ponds, flushing water towers, etc. The city's tap water trunk lines, from April of the 24th year to the most recent date, have completed 28 locations including Shanghai Road, with a total length of 44,769 meters, building a Beijing-Qilin Road booster station, modifying the total outlet pipe of the clean water engine room, completing the ring system, burying the second main pipe from the water plant into the city, expanding the city's fire hydrants to a total of 621, using automatic gas injection machines and dynamic gas injection machines, and at the same time adding bacteriological testing equipment to improve water quality and adding a repair machine factory to meet needs, and establishing a water plant employee school.

Future Policy Directions:

The above is an overview of the government's work in the past two years. As for the future policy directions, it is planned to complete several major trunk roads such as Jiankang, Jianye, Baixia, Zhongzheng, Daguang, and Beiping before the Double Tenth Festival this year. At the same time, the key projects of the sewer system, the water interception pipe along the Qinhuai River from the Shiguandu to Zhuqiao, will be put out to tender and start burying within the month. The central pumping station is also planned to start construction before the fall of this year. Expansion projects for tap water, such as the construction of rapid filtration ponds and the addition of storage ponds, have all started construction and are expected to be completed by August of this year. It is also planned to realize trolleybuses within the year to facilitate transportation, build a new slaughterhouse, promote the hygiene of meat, and organize the Xiaguan Wharf to facilitate transportation. A large-scale nursery will be built, incorporating the original Qingying Institute of the Relief Institute, and expanded to accommodate more people. Guangdong businessman Lin Bingyan has now raised 150,000 yuan in donations. As soon as the funds are remitted, construction can begin soon. In the future, it will be able to accommodate about 1,000 babies. The Municipal Bank plans to build a new building to develop its business. The Municipal Hospital will continue to expand to meet the needs and plans to build a people's hospital in Xiaguan to benefit the poor and sick. In terms of land administration, it is planned to complete the land survey and registration in rural areas in the shortest possible time. In terms of finance, under the current situation, there is no source of revenue to be opened, so we can only cut expenses to seek negative relief. Although the newly established land value tax can slightly compensate, since the start of collection, resistance has arisen and progress has not been very smooth. This is indeed an inevitable phenomenon at the beginning of a new tax, but it is undeniable that the people of this city cannot understand the difficulty of the government's work and appreciate the government's financial exhaustion. Therefore, I hope that the people of this city can prioritize the public cause over personal interests, and rise up to cooperate with the government to jointly seek the development of Nanjing's municipal administration. We feel that among the criticisms the citizens have made in the past two years, there are indeed those who speak for the public interest, but those who are purely for personal gain or have other reasons should reflect on themselves, strictly abide by discipline, be clean and self-loving, and not give people an excuse to double their efforts to serve all citizens. We especially hope that you can abide by the law, be of one heart from top to bottom, without division, and establish common trust. The so-called ruler treats his ministers like hands and feet, and ministers serve their ruler like their heart. If they agree, they stay; if they disagree, they leave, without losing the open and upright attitude of a great man. If one cannot keep oneself clean and good, and cannot abide by the law in public, it is called being disloyal to those who plan for others and untrustworthy to those who associate with friends. Such people should not be allowed to exist in public institutions. We should unite and correct them to avoid being implicated. In short, we only need to ask ourselves our conscience, regardless of the temporary praise or criticism from the outside world, and firmly commit to abiding by the law and marching forward. Therefore, today, in reporting the overview of the work in the past two years, I hope that all comrades can uphold the leader's usual instructions on how to be a human being and the Prime Minister's legacy of teaching us to serve the people loyally. Nanjing is the most important area, and I hope that everyone will strictly abide by discipline and work hard from today onwards to achieve greater success and set an example for the whole country."

### Songjiang

Stone Workers Destroy Police Station

Two stone workers in Tianma Mountain, under the county's jurisdiction, had a quarrel at a tea house on the 19th over the settlement of wages. The police officer on duty at the police station took them to the station for questioning. Unexpectedly, as soon as the two workers entered the police station, more than a hundred workers arrived in large numbers and surrounded the police station, then broke in and destroyed everything. Three villagers, including Shen Bolan, were also injured. Liu Shizhang, the patrol officer of the station, urgently telegraphed the county bureau for instructions. According to the telegram, the county bureau immediately sent Inspector Yang and Patrol Officer Yu of the water patrol team, leading armed police officers, to the countryside by boat to investigate. After an investigation, the two foremen, Liu and others, were taken to Song for interrogation. On the way, they were hijacked by more than a dozen workers in a boat. In order to avoid escalating the situation, Yang and others did not pursue them and returned to the bureau to report for approval.

### Suzhou

Suzhou Pawn Industry Members' General Meeting

The Jiangsu Provincial Pawn Industry Association Federation held a general meeting of members yesterday (20th) at 10:00 a.m. in the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce in Xibaihua Lane, Suzhou. 134 member representatives from 21 counties attended, and 47 industry representatives from 22 counties attended as observers, totaling 181 people. Representatives from the Provincial Party Department, Sun Danchen (represented by Wang Kwan), and the Provincial Department of Construction, Yan Shounan, attended to provide guidance. Chen Qinshi and Xie Huchen, representatives from the Zhejiang Pawn Industry, and Song Moqing, representatives from Nanjing City, and Wu Qiutao Chuan Zuoheng, representatives from Shanghai City, attended as observers. The meeting started on time. First, Chairman Pan Jingsi reported, and then the agenda was discussed. (A) The Wuxi Pawn Industry Association proposed that rural sub-pawnshops have been established everywhere in Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other counties, which is detrimental to the currency industry. It should be requested to find a way to ban them to eliminate the harm to the people. (B) The Jingjiang Yujing Public Pawnshop proposed that the sub-pawnshop and the main pawnshop are only a short distance apart, but the sub-pawnshop was established first. Can it be cancelled? (C) The Jingjiang Yujing Public Pawnshop proposed that the sub-pawnshop, which is only a short distance from the sub-pawnshop, has actually changed into a disguised pawn industry due to business relations. Should it be strictly banned in accordance with the regulations? (D) The Jiangyin Houcheng Decheng Pawnshop and others proposed that the sub-pawnshops in the county often violate the regulations and privately set up inter-county guarantees, and exploit high interest rates. Please find a way to ban them. (E) The Changshu Pawn Industry Association proposed that private sub-pawnshops in the county do not comply with the specified distance. Please report to the province to lead the county to ban them. After the chairman read each of the above five proposals, representatives from various counties expressed their opinions one after another. The discussion lasted for a long time. Most of them believed that sub-pawnshops without registration certificates should be banned, and those that are less than six kilometers away and without pawn guarantees should be immediately recommended to the government to investigate clearly and immediately stop their opening. Finally, the opinions of the representatives of the counties were summarized, and it was resolved that: ㊀ If it is found that the sub-pawnshop violates laws and regulations and its organization is unsound, causing harm to the local area, the provincial department should be requested to order the local authorities to ban it uniformly. ㊁ The above five cases will be submitted to the Executive Committee to separately request the provincial department to strictly implement the ban according to the circumstances. (F) The Changshu Pawn Industry Association proposed that the establishment of a farmer loan office by the China Farmers Bank in Changshu conflicts with the pawn business. Please discuss the relief case. (G) The Taicang Pawn Industry Association proposed that the Farmers Bank's warehouse accepts gold jewelry and native cloth for mortgage, which affects the pawn industry. Please find a way to stop the two cases from being discussed together, and Xie Huchen, the representative of Zhejiang, reported that there are also similar situations in Zhejiang. It was decided that the association should request the Department of Construction to find a way to provide relief, and jointly plan with the Zhejiang Provincial Industry Association. By this time, it was already past 12 o'clock. Since there were no other temporary motions, the meeting was adjourned.

### Taicang

The Robbery Case in Zhitang Town

Since the opening of the Xi-Hu Highway in Zhitang Town, which belongs to Taicang County, transportation has been convenient, but thefts have occurred from time to time. On the morning of the 13th of this month, more than 20 bandits, each with weapons, first cut off the electric lights and telephone lines and rushed into the four towns, looting the Ling family, who were in the needle and science business. They first entered the rooms of the Xiong and Xie families to rob. At that time, Ling's mother was still asleep and was awakened by the servant. Suspecting that it was a fire, she immediately organized her belongings, causing all the items in Ling's mother's hands to be taken away. She was also tied with a rope and forced to tell where the silver was hidden so that they could search. At that time, Xiong's wife escaped out of the door and twisted with the guard bandit. The bandit immediately opened fire to show his power. While the bandits upstairs were torturing Ling's mother, they suddenly heard gunfire, mistakenly thought they had been discovered, and immediately fled. Afterwards, each household checked their belongings and found that the losses were quite large. They immediately reported to the Shuangfeng Police Station. At 2:00 p.m., the police were dispatched to the scene of the incident to investigate. After the incident, it was heard that each Baojia town in the town had submitted a report to the county government, setting a time limit for solving the case to warn the bandits.

### Kunshan

Section Chief Personally Solves Smoking Case

The newly appointed County Chief Wen Chongxin has always advocated the thorough elimination of smoking and gambling. Since taking office, within a dozen days, he has cracked six or seven cases of smoking and gambling. At about 9:00 p.m. on the 18th, the fourth section chief, Wei 𢇣yan, personally led three section members to search Ding Baojun's house at No. 12 South Street. More than a dozen packages of opium bubbles and smoking paraphernalia were found, indicating that he was selling opium privately. The witnesses were brought to the county for interrogation.

### Jiashan

Cargo Ship Robbed Midway

Dian Lake in the north of the county has a vast water surface and has always been a place where bandits haunt. The other day, Lu Laoda, a Taizhou native, was supporting a coal-carrying boat when he encountered a bandit boat in Dian Lake. He was ordered to stop sailing and a swarm of people boarded the boat, searching and looting all the clothes and belongings. Lu Laoda escaped with his life in a state of embarrassment.

### Municipal Museum to Hold Hainan Island Li-Miao Folk Objects Exhibition

Six Days Starting Today

Since its opening, the Shanghai Municipal Museum has held two special exhibitions, collecting rare and precious items for the systematic study of citizens, which has aroused the interest of viewers. The museum, recognizing the growing calls for the development of Hainan Island (i.e., Qiongya Island) and the attention of Shanghai residents, has specially requested Professor Stubel of Tongji University and Mr. Liu Xian of the Science Society of China to collect various items on the island to accurately understand the customs and conditions of Hainan Island. These items will be displayed in a special room. Starting today, the Hainan Island Li-Miao Folk Objects Exhibition will be held for six days. Yesterday, the museum director, Hu Zhaochun, held a tea party to entertain the exhibitors and the press. Mr. Stubel and Mr. Liu had visited the island several times to investigate the actual situation of the local ethnic groups and searched for items, which were made into various models. These strange and peculiar things are all unseen before. Among them, the most eye-catching are dozens of models of Li, Miao, and Yao people, which are lifelike and no different from real Li and Miao people. The costumes worn by the models are the most exquisite and peculiar among the Li and Miao people. In addition, there are Li from Baisha Cave, Li from Lemeifu, Li from Nanlao, Li from Yuanmen Cave, and Yao people from Yao Mountain in Guangzhou. Their clothing includes short shirts, skirts, battle uniforms, headbands, towels, and genital belts. Weapons include waist swords, bows and arrows, and blowpipe arrows. Ornaments include earrings, hairpins, beaded necklaces, and bracelets. Fishing and hunting tools include fishing sieves, bird-catching glue needles, fishing baskets, and bird-catching baskets. Musical instruments include harmonicas, flutes, hypnotic clappers, and wooden cowbells. Agricultural tools include lice combs and rakes. These are all real objects and are very rare and precious. People in Shanghai who study folklore and customs and are concerned about the lives of the Li and Miao people will surely be eager to go and study them in detail. It is said that for the sake of popularization, tickets are only sold for one dime, and group tickets are five cents. The exhibition will close on the 26th. It is also said that starting from the 1st of next month, the museum will cooperate with the Nanjing Engineering Reference Library to hold a railway engineering exhibition.

### Mayor Yu and Ningbo Fellow Association Hold Tea Party Yesterday

Farewell Ambassador Wang

Ambassador Wang Zhengting, who is about to leave for the United States, has been given farewell parties by various parties in recent days. Yesterday, the Ningbo Fellow Association and Acting Mayor Yu held a tea party, and the delegation to the Philippines held a farewell banquet. The grand occasions are recorded as follows:

Fellow Townsmen Say Farewell

The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai held a tea party to bid farewell to Ambassador Wang at 5:00 PM yesterday in the hall on the fourth floor of the association. Ambassador Wang and his wife, as well as the executive and supervisory committee members of the association, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Shouyong, Liu Hongsheng, Mao Heyuan, Jin Runxiang, Hu Xiyuan, Zhou Xiangsheng, and others, more than 50 people, attended. Because Ambassador Wang had other engagements, they first took a group photo and then took their seats. Yu Qiaqing then stood up and delivered a welcome speech, saying that Mr. Wang Rutang, a supervisory committee member of the association, had been appointed as the ambassador to the United States and was about to leave for his post. The fellow townsmen held a tea party to bid him farewell in the name of fellow townsmen. He was very honored to have the ambassador and his wife present. This is the first time that China has sent an ambassador to the United States, and Ambassador Wang is the first ambassador. The ambassador's past achievements in diplomacy are well known to the people of the country and need not be repeated. What I want to say now is the issue of the future. At a time when the country is in trouble and the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, if we want to seek national survival and consolidate the country's position, diplomatic negotiations are very important. Ambassador Wang is a diplomat who is brave enough to take responsibility and will surely be able to live up to the expectations of his fellow townsmen and the people of the country. Moreover, more and more fellow townsmen from Ningbo are going to the United States to do business and study. I hope that the ambassador will give them supervision and guidance in the vicinity. I wish the ambassador good health. Ambassador Wang then gave a speech in reply, saying that he was very grateful to the fellow townsmen for holding a tea party to bid him farewell. He is about to leave the country after being ordered to serve in the United States. All domestic public and private affairs can be handed over. What he is most concerned about is that his elderly mother is nearly seventy years old. However, he cannot fulfill both loyalty and filial piety. He has decided to leave his wife in the country to serve his mother. He hopes that the fellow townsmen will take care of her. Now that the country is in trouble and the situation is tense, as Mr. Yu said, China should try to turn danger into safety in this extraordinary period. The way to do this is to unite and have a unified spirit domestically. This has been effective in both the Guangdong-Guangxi and Xi'an incidents. As for diplomacy, it is also important. We often hear that "a weak country has no diplomacy." In fact, the weaker the country, the more it should study and promote diplomacy. I have been ordered to go abroad this time. I will follow Premier Sun Yat-Sen's instruction to "unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally" and the central government's diplomatic policy to work hard in my post. I hope that the fellow townsmen will not forget those who are far away and will teach me.

### Ambassador Xu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning

Hospitalized for Treatment of Otitis Media

Ambassador Xu Shiying to Japan has been suffering from a cold and severe cough for a long time, but Mr. Xu did not take it seriously and traveled north and south without rest or treatment. The day before yesterday, he went to the capital with Secretary Huang Bodu and hosted a banquet at the International Friendship Association to entertain all the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and visited Foreign Minister Wang Longhui, Vice Ministers Xu Mo and Chen Jie for long talks. In the evening, he attended the farewell banquet for Ambassador Kawagoe hosted by Director Gao Zongwu. He originally planned to attend the banquet for the major ministers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 20th and the welcome party of the Anhui Fellow Association before leaving Beijing, but due to ear pain, it became more severe. After consulting Director Hu of the Department of Otolaryngology of the Central Hospital, it was diagnosed as otitis media and urgently needed treatment. Therefore, he took the night train that night, accompanied by Secretary Huang Bodu, to Shanghai. He arrived at the station at 7:00 yesterday morning and went to the clinic of Dr. Mili, a German doctor. After a detailed examination by Mili, he said that Mr. Xu's body was very strong and all parts were free from disease. However, the middle ear was inflamed and there was a risk of acute suppuration. He should be treated quickly to avoid prolonged delay. He strongly advised him to be hospitalized for treatment that day, to avoid exertion, not to talk too much, and to have two or three weeks of rest before he could fully recover. Mr. Xu accepted Dr. Mili's advice and went to the Hongqiao Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road for treatment without returning to the residence on Laoshufu Road. When friends and relatives from all sides heard the news, they went to inquire about his health, but they politely declined according to the doctor's instructions and were received by his son and Secretary Huang to express their gratitude on his behalf. According to the Central News Agency reporter, when Mr. Xu got off the train at the North Station, he looked very energetic and walked as strongly as usual, but his right ear seemed slightly swollen.

### Party and Government Jointly Issue Announcement Prohibiting Unauthorized Strikes and Business Closures

Labor-Capital Disputes Should Be Resolved by the Competent Authority in Accordance with the Law; Instigating Labor Unrest and Endangering Public Security Will Be Punished Severely

The Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government, in view of the repeated labor-capital disputes in the city recently, especially the fluctuating labor unrest in the silk weaving industry, jointly issued an announcement yesterday, strictly prohibiting it. The original text reads: "It has been investigated that labor and capital should mutually seek coordination to coexist in the Huang Rong case. This Association and this Government have repeatedly and earnestly notified it. However, labor-capital disputes in this city have repeatedly occurred, which not only affect production and business, but also endanger local public security. Moreover, at a time when the national economic construction movement is being actively promoted, labor and capital should cooperate sincerely and strive for prosperity together. Even if there are disputes, they should be reported for mediation in accordance with the law. If mediation fails, arbitration should be submitted. There are proper ways to resolve them. How can they strike or close down without authorization, coerce each other, cut off their own livelihood, and perish together? In view of this, this Association and this Government, in order to eliminate labor-capital disputes, maintain social order, and promote production and business, jointly issue another strict announcement. From today onwards, all labor-capital dispute cases must be submitted to the competent authority for resolution in accordance with the law. Before the convening of mediation or during the mediation period, if there are any unauthorized strikes, work slowdowns, or business closures without cause, they shall be investigated and severely punished. As for those who do not obey the law, instigate labor unrest, and endanger public security, they shall be punished according to the law and severely punished without leniency. They should all abide by this and not neglect themselves. This is hereby announced."

### Taxpayers' Association Offers Solutions to Municipal Policies to Frankling

Please Do Not Hinder Our Country's Implementation of Labor Laws and Regulations; Expenses Should Be Reduced to Alleviate the Burden on Taxpayers

The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to Public Works Bureau Chairman Frankling yesterday, saying: "Dear Sir, We are pleased to learn that Your Excellency and your colleagues have taken office and begun to serve the taxpayers. You will surely like what the taxpayers like and dislike what they dislike. It is right to congratulate you. Taking advantage of this congratulation, we would like to discuss something with Your Excellency and your colleagues for the sake of public interest. Your Excellency is a legal expert and must have studied everything about social conditions and social sciences. Your knowledge and intelligence must be based on objective gains. Especially since Your Excellency considers Shanghai as your hometown, and your son will also live here permanently, it is even more clear that Your Excellency must have deeply recognized the unique characteristics of China that make people nostalgic. According to reports, Your Excellency intends to 'do your best to make Shanghai a better city to live in,' especially the education policy and cross-border road construction, which are considered to be the two major issues at present. It is truly essential. You also believe that all plans to improve the living conditions of the poor in the concession are not a problem as long as the finances are sufficient, which shows that you treat Chinese and foreigners equally and care about their well-being. You also believe that Shanghai is very different from major cities in the UK and the US, which is a remarkable insight. Moreover, Your Excellency aspires to obtain closer cooperation from citizens of all countries on various affairs in the concession during this term, and the resolution of all social problems will be more active than before. These are all what taxpayers desire and hope to achieve. The problems that Your Excellency intends to solve are education policy, cross-border road construction, the livelihood of the poor, social problems, and financial problems. This Association is willing to sincerely offer the following solutions: ㊀ Education Policy: The late Chairman Bayer implemented the eight-year education plan in a practical manner, and in accordance with the exchange of letters between this Association and Your Bureau on March 26, 1928, the text and spirit of the education item must be reflected in the facts. ㊁ Cross-border Road Construction: According to the law and legal principles, restore it to the state before the problem arose. ㊂ Livelihood of the Poor: Protect street vendors who operate legally and grass sheds that are legally owned in accordance with the law. This can be done without sufficient funds. If financial support is needed, vocational training centers and public housing should be established. ㊃ Social Problems: The most important social problem is the labor problem. Our country already has the Factory Law, the Factory Inspection Law, and other labor laws and regulations, which should be allowed to be implemented, assisted, and not hindered. ㊄ Financial Problems: It should be recognized that the ratio between the average income of taxpayers and their average tax burden should not only consider the size of the tax rate as reported by the former Chairman Arnold at the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers. The spirit and courage of US President Roosevelt to abolish the gold clauses (a reporter from the New Voice Society noted that China has also abolished the gold clauses on commercial contracts, and the UK has agreed) and grants should be used to seek the happiness of the majority of people and alleviate their burdens. Urging the payment of outstanding taxes is a fairer legal measure and a legitimate and reasonable way to achieve financial prosperity at present. As for close cooperation, it is the easiest thing to do, that is, both internally and externally, we should trust, benefit, and treat each other equally, abide by the law, and respect public opinion. Your Excellency is a well-known legal expert and has long been deeply known and admired by taxpayers. Therefore, the issue of the quorum of the last meeting of the Board of Directors before April 7 that has been rumored should be investigated. If it is true, this Association believes that those who draft the rules of procedure and enjoy the highest salary, and those who are responsible for external representation on behalf of Your Bureau, should not pay attention to the rules of procedure, causing Your Bureau and the former Chairman and his attending colleagues to be in a position of violating the law. The seriousness of the matter is even greater than the missing ballot incident last year. At least the same punishment as the missing ballot incident should be given to make the legal basis of Your Bureau more consolidated. This letter is hereby sent to you, and we hope that you will examine it and inform your colleagues.

### British Merchant Tramway Strike Stalled

Municipal Party Department Mediation Failed Yesterday; Social Affairs Bureau Will Convene Mediation Meeting

The New Voice News reported that the Municipal Party Department convened representatives of the labor side for questioning yesterday because the British merchant tramway strike was stalled and could not be resolved for a while. Yang Zhaoyu, Yan Yongqing, and others attended. Lu Yinchu, a staff member of the Civil Training Section, asked the workers about the course of the dispute and their opinions. He said that the company insisted on resuming work first and then negotiating. The workers said that the company had dealt with them in this way in the past, and they could no longer tolerate it.

Mediation in Progress

Lu Yinchu, a staff member of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Department, talked with Hu Zixing, the comprador of the company, by telephone yesterday to mediate. Mr. Hu said that the company's foreman believed that the workers must resume work first and then negotiate the conditions. Staff Lu informed him that the workers insisted that the conditions must be negotiated first and then work would be resumed because the previous attempts had been unsuccessful. As a result, the capital side failed to change its position, resulting in no resolution.

Decision on Steps

The workers have decided on the following steps for negotiating this matter: sincerely accept the mediation of the party and government organs. If the negotiations are ineffective, wait for the authorities to convene a mediation committee. If it is still ineffective, ask to convene a labor-capital arbitration committee and submit to arbitration. If necessary, petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Municipal Government's Diplomatic Office in Shanghai, the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, local associations, the Municipal Council, and the Chinese Directors of the Public Works Bureau, as well as well-known figures Wang Xiaoxiang, Du Yuesheng, and Lu Jingshi, to request assistance.

Social Affairs Bureau Notification

The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday notified the British merchant Shanghai Tramway Company and worker representatives Yang Zhaoyu and others in accordance with the revised Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Law, requiring both labor and capital to each select or appoint two representatives within three days and report the names and addresses of the representatives so that the Labor-Capital Mediation Committee can be convened again on a regular basis to mediate in accordance with the law.

### Rice Merchants' Petition Representatives Go to Beijing for the Third Time Tonight

Petition to Stop Guangdong from Exempting Foreign Rice Tax

Although various parties have repeatedly appealed for a stop to the case of Guangdong Province exempting the foreign rice tax, and representatives from six provinces and cities have petitioned in Beijing twice, and the Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to jointly review it with relevant agencies, the Ministry of Finance invited the Industrial Department, the General Economic Council, and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to review it again last week, but the results have not been announced. The representatives are deeply bewildered. It is learned that in order to fight for this, Xian Xinyi, Chen Ziyi, and others have been re-elected as petition representatives, and Mr. Luo Qinghua, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will go to Beijing for a petition tonight to request the withdrawal of the order.

### Negotiations on Road Construction and Municipal Donations Beyond Borders to Stall Again

Due to Japanese Obstruction

The Continental Daily reports that the issue of municipal donations for road construction outside the boundaries has recently seen a temporary agreement signed between Acting Mayor Yu and Stirling Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, Japanese residents of this city may again obstruct the process, as they did in 1932 and 1934. Japanese Consul-General Yoshioka in Shanghai visited Fessenden yesterday (the 19th) and formally stated that the Japanese could not agree to the agreement. As a result, the financial discussion on this matter originally scheduled for Wednesday by the Municipal Council is likely to be postponed, pending the elimination of Japanese objections before proceeding further. According to observers, the current stance taken by the Japanese may make it impossible to resolve the dispute over road construction outside the boundaries again. This dispute has been ongoing for three years. Acting Mayor Yu, while serving as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, had also reached agreements with Fessenden in both 1932 and 1934, but they were abandoned due to Japanese opposition. Although the content of the new agreement has not yet been announced, according to non-official sources, the agreement divides the roads outside the boundaries into northwest and west districts. In the west district, the Municipal Council will collect municipal donations and miscellaneous taxes on behalf of the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government will allocate a certain amount of the proceeds to the Municipal Council as compensation for the public services and other conveniences enjoyed by the residents. The Municipal Government only retains a small portion of the miscellaneous taxes. The Japanese argue that the new agreement does not take into account the interests of the so-called Japanese residents in the area and do not approve of it. The Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun has published an article criticizing the Municipal Council's handling of this matter, which is sufficient to represent the views of the Japanese.

### Minsheng's Two New Ships to Set Sail Today

When the Yangtze River's water level rises, it can also sail along the Min River to Jiading. The "Minsu" ship, which is undergoing annual repairs, has also been repaired and will sail to Yichang and Chongqing at the same time. It is reported that the company currently has 46 ships on the Yangtze River. Except for the "Minzu," "Mintai," and "Minlian" ships sailing on the Shanghai-Yichang line, the rest sail between Yichang and Chongqing. The company's ships are fully equipped, providing exceptional convenience for Yangtze River passengers.

### Two More Major Criminals Apprehended in the Robbery of the Jiangsu Bank

Wang Abing and a "Young Master Ren" Arrested; Police Investigation Rescheduled for Further Inquiry

On the afternoon of February 3rd of this year, at around 5:00 PM, as the branch of the Jiangsu Bank at 339 Xinzha Road was preparing to transport over 7,000 yuan in cash to the head office, a number of robbers suddenly appeared, each wielding weapons, attempting to rob the money. Fortunately, the person carrying the money out of the store was quick-witted, and the money was not robbed. At the same time, the robbers opened fire, killing Shi Jinzhi, the bank's doorman, and wounding bodyguard Gu Wenlin, Jiang Ziqin, and rickshaw puller Chen Youru. Subsequently, the Chief of Detectives You A'gen and Detective Lu Gensheng of the Old Zha Police Station apprehended thirteen perpetrators of the crime, including Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, and Chen Changfu, who were handed over to the First Special District Court. Zhang and Zhao were sentenced to death, and the rest were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. However, the masterminds behind the crime, Young Master Ren from Yangzhou (also known as Zhang Yiqing, Ren Wenhai, Ren Huanzhang, "Little Ren") and Wang Abing from Hubei (also known as Liu Bingkun, Zhang Zhensheng), remained at large. The First Special District Court issued arrest warrants for their apprehension. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, at 7:50 PM, Detective Lu learned that the suspect Wang must pass near Pingliang Road and Taopeng Road. He led detectives Liu Ziliang and Zhu Shangwu to arrest Wang. Wang confessed that Young Master Ren was hiding in Tianchang County, Anhui, working as a chauffeur. Detectives Wang Jiaju and Ye Yuming were dispatched with a warrant to cooperate with the county police to arrest Ren and bring him back to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the process, stating that the defendant, Young Master Ren, was the mastermind of the case, while Wang Abing was assigned to monitor the Chinese police near the Wuzhen Road bridge. However, the case still required investigation, so he requested a postponement for further inquiry. Both Young Master Ren and Wang Abing denied the charges. Zhang Shaoqing and others who had already been sentenced were called to court to testify, but their testimonies were very vague. Judge Feng Shide ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning.

### Zhu Hong, Representative of China-Africa Business Investigation, Arrives in Shanghai

Seeking to Promote China-Africa Trade; Donating Library Funds to Jinan University

Zhu Hong, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman from South Africa, recently hired by the South African Union government as a representative of the China-Africa Business Investigation, accompanied by Ye Fan, a representative sent by the Central Government to receive him in Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to Zhu Hong, the South African Union government hired him as a representative of the China-Africa Business Investigation to promote China-Africa trade under the principle of mutual benefit. The mission of this trip is to investigate Chinese goods suitable for sale in the South African market for transportation and export, and to investigate raw materials lacking in China for import from South Africa, where there is overproduction. For example, South African wool is of excellent quality, the best in the world. Zhu Hong plans to establish factories for weaving felt, blankets, and wool fabrics in China, which can both improve China's emerging industries and alleviate unemployment, and absorb South Africa's surplus production. Before leaving South Africa, Zhu Hong discussed this with the local Minister of Industry and Commerce and received high praise. The South African government has instructed Mr. Billandun, the Commercial Commissioner stationed in the Far East, to come to Shanghai to discuss the matter further. Furthermore, the South African Union is a newly emerging country, and those who have not visited it may think it is a barren desert. In fact, it has green mountains and clear waters, a mild climate, and fertile land, so agricultural production is very abundant. However, due to its vast land and sparse population, there is an overproduction of goods, and it urgently seeks a market. China can supply what it lacks, and will certainly be welcomed by South Africa. Based on this principle of mutual benefit, not only will both countries benefit, but the status of overseas Chinese will also be improved. Mr. Zhu is extremely enthusiastic about various undertakings in the motherland. Today, Mr. Ye Fan introduced him to visit the National Jinan University in Zhenru, where he was received by Du Zuozhou, the Secretary-General of the university, and Mr. Yu, the Director of the Overseas Cultural Affairs Department. Mr. Zhu acknowledged the school was well managed and donated two hundred yuan in national currency for library funds to benefit overseas Chinese education, which is commendable.

According to Ye Fan, Mr. Zhu has been traveling to Africa for many years. Early on, he joined the Kuomintang and served as the branch director of the South Africa branch and the standing committee member of the general branch. He made outstanding achievements overseas. When Sun Yat-sen was alive, he was appointed as the fundraising officer in Africa and was awarded a gold medal and certificate. Mr. Zhu operates a large business in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is highly trusted by Chinese and Westerners.

### Labor Dispute at the Public Welfare Cotton Mill Not Resolved Yesterday

Workers at Ewo Sympathize and Respond

The New Voice News Agency reports that after the workers at the Public Welfare Cotton Mill on Rue Robert, Shanghai West, went on strike and the factory announced a shutdown, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a labor-management conciliation committee at 2:00 PM yesterday in accordance with the revised Law on Handling Labor Disputes. Labor representatives, including Dai Guoliang, attended on time, but the management representatives refused to attend. After the Chairman, Mr. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Third Division of the Conciliation Department, inquired of the labor representatives, he announced that he would report to the Director for approval. It is reported that in accordance with Article 11 of the revised Law on Handling Labor Disputes, "If the conciliation committee has been convened and a member refuses to attend, resulting in the conciliation being unable to proceed, it shall be considered that the conciliation has failed." Therefore, the case will be handled as a failed conciliation in accordance with the law and submitted for arbitration. In addition, the workers of the factory are indignant that the management refused to attend, causing the competent authority to be unable to mediate. They have decided to convene a general meeting of all workers at the wasteland of Gongan Primary School on Boulevard des Deux Republiques at a certain time this afternoon. After the meeting, they will send representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. At the same time, the workers of the new and old Ewo cotton mills in Yangshupu also made three demands to the management yesterday to support the workers of the Public Welfare Cotton Mill: 1. In the Public Welfare incident, the factory should accept the mediation of the Chinese government. 2. Workers should not be dismissed or have their workloads increased under any pretext. 3. With the current high prices, the one-tenth wage reduction and three-tenths rice subsidy that were cut last year must be restored. They also stated that if the management does not agree to the above three conditions, they will take unified action with the workers of the Public Welfare Cotton Mill.

### Tao Zhu Confesses to Murdering Her Husband

Cui Zigao Talks About Borrowing Money from Ma; Prosecutor Argues for Severe Punishment

Tao Zhu, the wife of Tao Wenhai of Haichang Road, Zhabei, had an affair with Cui Zigao. In order to become a long-term couple, they secretly plotted to kill her husband. They tricked Tao into a storefront a few dozen doors away from home, then hacked him to death with a hatchet. Afterwards, Tao feigned grief when identifying her husband's body, claiming he was a gambling addict and a scoundrel, causing the authorities to suspect foul play and investigate. They learned that she had plotted to murder her husband and arrested her and Cui Zigao, referring them to the District Court for prosecution. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened the court. Tao Zhu initially denied having an affair and denied murdering her husband. After the judge's stern interrogation, Tao Zhu confessed that Cui Zigao was the godfather of her child, that they had been having an affair for four years, that her husband knew about it, and that they often quarreled and that he had beaten her severely. She said that someone named Ma said that he could kill her husband for a fee of 100 yuan. She said that she had discussed it with Cui and gave the money to Ma to do it. She said that she had discussed the matter with Cui on the morning of the eighteenth day of the twelfth month at home. She said that she had first proposed the murder and that Cui had agreed. She said that the motive for the murder had been discussed as early as October, first by Ma, and that Cui did not know about it at that time. In the twelfth month, after being beaten by her husband, she again discussed it with Cui and decided that she would first give Cui 50 yuan to pass on. After that, Cui did not say anything. She said that her husband died on the night of the twenty-fourth day of the first month, after being called out by Luo Erxiao, Yangzhou, and others. She said that her husband died at the west end of Datong Road. However, she had once regretted the murder and had said to Ma on the fifth or sixth day of the first month not to do it, saying that it was terrible to kill her husband. She had asked him to return the money, but he refused. She said that she was going to report it, and he said that he would return the money. Later, because he could not return the money, he killed her husband. She said that after her husband died, Cui Zigao ran away, but was also arrested, etc. When asked, Cui Zigao said, "I did not have an affair with her. I work every day, leaving early and returning late, and this did not happen." When asked how much money he had given to Ma, the man named Ma Zhaoxian, he replied, "I didn't give him any money, but Ma did borrow 50 yuan from Tao Zhu to spend the New Year, and it was handed over in a small teahouse on Wuzhen Road." When asked why he ran away after her husband died, he replied, "Because business was bad, I went to Nanjing to find work." At this point, Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang's opinion was that severe punishment should be requested. Finally, the designated female volunteer lawyer Yu Xiufang gave a defense. The court announced that the debate was over and that the verdict would be announced at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month.

### The Thug Who Used Intimidation to Extort Money Was Indeed the Intermediary

Liu Zhiming Served Shao, Writing Letters of Extortion, Resulting in Exposure

Shao Nantang, a native of Zhejiang and chief of the Finance Section of the Ministry of Transportation, resided in Shanghai at No. 1 Chongye Lane, Marlborough Road, in the French Concession. His wife, Madam Li, lived in Shanghai. As they had no children early in their marriage, they adopted a son named Ruixin, sending him to school. Unexpectedly, upon reaching adulthood, he neglected his studies and indulged in extravagance outside, associating with criminals. Disappointed, Mr. and Mrs. Shao asked their friend, Lu Cufen, director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau in the Upper Bin District, to use gentle persuasion to arrange for Ruixin's expulsion from the family. Lu then entrusted the matter to his former subordinate, Liu Zhiming, a 40-year-old native of Zhejiang living at No. 5 Nianxuan Village, Lujiabang, South Shanghai.)

Liu then Encouraged Ruixin to go to the Third Security Corps in Pingyang, Zhejiang, as a soldier to sever the father-son relationship, and gave Liu 30 yuan for travel expenses. Liu then accompanied Ruixin from Shanghai. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Pingyang, both Liu and Ruixin fell ill, and all the travel funds were used for medical expenses. Liu returned to Shanghai last month and reported to the Shao residence, recounting the journey to Pingyang and claiming to have advanced 69 yuan for medical and other expenses. He demanded that the Shao family repay him and requested compensation. However, the Shao family sternly refused. As a result, Liu Zhiming harbored resentment in his heart. From the 8th to the 18th of this month, he secretly entrusted Wang and Chen to write three intimidating letters to the Shao residence, extorting 1,000 yuan. Liu then seized the opportunity to go to the Shao residence and

Volunteered to Negotiate with the Robbers. The Shao family deeply believed him and gave Liu 150 yuan in cash, instructing him to go to Room 231 of the Mengyuan Hotel at Daxin Street Intersection, Sanma Road, at 3 PM the day before yesterday to negotiate with the robbers. Meanwhile, the Shao family reported to the French Concession Police. Inspector Li Xianyang, along with detectives Xie Guangming and Yao Zhupo, rushed to the hotel to wait and observe the robbers' movements. The detectives waited in the Mengyuan Hotel for a long time but saw no one else entering or leaving Room 231. They only saw Liu ascending the stairs and

Wandering Around. The detectives became suspicious. After waiting until 4 PM, they saw Liu leave. The detectives followed him and found his behavior even more suspicious. They stopped Liu at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and searched him, finding 150 yuan in banknotes given to him by the victim, as well as several other notes. They took him back to the French Concession Police Station, where he confessed the whole story. It was also discovered that Liu had been sentenced to five years in the Western Jail by the French Concession Court for a robbery case on May 4, 1931. He was then detained and sent to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Special No. 2 Court yesterday. Judge Sun Peng interrogated him, and the attorney of the Police Department, Yao Di, explained the case and requested a postponement for further investigation. After the detectives reported the arrest, Liu Zhiming confessed to sending letters to the Shao residence for extortion and admitted to accompanying Shao's son to Pingyang to join the army. The court verified the confession and adjourned the hearing to the 27th of this month. The defendant was detained.

### Collection Case, Agent Represents Principal Acknowledged

Deducting Commission, Witness Swears, No Damage, No Acknowledgment of Penalty

Xu Peikun and Zhu Muzhou guaranteed Wang Naigang's loan of 2,000 yuan from Wei Guangling. After repaying 1,200 yuan, 800 yuan remained unpaid, leading Wei to hire lawyer Gu Xianzhang to sue in the First Special Court. Xu and others argued that although Wang borrowed 2,000 yuan, the actual deduction for commission, interest, and repayment of 1,200 yuan totaled over 3,000 yuan, exceeding one-third of the loan amount. The Special Court had summoned them twice. Yesterday morning, Judge Jia opened the court for a continued hearing. Wang Naigang presented witnesses Su Zikun and Yao Jixue to testify about the deduction of commission and interest for the nine extensions. Su swore that if he lied or the plaintiff denied it, he would be without descendants. Wang's lawyer, Huang Xiubo, and Xu's lawyer, Xi Shichang, both stated that the plaintiff in this case was actually lawyer Gu Xianzhang himself, and it was absurd for the plaintiff to act as his own agent. As for the plaintiff's request for a penalty of 250 yuan, he had suffered no damage at all, so there was no basis for a penalty. They requested the court to reject the plaintiff's claim. Judge Jia then announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for the verdict.

### The Bodhi Society Requests Banning the Disposal of Puffer Fish Eggs

Advising Fish Merchants and Residents to Avoid Endangering Lives

The Bodhi Society of this city, together with the Chinese Buddhist Association, yesterday requested that letters be sent to the Municipal Police Bureau, the British and French Concession Municipal Councils, and the governments of Baoshan, Nantong, Jiangyin, and other counties, requesting the prompt issuance of simple notices advising fish merchants and residents to discard puffer fish to protect lives. The original letter stated: "To the esteemed authorities, according to a letter from member Wang Jie, there have been several reports in recent days of people dying from puffer fish egg poisoning, mostly among shanty dwellers and coolies who do not recognize the fish and are unaware of the toxicity of puffer fish eggs. They often find a pile of them on the beach, take them home, cook them, and within hours, die from the poison, sometimes even with their entire family succumbing. Every spring, countless people in Pudong, Puxi, and other areas lose their lives in this way, which is truly lamentable. We humbly request your great compassion in forwarding a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau, the British and French Concession Municipal Councils, and the governments of Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Nantong, Jiangyin, Changshu, and other counties, requesting the prompt issuance of simple notices advising fish merchants and residents to discard puffer fish eggs to avoid endangering lives. When discarding them, they must be mixed with ash and soil so that the poor people cannot find them. In addition, please instruct police officers to inspect streets, riverbanks, and garbage dumps regularly, and if they find any, confiscate them immediately. Those who disobey the advice and continue to discard them randomly should be punished to correct this habit." The letter was sent to the association for review and action.

### The Difficult Problem of Reconciliation Between Monks of Longhua Temple and Merchants

The Court Approves Withdrawal of Part of the Case, Re-Hearing Required for Those Who Do Not Agree to Private Settlement

The monks of Longhua Temple once clashed with merchants. Wu Rugui (residing at No. 123 Tianyao Bridge, Longhua Road, serving as the deputy head of the security corps), and Wu Fusheng, Liu Peiren, Yu Xiaochun, Xu Shiming, and five other merchants were prosecuted by Prosecutor Huang Meiqing of the Local Court for robbery, assault, and property damage. Judge Lu interrogated them yesterday afternoon. The prosecutor's indictment stated that the defendant Wu Rugui, as the deputy head of the Longhua Town security corps, on the morning of March 16, invited defendants Wu Fusheng, Liu Peiren, Yu Xiaochun, Xu Shiming, and several other fugitives, using debt collection as an excuse, broke into the temple, posted slogans, intending to expel the plaintiff, Reverend Yuanming, and take over the temple property. A dispute arose, and Yuanming, Zhengqing, Jueliang, Changrui, Chen Peigen, and others were injured. The paneling, doors, and windows of the temple's reception hall were also destroyed, and the trunks, gold Buddhas, and silver pagodas inside the hall were robbed. Local police arrived to suppress the disturbance and took Wu Rugui, Wu Fusheng, Liu Peiren, and Reverend Yuanming to the police station. Yuanming and Zhengqing filed a complaint with the court, accusing them of violating Article 277, Paragraph 1, Article 354, and Article 306, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, which should be punished severely according to Article 55 of the same law. Furthermore, taking advantage of the chaos in the temple, they robbed property, committing the crime of Article 325, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, which should be punished jointly according to Article 50 of the same law. The victimized monks hired lawyer Liu Xiang to pursue civil litigation for 3,334 yuan. However, the case had already been settled out of court, so they requested to withdraw the lawsuit. The court ruled that except for the charges of assault and property damage, which required a formal complaint, the rest could not be settled privately, and adjourned the hearing for another day.

### Damage to Steel Plates of the Chunhe Steamer, Fortunately Returned to Qingdao

Dumping Coal to Reduce Draft, Fortunately Safe and Sound

The Chunhe steamer, owned by the Hefeng Xinji Shipping Company in this port, weighing 1,765 tons, was carrying 2,300 tons of coal from Qingdao to Shanghai. On the way, a steel plate, one and a half feet long and eight inches wide, on the side of the second-class cabin in the stern of the ship was suddenly damaged. Seawater flooded the main cabin. After the shipowner, Mao Beiqing, discovered this, he was greatly alarmed and sent an urgent telegram. The ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday. Upon receiving the report, the Shanghai Dalu Company immediately telegraphed the ship, ordering it to return to Qingdao as quickly as possible, as it was closer. At the same time, the manager of the company, Fang Shouxian, flew to Qingdao to inspect. By yesterday afternoon, they received another telegram from shipowner Mao, stating that the Chunhe steamer had turned back to Qingdao. To avoid danger while sailing, they had to dump some of the coal into the sea to reduce the draft and ensure safety. Fortunately, the ship returned safely to Qingdao port on the afternoon of the 20th. Except for the loss of some coal, the ship was safe and sound. Upon hearing this news in Shanghai, they were greatly relieved and notified the insurance company. It is said that the cause of the accident was that when the ship left Qingdao with all the coal loaded, the iron plate in the stern was damaged when it left the dock, causing it to break and flood on the way. Fortunately, it was discovered early enough to avoid sinking, which was a great blessing. However, the loss was still very significant.

### Third Public Hearing of the Embezzlement Case of Detectives

Because the Original Judge Was Ill, the Hearing Was Not Concluded Yesterday

—The Case Involves 22 Witnesses and Others—

Liu Bingyuan, the leader of the sixth squad of the Zhabei division of the Municipal Police Bureau's Detective General Team, and detectives Miao Yizhong and Wu Song, were accused by Ruan Defu, the owner of the Ruan Defu Leather Goods and Sundries Store at 119 Xinmin Road, in the Shanghai Local Court of restricting freedom and embezzlement. Judge Li Xuedeng had already held two public hearings, involving 22 people in the case. The plaintiff's side included Ruan Defu and his mother and wife, Madam Ruan Kong and Madam Ruan Chen. The defendants were Liu Bingyuan, Miao Yizhong, Wu Songshan, Liu Heng, Liu Yufu, and squad leader Qian Tianxiong. The witnesses were Fan Bingnan, Wang Shixiang, Shi Hongliang, and Wu Si. The related parties were Shi Dengnian, Madam Shi Zhu, Ma Delin, Gu Naide, Niu Baoqi, Wang Bingkun, Cao Jinxian, and police officers Gao Zhifang and Zhao Yulin. At 9 AM yesterday, the third public hearing was held. The original judge, Li Xuedeng, was ill, so Judge Yu Lude acted as his agent and opened the third courtroom for the hearing. The testimonies of the various parties are summarized below: (1) Liu Bingyuan testified: "Miao Yizhong and Wu Songshan are my colleagues. The Zhabei Branch Bureau assigned us to investigate Gu Naide and others, who claimed that they had fought and had weapons such as axes, iron bars, and guns. So we reported to the squad leader and were sent to search. As a result, no guns were found. On the second day (i.e., February 9), Miao Yizhong and Wu Songshan went to ask Ruan Defu's mother for 150 yuan. This is completely untrue. How could we public officials break the law?" (2) Miao Yizhong testified: "On February 8, I did not go to Shi Dengnian's house to search. I went to Ma Delin's house with Liu Yufu and Liu Heng. No guns were found, so we returned to the team. I never asked Ruan's mother for 150 yuan the next day. They are completely framing us out of spite." (3) Wu Songshan testified: "Similar to the above. We went to Ruan Defu's house to search for guns, but we didn't find any. It is completely untrue that we asked Ruan's mother for 150 yuan. How could we public officials do such a thing?" (4) Ruan Defu testified: "On February 8 (i.e., December 27 of the lunar calendar), we were busy preparing for the New Year, so I wasn't at home. Only my wife and mother were in the store. They came to search, but I didn't know at the time. My wife didn't come today; she went back to Jiangbei. On the third day, they said they wanted 154 yuan, at least 100 yuan. I was at my aunt's house at 1 Jiujiang Lane, Sanma Road, because I heard that they were looking for me, so I didn't dare to go back to the store. I don't know much about what happened." (5) Shi Dengnian testified: "I wasn't at home on February 8. My wife was at home. Someone came to search for guns, but they didn't find any." (6) Ma Delin testified: "I wasn't at home on February 8. My wife was at home. She said that detectives came to search for guns, but they didn't find any. I don't know anything else." (7) Fan Bingnan testified: "I have known Miao Yizhong for a long time, but we don't have any close relationship. On the morning of February 9, I was drinking tea at the Huayanglou on Xinmin Road. Miao Yizhong came, and this matter was very important. It would be good to settle it. Ruan's mother said they wanted 150 yuan, which was too much. If it was 20 or 30 yuan, it could be done." (8) Qian Tianxiong testified: "Miao Yizhong and the others are all colleagues; we don't have any relatives. On February 8, the branch bureau assigned us a fighting case, saying that Ruan Defu's house had axes, guns, and other items, so we sent officers and police to search together. As for the matter of embezzling 150 yuan, I don't think they would do such a thing. I haven't heard anyone say that either." (9) Madam Ruan Kong testified: "On February 9, I was on the road in front of the store. Miao Yizhong and Fan Bingnan came and said they wanted 150 yuan. No one else said anything." (10) Madam Shi Zhu testified: "Shi Dengnian is my husband. On February 8, the detectives came to search. My husband wasn't at home. The next day, they said it was related to a bank gun case in Xingjiang and told me to settle the matter. They said to drink tea at the Xi'an Tea House at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Xinzha Road in the concession. I didn't know the way, so I asked Wu Si to lead me." (10-1) Wu Si testified: "Similar to Madam Zhu's testimony." (10-2) Wang Shixiang testified: "On February 9, at 9 or 10 AM, I was drinking tea at the Huayanglou. I saw Shi Dengnian, Fan Bingnan, and others talking to Miao Yizhong, but I don't know what they were saying." (10-3) Shi Hongliang testified: "I am Ruan Defu's neighbor. On February 9, I was drinking tea at the Huayanglou. I saw Fan Bingnan run to Miao Yizhong and talk, but I don't know what they were saying." A total of thirteen people came to the court. Judge Yu questioned them about their age, address, occupation, etc., and then adjourned the court. It is said that the next hearing will be held after Judge Li Xuedeng recovers from his illness, and then the debate can be concluded.

### The Loss Prevention Squad of the Police Bureau Arrests Pickpockets in Large Numbers

The Criminals and Stolen Goods Are Recovered, Criminal Photos Are Displayed on the Streets

Chen Benhou, a staff member of the Secretariat of the Municipal Police Bureau, went to visit the zoo on Wenmiao Road the day before yesterday afternoon. He then went to the Penglai Market to shop. When he approached the Wuzhou Drugstore, he discovered that the small camera he had with him was missing. He returned to the bureau to report the theft. The Detective General Team ordered Liu Guangjun, the leader of the fifth squad in the jurisdiction, and detectives Yu Ruhai and others, to conduct a large-scale search for pickpockets in the areas of Laoximen, Wenmiao Road, Penglai Market, Laobeimen, Minguo Road, and Jiumudi. They arrested Wang Jinqing, 29 years old from Ningbo; Zou Zhengwu, 36 years old from Guizhou; Yue Chaogen, 28 years old from Yunnan; Zhang Zhaolin, 55 years old from Suzhou; Su Zhiming, 35 years old from Sichuan; Zou Zhian, 20 years old from Sichuan; Tang Zhigui, 22 years old from Sichuan; Li Xiaolin, 21 years old from Sichuan; and Zhang Chuqing, 25 years old from Guizhou. As a result of the interrogation, Tang Zhigui and Li Xiaolin confessed to stealing and pawning the items at the Qiasheng Pawnshop on Minguo Road, obtaining 14 yuan to divide among themselves. The pawn ticket was sold to Xiao Nanjing for 3 yuan. After recovering the pawn ticket, the criminals were photographed one by one, displayed on the streets, and sent to the court for trial with a formal document.

### Insurance Fraud Case Appeal, Downplaying the Seriousness

Police Lawyers Request Dismissal, Verdict Scheduled for the Afternoon of the 27th

The Fenghua Clothing Company, located at No. 548 Fuzhou Road, has been in business for several years with a paid-up capital of 18,000 yuan. It had fire insurance of 50,000 yuan with the Lulin Dalai and other insurance companies. Wu Ziliang, a native of Suzhou, served as the manager. In recent years, the company's business had been poor, and it had suffered significant losses. They secretly plotted to commit arson to defraud the insurance money. Zhang Kuibo, the company's accountant, found Huang Changgen, who was skilled in arson, to set the fire with jute and rush mats at around 2 AM on January 22 of this year. However, the plan was discovered by Hua Detective Lu Gengsheng and Detective Zhu Shanghe of the Laozha Police Station, who arrested Wu, Zhang, and Huang and sent them to the First Special District Court. Judge Qian interrogated them and sentenced Huang to 14 years in prison, Zhang to 9 years and 6 months, and Wu to 3 years and 6 months. Huang and the other two appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, either because they believed the original sentence was too heavy or because they claimed they had not participated in the plan beforehand. Lawyers were hired. Yesterday afternoon, Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court, together with judges Nie and Zhou and Prosecutor Song, opened the First Criminal Court to interrogate them. Wu Ziliang, Zhang Kuibo, and Huang Changgen all downplayed the seriousness of their crimes. The lawyer for the Municipal Council, Gan Raoxian, argued that the original sentence was appropriate and requested that the appeal be dismissed. After the lawyers for the appellants defended them, Judge Yu announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 27th.

### The Zhonghe Steamer Runs Aground in the Nianyu Set

Unloading 600 Tons of Salt, Another Ship Dispatched to Rescue

The Zhonghe steamer, owned by the Huatong Shipping Company in this port, is currently loading salt in Haizhou, heading from Lizekou to Hankou. Yesterday, the shipowner telegraphed that the Zhonghe steamer ran aground on a shoal near the Nianyu Set, about ten miles from Wuchang, on the 19th, due to low water levels and the ship being overloaded with salt. They tried all means to free the ship but were unable to do so. They have dispatched a barge from Hankou to unload the cargo. At least 600 tons must be unloaded to reduce the ship's weight before it can be towed.

### The Municipal Police Bureau and the Anti-Opium Committee Form an Anti-Opium Propaganda Team

Advising People to Exchange Their Fourth-Term Licenses and Unregistered Opium Smokers to Register Quickly

The Anti-Opium General Association previously found that many opium smokers arrested in the city for smoking without a license were residents of the special districts and urban areas who were unaware of the anti-opium laws. There was a need for thorough assistance, so they ordered the municipal government to instruct the Municipal Police Bureau to conduct supplementary registration again so that all opium smokers in the city could be registered to avoid breaking the law. After receiving the order, the Municipal Police Bureau immediately began to handle the matter and exchange the fourth-term licenses. For many days, the number of opium smokers exchanging their fourth-term licenses and supplementing their registration has been increasing. However, the supplementary registration and license exchange period is short. In order to advise opium smokers to register universally, the Municipal Police Bureau, in addition to the responsible section chief, Mr. Dai Lizhen, leading all the investigators to go to the various branch bureaus and teams to urge them to step up investigations, also formed an anti-opium propaganda team in conjunction with the Anti-Opium Committee. Starting today, they will depart in groups to publicize and advise licensed opium smokers to exchange their fourth-term licenses on schedule and unregistered opium smokers to apply for supplementary registration quickly. If they continue to be stubborn, they will be punished according to the circumstances after being caught.

### Stepmother Abuses Her Stepchild Wang Yukun, Returned to His Paternal Uncle for Adoption

Biological Mother Madam Gao Also Wishes to Adopt Him, Wang Zhang Given One Year and Two Months

Zhang, a 23-year-old Wuxi woman and the stepmother of Wang Linsheng, a native of Dangzhou residing at No. 5 Tongzhou Road, abused Wang Yukun, her husband's 11-year-old son from a previous marriage, from September of last year to February of this year. She beat him frequently, pierced his face with sewing needles, burned his hands with lit cardboard, or pulled his hair and slammed him against the wall. He did not dare to speak of the suffering. He was only allowed to eat two bowls of thin porridge a day, not allowing him to be full, resulting in his face being yellow, his skin thin, and him becoming sick and near death. Recently, neighbors secretly reported this to the Jiaxing Road police station. Hua Detective Chen Jinsheng went to investigate and found the report to be true. He arrested Wang Zhang and sent her to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in this newspaper. Wang's child was temporarily sent to the Women and Children Relief Society for care. Judge Zhong Qing visited the Criminal Third Court yesterday morning for a continued hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution based on Article 286, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, accusing her of abuse and requesting severe punishment to deter others from following her example. Subsequently, Madam Wang Gao, a woman from Dangzhou, stated that she was Yukun's biological mother and had divorced Wang Linsheng four years ago. She now wanted to take the child back. Wang Ziqing, Wang Linsheng's elder brother, also wished to take his nephew Yukun back, send him to the hospital for treatment, and take responsibility for his upbringing in the future. The court asked the child to choose whom he wished to follow. Yukun said he wished to follow his paternal uncle. The defendant pleaded for leniency in her testimony. Judge Zhong sentenced Wang Zhang to one year and two months in prison as a warning. Yukun was handed over to his paternal uncle Wang Ziqing with a guarantee to take him back and properly educate him.

### Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank's 25th Year Business Report (Continued)

(A) Production and Marketing Loans

This year, this type of loan was divided into four categories: First, wheat production loans, the production cooperative was distributed near Su County in Anhui, under the guidance of the University of Nanking Agricultural Extension Zone. Second, tobacco production loans, distributed in Linzi, Shandong, and Fengyang, Huaiyuan, Anhui, etc., were used to purchase fertilizers and bake tobacco leaves. Third, cotton production and marketing loans, distributed in Xuzhou, Dongtai, Jiangpu in Jiangsu, Wujiang in Anhui, Jingyang, Sanyuan, Lintong in Shaanxi, Yuyao in Zhejiang, etc., accounted for the majority of the bank's agricultural loans. The handling of these production and marketing loans has been going on for many years and has considerable experience. Fourth, sugarcane farmer production loans, distributed in Shunde, Panyu, Zhongshan, Nanhai, Dongguan, Gaoyao, Gaoming, Xinhui and other counties in Guangdong, were loans to sugarcane farmers to purchase sugarcane seeds and fertilizers. Most of the farmers in the area are tenant farmers, so cooperatives are not very developed, and they are still in the trial stage. In total, the total amount of production and marketing loans this year was more than 3.4 million yuan, all of which can be recovered on schedule.

(B) Credit Loans

This year, the amount of loans to credit cooperatives was greatly reduced, because credit cooperatives are distributed in a very scattered area, and it is not economical to handle loans. Therefore, this year it was decided to gradually abandon credit cooperatives that do not have a competent organization responsible for guidance. Currently, only Gaoqiao District in Shanghai, Changweidao, Jiangpu in Jiangsu, and other places are retained, all of which have reliable organizations responsible for guidance. Although the loans are credit loans, the use is still limited to production, but the crops are not specified. The total amount of this type of loan this year was more than 160,000 yuan, most of which have been cleared.

(C) Warehouse Agricultural Pledge Loans

The warehouses that undertake this type of pledge loan are either self-operated, specially contracted, or operated by cooperatives. This year, we focused on agricultural pledge loans in self-operated warehouses, including Qingyang in Jiangyin and Heqiao in Yiwei. The pledge loans of specially contracted warehouses and cooperative warehouses have been gradually reduced due to the difficulty of management. In addition, there is also a type of loan office that accepts not only pledged agricultural products, but also clothing, utensils, etc. This year, there were two places that undertook this type of loan, the Jiangning Hushu Loan Office and the Dongtai Dafeng United Cooperative. In total, the warehouse pledge loans this year were more than 1.1 million yuan, most of which have been returned.

Our bank has been conducting agricultural lending for several years, and has determined the proper way for commercial banks to assist the rural economy, which has aroused the enthusiasm of all sectors to invest in rural areas, which is very gratifying. At present, although the operation of cooperatives is not perfect, the purity of the farmers' minds and the spirit of keeping their promises have become more obvious through the bank's years of trial and error. If they have the slightest ability, they have no intention of delaying repayment. For example, during the recent Xi'an Incident, when the overall situation was chaotic, farmers near Xi'an still returned their debts one after another amidst the disturbances of soldiers and bandits, without breaking their promises. This spirit of keeping their promises is worthy of our admiration.

Three, Small Loan Services

The Jing'an Temple Road branch of our bank has been handling credit small loans for six years. Through careful management over the years, it has made a great contribution to the turnover of individual and small industrial and commercial finances. This year, the market was slightly better than in the past, so the number of borrowers was reduced compared to last year. There were more than 5,280 households, a decrease of more than 1,600 households compared to last year. More than 700,000 yuan of loans were released, all of which were repaid on time. In total, the number of loan recipients since the start of the business has reached more than 20,000, which shows that this service can indeed meet the needs of the general public.

Four, Promotion of Acceptance Drafts

Our bank believes that the promotion of acceptance drafts can gradually establish a commercial paper market, and based on the principle of financing goods, the turnover of funds is also very active. Therefore, since last year, we have been promoting it together with all sectors. This year, the market has recovered, and our bank is still trying its best to promote it within its capacity, explaining the meaning of bank acceptance drafts and commercial acceptance drafts in detail, and printing small booklets for distribution. The discount rate was also reduced appropriately to show preferential treatment. Because industrial and commercial firms enjoy the convenience of credit overdrafts, this business has not yet become a trend. Although efforts have been made to publicize it, the progress is slow, and it still awaits the establishment of a key system and the cooperative promotion of the industry.

In addition to the above services, this year our bank has also tried its best to assist in economic construction work and the industry's cooperative endeavors within the possible scope. For example, the establishment of the Agricultural Bank, the turnover of railway finance, the establishment of various agricultural product syndicates, and the organization of bank note acceptance houses, etc., our bank has also followed the industry, and contributed its modest efforts under the principle of prudent operation.

㊄ Factors of the Prosperity This Year

The important events of our bank's business this year have been described above. This kind of progress in operation is due to the loyalty of our colleagues and the care and guidance of shareholders and depositors. The improvement of the environment this year is also a great help to the bank's operation. In general, the period after the second half of this year can be regarded as a more prosperous period. The factors that promote the prosperity are about several points. In addition to describing the bank's business, it is necessary to mention them to the shareholders, as follows:

One, Price Rebound

The most noteworthy event this year is the continued rebound in the prices of various commodities. The price increase started in November of the 24th year, when the currency system was reformed. The Shanghai wholesale price index (according to the National Standards Committee) increased from 94.2 in October to 103.3, an increase of 10%. Since entering the 25th year, the first half of the year saw a slight increase, but not very fast, hovering around 106. From October in the second half of the year, it surged. By the end of December, the Shanghai price index was 118.8, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year, and an increase of 26% compared to before the currency system reform (October of the 24th year). In more detail, the price increase of export goods was more significant than that of import goods. The export price index increased from 90. in December of the 24th year to 102.9 in December of the 25th year, an increase of more than 14%. The import price index increased from 141.5 in December of the 24th year to 147.6 in December of the 25th year, an increase of only 4%. However, the increase in export prices is not as good as wholesale prices, because the wholesale price index includes domestic trade commodities, and the degree of price increase is faster than that of import and export trade commodities. In terms of the types of commodities, the price increases of various commodities are as follows:

Among all kinds of commodities, the price increases of food and textiles are more severe, which increases the burden on general consumers. However, in these two types of commodities, our country's agricultural products account for the majority, such as wheat, grain, peanuts, raw silk, rice, etc., so the result of the price increase is to increase the purchasing power of our country's farmers.

This year, the prices of various commodities have been rising steadily, and all industries and businesses have accumulated inventories, all of which have been sold at good prices. In addition, the purchasing power of farmers has obviously increased, and the sales of various commodities have been more enthusiastic than before. Therefore, since the second half of the year, the market in all industries has shown a prosperous appearance. The most obvious of these is the yarn industry. In recent years, the operation of yarn mills has been restricted by the competition of Japanese yarn and the weakness of rural purchasing power, and they have been on the verge of danger. It is not uncommon for them to stop work and liquidate. Fortunately, since the second half of this year, cotton production has been abundant, with the lowest estimate reaching more than 14 million dan. The supply has been sufficient, and the price has not risen sharply. At the same time, the sales of cotton yarn have greatly increased, and the purchase in the mainland has increased by more than 22% compared to previous years (the transaction volume of spot yarn in Shanghai this year was more than 370,000 bales), which has led to the price of yarn rising day by day, with an increase of tens of yuan per month, and the profit of each package of 20 count yarn in the yarn mill has often reached 40 or 50 yuan, which is the best situation that has not been experienced since the European War. Those who were on the verge of death can now turn around freely, which is thanks to the rise in yarn prices and the surge in yarn sales. The cloth industry feels the same prosperity as the yarn industry. Since the second half of the year, sales have risen sharply and prices have soared. For a time, cloth factories and cloth shops were almost unable to meet the market demand. The prosperity was also unprecedented in the past. The other industries, such as the flour industry, the hardware industry, the match industry, the rubber industry, the miscellaneous grain industry, the pawnshop industry, the sugar industry, the north-south goods industry, the shipping industry, the paper industry, the silk industry, etc., have all made profits, which is much better than the operation in previous years. The reason for this is that it is all due to the rise in prices.

Why did the prices in our country suddenly rise at the same time in this period? The obvious reason is that overseas prices are also in the process of rising. This has been seen since the 22nd year of the Republic of China, except for some gold standard countries. However, before the currency system reform in our country, although overseas prices rose, the price of silver also rose. Since our country used silver as the currency standard, the two offset each other, and it was impossible to raise the prices in our country. After the currency system reform in our country, the exchange rate was stable and was no longer affected by the rise and fall of silver prices, so domestic and overseas prices became related. Since the second half of last year, either because the United States suffered a drought, resulting in a sharp decrease in grain supply, or because the stagnant goods of various surplus commodities have gradually been cleared, or because countries are intensifying their rearmament, the prices of various commodities overseas have risen enthusiastically. Since France stopped the gold standard, the trend has been even more unstoppable, so the prices in our country have also risen with it. However, the price increase in our country in one year has reached 15%, which is faster than the price increase in the same period in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Japan, second only to France, which stopped the gold standard not long ago (the price increase in France in this period reached about 47%). It can be seen that the reason for the price increase in our country, in addition to the rise in overseas prices, there are other factors that contribute to the price increase. (To be continued)

### Visiting the World Encyclopedia Exhibition

— Ya Fei

Yesterday, with an excited heart, I went alone to Ferguson Road and visited the encyclopedias of various countries at the International Community Center.

In these few days, on that Ferguson Road, which is full of a strong cultural atmosphere, although it is so remote and vast, the people who came to visit the World Encyclopedia Exhibition were still too crowded; especially at the entrance of the International Library, there were many decent people coming and going. In the exhibition room, there were more than 500 kinds of encyclopedias on display, a total of more than 2,000 volumes; its scope is divided into: ㊀ General Encyclopedias, ㊁ Various Encyclopedias. ㊂ Chinese General Reference Books, ㊃ Chinese Various Dictionaries, etc. The exhibition used a library classification method, so it was easier to understand when visiting. Among them, there are more than 200 kinds of Chinese, more than 100 kinds of Japanese, and nearly 200 kinds of Western languages; including Chinese, English, German, French, Japanese, Russian and other countries. In short, the books in this exhibition cover a wide range of content and have everything. Who says it is not appropriate to call it an encyclopedia?

There are also 20 libraries that participated in this solicitation. In addition to the Shanghai City, Customs, and China International Library, the libraries of various universities, academic institutions, and bookstores also participated.

In addition, we also saw the plaster statue of Mr. Ji Xiaolan, a great writer of our country, in the exhibition room. Moreover, many of Mr. Ji's posthumous works and his belongings during his lifetime are displayed in front of him. On the other side is the plaster statue of French writer Diderot. As for the significance of displaying these two writers here for people to admire, it is because the Siku Quanshu was mainly edited by Mr. Ji Xiaolan, and the French Encyclopedia was compiled by Diderot. The two are the creators of the two major encyclopedias, and their contribution to the cultural world is really very great, so now displaying the two at the same time here certainly has a commemorative meaning.

The conference opened on April 15 and closed on April 12. It was open to the public for a week, and tickets were sold for only five cents.

After visiting various encyclopedias inside, I also took a look at the publishing process exhibition attached to the China Library School. This also gave people a lot of enlightenment and understanding in the modern publishing industry.

Rambling Talk

### Please Try It Record

— Zhang Huang

What is recorded here is limited to the small experiences that can be used when the human body occasionally feels uncomfortable in daily life. It does not prescribe prescriptions or pills. It is harmless to people. Please try it to see if it works.

Foot Numbness: If you squat for a long time or sleep soundly, your feet will often suddenly become numb, commonly known as "muscle strain". That local short-term numbness, like sour but not sour, like itchy but not itchy, and it is very uncomfortable and tiring to shake it a little! Everyone has had a full experience of this, and most people can only let it develop naturally. Tell you: At this time, quickly press and write the two characters "木" (wood) and "瓜" (melon) on the inside of your knee like drawing a talisman, writing hard in overlapping strokes, and you will be guaranteed to restore the normal state of your feet in the shortest possible time. This is not a magic talisman, but a trick, because the strokes of the two characters "木" (wood) and "瓜" (melon) mostly go downwards and are scattered in all directions, which can help the blood flow downwards; and also because the strokes are simple and easy to write.

Dust in the Eyes: People who are covered in dust often suffer from flying sand in their eyes. Even if they live quietly indoors, this encounter is inevitable. When ordinary people feel that there is dust or small objects in their eyes, they always quickly raise their hands to squeeze and rub, wanting to get rid of the uncomfortable feeling. Who knows that the more the eyes are squeezed and rubbed, the more they feel that there is something accumulating in them, and not only are they still uncomfortable, but they also add a lot of tears. Therefore, when you encounter a small object in your eyes, first, don't squeeze and rub it. I will teach you to put on a statutory grimace. The method is: open the affected eye, close the other one; at the same time, stuff your index fingers tightly into your ears, and press your thumbs against your nostrils; then, spit out a few mouthfuls of sputum or saliva, or it may be virtual, taking its air-part of the vibration force. Block other organs that can vent air, and use the force of spitting to knock the dust down to a place under the eye cavity that does not hinder the foundation. This was invented by drivers.

Choking: If you swallow food too quickly, it will stagnate in the throat below the chest and refuse to slide down for a while, making people feel bloated and uncomfortable, or if you swallow it improperly, it will cause air to enter and hiccups. These are not only unpleasant to feel, but also should be remedied because of choking. Some people say: Raise your own rice bowl and place it on top of your head, and tap the edge of the bowl three times with your chopsticks, which can make the food stuck in the chest sink and digest immediately. This method is both troublesome and dangerous, and it is not effective. One day, I was dining with a friend, and when he saw me suddenly stop eating and put down my chopsticks because I was choking, he taught me a method: tilt your head back as much as possible, and at the same time clench your fists and repeatedly knock on the spine under the Gaohuang acupoint. Once made in accordance with the law, the food blocking the upper jiao will loosen and digest very quickly, and you will feel as if a heavy burden has been lifted.

### The Second Child

— Master Shenshizhai

I am now a father of two children.

Although the children are all my children, the two children are obviously different. The eldest child is five years old this year, and his physique is weak. He often falls when he walks. His face is very yellow and he is not energetic enough. The second child was born last year, and his spirit is very lively, without any morbid state, and he can walk very steadily. Seeing that the eldest son is so underdeveloped, I am pessimistic about his future! Seeing the second son's healthy physique, I feel happy and comforted in my heart, and I feel that this is the performance of the new children of the new China.

The upbringing of these two sons can be said to be exactly the same, but the second child has been eating "Jiale Calcium" chocolate candy from Wuzhou Pharmacy every day from last year to now. This candy contains calcium and vitamin D, which can strengthen bones and teeth. The development of the second child is particularly fast, probably because of this.

### The Dual Difficulties of the Silk Industry

— Naiyi

Amid the rising tide of labor disputes in Shanghai's silk weaving industry, we saw news in the newspapers that the All-Zhejiang Public Association was petitioning the Zhejiang Provincial Government to relieve the panic of mulberry leaves. The petition said: "Our Zhejiang has always been a prosperous area for sericulture. Since the overseas silk prices have plummeted, silkworm farmers regard raising silkworms as a difficult path and no longer pay attention to planting mulberry trees, allowing them to be barren and not cultivating them. The good mulberry forests are gradually becoming barren." This is because "After years of failure, the interest in raising silkworms is not strong, and the supply and demand of silkworm leaves can still be adapted." Once "suddenly jumping forward", it is "inevitable to cause a lack of panic in a leaf-eating peak season", resulting in "soaring leaf prices, making it impossible to make ends meet, and the future of silkworm farming is very uneasy."

"Our Zhejiang has always been a prosperous area for sericulture". In theory, the "supply and demand of silkworm leaves" should be no problem. However, "since the overseas silk prices plummeted", "silkworm farmers regard raising silkworms as a difficult path". Since it has become a "difficult path", it will naturally "be barren and no longer pay attention to planting mulberry trees." However, after "gradually becoming barren", once the silk industry gradually improves (whether this phenomenon will last is another question), it is "inevitable to cause a lack of panic". Then it feels that "allowing it to be barren" is really not right. But what can be done about this? The silkworm farmers have "regarded raising silkworms as a difficult path" before, and they must not be asked to plant mulberry trees on an empty stomach!

However, now it is "the silk industry is showing a little vitality", and it is said that "the market is gradually turning". Therefore, "to fundamentally seek to revitalize the sericulture industry, we must first promote mulberry planting, and especially rely on excellent mulberry seedlings, so that they can be easily prosperous." This kind of "fundamental" method is very correct as the first step to "revitalize the sericulture industry".

However, please forgive my "spoiling the fun": What if the "silkworm farmers regard raising silkworms as a difficult path" again? There was originally enough supply and demand, but now it is not also "gradually becoming barren"?

This seems to be "worrying about the sky", and I hope it is worrying about the sky. However, it is also a fact that the power of life and death of China's national industry is in the hands of foreigners: "The plummeting of overseas silk prices" can make "Our Zhejiang", which "has always been a prosperous area for sericulture," become "a good mulberry forest, gradually becoming barren." In recent years, the rise of rayon has dealt a major blow to the sericulture industry.

With the rise of rayon, our pitiful tariff barrier has originally set down the rules that "the import tax on rayon is 60% of the value, and the import tax on woven products is 80% of the value". However, "the price of each box of goods used to be 500 yuan, but now it has fallen to 150 yuan." The price of this silkworm silk is naturally much lighter. However, leaving the sericulture industry aside, let our silk weaving industry weave rayon. It can also lose money. Originally, rayon is taxed according to quantity, "and because of the quantity, the tariff still has to be paid 290 yuan." Adding it up, the cost of the raw materials becomes 440 yuan, while the tax on woven foreign silk made from 150 yuan of raw materials plus 120 yuan of woven product tax totals only 270 yuan. The difference between them is 170 yuan per box. Adding the "10% profit" of the handlers, the difference is naturally even greater.

The rise of rayon, viewed from a progressive perspective, is really what it should be. Isn't it natural to abandon gas lamps when there are electric lights? Then, it is also very natural for general merchants to "use its cheap and good quality to easily attract customers and compete to promote it as a sacrificial product". However, "Foreign silk can be dumped, and if we do not think about seeking remedies, then when the flood comes, we will ask for domestic silk in the dried fish shop". Is it possible for people with a heart to witness the overflow of this "flood"?

The sericulture industry has to break a bloody path out of such dual difficulties. —— The answer, then, can only be waited for by experts.

### The Jiangbei Woman Crushing Stones

— Laoxin

——Dedicated to the Faraway Ming——

Lazybones: It's been a while since I last wrote to you. Don't think I've picked up your lazy habit, just staring blankly, anxiously waiting for others' letters, and finding joy in it. I'm not like that, rest assured. There's a reason I couldn't write: it's nothing much, just sickness.

I'm not a very good "patient," always impatient with illness. Getting anxious naturally makes the illness act up, preventing you from getting better. But the main reason is probably not being able to let the family go hungry because of the illness, right? So, I had to keep working while being sick. That's why this little illness has dragged on for so long. Enduring these days may have some value because, for this reason, I've been paying more attention to ordinary things these past few days. Now, let me lie in bed and write a little about this!

You know how I usually am, walking like a whirlwind, rushing around. Anything on the road just flashes before my eyes and slips away, leaving nothing in my mind. These past two days have been different. Every morning, I have to walk for more than twenty minutes to get to the cheapest free clinic, where I offer my illness for others to experiment on. On the way, with my current health, I can only walk slowly because if I speed up even a little, my head starts to ache terribly. Of course, walking slowly has its advantages, because I've started to notice the most ordinary things in every corner of the road.

Today, as I passed a construction site on barren land, I became interested in the liveliness of the place and stopped to gaze at this virgin land being developed.

There were many women working patiently on the barren land. Their attire is probably familiar even to those who have never been to the north. You probably remember that in our hometown, at certain times, there were many refugee women speaking dialects that we Southerners couldn't understand. They wrapped their dust-covered heads in tattered cloths, wore old, short blue jackets (partially faded to white by the sun), and short, narrow trousers, easily revealing their bound feet. They all bared their chests, with a pair of withered breasts and a skinny, monkey-like child in front. Around them, as you also said, were boys and girls from who-knows-where, five or six in total. They begged silently, and their begging skills once shocked you and me when we were eating grain husks. Sometimes, there were one or two starved strong men with them, shouting rudely and miserably, "Masters, have pity on us poor performers!"

You haven't forgotten, have you, the cruel tragedy we witnessed on Guanyin Mountain, where some authoritative figures harshly and ruthlessly drove them away? Afterward, we both sighed about it. Now, my friend, I tell you, they have work here now; the work is crushing stones with soft hammers with small rattan handles.

I stood there for a long time, seemingly very happy to see these long-forgotten, abandoned people of society, and to relive our old dreams from that time. But, my friend, I should tell you even sooner that I understand them better now.

You see, although their clothes are similar to what we saw in the South back then, I can tell from the degree of color fading that they were very happy people not long ago! Two or three of the younger ones still have an unnatural, shy look, avoiding the eyes of me and other passersby who are standing there watching foolishly. The unfortunate mothers carrying children on their backs, while their hands are hammering the tough bricks, their pretty faces look somewhat awkwardly at their own exposed breasts and the tender milk for their children. They are not yet fully accustomed to this kind of life. But, this is already a kind of happiness for them.

### Listening to Xiao Rehun (Little Hothead)

— Liu Ziming

—Rural Notes

Returning to the countryside, I can't help but take the time to visit the temple. It's like the City God Temple in Shanghai; it's more appropriate to call it a market than a temple. In the morning, it also serves as a small vegetable market. In the afternoon, various stalls open under their fixed eaves: there are sock stalls, small bookstores, various household goods, food, and sweets, everything you could want. These stallholders all pay a considerable rent to the temple. In the open space in front of the main hall, there are no designated boundaries; whoever arrives early and pays a small fee to the temple keeper can secure the best spot. Among them is a sugar seller named Xiao Rehun, who is the most popular. Because he is the most popular, he always occupies the best spot in front of the main hall; even if he arrives a little late, no one tries to snatch it. Because of him, people come to the temple, and all the stallholders seem to rely on his "Rehun" to bring in business. Just ask anyone going to the

## Page 18

temple, and they'll say, "Going to the temple to listen to Xiao Rehun." Whether they really want to buy something, they can't miss listening to Xiao Rehun.

As soon as he arrives at the temple, he is immediately surrounded by a large crowd. "Rehun" has replaced his name; the old listeners (also the old buyers) all say one after another, "Rehun, sing 'Country Girl Flirting'," "Little Widow Visiting the Grave must be sung today." Rehun always calmly stands on a bench, answering, "All of them, all of them!" while tapping the ruler.

This is the opening act. After tapping the ruler for a while, he doesn't immediately sing the main song; instead, he chats with the listeners about the news on the ground – he's the most well-informed about these matters. Gambling bust at Zhuangyuan Lou, the wife of the sweet potato seller stealing someone, etc. He speaks with such authority, as if he saw it with his own eyes. He also has no reservations, joking and laughing as he pleases, dragging on for a long time until the people who called him to sing "Country Girl Flirting" or "Little Widow Visiting the Grave" before, he pretends to have forgotten and gives everyone a military salute, expressing his apology. Then, amidst a burst of laughter, he opens the box of sweets, reciting two old lines, "Sell two pieces of Bai Cao pear paste candy, then sing about the country girl flirting."

Everyone knows he's going to play this trick. Before he even opens the candy wrappers, coins are already being tossed up. He's really skilled at this; one hand catches the tossed coins, and the other hand immediately throws the pear paste candy to that person. He never misses. He also speaks according to the person: seeing an old man, he sings, "Old man, eat my pear paste candy, and your fallen teeth will regrow." Seeing a child, he sings, "Little brother, eat my pear paste candy, and you'll read smoothly." If there's a slick-haired woman in the crowd, he'll be impolitely singing out any kind of vulgar language. And the listeners welcome these words the most. In this way, he sells one package of candy after another.

When it comes to singing the main song "Country Girl Flirting," he deliberately stops halfway and reminds people, "The sun sets in the west, and your wife is waiting for you to buy a pair of foreign socks to bring home," taking turns advertising for those stallholders.

His popularity probably comes from understanding the secret to doing business.

This time at the temple, I naturally walked to his circle first. Now he has a partner. When I walked up, they were singing "Bao Longtu Catches a Live ×× Person." This thing was invented by a one-man show in Shanghai. I didn't know they would secretly steal it. Sure enough, it's also very popular. After singing the play, he naturally sells sugar again, and the partner deliberately pretends to be a customer, asking if it's made with ×× sugar, and we don't want smuggled goods! So he imitates the tone of ×× people, "My sugar is very good, no price increase, no reduction, selling ×× sugar will make you childless and grandsonless!"

When closing the stall, he announces that tomorrow he will sing "×× People Eating Bombs!" Amidst a round of applause, he gives another military salute.

Gentlemen of integrity originally despise Xiao Rehun because he sings obscene songs and lyrics. Like in Shanghai, many performances have been banned on the radio. However, they are the "deeply rooted in the people" art. Their power is not necessarily smaller than "slogans" and those official "speeches." Didn't "Catching Live ×× People" also be banned from performance in the amusement park? This really makes people speechless.

It's a pity I can't stay in the countryside for long. In that piece of my own land, I really want to listen to "Xiao Rehun" every day.
