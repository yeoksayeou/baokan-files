[Nanjing] The newly appointed Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui attended the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 8th and then returned to his official residence. At 10:15 AM, Vice Ministers Xu Mo and Chen Jie arrived at his residence to escort him to the ministry to assume his duties. Mr. Wang went to the minister's office for a brief rest, and at 10:25 AM, he convened all ministry staff in the main auditorium for the weekly memorial service, leading the ceremony as usual. He then addressed all ministry staff, concluding at 10:45 AM. In the minister's office, he met with senior ministry officials in batches, offering words of encouragement. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, he met with news reporters in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reception room. Over thirty Chinese and foreign reporters were present. Minister Wang was amiable in his manner and sincere in his remarks. Finally, he cordially inquired whether any reporters had questions. The Chinese and foreign reporters all believed that Minister Wang's speech had clearly elucidated China's foreign policy and offered their thanks before departing. Minister Wang's address to the ministry staff and his remarks to the reporters were as follows:

▲ Address to Ministry Staff: Colleagues, former Minister Zhang resolutely resigned, and the government, appreciating his hard work, has granted his request and decided to have me succeed him. Former Minister Zhang has worked exceptionally hard over the past year amidst various difficult circumstances and has lived up to the expectations of the central government and the people. I deeply admire him. Although former Minister Zhang has now left this ministry, fortunately, he is still in Nanjing. He will continue to provide assistance from the sidelines based on his initial intentions of caring for this ministry. We should work together with one heart to serve the country. The meaning of the English term "Ship of State" lies in this. The nation is like a ship. The ship's mission is to brave the wind and waves to reach a predetermined destination. However, the ship itself cannot move. Therefore, to accomplish this mission, two conditions must be met: first, there must be a correct direction of travel, and second, those who operate the ship must each fulfill their duties and work together with one heart. With a correct direction, we can avoid straying onto the wrong path and avert danger. With the efforts of everyone, we can proceed quickly and ultimately reach our destination. National politics is also like this. Therefore, we who serve in the government must also adhere to the policies set by the central government and work together with one heart to overcome all difficulties to achieve the highest goals of the nation. I am assuming the responsibility of foreign affairs this time with this intention in mind. I am willing to work with my colleagues to further enhance the spirit of past efforts under the government's established policies, without shirking responsibility, without perfunctoriness, without fear of difficulties, and with harmony and unity, to move forward courageously in order to accomplish our mission.

▲ Remarks to Reporters: In modern times, the closeness of international relations is far greater than in the past. Without international cooperation, it is impossible to seek the prosperity of all nations and ensure world peace. To promote international cooperation, we must pay attention to the feelings of the people. Anything that hinders goodwill between the two sides should be diligently resolved or prevented first. Cooperation between nations must begin with sincere feelings, which then generates the desire for cooperation, and from the desire for cooperation arises the fact of cooperation. International cooperation must go through such stages to be successful. Our country's foreign policy has been repeatedly clarified by the central government and President Jiang. The integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty must be preserved. International relations must be based on equality and mutual benefit. Under these principles, we should strive to increase friendship through peaceful means. All political coordination and economic cooperation must be based on the principle of mutual benefit to seek closer mutual relations. This is the most reasonable principle of international negotiation and the established foreign policy of our government. I deeply feel the great responsibility upon assuming the responsibility of foreign affairs this time. I will certainly adhere to this intention, proceed diligently according to international justice and the norms of diplomacy, so that the government's established policies can be realized, and Sino-foreign relations can rely on international cooperation to achieve mutually beneficial development.

### Japanese New Foreign Minister Issues Declaration on China Policy

Equality and Spirit of Coordination, Striving to Break the Sino-Japanese Stalemate

[Tokyo] During a meeting of the House of Peers this morning, Viscount Okouchi, a member of the House of Peers, raised a question regarding foreign policy. Foreign Minister Sato answered, lasting 35 minutes. This was the Foreign Minister's first formal declaration on foreign policy since taking office, and all parties attached great importance to it. Although Sato lacks sufficient experience in domestic politics, his thinking and attitude have left a good impression due to his long exposure and activity on the international stage. This can be seen from the enthusiastic applause he received in the meeting place at the end of his speech. Sato said in his answer that a country's diplomacy should have its continuity, but circumstances often change, so it goes without saying that it is necessary to fully review the policies adopted by the previous cabinet. It is most important to find ways to change everything that is unsuitable for the current situation. Sato continued that one should not forget the other party in diplomacy. Although this statement seems ordinary on the surface, it is actually very meaningful. He also said that when domestic public opinion is extremely agitated and our country is dominated by strong opinions, this shortcoming of forgetting the other party can occur. That is, it is generally believed that no matter what our demands are, in what way they are made, or to what extent they reach, if they can be put forward in a tough manner, they will surely be fulfilled. However, the other party also has its own public opinion and often cannot accept our demands. This point is completely ignored by the general public. Therefore, temporary stagnation in diplomacy is unavoidable. This statement has a rather stern warning effect.

Regarding Anglo-Japanese diplomacy, Sato said that as far as he knows, after the Manchurian Incident, Britain believed that Japan's actions were limited to the north of the Great Wall. However, when Japan crossed the Great Wall and entered North China to carry out various activities, Britain became extremely worried that Japan's behavior might infringe on Britain's interests in North China, Central China, and even South China if it was not paid attention to. As for the North China issue, Japan's attitude has been clearly stated by the Prime Minister. I firmly believe that if we respect the interests of the other party and seek the peaceful development of China without antagonizing others, we can gain the understanding of other countries. This is the real way to protect Japan's interests. Sato's remarks were something that previous foreign ministers, from the scorched-earth diplomacy era to the concord diplomacy era, did not dare to say.

Sato then discussed diplomacy towards China, saying that it is undeniable that Sino-Japanese negotiations have reached a stalemate. However, I cannot endorse the claim that the negotiations have failed without any doubt. The current situation can only be regarded as an unfortunate moment that has caused the greatest difficulty. But what kind of policy should be adopted to break the stalemate is a very big problem. Especially after the Manchurian Incident, the disputes over many difficult events have reached their peak. If I can speak frankly, the current Sino-Japanese problem can only be solved if we change our approach and start from a new starting point. Negotiations between fully independent countries should be based on equal footing. This is the normal path of international relations and there is nothing surprising about it. However, this natural principle is often forgotten. In some cases, especially in the relationship between nationals, we often hesitate to adopt an equal footing and assume a superior position. This superior concept often causes great obstacles in international relations. After Sato put forward abstract fundamental principles to warn the people of the country, he entered into a concrete discussion and asked: In Sino-Japanese negotiations and events between the people of the two countries, have we ever proceeded on an equal footing? This question is left entirely for you to answer yourself, but I believe that everything in the past should be left to flow eastward, and negotiations should be conducted from a new perspective with equal footing. This is not a special concession to China's demands, nor is it a special response. China often accuses Japan of not granting equal relations and demands that all negotiations should be based on equal footing, etc. If China is not satisfied with this point, I believe that there will often be obstacles in the smooth progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations. Regarding this level, I believe that the concept of equality versus inequality should be abandoned, and instead, a heart-to-heart attitude should be adopted to fully consider China's demands and the rights that are closely related to China. At the same time, the interests that are closely related to Japan should also be explained sincerely. We are willing to maintain the spirit of coordination within the scope of not sacrificing the interests that are closely related to Japan and resuming negotiations based on equal footing. Although it is not known how China will react to this, if they are determined, Japan will undoubtedly provide various conveniences, even changing the content of past negotiations.

Sato's above-mentioned declaration on diplomacy towards China has not been heard in practice since Kijūrō Shidehara. In the current situation, it sounds like a lone voice in an empty valley. Although it remains doubtful whether Sato can cope with concrete problems according to such fundamental beliefs and overcome the difficulties within Japan when implementing them, judging from Sato's basic approach to China, it is indeed more progressive than Kōki Hirota and Hachirō Arita. It is heard that the army is deeply concerned that Sato's speech may cause China to adopt a tough attitude and expresses deep concern about China's possible reaction.

### The Executive Yuan Concerned with the Appointment and Dismissal of Civil Servants

Instructions on Points to Note　Circular to All Provinces and Cities for Compliance

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan believes that the state establishes official positions to select and employ capable individuals to jointly manage governance. In recent years, the government has revised and supplemented various regulations on the appointment of civil servants, originally hoping that the promotion of personnel administration would be beneficial, personnel appointments would follow the correct path, and abuses could be eliminated. However, it has been found that many administrative personnel in various provinces and cities are still not appointed according to the law, and the documents submitted by the provincial and municipal governments for the appointment and dismissal of personnel often lack clear descriptions and have erroneous procedures. In order to rectify personnel administration and improve efficiency, the Executive Yuan has specially provided the following points to note and issued a circular for strict compliance: ㊀ When various agencies submit applications or requests for personnel to be appointed at the recommended or simplified level, there should be a basis in the organizational regulations. These organizational regulations are limited to those that have been clearly promulgated by the National Government or approved for record-keeping. ㊁ If current personnel in various agencies hold positions that, according to organizational regulations, are at the recommended or simplified level but have not yet completed the procedures for recommendation or request for simplification, they should immediately handle them in accordance with laws and regulations to await official appointment. ㊂ Once simplified or recommended personnel who have been officially appointed by the National Government leave their posts, the responsible supervisor should immediately select qualified personnel to act as agents and, at the same time, submit a request to dismiss the departing personnel, along with the review form for the appointment of the proposed personnel and supporting documents, for recommendation or request for simplification to comply with legal procedures. ㊃ If the original personnel have already left their posts, and there is not enough time to select qualified personnel to succeed them, a special request should first be submitted to dismiss the departing personnel. ㊄ The reason for the departure of the departing personnel, whether it is a request to leave, another appointment, awaiting another appointment, or dismissal, should be stated separately to allow for official announcements and provide a basis. In the event that the original personnel leave due to illness, a request for record-keeping should also be submitted at any time. ㊅ In addition to following the Civil Servant Appointment Law and its Implementation Rules when recommending or requesting simplified appointment of proposed personnel, if there are separate regulations for the appointment procedure, those separate regulations should also be followed.

The Third Plenary Session lasted only a few days, and it was not possible to discuss and study all the proposals in detail within these few days. This is not unique to the Third Plenary Session; it has been the case with previous plenary sessions. In addition to deciding on the major issues to be resolved at present, other proposals are submitted to the standing committees for handling. What we should pay attention to now is that these standing committees, after receiving the cases submitted by the plenary session, should take up their responsibilities with all their might, first conducting detailed research and serious discussions, and then implementing them earnestly. If they find that these proposals are incomplete, they should be revised and supplemented. If they find that there is something greatly inappropriate or even difficult to implement, they should also point it out clearly and without hesitation. If it is of great importance, they should reconvene a plenary session to make a new decision. This is not impossible. Because these proposals are the result of months of reflection and accumulation by responsible comrades from various aspects of party affairs, politics, and economics, they should be given great importance. If they are casually shelved, as it was said in the past, imprisoning public affairs or causing them to travel constantly, then not only would it be a disservice to the hard work of the proposers, but it would also be a disservice to the trust of the plenary session. I have thought carefully about the reasons why resolutions are not made and actions are not taken. A comrade said it well: we must treat an unresolved case as a debt on our backs that we have not been able to repay. We should be vigilant at all times to seek repayment; otherwise, we are irresponsible. I would like to encourage myself with this point and share it with all comrades. (Central News Agency, 8th)

[Nanjing] The National Government held a commemorative week at 10:00 AM on the 8th. Attendees included Deng Jia Yan, Jing Hengyi, Li Wenfan, Chen Shuren, Liu Jiwen, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials and staff of the National Government and various ministries and departments, totaling more than 400 people. After leading the ceremony by Chairman Lin, he spoke on "Industrial Planning and National Defense Construction," first stating that the Third Plenary Session concluded last month, and the general guidelines for domestic and foreign policies have been explained in great detail in the conference declaration. We can only strive forward in accordance with the path shown. Next, he mentioned that the Soviet Union, through its efforts in economic construction, not only solved the people's livelihood problems when its five-year plan was completed, but also established a strong national defense for the Soviet Union. Germany, through the arduous struggle of the entire nation, finally broke the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and recently implemented a four-year economic plan. The content of the plan requires the nationalization of the entire industry for national defense, the nationalization of consumption for national defense, and various other economic self-sufficiency measures, which are also national defense plans and national defense construction. He further stated that more than twenty years ago, President Sun Yat-sen recognized that to save China from danger, it was necessary to devote all efforts to economic construction and personally formulated an industrial plan, which was listed as one of the founding strategies. Detailed plans were made for transportation development, heavy industry development, agricultural improvement, and so on. Most of the industrial plan is a plan for developing transportation, especially railways. Over the past ten years, the country has been plagued by internal and external troubles, and this plan has not been implemented accordingly. When we recall the origins of national difficulties, we feel infinite emotions and shame. Finally, he said that summarizing the President's last instructions contains about three points: ㊀ Develop transportation as the foundation for all types of construction. ㊁ Seek the development of heavy industry for peacetime people's application and wartime military industry preparation. ㊂ Develop agriculture to achieve self-sufficiency in food. The purpose is to utilize our country's abundant resources, with the needs of national and ethnic survival as the principle, and seek industrial development. Therefore, the industrial plan is the national defense plan and the basic plan for our country's economic construction. Now that the foundation of unification has been formed, we hope that the entire nation will unite sincerely, support unification, and consolidate unification. Under the leadership of the unified government, we will save on food and clothing, endure hardship, and contribute our minds and bodies to the interests of the nation and ethnicity, engage in economic construction, and complete the important task of saving the nation from extinction.

### Tianjin Korean Commits Murder, Beating a Deaf-Mute Chinese to Death

Four Criminals Flee into the Japanese Concession　We Request the Japanese Police to Arrest the Murderers

[Tianjin] At 5:00 AM on the 8th, in the Weishi Chi Bathhouse on Jianwu Street in the South Market of Tianjin, two deaf-mute Chinese, Chai Yulin and Guo Renzhi, had a dispute and fight with two Koreans over a minor matter. The two deaf-mutes could not speak, and the two Koreans did not understand Chinese. People in the bathhouse could not resolve the situation. One Korean sustained a minor head injury from the beating. Police officers from the Fu'an Street Police Station arrived and took both parties to the Sixth Police Station, which then transferred them to the First Bureau. Because all the police officers in the station went to the police bureau to attend a meeting on the morning of the 8th, only one police officer escorted the four criminals. Unexpectedly, when they arrived in front of the Donghe Residence on Jianwu Street, another Korean suddenly stopped them to inquire and spoke with the two Korean criminals. The four suddenly joined forces to surround and beat Chai and Guo. The police officer was outnumbered and unable to stop them, so he ran back to report to the station. At this time, Chai was stabbed in the lower back with a short knife by one of the Koreans and fell to the ground. Guo was still fighting hard. By the time the police brigade arrived, the four Koreans had fled into the Japanese Concession. Chai was taken to the Municipal Hospital, but he died before he could be treated. Yan Jiaqi, the chief of the First Bureau, received the report and visited Wakui, the head of the Japanese Police Department, to request the arrest of the murderers. Subsequently, the Japanese side sent the head of the Special Affairs Team, Li Yunxiang, to investigate the truth and promised to assist in the arrest of the criminals. Chai's body was collected and buried by his son, Lianke. The police bureau interrogated Guo about the cause of the dispute. Guo could only write his name and address, as well as the fact that Chai was a newspaper vendor, but could not describe the case. (Special Dispatch, 8th)

### The Interior Ministry Plans to Increase Police Salaries

[Nanjing] The Ministry of the Interior believes that in many provinces, cities, and counties, due to financial constraints, the salaries of police officers have not been effectively increased, which may affect the progress of their work. Now that the general budget for local expenditures for the 26th year is being prepared, the salaries of local police officers in all provinces and counties should be increased as much as possible, taking into account the actual situation in each locality, so that they can serve with peace of mind. At the same time, it is hoped that more funds will be raised in order to prepare for performance evaluations, promotions, and salary increases, and it is determined to implement this starting in the 26th year, so as to improve the quality of the police and facilitate the progress of their work. The ministry has recently consulted the provincial and municipal governments for review and requested a report on the handling situation. (Central News Agency, 8th)

Current Commentary

### Necessary Conditions for Promoting Construction Projects

— Du

Since the national crisis has deepened, the country has been in turmoil. People in the government alone have been able to maintain their composure and work diligently. The most remarkable achievement is construction. They have been able to plan comprehensively and promote projects in parallel. For example, the rapid completion of highways in various provinces, the continued construction of unfinished railways, the sudden emergence of grand buildings, and the sequential connection of transportation. All of these demonstrate the ruling authorities' dedication to governance and the technical personnel's diligent service, resulting in such remarkable and polished achievements. Among all the facilities, the most eye-catching is the promotion of the Qiantang River Bridge project, which is a solid proof of the grand development of construction projects. This project is difficult and extraordinary, unlike ordinary projects. In terms of its importance, it can be called the crown of the southeast. There has been no shortage of proposals in the past, but they were afraid of implementation and only became empty promises. Until this decision was made to organize it, many short-sighted people said that the situation was restrictive and that it might not be possible. Even after the construction began, it progressed smoothly. However, those who were good at spreading pessimism were still deeply suspicious, believing that completion was impossible. This shows that the matter was not easy to handle. Yesterday, Mao Yisheng, who presided over the project, clearly told people that all the bridge piers could be completed by the end of June, and the completion ceremony would be held on Double Ten Festival. At the same time, it was learned that the direct traffic between Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo and the joint transportation of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Guangdong three lines would all be completed on that day. With such a grand plan, one can see its completion in a fixed time. It not only spreads the reputation of the project itself, but also benefits the local people. What it shows to the world is to build a stable foundation for the political situation and give the public a good impression. Those who used to doubt the government's affairs and liked to be circuitous and frustrating may now be able to refresh their eyes and change their views. It is a move that has multiple meanings. All those who care about national affairs cannot help but be excited and encouraged when they hear the news of the imminent completion of this bridge.

I have always believed that there are necessary conditions for promoting all construction projects: fixed funding, selecting talent, balanced development, and strict control. Funding is the first step in all measures and the master of promoting the project. Once it is designated, it should be carefully kept and never be misappropriated, so as not to hinder the original purpose. The selection of talent is very difficult. Not only should knowledge and ability be considered, but also the person's private morality and character must be carefully noted. They must have the determination to be responsible and no intention to be obscured. Then, the progress will be faster. As for one thing to be done, it cannot be done by one person. It is necessary to divide the work and cooperate. Without the authority to control clearly, there will be a lot of blame and push. Only the faithful are discouraged, and the cunning are happy. The host must be equipped with Zhou Za to make balanced development. If the management aspect seems unimportant, it is actually closely related. The general project can be completed according to the type, and the predetermined deadline may not be different. However, whether the actual work is in full compliance and whether the materials used meet the requirements, it is difficult to suspend and obtain without personal experience. If the following can do things to be able to change the rate of Mengfu, and on the lack of strict knowledge of discrimination, then the results of stealing work and reducing materials, some future troubles are unimaginable. Show the consistent essence and energy, and prevent the hidden worries of the future. It is the responsibility of the project manager that is not allowed to be relaxed. Touched by the chords, because of the general theory, it will promote the attention of the Qiantang River Bridge workers.

### Japanese Diplomatic Hub Adjusts Relations with China

Seeking Fundamental Solutions to All Problems　Maintaining Close Liaison between the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs　Summoning Kawagoe Back to Consult Soon

[Tokyo] When Japanese Foreign Minister Sato visited the Ise Grand Shrine, many journalists accompanied him. Therefore, this morning, various newspapers here published lengthy reports describing the policies that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to follow in the future. It is generally believed that this was Foreign Minister Sato's informal conversation with reporters in the car. The following is a summary of the main points: According to the views of the new diplomatic authorities, the fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese problem is the hub of Japan's future diplomacy. The success or failure of adjusting relations with China will not only have a serious impact on Japan's relations with the Soviet Union, but also on the United Kingdom and the United States. As for the so-called Pacific problem and disarmament problem, they are inseparable from the problem with China. If Sino-Japanese relations can be adjusted, the friction between Japan and other powers can be greatly reduced, and Japan's credibility can also be improved. Regarding the three-minister conference of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs adopted by the previous cabinet, it will continue to be held to study the basic policies toward China. This conference will be held at least once a week. Foreign Minister Sato will try to exchange opinions with Army Minister Sugiyama Gen and Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa on issues such as the United Kingdom, the United States, China, the promotion of the Japan-Germany Anti-Communist Pact, and disarmament and commerce. In addition, it is planned to convene meetings of the responsible persons of the three provinces of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs from time to time, with the Foreign Minister as the center, to draft concrete plans.

The newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister has now taken office, giving Japan a good opportunity to change its diplomacy toward China. For this reason, it is planned to instruct Ambassador to China Kawagoe to return to the country to jointly review China policies with the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs. As for the issues mentioned by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, such as the abolition of consular jurisdiction and unequal treaties, Japan, in view of past experience, will deal with them with a sympathetic attitude, but it must be based on the premise of the completeness of Chinese legislation. When reporters inquired about the above news, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that he could not confirm whether it was published by the Foreign Minister, but to his knowledge, many journalists did accompany the Foreign Minister on his weekend trip.

### Japan's Huge Budget Plan Passed by the House of Representatives

[Tokyo] The General Assembly of the House of Representatives met at 1:00 PM. Because today was the date for the formal submission of the budget plan for the twelfth year of Showa, there were no empty seats in the auditorium, and there was almost no room to stand in the gallery. The members of the Cabinet, starting with Prime Minister Hayashi, were all present, showing a tense atmosphere. At 1:15 PM, Chairman Tomita announced the opening of the meeting, and the deliberations began immediately. First, the government submitted the following two proposals: ㊀ The general budget plan for the income and expenditure for the twelfth year of Showa, and the budget plan for the income and expenditure for various special accounts for the twelfth year of Showa. ㊁ Matters that should be borne by the national treasury outside the budget and that require the conclusion of a contract.

The chairman instructed Chairman Koyama to report on the process and results of the Budget Committee.

During the final discussion of the Budget General Assembly, Kanie Kanichiro of the Social Masses Party and Yutani Yoshinuma of the Toho Association advocated the return of the budget, but the outcome was the approval of the general budget plan with the accompanying resolution of the political, civil, and Showa parties.

The whole room burst into applause. After the report was completed, the discussion began immediately. First, Tetsuji Katayama (Social Masses Party), who advocated the return of the budget, took the stage and mentioned the following items:

㊀ The increase in military expenditure was acknowledged as inevitable. ㊁ The stability of the national life was neglected in favor of narrow national defense. ㊂ This budget originated from the financial capital's dominance. Due to the above three situations, he advocated the return of the budget and listed the arguments for detailed review. He believed that the essence of the Yuki finance was the industrial dominance of financial capital, and the amendment of the Bank of Japan Ordinance was a clear proof of this. There was no way to stabilize the national life except to break the profitable industries. From the above viewpoint, he advocated compiling this budget separately. Next, Masaken Katsuno of the Minseito Party took the stage and expressed his support, saying, "This budget is a modification of the legacy of the Baba finance. It is really unsatisfactory in terms of national policy. In view of the current internal and external situation, it is inevitable to support this case." He will give the following warnings here:

㊀ If this budget is implemented, there is a risk of a sudden increase in prices and disruption of the stability of people's lives. ㊁ The national burden has increased sharply, so it is most important to ensure that the national life does not experience a sudden shock. ㊂ Efforts should be made to avoid adverse effects on the digestion of huge military expenditures and the preparation of raw materials. Yoshinuma Yutani (Toho Association) said,

The Hayashi Cabinet has greatly distorted the broad sense of national defense and has narrowed it down to an acute angle. The key to national defense should be the comprehensive expansion of military preparations and national life, but the Hayashi Cabinet's policy has not taken this into account. He went on to say that he could not agree with the amendment of the budget at all. As for the regulation of commodity prices, etc., he advocated that it should be in accordance with the Toho Association's theory of rebuilding the national economy. He also said that the local allocation of less than 30 million yuan was inappropriate. Finally, he criticized the evils of political transactions, which he considered to be the enemy of parliamentary politics, and that it was the inferior political means adopted by the military.

Kiroku Okuchi took the stage, read the accompanying resolution, and elaborated on its purpose, expressing his support. Next, Sanjo Nakamura of the Minseito Party talked about his supporting views, saying that he should not be intoxicated with the theories of each person and make irresponsible remarks to oppose the budget, etc.

Shu Toyota (Showa) asked the government to pay attention to the increase in national defense spending and not to cause a limping economy, and also expressed his support.

Benkyo Shiio listed five or more items of the government's political program, saying that there was a lack of intention to realize them. Although we support this budget, we do not necessarily trust the government, so we still hope that the government will pay attention to future measures.

Tetsuya Nonaka (Kokudo Domei) read the National Alliance's wish conditions and also expressed his support.

At this point, the discussion was completed, and a vote was held. Those who agreed stood up. Except for the Social Masses Party and the Toho Association, all the members stood up and unanimously approved. Thus, the large budget of more than 2.81 billion yuan was approved by a majority. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 PM. (Allied Press, 8th)

### Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States Establish Agreements

Abolition of Perpetual Leases

[Tokyo] The Anglo-Japanese Agreement on the removal of British perpetual lease rights has been concluded. However, on the afternoon of the 7th, the government also announced that the Japan-US Agreement on the removal of American perpetual lease rights had also been concluded. (Allied Press, 7th)

[Tokyo] The Special Committee of the Privy Council met this afternoon to review the articles on abolishing all perpetual lease rights of British Overseas Chinese residing in England and concluding an agreement with the United Kingdom to change to ordinary lease or possession of the land. Foreign Minister Sato attended the meeting to clarify the contents of the agreement and report on the process of negotiating this matter with the United Kingdom. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 8th)

### US-Philippines Conference

Broad Scope of Discussions, Not Limited to Business

[Washington] Since Philippine President Quezon arrived in the United States, he has been busy with social engagements for a week. Today, he is taking a short rest to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with various government department committees to discuss Philippine affairs. Tomorrow, Senator Robinson will invite Quezon to lunch, which may also involve political matters, as senators have been paying close attention to Philippine issues recently. Furthermore, the sugar case is also under study in Congress. Democratic Senator King stated today that he supports granting the Philippines preferential treatment in tariffs, similar to Cuba. He also supports the Philippines' request to shorten the term of the autonomous government and achieve early independence. He believes that the current Philippine Independence Act cannot cope with the current environment, resulting in the United States having only obligations but no power, and that the act also hinders Filipinos from finding new markets. He fears that the outcome will inevitably lead to a chaotic situation. As Quezon expressed dissatisfaction with the current Independence Act yesterday, the scope of discussions at tomorrow's government department meeting may not be limited to business matters. The person in charge of handling US-Philippine relations this time is Under Secretary of State Sayre, who has handled reciprocal trade agreement negotiations many times and enjoys President Roosevelt's deep trust. However, whether the meeting will result in a solution that is handled by the government or requires legislative procedures remains a question. (7th National Telegram)

### US Department of Commerce Releases Foreign Trade Report

Both Imports and Exports to China and Japan Increased Last Year

[Washington] The Department of Commerce released a foreign trade report today, stating that in 1936, US exports to major Asian countries were higher than in 1935. Exports to Japan increased by 1%, but the amount of cotton shipped to Japan that year, although reaching 705,000,000 pounds, worth 88,000,000 yuan, decreased by 101,000,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Exports to China increased by 25%, with tobacco, oil, iron, and steel products accounting for the majority, but cotton and automobile sales did not exceed those of the previous year. Exports to the Philippines increased by 15%, with all goods showing increases, and food increasing the most. Imports from Japan increased by 12% last year, with hog bristles, vegetable oil, textiles, various manufactured goods, chemicals, and toys accounting for the majority. Imports from China increased by 16%, with hides, hog bristles, and tung oil all increasing, while tin decreased. Imports from the Philippines increased by 2%, with sugar being the largest category, but coconuts and lard were lower than before. (7th National Telegram)

### British Aircraft Factory Strike Wave Expands

Expansion of Military Program Affected

[London] Several aircraft factories in the country that manufacture government orders have recently experienced labor unrest, with the number of striking workers increasing daily. As a result, the government's expansion of the air force program may be affected and hindered. Currently, the number of striking workers has reached 6,000, with 4,000 belonging to Rolls-Royce and 2,000 being workers at the Fairey factory. Since the start of the government's military expansion program, aircraft factory workers have expressed dissatisfaction with their working conditions and treatment, which are inferior to those of other specialized mechanical workers. They also believe that since the government has issued large numbers of orders and the factories' business is booming, they are demanding wage increases. Therefore, local strikes have already occurred, and recently, the labor unrest has intensified. Union leaders are scheduled to hold several meetings next week. As for the government, it may convene a meeting of union representatives to resolve this issue, which is also possible. (7th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

### Ten Thousand Italian Volunteer Troops Arrive in Spain

German and Russian Military Supplies Arrive Uninterrupted; Violations of Agreements Occur Frequently

[Paris] Various newspapers recently commented on the Spanish Civil War, all stating that a certain country's violations of the non-intervention agreement are occurring frequently. The right-wing newspaper L'Echo de Paris reported, "According to sources, after the international agreement on prohibiting the dispatch of volunteer troops to Spain, signed by the relevant countries, came into effect on the 20th of last month," a batch of Italian troops actually landed at the port of Cadiz in Spain (in the hands of the Nationalist forces) on the 28th of last month. This news is extremely serious and has been confirmed by the authorities of British Gibraltar. According to some sources, the total number of these troops reached 10,000, but other sources say that this number is not entirely reliable. The newspaper L'Action Française published an article by Madame Tabouis, confirming the news she obtained yesterday that 25,000 Italian army personnel are about to set off for Spain, and said, "Although the Italian authorities claim that these troops belong to those sent to the Italian colonies in East Africa, informed sources in Rome all assert that these troops, once formed, will be sent to Spain. In addition, according to news from the Italian port of Venice, a school has now been opened there, specializing in teaching tank driving methods." The well-known journalist Tau Dominic published an article in the newspaper La République, saying, "Italy is now sparing no effort to aid the Spanish Nationalist forces. If the Spanish Nationalist forces win, then the communication lines between France and its African territories will have no security." (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

[London] The diplomatic correspondent of The Manchester Guardian recently published a message stating that the international agreement on prohibiting volunteer troops from joining the Spanish Civil War came into effect on the 20th of last month, but was immediately violated, "because 10,000 Italian soldiers landed in Spain on the 28th of last month and joined the Spanish Nationalist forces." As for Germany and the Soviet Union, since the 20th of last month, no volunteer troops have arrived in Spain, but military supplies from these countries are still being transported into Spain uninterrupted, and have not stopped. In addition, Colonel Rossi of the Italian army (who previously led Italian troops to the Spanish island of Majorca in the Mediterranean) is reportedly still in Spain. Furthermore, the Spanish Nationalist forces have a large number of personnel and sophisticated weaponry, far superior to the government forces. Why have they not yet won a final victory? It seems that the combat capabilities of the German and Italian troops are not very sufficient, or General Franco is relying on his own strength to achieve victory and is unwilling to over-rely on the German and Italian troops. Therefore, he often does not allow them to participate in important military decisions or even in the war. (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

### Plenary Session of the Adjustment Committee

Discussing the Surveillance Plan

[Geneva] The Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee decided yesterday after a ten-hour meeting that March 13th would be the final date for implementing the surveillance plan to stop military equipment and volunteers from entering Spain. At 11:00 a.m. tomorrow, the Non-Intervention Committee will hold a plenary session to finally approve this resolution, and will then consider the detailed report of the Surveillance Plan Subcommittee. This report, approved yesterday, advocates organizing an international office to handle the surveillance plan on behalf of the 27 countries participating in the Non-Intervention Committee. The main point that has not yet been resolved is France's share of 16% of the total implementation cost, amounting to 143,000 pounds in British currency. The German government has so far only agreed to pay 2,000 pounds in foreign currency, with the remainder paid in German marks. Lord Plymouth, chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, declared yesterday that Germany's refusal has jeopardized the entire surveillance plan, because Britain and other countries must have the relevant major powers pay in convertible currency before they are willing to pay their share. The Portuguese government has withdrawn its objection to Soviet ships carrying surveillance personnel to Lisbon. (7th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

### Spanish Rebel Army Attacks Madrid

Advancing in Three Columns; A Major Battle Is Imminent

⊙ Seberna: The Nationalist forces have been preparing to launch a major attack on the capital south of Madrid for many days. Now that the concentration of troops has been completed, they have begun to launch the attack. According to news from Andujar, the Nationalist forces have advanced north of Cordoba in the Bosan Blanco district. Their purpose is obviously the mercury mines of Puerdollano and Almaden. It is believed that there are currently three columns of Nationalist forces advancing towards the trenches held by the government forces. The central column, the strongest in force, is approaching. A major battle is imminent. (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

⊙ Madrid: Our correspondent Laurent reports that the government forces launched several consecutive offensives in the Jarama River area southeast of the capital in the middle of last week, all of which were successful. As a result, the highway from the capital to Valencia is no longer controlled by Nationalist forces' artillery fire. The government forces were most successful in the Pingleon area. The terrain there is rugged and the ravines are connected, but the government forces were still able to advance five kilometers and occupy the strategically important highlands near the railway line. Although the Nationalist forces used artillery and aircraft to bombard fiercely, the government forces had built solid shelters and were therefore unharmed. At this time, the Nationalist forces are concentrating fresh troops in the capital area, reportedly mostly German soldiers. It is expected that they will launch a major offensive on the capital in a matter of days, but due to a lack of gasoline and the concentration point being quite far from the base, the supply of military supplies is quite difficult. In addition, in order to avoid interception by government forces, they often take roundabout routes, so the march is extremely slow. (7th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

⊙ Madrid: The Defense Committee issued a war report stating that the Nationalist forces launched night attacks in the university district in the western suburbs of the capital and the El Bato town in the northwestern suburbs last night, twice, but were repelled by the government forces. In addition, a bridge built by the Nationalist forces on the Manzanares River was also blown up by the government forces. (7th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

### Spanish Rebel Army Detains Foreign Ships

⊙ Gibraltar: The American ship "Springway No. 1" en route to a Spanish port was blocked in the strait by a Spanish Nationalist fishing boat and ordered to sail to Ceuta. The captain refused to comply and sailed quickly to Gibraltar. It is reported that Nationalist warships are now detaining foreign ships every day, mostly from Denmark and Norway, and escorting them to Ceuta, forcing them to unload their cargo before releasing them. At the same time, Moroccan reinforcements are still arriving in Algeciras from Ceuta in an endless stream, with two batches arriving every day. These troops are scheduled to go to the Malaga front line. According to informed sources in the Nationalist forces, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, General Franco, considers the concentrated troops to be insufficient to attack Almeria. It is reported that the government forces have increased heavy support there. (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

### Bombing Incident Occurs on the French-Spanish Border

Suspected to be the Work of Anarchists

⊙ Seber: French border inspectors were checking the passports of passengers on a special train from Paris to Spain today when a bomb suddenly exploded, destroying a carriage. Fortunately, all fifteen passengers were unharmed, but one passenger named Sells disappeared after the bombing. He was later arrested in Perpignan and anarchist documents were found on him, but he vehemently denied any involvement in the bombing. The police have two views on this case: (1) The bomb was intended to protest the Non-Intervention Committee's blockade of the French-Spanish border; (2) The incident was carried out by the Spanish Nationalist forces in order to block traffic between the government forces and France. (7th National News Agency Telegram)

### British Naval Exercises in the Western Mediterranean

Sixty Warships Participate

[London] The Times recently reported that after the British Home Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet held joint exercises yesterday in the Atlantic Ocean off the Strait of Gibraltar, they are now concentrated in the port of Gibraltar. The two fleets have a total of sixty-five warships of various sizes, including seven battleships, two armored cruisers, nine cruisers, two aircraft carriers, and forty-five destroyers. (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)

⊙ Gibraltar: A tragic accident occurred on the British battleship "Hotspur," in which a cable broke, killing one person and injuring several others. At the time, several people on deck were knocked down when one of the ship's iron cables broke. (7th National Telegram)

### Raw Materials Conference

Opened in Geneva Yesterday; No Representatives from Italy or Germany Attended

[Geneva]

As a result of recent speeches by British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, Britain initiated a conference in London to formally study the issue of equal commercial opportunities for all countries in certain raw materials. This conference opened today, with representatives from sixteen countries attending. Sooner or later, it will involve political and economic events. Although Japan, a non-League of Nations member, also has representatives attending, neither Germany nor Italy has sent representatives. Germany has recently complained about its lack of raw materials. Now that a conference is being held to study the issue of raw materials, it is regrettable that no representatives are attending. A total of thirty-seven raw materials are to be considered, of which thirty-two are mostly produced in the British Empire. The famous Swiss economist Stucki has been elected as chairman of the conference. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, will present Britain's views this afternoon. Then, representatives from countries in need of raw materials, such as Japan and Poland, will successively present their views. This conference will probably last only a few days, after which representatives from several countries will draft a report on the various aspects of the raw materials issue and submit it to the next meeting, which is scheduled to be convened in about three months.

### Anniversary of German Troops Entering the Rhineland

Tearing Up the Treaty of Locarno; Explanation of Reasons

[Berlin] Last year on March 7, Hitler announced in the Reichstag the abolition of the Treaty of Locarno and the restoration of German sovereignty in the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River. German troops entered the area on the same day, and a year has passed since then. Garrison troops in various areas of the region held banquets yesterday to celebrate. The local newspapers, under the instruction of the authorities, also published lengthy articles explaining the reasons for abolishing the Treaty of Locarno. They also explained that the German people were uneasy because other European countries were all rearming, so they made many explanations to try to dispel this psychological state. Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave speeches yesterday in Berlin, Hamburg, and Cologne, saying that Germany is now strong enough that no country would dare to attack it. Lieutenant General Yastrow of the General Staff also published an article in a military magazine, stating that the German army's combat capabilities are now increasing daily, and that the defensive fortifications in the Rhineland demilitarized zone are now under construction. He also said that the main reason for Germany's rearmament was the signing of the mutual assistance pact between France and the Soviet Union, which was an obstacle to the establishment of a new Treaty of Locarno.

### New Island Discovered in the Black Sea

▲ TASS News Agency, Siferopol, February 8th: A new island has been discovered in the Black Sea not far from the southwest coast of Crimea.

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Communications has recently noted that the power of broadcasting stations established in various provinces often exceeds 1 kilowatt.

### The Executive Yuan Convened a Meeting to Resolve the Case of Hunan Province Encroaching on Dongting Lake

Representatives of Various Counties in Hubei Province Elected a Petition Delegation

Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the case of Hunan Province encroaching on Dongting Lake to build Tianhu Embankment and proposing to block the four openings of the Yangtze River—Ouchi, Tiaoxian, Songzi, and Taiping—the people of Hubei Province have expressed their opposition. However, those who are determined to encroach are still rushing to build the embankment, which is about 100 miles long and covers a very large area. More than 10,000 workers are building it every day. The base of the embankment has been completed, with a height of more than one meter. At the same time, the surveying of Taiping, Ouchi, and Tiaoxian openings has been completed, and the surveying of Songzi opening is underway. The Executive Yuan has recently issued a strict order to the Hunan Provincial Government to temporarily suspend the construction to avoid escalating disputes, and has scheduled a joint meeting to be held in Nanjing on the 19th of this month, with representatives from the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Industry, the governments of Hunan and Hubei Provinces, and the National Economic Council, to discuss a proper solution. The Hubei Provincial Government has sent Fan Xiji, a member of the Provincial Committee, to attend. The construction of Tianhu Embankment and the blocking of the four openings of the Yangtze River will cause the Yangtze River to change its course, Dongting Lake to move north, and the Xiang and Jiang Rivers to merge. This concerns the entire water conservancy of the Yangtze River basin and is not merely a dispute between the interests of Hunan and Hubei, so it must be handled with caution. Representatives of the fellow-provincial associations of various counties in Hubei Province held a delegation meeting at Jingnan Middle School in Wuchang at 1 PM on the afternoon of the 7th. The meeting was chaired by Shen Zhaonian and resolved several issues: ① To establish the Joint Association of Fellow-Provincial Associations of Various Counties in Hubei Province, with the office located within the Provincial Party Headquarters. ② To elect Yang Jinyu, Yu Qingzhi, Zhang Nanxian, Kong Geng, Fang Benren, Xie Shengkan, Tian Juyuan, Chuan Xiangrong, Chang Chunyuan, Li Shucheng, Zhang Xiaoxu, Zhou Xialing, Li Boren, Su Daoheng, Shen Zhaonian, Chen Dongshan, Chen Laibo, Zeng Shangwu, Liang Ruitang, Deng Tiehan, and Chen Demou, a total of 21 people, to form a delegation. The delegation is scheduled to go to the Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau on the 11th to petition, and Xie Shengkan, Chuan Xiangrong, Tian Juyuan, Su Daoheng, and Chang Chunyuan were tasked with drafting the petition telegram. ③ To organize the Hubei Water Conservancy Association, with the representatives of the delegation serving as organizers. ④ To recommend Xu Guorui, Director of the Jingjiang Dike Construction Bureau, to visit the Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to explain the advantages and disadvantages. ⑤ The temporary expenses for the delegation's activities will be covered by voluntary donations from the representatives of various counties.

### New Discoveries of Song and Yuan Porcelain and Song Bronze Mirrors in Shandong Province

—This can be used to study the burial customs of Song and Yuan Dynasties in Shanxi (present-day Shandong)—

Jinan Dispatch: The road protection police of the Shandong Provincial Automobile Road Administration, currently stationed in western Jinan City for training, recently discovered an ancient tomb while digging trenches near the drill ground for air defense exercises. They found porcelain, bronze mirrors, and other items. The team leader reported this to the Administration, and Liu Xizhong, the Director of the Administration, invited Wang Xiantang, the Director of the Provincial Library, to send personnel for appraisal. The appraisal results determined that the porcelain items were from the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and the bronze mirrors were from the Song Dynasty. They were funerary objects. The Administration prepared a letter and donated the items to the Library for display. The letter and the list of ancient items are recorded below:

The Automobile Road Administration's letter to the Library stated, "According to the report from Wang Fuzhen, the captain of the student brigade of the road protection police of this Administration, while digging trenches near the drill ground for air defense exercises, they unearthed a total of fourteen items, including large and small jars and bronze mirrors. The Shandong Provincial Library was invited to send personnel for appraisal, and it was confirmed that they were ancient artifacts from the Song and Ming Dynasties. A list of the items and how they should be handled is attached for your review. In view of the fact that the bottles and mirrors obtained by the team while digging air defense trenches have been identified by your Library as ancient artifacts from the Song and Ming Dynasties, and that they are related to the cultural heritage of this province, they should be properly preserved for posterity and for research purposes. Therefore, we are donating all fourteen of these ancient artifacts to your Library for display to assist in archaeological research. We hereby request that you accept them for safekeeping and that you provide us with a detailed list of the examination results." The Library replied, "We have received your letter, and we are grateful for your donation of fourteen porcelain jars and bronze mirrors. We have examined them all. Among the twelve pieces of porcelain, one small black porcelain jar is from the Song Dynasty, and the rest are Yuan Dynasty porcelain. One jar with blue and red glaze is a Yuan Dynasty product from Huaiqing Prefecture imitating Jun kiln. It is the most valuable among all the items. All of them are daily necessities, and since they were found in a tomb, they were used as funerary objects. The square mirror is also a Song Dynasty artifact, and the craftsmanship is exquisite. This can be used to study the burial customs of the Song and Yuan Dynasties in Shanxi, which is of great cultural significance. In recent years, due to the high price of ancient artifacts, people often keep them secret after they are discovered. After these ancient artifacts were unearthed, your Administration's road protection team immediately made them available for public appraisal, and Captain Wang Fuzhen submitted all the items to your Administration. This is a testament to your selfless dedication and commendable training and use of personnel. We are grateful for your kindness in allowing our Library to display them publicly, which is a blessing for the cultural heritage and a glory for the art community. We are extremely grateful for your generous gift. In addition to labeling and decorating them separately, we will display them immediately. We hereby express our sincere gratitude and request your inspection."

List of ancient items: one small black porcelain jar from the Song Dynasty, two black porcelain jars from the Yuan Dynasty, five white porcelain jars (unspecified), one white porcelain wine cup from the Yuan Dynasty, one white porcelain bowl from the Yuan Dynasty, one white porcelain black flower vase from the Yuan Dynasty, one black porcelain jar from the Yuan Dynasty, one Jun porcelain jar from the Yuan Dynasty, one square bronze mirror from the Song Dynasty.

### Zhejiang Aquatic Products Experiment Field Sends Personnel to Investigate Nieshan Island in Shandong Province

Escorted by the Keqiang Warship - The results of the investigation are very satisfactory - It can be a good base for the fishing industry

Dinghai Correspondence: Nieshan Island, which belongs to Xiangshan, Zhejiang Province, can be developed into a good base for the fishing industry. Previously, Chen Tongbai, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Experiment Field, drafted an opinion letter and submitted it to the authorities for development. It is reported that the field needs to conduct on-site inspections in order to specify the operation plan. In addition, in order to ensure the safety of the investigators because the island has always been occupied by bandits, it was requested to send a warship for escort. A few days ago, the Maritime Public Security Bureau ordered the Keqiang warship to sail to Dinghai and carry technicians Lin Shuyan and Lin Maochun and others from the field. They departed to the island for a detailed investigation lasting about five days. It was learned yesterday that the technicians have returned. According to reports, the situation of this investigation is briefly stated as follows: "Although the island is barren, the quality is exceptionally fertile, and the surrounding area is an excellent fishing ground. It is only a five-hour voyage from Dinghai. In the future, if the bandits can be wiped out and tens of thousands of yuan are allocated for minor operations, fishermen can be widely gathered and it can become an excellent fishing base. The results of this investigation are quite satisfactory. A detailed report will be submitted to the Construction Department for review and approval after it is sorted out and a development plan is prepared."

### Changshu Requests Improvement of Teacher Treatment

The county's education administrative meeting will open on the 13th of this month, and the education community is extremely concerned about it. In view of the fact that each school in the county is ordered to employ only one person per classroom, the teachers' lives and spirits are both painful. Once there are diseases and other matters, they must also force themselves to do their duties. In addition, various volumes and registers are accumulated, and they still worry that it is difficult to be clear even if they revise them day and night. Therefore, it is difficult to be comprehensive in teaching management, and there is no opportunity for self-improvement. In recent years, the low level of students has not been affected by this. In order to improve teacher treatment and increase educational efficiency, the county education association has specifically proposed to the conference to break the system of one person per classroom and change it to a system of three people in two grades. It is heard that there are sufficient educational expenses here, and there may be a possibility of reform.

Agreement has now been reached. The director of the relief center is looking for a suitable location and has identified the back palace of the Zhou Shen Temple as the association's location.

At midnight on the 7th, more than 30 bandits suddenly came to the Jijia Hotel Shouzhen Nunnery in Xilai Township, Jiangdu Ninth District. They knocked on the door and claimed to be the "Hui Tianshun". (The abbess of the nunnery is about 50 years old.) They entered and went directly to Tianshun's bedroom, pulled out a pistol, and shouted to keep silent. After inquiring and learning that there were no guns in the village or the nunnery, they tied up Tianshun, tortured her, and poured kerosene on her, forcing her to confess the location of silver coins. Then, they poured oil and tortured a fellow nun, while rummaging through boxes and cabinets, cooking and eating their fill. At about 2 AM, they roared away. It is estimated that they robbed a 50-yuan wine ticket sent by the Jiang family from Shanghai, 5 yuan in current coins, a pair of silver bracelets, two bags of flour noodles, bedding, clothing, and other items, totaling more than 100 yuan. After dawn, neighbors of the nunnery learned that the nuns had been tortured and were seriously injured inside and out. They were carried into the city. Doctors from Tongren and Chengzhong hospitals examined them one after another. They all said that Tianshun's life was in danger. A cardiac stimulant was administered in the city. It was said that there would be no change in a day and night before treatment could begin. She was carried back to the nunnery, and Yuanjing was carried to the Baohui Nunnery in the old alley to receive treatment in the city.

Because the porters from the two villages had deep-seated grievances, the number of people on both sides was large and the fight became more and more intense. After the Public Security Bureau learned about it, it sent police to suppress it before it could be dispersed. As a result, two people from Ziyou Village and six people from Dai Shang Wang were injured, fortunately without serious harm. The ringleaders, Kong Youquan and Jin Renquan, were arrested and interrogated. On the afternoon of the 4th, the villagers of Dai Shang Wang prepared for an armed fight. Gentry from the town came forward to mediate, but because the conditions of both parties were difficult to accept, it was impossible to persuade them for a while. Hundreds of armed men from both sides, carrying guns and forming teams, went to the armed fight. Gunshots rumbled continuously. The Public Security Bureau sent a large team of police to suppress them. The director of Wang personally led the team to stop them before he could listen to persuasion. The person in charge mediated, and it is unknown whether the armed fight can be settled.

### Wen Zhou, Xu Hongbao inspects AGAIN

Xu Hongbao, the customs supervisor of Wenzhou and Ouhai, set off for a real inspection of the coastal area of ​​the customs area in December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, and successively formulated plans based on the inspections and submitted them to the Ministry for adoption. Since the trip, the tax revenue has increased exceptionally, several times more than before. It is heard that Customs Supervisor Xu Lan had just returned for more than a year since his last tour. Although the investigation network is tight, private sales activities are inevitable. In addition, the bandits in Pingyang and Taishun have been rampant recently, and it is feared that there will be private transport by Chinese traitors. It is also heard that large-scale smuggling companies have been re-established in various parts of South China, and there are even concerns that they will have a large number of smuggled goods. If there is an invasion of the customs area, and the coastal area is smuggling, it is inevitable that the situation will change recently, circumventing tax avoidance. Xu Hongbao followed the consistent proposition of Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance to rectify tariffs and strictly suppress smuggling, and specially invited customs affairs officer Morgan to tour again. I also heard that in addition to setting off for the coastal area of ​​the customs area, as well as the islands and ports, for detailed inspections, he also went to Gu'aotou and Haimen two sub-cards to inspect them separately. Based on the results of this inspection, he planned to reorganize the anti-smuggling case.

### Lu Province Confiscated Three Cars Carrying Illicit Goods

—All Illicit Goods Were Also Detained—

Jinan Correspondence: Since the smuggling of illicit goods has had a profound and significant impact on national revenue, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Han Fuqu, has repeatedly received orders from the central government to instruct his subordinates to strictly investigate and suppress illicit goods in order to rectify tax revenues and safeguard the national economy. He has already seized illicit goods several times and confiscated them. Recently, according to a telegram from the Fifth District Inspector's Office of Huimin, three cars transporting illicit goods were seized. The cars were transporting smuggled cigarettes and paper. They were sent to the headquarters for investigation. Han considered the matter to be of great importance. In addition to confiscating all illicit goods according to law as a warning, he also issued a public notice to inform merchants and civilians. The public notice stated, "The payment of taxes on transported goods is specifically stipulated by law. Evasion and trickery are not permitted by law. In recent times, smuggling has become increasingly prevalent, which has had a profound and significant impact on the state's revenue and the loss of rights. I, the Chief Commander, am duty-bound to be vigilant and cannot but suppress it. I have repeatedly issued orders to my subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit it, and to take measures to prevent it. According to a telegram from the Fifth District Inspector's Office of Huimin, three cars transporting illicit goods were seized at Yangfang Ferry in that county. The cars were detained and sent for investigation. In addition to confiscating them according to law, this notice is hereby issued to inform all merchants and civilians. In the future, when transporting goods, you must comply with the regulations and pay taxes, and you are not allowed to evade or smuggle goods. If you dare to violate this, you will be severely punished and never leniently treated. This is a must."

The Far East's only grand sports building will soon stand tall next to the Racecourse Hall at the most prosperous center of this city, meeting the long-standing needs of both Chinese and foreign residents in Shanghai. Its magnificent scale and perfect facilities are unparalleled in the Far East. Those in charge are leading figures in the sports and business communities. The construction site has been selected between Baker Road and Maybach Road. The plan was announced yesterday by the board of directors of the venue and named "Olympia" Sports Field. Construction will begin soon. The purpose is purely to inspire great sports endeavors and meet the needs of the public. This grand project has been in commercial planning for years and was completed after much careful consideration, representing a new social undertaking. It is now sponsored by the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office in Shanghai and organized a board of directors in accordance with company law. Mr. Wang Zhengting, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States and former Chairman of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, is also listed as one of the patrons.

Board of Directors Established

The provisional directors are all leading figures in the city's business community, such as financial expert Mr. Spielman (Manager of the International Savings Society), Mr. Peel (former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council), Mr. Shen Siliang (Honorary Secretary-General of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation), Mr. Yang Guangshang (General Manager of the Arctic Company and the Continental Newspaper), Mr. Spire (General Manager of the British Commercial Broadcasting Company), Mr. Simpson (Shareholder of Zen Chong & Co.), Mr. Olmen (Lawyer), Mr. Bairober (Manager of the American Commercial Company), Mr. Hunt (Chairman of Jardine Engineering Corporation), Mr. Li Shuxiong (Renowned Real Estate and Insurance Merchant), Mr. McDonald (McDonald Engineering & Construction Company), Mr. Mayerink (General Manager of Meihe & Co.), Mr. Pan Zhiquan (Head Comprador of Jardine Matheson & Co.), Mr. Benar (Vice President of the American Banknote Company), Mr. Ross (Xinfeng & Co.), and Mr. Morrison (General Manager of the American York Company).

Total Investment of Two Million Yuan

The total investment of the company is estimated at two million yuan in national currency, with one million yuan intended for construction and various equipment expenses, and the remaining one million yuan for purchasing real estate and meeting the needs of working capital. The entire base covers a total of eleven acres and will house a magnificent and grand building. The building is divided into three floors, with extremely complete sports facilities, from ice hockey to new-style billiards rooms and Earthball fields, everything is available. The designer is the famous architect Mr. Dong Dayou. Mr. Dong has planned and built the large sports field and gymnasium in the city center and has a wealth of experience, so the design is innovative and perfect.

Great Swimming Pool Serves Two Purposes

As for the structure and distribution of the building, the ground floor includes the offices of the administrative organs that manage the entire building, a sports club, a billiard room, a small billiard room, a storage room, a shower room, a changing room, a library, and all necessary equipment. The middle floor will have the largest swimming pool in Shanghai, which has the unique feature that it can be immediately converted into an ice skating rink and an ice hockey field when needed. The surrounding stands can accommodate 7,000 spectators. The design of this pool serving two purposes is entirely to introduce ice hockey to the people of Shanghai. This kind of reasonable team sport that develops all the muscles simultaneously is of great promotional value. Therefore, in addition to installing this novel device, the venue will also hire experts to guide and train beginners in the technical essentials at any time, hoping that ice hockey will become as popular in Shanghai as football and basketball and become a popular sport.

Gym Can Accommodate 10,000 People

### Mutual Accusation Case Between Hubei Education Director and Teacher Adjudicated by Wuchang District Court

Teacher Zhang Found Guilty of Insult, Fined; Counter-Accusation of Director Zhou Found Not Guilty on All Counts

(Hankou Airlines News) Zhongxiang Middle School teacher Zhang Chuandao, because of the new Education Director Zhou Tianfang was not seen. There were words insulting Mr. Zhou's dignity, and Zhou ordered the guards to hand them over to the Provincial Police Department and send them to the Wuchang Local Court to accuse Zhang of insulting his superiors, destroying public property, and obstructing official duties. Zhang also hired three lawyers, including Wang Guangxiang, to file a lawsuit accusing Zhou of abusing his power, illegally arresting, and falsely accusing him. On the 17th of last month, the court held a hearing and ordered the end of the debate, scheduled to pronounce the verdict on the 1st of this month. The date was later extended to 1:00 p.m. on the 5th before the verdict was pronounced. The main text was that Zhang Chuandao insulted his superiors and damaged public property, which constituted crimes under Articles 124 and 382 of the Criminal Law. He was sentenced to a fine. Zhang Chuandao's accusation of Zhou Tianfang was found not guilty. The uproar that swept through Wuhan has now calmed down. After the verdict in this case, Zhou issued a statement stating his feelings: "I was ordered to come to Hubei to handle education. All facilities are based on local conditions and in accordance with central laws and regulations. I am cautious in handling matters. In terms of personnel, I follow Taigong's example and have never had any selfish intentions. This time, Zhongxiang Middle School teacher Zhang Chuandao came to the hall to cause trouble. The accusation of slander against me was purely due to a failure to understand my spirit. At that time, the court was in the process of trial, and although reporters came to visit, I did not express any opinions. Now that the court has pronounced its verdict and the truth is revealed, there is no need to express any opinions. However, I feel sorry that I have not been in Hubei for long and my credibility has not been established, which has caused this unfortunate incident of colleagues in the education community misunderstanding me and violating criminal law. (8th) (Hankou, 8th) Zhang appealed to the High Court in the case of Zhang's accusation against the Director of Education.

In the end, the score was 15 to 10, with Suqiaoer losing consecutively. The overall score was 2 to 0, with Haiqing winning completely. The other match was between Xiqing and the Russian army. In the previous round, the Russian army had suffered a complete defeat against Xiqing. In yesterday's match, they recalled their previous shame and launched a fierce attack. However, they were brave but lacked strategy. Their cannonball-style spikes were ineffective, while Xiqing's light touches and skillful kills were extremely cunning, allowing them to easily outmaneuver their opponents. Xiang Boluo Kefu's fierce spikes were also turned against his own side, forgetting his former deep feelings. The Russian army was even more miserable under these circumstances. Therefore, after losing the first game 10 to 15, they still failed to capitalize on many opportunities in the second game and lost 13 to 15. The overall score was still 2 to 0, with Xiqing defeating them again. In the match between Xiqing and Suqiaoer the night before, Xiqing also won with two straight sets. The results are recorded below. The lineups of both sides were the same as before, so there is no need to repeat them.

▲Yesterday's Match Results

Haiqing wins against Suqiaoer (Group A) 2 to 0

Xiqing wins against the Russian army (Group A) 2 to 0

▲Previous Match Supplement

Xiqing wins against Suqiaoer (Group A) 2 to 0

### The City Women's Association Celebrated "March 8th" Yesterday

A commemorative meeting was held in the morning with representatives from all walks of life, along with radio broadcasts and speeches, and promotion in rural areas.

Guomin News Agency reports that yesterday was "March 8th," International Women's Day. In addition to issuing a letter to women to encourage them, the city's Women's Association held a commemorative meeting at 10:00 AM at the auditorium of Huadong Girls' High School on Xiafei Road, with over 600 representatives from all walks of life attending. Prominent figures were invited to broadcast on the radio, and personnel were sent to rural areas to promote the cause. Details are recorded below:

Meeting Staff

The meeting staff included: Presidium: Lin Kecong, Zhang Sujun, Luo Gengyang, Shu Huizhen, Wang Jisi; Recorder: Lin Yuxiang; Master of Ceremonies: Miao Lianqing; Reception: Yao Shicui, Weng Huiyao, etc.

Chairman's Report

After performing the ceremonial rituals, Chairman Lin Kecong gave a report, stating that since 1909, when American women launched a movement for liberation on March 8th, women in various countries have gradually begun to liberate themselves. In China, after this trend spread to East Asia, Chinese women have also become aware of the various oppressions and sufferings they have suffered. Since the National Revolutionary Army took its oath in the 15th year of the Republic of China, the government has also been able to respond to the demands of women and has successively formulated many laws to improve the status of women. Although the majority of women are still trapped under the constraints and oppressions of feudal patriarchal forces and the lack of guaranteed livelihood due to backward production, it cannot be denied that considerable gains have been made in terms of politics and law. Therefore, our future women's movement should do more positive and practical work. Especially now that the national crisis is severe, our female compatriots should all strive to rise up and work for resistance and national salvation under the leadership of the government. I believe that the women's problem in China cannot be completely resolved until the entire China obtains freedom and equality. I hope everyone will unite and work together, etc.

Summary of Speeches

Subsequently, Ma Jiazhen, the principal of Huadong Girls' High School, gave a speech, stating that: (1) In the past, women generally believed that they were oppressed by men and had to resist men everywhere. But now, the oppression women suffer is the same as the oppression men suffer from imperialism and unequal treaties. Therefore, the first path for women's efforts in the future is to seek national freedom and national equality together with men, and to shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and resisting aggression. (2) At present, women have equal opportunities with men in terms of law, education, and politics. But in fact, because women are not as educated as men, women's ability to act in various fields is not as good as that of men. Therefore, the second path for women's efforts in the future is to promote the popularization of women's education and strive for self-cultivation in order to achieve truly equal status with men, etc. Then, Wang Tianren gave a speech, which can be roughly divided into three main points: (1) To commemorate Women's Day, women themselves should strive for women's economic rights. (2) To commemorate Women's Day, we should break away from vanity. (3) To commemorate Women's Day, we should prepare our own strength. The so-called strength can be divided into two types: human resources and material resources. Compared with the two, human resources are particularly important, and human resources are divided into physical strength, mental strength, and technical strength. I hope that female compatriots will make twelve points of effort in this regard, etc. The meeting was then adjourned.

Radio Broadcasts and Speeches

In addition to holding a commemorative meeting yesterday, Wu Mayor's wife, Cai Yuanpei's wife, Ms. Wang Xiaoying, Ms. Lu Lihua, and Ms. Shu Huizhen were specially invited to broadcast the meaning of "March 8th" on the Asia Sound, Great China, and other radio stations at 11:00 AM. Lin Kecong, the managing director of the association, and the directors, led the staff and members to the areas of Fanhuangdu, Xujiahui, Beixinjing, Longhua, Jiangwan, Wusong, etc. in the afternoon to explain the relationship between March 8th and society, the country, and the world.

### The National Goods Association Asked to Stop the Monopoly of Foreign Bulb Merchants

Yesterday's Letter to the Shaoxing Chamber of Commerce Asked to Send Personnel to Investigate and Stop It

The China National Goods Maintenance Association, in order to request the prohibition of the monopoly of foreign bulb companies in promoting sales in the Shaoxing market, sent a letter to the Shaoxing Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: Dear Sirs, Recently, we received a letter from our member, Huade Factory, stating that our factory recently learned that the Shaoxing Electrical Industry Association has signed a sales agreement with a certain foreign bulb company, and all the bulbs needed in the county are supplied by the company. We were shocked to hear this. We have investigated that the government is implementing the promotion of the use of national goods by the national people. If this agreement is signed, not only will our Chinese market be arbitrarily monopolized, but also the implementation will destroy our national goods and cut off sales channels. Our national goods bulb industry will be deeply affected. For the sake of national goods, we specially wrote to your association, and forwarded the letter to the Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, to investigate and stop the signing of this agreement, etc. In this regard, we have investigated that promoting national goods is one of the basic movements of our government, and it is extremely important to the survival of the entire country. In recent years, foreign insults have become more and more pressing, and the national steps have been difficult. At the time when smuggling is rampant and it is difficult to suppress bandits, it is felt that there is an urgent need for the entire country to uniformly use national goods. Moreover, the Executive Yuan issued the third (79) order to all agencies and local people on May 21, 1936, that national goods should be purchased as soon as possible in order to prevent leakage, etc. The order was sent for investigation and processing. Now, according to the factory's report, the Shaoxing Electrical Industry Association has actually taken this action, which not only violates the government's intention to promote national goods, but also destroys national goods and introduces wolves into the house. It is a severe step. It is appropriate to send a special letter to you, and we hope that your association will promptly send personnel to investigate and stop the signing of the agreement, so as to prevent the public from following suit, and to maintain the export of national goods and consolidate the patriotic front. We sincerely hope and pray for the best, and we will reply with a new perspective.

Luen Cheong Workers Petitioned Yesterday

Since a strike broke out among male and female workers in the coarse and fine yarn sections of the British-owned Luen Cheong Textile Printing and Dyeing Company in Lujiazui, Pudong, it has been many days. After the employers invited foremen and worker representatives from various departments to hold direct negotiations, the employers only agreed to increase wages by 5%. There was no adequate decision on other conditions such as bonuses and holidays. After the foremen and worker representatives reported the negotiation process to all the workers, it was rejected, and a solution was not reached. The labor unrest is still at a standstill. Yesterday morning, twelve representatives from various departments of the factory presented a petition first to the city party headquarters. Zhang Sheng, the chief director of the civil movement section, received them. The workers presented six demands: (1) Increase the daily wage of female yarn-joining workers by one dime, increase the wage of bobbin workers by one-quarter, and add one worker per bag; (2) No deductions of wages; (3) Female workers should be able to take leave automatically when pregnant, and receive six weeks of leave with pay at childbirth; (4) Male and female workers should not have their wages deducted for incidents occurring outside the factory; (5) After working for two weeks, workers should be compensated with one day off; (6) Workers should not be dismissed without cause. Mr. Zhang indicated acceptance and agreed to coordinate with the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, where Section 3 staff member Zhang Chuqiang received them. They did not go to the General Labor Union to petition, but Commissioner Gong Yuting received them and agreed to find ways to mediate the workers' demands. It is understood that after receiving the workers' petition for assistance, representatives of the party and government authorities have discussed it and decided to cross the river to Pudong tomorrow to mediate with the factory.

Ni Peisheng was seriously injured, and the wives of Zhang Zhiquan and Shen Changfu were also beaten. The constabulary is increasing patrols to maintain order. The striking workers originally planned a joint petition this morning, but because the factory asked someone to come forward to mediate, their opinions have gradually approached an agreement, so the petition was cancelled. According to worker representatives, the labor unrest may be resolved soon.

### Three Things the Industrial and Commercial Sectors Should Pay Attention to After the Implementation of Income Tax (Continued)

Li Wenjie's Speech at the Citizen's Association; Important Reference for the Industrial and Commercial Sectors

(B) Matters to be Paid Attention to Regularly

The calculation of income tax for profit-making enterprises is based on the total actual and collectible revenue from business operations as the total revenue, from which the necessary and reasonable expenses and other losses, bad debts, depreciation, inventory consumption, public contributions, and legally prescribed public reserve funds (collectively referred to as deduction items) paid and payable but unpaid during the business period are deducted to obtain the net profit. Then, the ratio of the net profit to the actual capital amount (the actual capital received plus one-third of the statutory public reserve fund) is multiplied by the net profit to obtain the amount of income tax to be paid. The so-called total revenue, various deduction items, and actual capital amount are all items and figures expressed in accounting books and documents. Therefore, the detailed rules stipulate that the reporter of the income of profit-making enterprises should produce a property catalog, profit and loss statement, balance sheet, or other account books and documents sufficient to prove the amount of income when reporting. The person obligated to pay tax and report should pay attention to the following matters in accounting: how to properly preserve the documents that can prove the increase or decrease in property, and accurately record and regularly express the increase or decrease. To analyze it, special attention should be paid to the following points: (1) Accounting books, forms, documents, vouchers, etc. should be properly stored. In commercial institutions that cannot have iron cabinets, an account box should also be prepared, and important documents should be stored after work every day, so that they can be easily taken in the event of unexpected incidents. (2) The names of the managers and the start and end dates of management should be stated in the account book. (3) If there are any errors in the account table, the person handling the correction should affix a seal to prove it. Do not use knives to scrape or chemicals to erase the handwriting. (4) Payment of funds must be based on documents, and receipt of funds must be based on receipts. Transfer transactions must be based on separate vouchers before recording in the account. (5) In addition to the signature of the responsible accounting personnel to indicate that the accounts have been cleared, each accounting voucher must be signed and sealed by the responsible person at the higher level for certification. (6) The daily accounts should be recorded on the same day. After the accounts are cleared, a symbol should be added. (7) A trial balance should be performed at least at the end of each month to check whether the accounting is correct. (8) Incoming and outgoing letters must be numbered and recorded in a book. Letters of important nature must also retain the envelope and the mailing receipt. Outgoing documents must be retained as a copy. (9) Important seals should be carefully stored. The above are general matters that should be paid attention to. The following are the matters that should be paid attention to regarding income tax: (1) Do not forget to withhold income tax when paying interest on deposits and loans (excluding those whose lenders are money lenders) and personnel. If it is not paid to the collection agency for the time being, a separate "withheld income tax" account should be opened to record it. (2) Do not forget to withhold income tax when paying irregular commissions to people involved in business and when paying regular salaries and remuneration to people who are used in business. For each business user, a separate account must also be established to record the income tax for each month of the year, so as to calculate their average daily income for the whole year. (3) The income tax on interest on bank deposits and other loans has been withheld by the debtor. This is income tax that has been paid from business income and should be deducted from the income tax payable. Therefore, a separate subject should be established to record it, and the withholding list should be carefully preserved for proof. The same applies to income tax withheld from temporary profit income outside of this business. (4) If industrial and commercial institutions invest in real estate, it is best to separate this investment from the inherent business so that it can be calculated independently for profit and loss. (5) Special care should be taken with each item of the "Note on the First Category of Collection" draft item 12 that cannot be considered necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business. The historical habit of treating capital official interest as an expense should be carefully noted. Before the current law is revised, it will not be listed as an expense to save the trouble of returning and correcting the calculation report. (6) When purchasing or building houses, land, machinery, tools, and property, documents proving the original price should be preserved. Expenses incurred for processing, improving, renovating, and repairing in the future should be added to the original price, and the documents should also be preserved together. This can avoid the danger of the competent collection agency directly assessing the value of the above-mentioned assets when it is impossible to produce reliable supporting documents. (7) Bad debts that have been recovered and included in the loss should be listed as income for the current year. (To be continued)

### Check Found on the Road Wrongfully Cashed; Culprit Convicted

Ham Shop Partner Lost Check and Was Planning to Report Loss; Immediately Reported to Police Upon Seeing Someone Trying to Cash It; Arrested and Taken to the Police Station

Qiu Jinguang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 11 Zhiqing Lane, Jessfield Road, West Shanghai, aged 23, went to the Nanshi Dalin Road to see his relatives yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM. He and his wife, Ms. Zheng (aged 21), went together. While passing through the Old North Gate in the city, Ms. Zheng suddenly found a check for

Two Hundred Yuan

on the ground with the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Nanshi Ximen Branch, Yin character number 2830. She handed it to her husband, Qiu. Upon inspection, Qiu saw that the check was due that day. A fortuitous heart arose, and he and his wife hurried to Ximen to wrongfully cash it at the bank. At that time, Hu Xueying, an Anhui native, aged 28, was a partner in the Hu Dasheng Ham Shop at 239 Fangbang Road in the city. Yesterday morning, he was ordered by the shop to take the check paid by the Danfenglou Rong Restaurant at the intersection of Ximen Zhonghua Road

Account for Ham

and cash it at the Shanghai Bank. Hu happened to have important business to attend to at a friend's place on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, so he discovered that the check was missing. He searched everywhere but could not find it and was extremely anxious. He hurried to the bank to report the loss when he caught sight of the check in the hands of the young couple, who were about to cash it. In a moment of desperation, he reported the situation to the bank's police officer Zhang Zijun. Officer Zhang apprehended Qiu

and his Wife

and brought them both to the Wemiao Road police station for interrogation. After the plaintiff, Hu Xueying, stated what happened, Qiu Jinguang and Qiu Zheng confessed that they found the check and wrongfully cashed it. Zhang Zhenxiang (aged 23), a partner at the Danfenglou Restaurant, Anhui native, confirmed that the check was indeed given by the shop to the Hu Dasheng Ham Shop. After verifying the confession, the police station believed that the case involved greed and embezzlement and immediately prepared a document to submit to the general bureau for investigation.

### 名妓適人後忽訴遺棄

Result: Defendant Found Not Guilty; Incidental Civil Suit Rejected

Zhuang Dingxin, a 36-year-old Ningbo native and former senior employee of the Xingju Company at Sassoon House on Nanjing Road, met Hongying Laoba, a famous prostitute from Leyu Lane on Yunnan Road, while out carousing with friends two years ago. Laoba's real name was Lü Suzhen, a 22-year-old from Wuxi, Jiangsu, residing at No. 1 Fukang Lane, Dunji Lane, Nine Acres, Nanshi. After getting acquainted with Zhuang, they developed deep affection for each other, feeling as though they had met too late. Soon, Lü
Stopped taking engagements
And began living with Zhuang in a loving cohabitation. Alas, good times don't last forever, and a storm suddenly arose in their love boat, leading to an irreparable rift. Lü then hired lawyer Zhou Yongzhi to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zhuang Dingxin of seduction, abandonment, and undermining public morals, along with an incidental civil suit. The reasons for the lawsuit stated that Lü Suzhen, using the stage name Hongying Laoba, had been taking engagements at brothels. In 1935, after meeting the defendant Zhuang Dingxin, they developed deep affection for each other. The defendant also claimed to be unmarried and

Decided to Marry Her
Making Lü leave the brothel on the Dragon Boat Festival of the same year and rent a house in Nanlin Lane on Haining Road to live together. All expenses were provided by the defendant. At that time, the plaintiff was already pregnant and had discussed formal marriage with the defendant. The defendant made many excuses, saying they'd notify his parents and hold the wedding after the birth. Until May 29th of last year, the defendant sent the plaintiff to

Tongde Maternity
Hospital, where she gave birth to a boy two days later, who died the same day. Unexpectedly, at this juncture, the defendant suddenly changed, becoming estranged. Not only did he not return home often, but he also neglected to provide for her livelihood, effectively abandoning her. After detailed investigation, the plaintiff discovered that the defendant had become infatuated with a dancer and built another love nest to live together. The plaintiff, as a woman of weak will, suffered

Initial Affection, Ultimate Abandonment
Which constituted a crime under Articles 129 and 293 of the Criminal Law. Besides requesting a legal sentence, she also filed an incidental civil suit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay monthly alimony of 50 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao presided over the case in the Third Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Lü Suzhen, arrived with her lawyer Zhou Yongzhi to state the above facts. When questioned, the defendant Zhuang Dingxin confessed that the plaintiff was

Introduced by a Teahouse Server
At the Wu Palace Hotel. They had relations. Afterwards, he would occasionally visit her residence in Nanlin Lane. Later, due to the plaintiff's pregnancy, he rented a house in Dunji Lane, Nine Acres, Nanshi, to live together. Currently, he is unemployed and unable to cover the expenses, so he stopped going there. He also hired a lawyer to defend him in court. Judge Xiao reviewed the evidence and ruled that the defendant Zhuang Dingxin was not guilty of abandonment. Other parts were not accepted, and the plaintiff's incidental civil suit was rejected.

### Girl Abandoned in a Small Inn

Woman Disappears, Never to Return; Child Sent to Nursery

At the Dong Inn, a small inn located at No. 8 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, a modern middle-aged woman arrived at around 5 PM on the 5th of this month, carrying a female infant, just a month old. She requested to rent Room No. 3 to stay overnight. The baby was wrapped in a red foreign cloth swaddle. The woman claimed to be Chen, a local resident, 30 years old. After paying the room fee, she asked the tea server, Lu A'gen, if there were any nearby wet nurses for hire. Lu replied that there were none. The woman then put the baby on the bed, claiming she was going out to find a wet nurse, but never returned. Until the next day, the inn still didn't see Chen come back, and the baby cried incessantly in the room all night. So, the tea server took the baby to the Xiafei Police Station to report and requested arrangements. The head patrolman ordered the baby to be left temporarily and sent to Guangci Hospital for care. Yesterday, it was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, requesting a decision. First, police lawyer Chen Ming went through the procedure, and then the official questioned Lu A'gen, the tea server of the Huadong Inn, about what happened. Subsequently, Wang Liu, a woman residing in Jing'an Temple, claimed she wanted to adopt the baby because she was unable to conceive. As a result, because a guarantor could not be found, Judge Bai ruled that the nameless female infant should be sent to the nursery for care.

### Robbery Case, Bandit Defense Concludes

After Judge Sun Peng repeatedly held court sessions to summon the victims and drivers to examine the defendants, Judge Sun presided over the First Criminal Court yesterday afternoon to review the case once more. As the facts of the case were already clear, he ordered the debate to begin. Lawyer Yuan Jiajie of the police department argued that the defendants had confessed to the robbery without denial. The box cannon and pistol had been recovered, and the victims and witnesses had provided evidence. He requested a legal verdict. Next, Judge Zhao Yifen, appointed by the court to defend the defendants, defended each defendant. The court then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 15th.

The boiler at the Shanghai Bank at No. 50 Ningbo Road suddenly exploded on the morning of the 28th of last month, killing Zhu Fenglai and Pan Weihan, and injuring Xu Jiarui. Afterwards, after investigation by detective Gao Zhen under the order of the police station, it was recognized that Xu Zulin, the worker in charge of managing the boiler, was indeed negligent, so he was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for
Requesting Detention
The details have been described in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court to continue the trial. Police lawyers Ru Bao Yi and Qian Xun Jiu filed a lawsuit according to Article 276, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for causing death due to negligence in business, and stated that the cause of the disaster was that the defendant hired a person without any experience to perform his duties, resulting in excessive heat and forgetting to open the valve, causing this disaster. After the incident, the police station
Commissioned Experts
Americans Davis and Meisheng to go for appraisal and prepared an appraisal report. This morning, the two appraisers were present in court, requesting questioning. Subsequently, Ma Xinchong, a clerk at the Shanghai Bank, stated that the defendant had been working as a fireman in the bank for more than five years. It was stipulated that he should start the fire at 5 AM every day and extinguish the fire at 12 PM in the afternoon. A few days before the accident, the defendant reported that there was a

Pipe Leaking
I then ordered an engineer to go and check, believing that the leak was irrelevant. As for why the disaster occurred this time, I don’t know. Next, Davis testified that after the accident, he went to investigate and found that the explosion was indeed caused by the valve not being opened. The valve should be opened once the fire is started, but the defendant had been repairing pipes before the incident, resulting in

Valve Closed
He forgot to open it when starting the fire on the morning of the 28th, so he started the fire, causing the water in the furnace to dry up and making a sound. Then he remembered that the valve was not open, so he immediately opened it, causing three thousand gallons of cold water to enter the extremely hot furnace, which then exploded. Meisheng testified that his words were the same as Tai's. When questioned, the defendant Xu Zulin confessed that the deceased Zhu Fenglai,

Was My Nephew
Had been helping me for three years. Because I was too tired from repairing pipes the night before the accident, I couldn’t get up on time the next morning, so Zhu started the fire for me, and unfortunately this disaster occurred. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned for a week for further investigation.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A

(14)

Question: I am a representative stationed in Shanghai by a merchant from another port. My residence in Shanghai is an apartment-style building with many households. Most of my incoming mail is business-related, and if it is mistakenly received by others, it will have a significant impact. I read the Postal Knowledge Q&A in the tenth issue and learned that the post office has a "poste restante" service where the sender can specify that the mail be held at the post office for the recipient to pick up. I would like to follow this method and request the Shanghai Post Office not to deliver my mail according to the address and instead have it all held at the post office. Is this feasible?

Answer: The post office's "poste restante" service was originally designed to facilitate traveling merchants. All "poste restante" mail should not have a detailed address, except for the name of the recipient and the location. Instead, it should be marked with "poste restante." Your incoming mail already has a detailed address written on the envelope. The delivery post office must deliver it according to the address and cannot change it to the "poste restante" method at the post office's location. However, according to your situation, you can rent a private mailbox at the Shanghai Post Office, which is a public facility, to solve the problem. The details and rental procedures for this type of mailbox are described below.

Post offices in important locations, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou, have private mailboxes for public rental. These mailboxes come in four sizes: No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. No. 1 is the smallest, and No. 4 is the largest. The annual rent for No. 1 is six yuan, No. 2 is twelve yuan, No. 3 is eighteen yuan, and No. 4 is twenty-four yuan. The renter can choose one of the sizes and obtain a "mailbox rental application" from the post office, fill it out according to the instructions, and then submit the application along with the annual rent (according to the post office regulations, the rent is calculated quarterly, but six months' rent must be paid in advance when renting. For example, if you rent a No. 1 mailbox in January 1937, the annual rent is six yuan, and you must pay three yuan when renting. If you cancel the rental by mid-March, the rent will be calculated until the end of March, which is one yuan and five jiao. The remaining one yuan and five jiao can be refunded) and a deposit of five yuan to the post office staff. The staff will fill out a receipt, specify the mailbox number, and fill the number on the receipt. Then, the staff will hand the receipt and a set of keys for the mailbox to the renter. If the renter needs two or more keys, they can request them from the post office, paying five jiao for each additional key. However, it should be noted that these keys should be kept safe. If lost, regardless of whether there are spare keys, the post office should be notified immediately to replace the lock and return the spare keys to avoid the theft of mail.

### Public Bus Accident: Sisters, One Dead, One Injured

Brakes Failed, Knocking Down Two Girls; Deceased's Autopsy Completed, Body Released to Father

Chen Zhijie, a native of Changzhou who runs a clothing store at No. 27 Renxing Street, Lane 1941, Yangshupu Road, has two daughters. The elder, Lanzhen, is 11 years old, and the younger, Renmei, is 5 years old. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, around 1 PM, the sisters were returning home after playing outside. As they were walking hand in hand across the road from south to north at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Guangxin Road, a No. 9 public bus, No. 15114, driven by Li Zhaosheng, came speeding from the west. Because the brakes failed, the left front wheel knocked both of them down, and they were severely injured. The police arrived after hearing the report, immediately copied down the bus number, and summoned an ambulance to the scene, immediately flying the two sisters to St. Heart Hospital for treatment. Renmei, due to more serious injuries, was unable to be saved and soon died. Lanzhen is still being treated, and her condition is unknown. The Yangshupu Police Station ordered detectives to investigate, and then moved Renmei's body to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang, appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived to examine the body. The head of the Western Police first reported the investigation process, and then Li Zhaosheng stated that he had been driving for three years, and that the deceased and others had emerged from behind a public bus traveling west, so he only glimpsed them 5 yards away. He tried to avoid them by turning the bus head south to avoid people, but was unable to avoid them, etc. The deceased's father, Chen Zhijie, stated that he was at home tailoring clothes that day, and his wife was washing clothes, so he didn't know the two girls had gone out. Now that one daughter had been killed and one daughter injured, he requested a ruling, etc. After hearing the statements, Zhang announced that the deceased, Chen Renmei, was a girl and was indeed killed by a No. 9 public bus. The body was released to her father, Chen Zhijie, with a signed receipt, and ordered the company to provide compensation.

### Chen Qian Accused of Abusing Adopted Daughter

Using Firewood to Beat and Cigarettes to Burn; Biological Father Receives News, Comes to Shanghai to Report and Rescue

Chen Qian, a Huzhou woman residing at No. 158 Hongfuxing, Huade Road, paid 20 yuan to Xu Jiaji, a native of Haimen, in 1934 to adopt his daughter, Meizhuang (currently 14 years old). Subsequently, for slight carelessness in her work, she was severely beaten and burned with firewood and the ends of her cigarettes. The girl endured unbearable suffering, only sobbing quietly. Recently, the father was notified by a friend named Xu Zhiming in his hometown, who told him to go to Shanghai immediately to take the girl back, otherwise,

Her Life Was in Danger

Xu Jiaji then borrowed some travel expenses from relatives, took a boat to Shanghai, and waited near Hongfu Lane. Until 3 PM the day before yesterday, the girl went out to buy something. After learning the whole story from the girl, he went to the Yulin Road Police Station to report. Detective Xie Wanfang arrested her at her address and took her to the police station, then transferred her to the women's prison. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special District Court. Labour Board lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the case, stating that on February 17th of last year, the police station received a phone call stating that at No. 158 Hongfu Lane,

There Was an Adopted Daughter
Being abused by her adoptive mother. The police station immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate, but Xu didn't dare to tell the truth, saying that nothing had happened, so the matter was not pursued. Currently, the girl was renamed Chen Aizhu by her. She told the police station that at the end of 1935, she was severely beaten with firewood by Chen, and in August 1936, because Chen needed hot tea when she was addicted to opium but didn't get it, she used the ends of her cigarettes to burn her head and arms. Since then, she has continued to use this vicious method many times. Recently, she

Pulled and Injured Her Left Ear
Quite severely. The abuse is real, but the scars and cigarette burns on her body have faded over time and are not obvious. A public prosecution is filed according to Article 286, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. However, the defendant denied the allegations at the police station, and the case is requested to be adjourned. Subsequently, Xu testified that she had been beaten and burned with firewood and cigarette ends several times by Chen. Her father, Xu Jiaji, stated that he sold his

Own Daughter
Meizhuang to Chen Qian for 20 yuan to be an adopted daughter because he was too poor to make a living. How could he know that she would abuse the girl like this? He also described how his friend Xu Zhiming had notified him in his hometown and how he had come to Shanghai. When questioned, Chen Qian stated that Xu had paid 80 yuan to her father Xu Jiaji to buy her as an adopted daughter. She denied beating her with firewood and burning her with lit cigarettes. The remaining confession was evasive. Judge Dai Rongduo ordered her to be remanded in custody, changed the date for further review, and sent Xu An to the hospital's forensic laboratory for detailed examination of the scars.

After completing the mailbox rental procedures, renters can print the mailbox number on their own stationery or other communication documents. All incoming mail, except for registered mail, express registered mail, parcels, insured mail, and cash-on-delivery mail, which are only placed in the mailbox with blank receipts or notifications, are sorted and placed in the mailbox by the post office upon arrival for the renter to pick up themselves.

In addition, for the convenience of the public, the post office has recently introduced a special mailbag system for areas without private mailboxes. The public can provide their own locked mailbag with a key and deposit it at the post office. All incoming mail will be placed in the bag by the post office for the recipient to pick up. The fees and procedures are roughly the same as renting a mailbox.

### ### Arrest of a Rascal for Extortion

Yin Duo Xi, a 29-year-old rascal from Yangzhou residing at No. 190 Ximen Road, on the afternoon of the 6th of this month, extorted money from Pan Jiaxiang, a copper artisan residing at No. 18 Tongfu Lane, Lan Weiai Road. When Pan couldn't comply, Yin forced Pan to a pawnshop and compelled him to pawn his overcoat for six yuan before leaving. Afterward, Pan, unwilling to accept this, reported it to the French Police, who dispatched officers to arrest Yin. Yesterday, Yin was sent to the Criminal Division of the Special First District Court. After a request for a postponement of the investigation, he was charged. Following the plaintiff's account of the fraudulent act, the magistrate briefly questioned the defendant and ordered a retrial on the 15th. The defendant was remanded to custody.

### ### Lawyer Guo Diaomei Appeals for Legal Fees

Witness Ran to be Summoned for Questioning

Guo Diaomei, a lawyer from Fuzhou, was hired in September of last year by Wang Ziying, a native of Chongming who works at the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and resides at No. 80 Jingu Village, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, to handle a civil lawsuit. When the engagement contract was drawn up, an initial agreement stipulated that the legal fees would be 20% of the 3,000 yuan lawsuit amount. Guo did not agree. He scratched out the amount in the contract and rewrote the legal fees as 600 yuan in national currency. Later, due to other reasons, the proceedings were halted. Guo urged Wang to pay the legal fees. Wang refused. Guo filed a suit in the Civil Division of the Special Second District Court against Wang Ziying to recover the 600 yuan in legal fees. After the trial, the court ruled against the plaintiff. Guo Diaomei appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, the civil division chief Xia Jinde and judges Tong and Fan questioned Guo in the civil third court. The appellant Guo Diaomei stated that he requested the original judgment be overturned and ordered the appellee to repay the 600 yuan in legal fees in national currency, as well as the statutory interest from the date of the lawsuit to the end of the execution, and the litigation costs of both the first and second instances. He reasoned that although the engagement contract had been altered, it was with the appellee's consent. The initial legal fees were specified as 20% of the lawsuit amount, but he did not agree because it violated the regulations of the Lawyers Association. The appellee agreed to the alteration, and he rewrote it as 600 yuan in national currency. It was agreed upon at the YMCA. The appellee didn't have a seal, so the witness Fang Zhenyu provided his seal as proof. Later, he prepared the lawsuit and was about to proceed, but the appellee's side had already reached a settlement. However, the agreed upon legal fees should be paid according to the contract. Zhang Xizhen (chief accountant of Hengfeng Yarn Factory) and Fang Zhenyu (currently secretary in the Beiping Municipal Government) should be summoned to testify. The appellee Wang Ziying requested the appeal be rejected. He said the Liang Peiji case was not settled. He lost the case in the First Special District Court. He and the appellant did not know each other before. He met him through a friend's introduction at a banquet and discussed the case with him. He said he volunteered to help as a duty. He didn't dare to accept the duty, so when the engagement contract was drafted, the legal fees were written as 20% of the lawsuit amount. He didn't know about the alteration. The contract was drafted at his home, and Wen Yinghu, the chief of the police station at the Temple of Confucius, and inspectors Xu Yuanyi and Er from the police bureau were present and could attest to it. After reviewing the situation, the court ordered the debate to be suspended and scheduled a retrial after summoning the witnesses. Guo was remanded to custody and Zhao was released on bail.

### ### Wang Wenquan et al. Accused of Forgery and Fraud

Mortgage Land Dispute

Zhang Yunbao, a local resident, operated a land and goods store on Rue des Soeurs, French Concession. In June of last year, due to slow business, he entrusted friends Xiao Qijing, Tan Jiangsheng, and Tan Maodi to mortgage a plot of land of over one mu to Wang Wenquan, a native of Anhui who operates a cloth factory on Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, for 600 yuan for operating expenses. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of the same month, Wang Wenquan had a novel idea. He conspired with Xiao Qijing and Tan Jiangsheng to forge a seal in the name of Zhang He Shang, Zhang Yunbao's deceased father, and a secondary seal for Zhang Buqing. He also colluded with Chen Shiying, Dai Weizhi, and Li Jinchao to forge a mortgage certificate in the name of Zhang He Shang. Tan Jiangsheng impersonated Zhang He Shang and mortgaged the land to Chen Ningchao, a wealthy land merchant, for 1,400 yuan in national currency, which was then divided among them. On December 24th of the same year, they again colluded with Wang Daoli to forge a mortgage certificate in the name of Zhang He Shang and obtained an additional 500 yuan from Chen Ningchao, which was divided among them. After Zhang Yunbao learned of the situation, he redeemed the land from Chen Ningchao for 1,900 yuan and recovered the forged mortgage certificates and seals from Wang Wenquan and others. He then hired lawyer Sun Ba Wu to file a lawsuit with the District Court. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu detained Wang Wenquan and Xiao Qijing after investigating the facts. Based on violations of articles 216, 217, and 339 of the Criminal Law, he initiated a public prosecution. Tan Jiangsheng, Dai Weizhi, Chen Shiying, Li Jinchao, and Wang Daoli, who were at large, were placed on a wanted list. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the trial. The judge ordered the defendants Wang Wenquan and Xiao Qijing to be brought to court. The plaintiff Zhang Yunbao, accompanied by lawyer Sun Ba Wu, appeared in court and recounted the events, pursuing a private lawsuit. Wang Wenquan, 39 years old, denied the forgery and fraud charges, stating that he was only a guarantor and that Tan Jiangsheng impersonated Zhang He Shang. Xiao Qijing, 52 years old, a native of Funing and owner of a incense business, testified similarly to Wang Wenquan. After the defense lawyer Hu Yuanjun concluded his argument, the judge deemed the hearing concluded and announced that the verdict would be delivered on the 13th. Wang Wenquan and Xiao Qijing were ordered to post a 5,000 yuan security bond.

### ### Executive Yuan Orders Factories to Register

All Must Be Completed by the End of June – Implementing Rewards and Relief

The Executive Yuan instructed this Municipal Government to order all factories to register. Existing factories that have not registered must register before the end of June this year. Factory report forms for 1936 must be submitted by the end of this month for review. The original order stated: (Omitted above) The Ministry of Industry reported that the purpose of Article 11 of the Factory Registration Regulations, which requires the submission of factory report forms, is to comprehensively understand the national industrial situation and annual operating conditions to provide guidelines for implementing industrial rewards, relief, and supervision to promote domestic industrial development. Since the beginning of implementation, many factories have been hesitant and watchful because it was a new undertaking, resulting in only 690 factories approved for registration by the end of 1935. After the Factory Registration Regulations were revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan for circulation to the provincial and municipal governments for strict supervision, progress was made in 1936, with a total of 1,441 factories registered by the end of the year. Combined with the factories registered previously, the total was 3,131 factories. In terms of numbers, this is still a small number and is insufficient to clarify the overall industrial situation, creating difficulties for industrial administration. In the future, continued efforts should be made to issue notifications to provincial and municipal governments to strictly enforce the regulations, aiming to complete the registration of all factories nationwide by the end of June 1937. New factories established thereafter should continue to register to ensure that the national industrial situation is fully understood and that industrial administration can proceed smoothly. This is the general situation regarding factory registration. Regarding the matter of ordering registered factories to submit factory report forms in accordance with the regulations, the Ministry has previously copied and attached the lists of factories registered before the end of January 1936 that should submit the 1935 report forms, and has included multiple blank factory report forms, which were sent to the provincial and municipal governments for distribution to the factories with instructions to fill them out. However, only a small number submitted them on time. Although reminders were sent, progress was not effectively made. Out of the 853 factories that should have submitted the 1935 report forms, only 400 had submitted them to the Ministry by the end of 1936, which is less than half the total and is insufficient to understand the operating conditions of various industries. Continued efforts should be made to urge the factories to submit them as soon as possible for statistical purposes. The Ministry has now copied and attached the lists of factories that should submit the 1936 report forms and has included complete blank report forms, which were sent to the provincial and municipal governments for distribution to the factories, with a deadline of the end of February for submitting them to the Ministry for review. This is the general situation regarding ordering factories to submit report forms. It is believed that registering factories and submitting report forms are important matters of industrial administration that greatly affect the future of domestic industry. Some factories in various regions may not understand this, leading to hesitation, and the supervision and progress of the local competent authorities may be lenient. The numbers of factories registered and the number of report forms submitted in various regions by the end of 1936 are listed below for review. It is requested that the Executive Yuan separately order the provincial and municipal governments to strictly instruct the competent authorities to ensure that all existing factories that have not registered must complete registration by the end of June 1937. New factories established thereafter should continue to be ordered to register, and those factories that should have submitted the 1935 report forms but have not done so must be ordered to submit them as soon as possible. Factories that should submit the 1936 report forms must submit them to the Ministry by the end of March 1937 for review and statistical purposes. Accordingly, approval should be granted, and in addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance. After receiving this order, the Municipal Government immediately forwarded it to the Social Affairs Bureau to urge all unregistered factories to comply.

The rest were omitted.

### ### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor:

I have read the news item titled "Disturbances Caused by Demolition and Bamboo Fencing in Longhua Town" in your newspaper's local news section on the 1st of this month, which states, "Because Landlord Lu and others could not collect rent, they secretly signed a treaty with the abbot of the temple to demolish the houses there to increase the rent and collect rent deposits."

After investigation, the agreement between the temple and Yin Dong to borrow money to repair the houses was reviewed and approved twice by all the chief stewards of the temple. It was signed publicly in the abbot's hall of the temple, with the signatures of more than ten chief stewards and the attestation of lawyer Pan Zhensheng. There were also witnesses present. How could it be a secret agreement?

The article also stated, "Lu and others hired many bamboo craftsmen to build fences, which was discovered by the tenants there. Because the annual incense season is approaching, if the fencing is used to force them to move, it will be like putting hundreds of people to death."

After investigation, the temple had already entrusted lawyer Pan Zhensheng to notify the tenants to move, and the rent was waived for two months. More than three months have passed since then. The tenants did not raise any objections within the deadline. When the Public Works Bureau urged the demolition of the houses, the tenants continued to occupy the property and obstruct the fencing. This kind of transgressive behavior will be dealt with according to the law.

However, after investigation, Landlord Lu has been protecting Longhua Temple and has been the benefactor of a large amount of land for generations. The history is long and can be verified by the stone tablet and the "Book of Ten Thousand Years" from the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, Lu's approval is required for all matters concerning the use, renovation, and reform of real estate. The tenants fabricated the fact that it was a treaty between the landlord and the temple. Is this not a groundless accusation to confuse the public?

After investigation, a small number of tenants owe large amounts of rent, many months before the landlord took over the collection of rent. The largest amount owed is more than twenty months. This time, the agitation of the situation and the defiance of the law are nothing more than attempts to seek their own illegal benefits, regardless of public safety. Your newspaper's misinformation is likely to cause misunderstandings and confuse the public. I hereby send this special letter to correct this and hope that you will publish it to rectify public opinion.

Respectfully,

Lu Shusheng, Landlord of Longhua Temple

No. 4 Lujiayan, Longhua Road

March 8, 1937

To the Editor:

I have just read the news item titled "Daughter-in-Law Accuses Father-in-Law of Encroachment" in your newspaper's local news section of March 2nd, which states that "Huang Changmu schemed to become the district leader."

According to me, I have been the district leader of the 23rd district of Yangjing for many years. Huang Changlin is only the former guarantor in the district. I am sending this special letter to ask your newspaper to correct this to show the truth. I would be grateful.

Respectfully,

Zhou Jinsheng

### Indentured Girl Dies After Being Mortgaged for Rent and Suffering Injuries

Neighbors Express Outrage Over Whipping and Abuse; Lu Qingchen and Wife Accused of Assault

Lu Qingchen, a 46-year-old man from Yanshan, Hebei, and his wife Zhao, of the same age, are the owners of the Yishunxing tobacco and paper shop located behind the Bureau Gate Road in the Nanshi district. Huo Changfu, who used to live in the back building of Lu Qingchen's property, was unemployed and impoverished, owing Lu more than 40 yuan in rent and more than 20 yuan in borrowed money. Unable to repay the debt, Huo Changfu sold his young indentured daughter, Daidizi (8 years old), to the Lu family to raise as a daughter. Huo Changfu then moved elsewhere. Unexpectedly, because Lu Qingchen and his wife had their own children, they did not cherish Daidizi. Because Daidizi was frail and often ill, she could not work for them. Therefore, she was often whipped and abused by Lu and his wife. Daidizi did not dare to speak up. During the last lunar month of the year, Daidizi became ill due to her injuries and was bedridden. Despite the severe cold, Daidizi only wore a torn cotton trousers, and Lu and his wife did not provide her with medical treatment but still ordered her to work. As a result, Daidizi died from her injuries on the morning of December 29th of last year. The neighbors, outraged by the injustice, reported the incident to the police and the District Court. Prosecutor Li Fen examined the body and confirmed that Daidizi had bruises on her chest, left waist, back, buttocks, and head, caused by blunt force trauma. Therefore, Prosecutor Li arrested Lu Qingchen, released Lu's wife Zhao on bail, and initiated a public prosecution on the charge of Article 277, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Judge Wang Shanxiang opened the trial yesterday. Lu Qingchen testified that he had adopted the girl and treated her well, denying any abuse and claiming ignorance of the illness that caused her death. He said he had bought medicine such as Huichun Dan to treat her and that the injuries on her body were caused by falling out of bed. He denied any abuse and hired lawyer Xu Lin to defend him. Witnesses Zhao Chunfu and Li Guoxing were questioned. Because the case required further investigation, the court adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it for a later date. Lu Qingchen was remanded to custody, while Lu's wife Zhao remained on bail.

### ### Discussing Stubborn Ringworm

Ringworm described as stubborn indicates the difficulty in its treatment. It is caused by the transmission of the trichophyton and similar fungi. It occurs on the easily moistened parts of the skin, such as the inner thighs and scrotum. From there, it spreads to the perineum, buttocks, or from the pubic mound to the abdomen and reaches the navel. It may also occur on the breasts, armpits, and nape of the neck. It initially appears as a coin-sized red spot with slight scaling, gradually growing to the size of a ten- or twenty-cash coin. The center slightly fades and becomes depressed, while the surrounding outline is clear and raised like a dike, with small blisters appearing everywhere. Later, dry scabs are left behind. It gradually increases in size and often causes intense itching, disturbing sleep and easily leading to neurasthenia. If a bactericidal and antipruritic agent with deep tissue penetration is not used, it is difficult to cure. In the past, physicians often considered such stubborn ringworm and sores as tricky cases. Now, there is a quick solution. It involves applying "Ganlu" medicinal liquid. After repeated use, it has been recognized as the most excellent and effective remedy for skin diseases and ringworm. The ingredients of "Ganlu" are excellent, and its quality is pure. Moreover, it is easy to use. If a patient develops ringworm or similar symptoms or has already developed them and they have not healed, they should immediately use "Ganlu" to treat it. It can quickly heal and prevent recurrence. This product is a well-known product of the Shanghai Tong Ren Western Drug Company. All drug stores in various ports sell it. Patients can purchase and try it locally.

### General Overview of Stomach Disease Symptoms and Treatments

Stomach Disease Symptoms: Extremely complex. In brief: ㊀ Appetite. In severe stomach disease, gastric acid is often deficient, leading to a complete lack of appetite. However, conditions such as gastric ulcers, intestinal parasites, diabetes, and intestinal tumors can cause an abnormally increased appetite. In cases like gastric mucosal inflammation, gastric dilation, and gastric atony, appetite is slightly reduced compared to normal. ㊁ Thirst. Seen in conditions like acute gastric mucosal inflammation and gastric atony. ㊂ Nausea. Caused by abnormal fermentation, observed in gastric dilation, chronic gastric mucosal inflammation, and gastric atony. ㊃ Vomiting. Seen in conditions like renal mucosal inflammation, gastric ulcers, gastric dilation, and stomach cancer. ㊄ Belching. Sometimes caused by air being swallowed along with food, sometimes by abnormal fermentation, resulting in belching with a sour and foul odor. Persistent belching is mostly indicative of nervous stomach disorders. ㊅ Acid Reflux and Heartburn. Gastric ulcers, excessive gastric acid, and gastric dilation often cause this due to excessive hydrochloric acid or fermentation. ㊆ Stomach Fullness and Pressure. Fullness is more commonly seen in gastric dilation and atony, while a feeling of pressure is generally a symptom of nervous stomach disorders. ㊇ Stomach Pain. Gastric ulcers cause pain fifteen to forty-five minutes after eating, whereas nervous stomach pain is unrelated to food and may even feel better with pressure. Excessive gastric acid often causes pain during hunger. Gastric ulcer pain is like a knife, while gastric spasm pain is like being twisted. Stomach cancer causes dull pain. The symptoms of stomach ailments are numerous, and the suffering they cause is a constant, everyday ordeal. Their impact on health is significant. Now, there is "Wei Bi Ling". Despite the complexity of various stomach diseases, it can treat each one effectively. It relieves pain, stops vomiting, increases appetite, aids digestion, eliminates fullness and pressure, and prevents ulcers and cancerous growths. It is particularly effective in promoting secretion in cases of gastric acid deficiency and reducing acid levels in cases of gastric acid excess. Therefore, among stomach medications, it can be considered unique. This medicine is distributed by Tong Ren Western Medicine Company at No. 1 De Xing Lane, Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. The fixed price is one yuan per box. It is also available at major pharmacies and the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company in Shanghai and other locations.

### Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Exceptionally Weak This Month

Most goods acquired last month have already been disposed of this month.

The yarn market experienced morning declines followed by afternoon rebounds, maintaining a relatively calm trend. However, a general bearish sentiment prevails due to yarn factories operating at full capacity with numerous new machines being installed, leading to anticipated increased production. Supply and demand are expected to balance out, resulting in strong speculative selling. Past rumors of Indian merchants controlling the market have led to a change of course among followers, who are now cashing out spot goods for March futures, resulting in massive deliveries. Consequently, despite the global cotton industry's prosperity, Shanghai's market is minimally affected, and the trend of spot yarn prices becoming lower in the near term and higher in the long term is emerging.

Sharp Decline After the Second Session

At the opening of the spot yarn market, prices for all months rose uniformly, buoyed by the bullish market conditions for Grade 1 American cotton, leading to active sentiment. Prices for all months increased by five jiao to one yuan. Unexpectedly, selling pressure intensified at the opening of the second session, causing a sharp decline. The market widely speculated that certain large players were reversing their positions in the near months. Therefore, despite Grade 3 yarn prices rising by nine to ten yuan, the market remained difficult to invigorate. The spot yarn market closed with prices for the current month down 1.1 yuan from the previous day's closing price, and prices for distant months down 1.46 yuan. The market atmosphere remained weak at the afternoon opening. Many bullish investors following Indian merchants reversed their positions in February futures, cashing out goods acquired last month for delivery. Sentiment remained weak, with prices declining by another seven jiao, while prices for distant months remained unchanged. The market slightly improved after the second session. By the close, Tianjin merchants purchased several hundred bales of warehouse yarn at prices three to three and a half yuan cheaper than market prices. Short positions slightly recovered but remained firm. The result was that prices for all months rebounded by four, five, seven, and eight jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Yuda sold 3,600 bales, Jinchang 1,800 bales, Mingde 1,450 bales, Hengde 850 bales, Yuan Yi 1,400 bales, Dachangcheng 1,400 bales, Taichang 1,300 bales, Tonghe 1,100 bales, and Run Kang 900 bales. Changfeng purchased 1,300 bales, Deda 1,300 bales, Dafeng 1,700 bales, Zhenda 1,600 bales, Wang Taixing 1,550 bales, Xiecheng 2,900 bales, Dachang 2,850 bales, Taichang 850 bales, and Changji 700 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.

Spot Yarn Sales Still Showing Support

A total of 1,886 bales were purchased by various merchant groups throughout the day, with prices showing signs of weakness. The prices for each merchant group are as follows:

### Futures Cotton Market Performance Mediocre

The cotton market has stabilized. Although the rise in overseas Indian and American cotton markets feels dramatic, local sentiment remains mediocre due to sufficient cotton reserves and ample storage at factories. Market sources indicate that a significant portion of inland cotton has yet to be transported. Therefore, while foreign cotton prices rise daily, the price increase for local cotton remains restrained.

Foreign Cotton Price Increases Have Little Impact

At the opening of the spot flower market, prices for all months rose slightly by five to one jiao, while prices for distant months remained unchanged. At the opening of the second session, the market followed the decline in the yarn market, and sentiment eased. However, American cotton continued to rise, and the increase in Indian cotton prices was even more pronounced. Osaka's Grade 3 cotton prices also rose by 1.2 yuan or more. Despite this, local sentiment remained stable. The spot flower market closed with prices for all months down five fen from the previous day's closing price. Market conditions turned flat at the afternoon opening. Some expected a rebound due to the continuous rise in American cotton prices over several days, and buying interest eased slightly. The result was that prices for all months rose or fell by five to one and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Yuanxingchang sold 3,000 dan, Jinchang 2,700 dan, Dafu 5,000 dan, Tongji 3,100 dan, Mingde 2,400 dan, Changji 1,700 dan, Shenchang 1,500 dan, Changyu 1,800 dan, Renfeng 2,200 dan, Yuan Yi 4,500 dan, Changfeng 3,000 dan, Run Kang 5,700 dan, Yongda 1,800 dan, and Yikang 5,800 dan. Dafeng purchased 2,800 dan, Hengyi 7,100 dan, Ruida 2,900 dan, Senkang 4,800 dan, Taichang 6,000 dan, Dachang 5,400 dan, Xincheng 5,200 dan, Changhe 9,200 dan, and Shenji 2,100 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.

Spot Cotton Factory Demand Remains Strong

Spot cotton consumption remains fairly good. Factory demand remains strong, and the source of supply has not been disrupted.

### Grade 3 Yarn and Cotton Continue to Rise

Osaka dispatch on the 8th: Spot yarn prices increased by eight to ten yuan. 16-count fan-brand yarn at 249 yuan, up 9 yuan; 20-count goldfish-brand yarn at 270 yuan, up 10 yuan; 40-count five-star yarn at 400 yuan, also up 10 yuan; 42-count pheasant-brand yarn at 395 yuan, up 8 yuan. Grade 3 futures yarn prices increased by six jiao to 2.4 yuan, with near-month futures at 258 yuan and distant-month futures at 260.4 yuan. Futures cotton prices increased by 2.5 fen to 5.5 fen, with near-month futures at 78.6 yuan and distant-month futures at 82.25 yuan.

### Premium Indian Cotton Very Active Last Week

Due to rising American cotton prices last week, short sellers felt uneasy, resulting in a strong market. Premium cotton was very active, while low-grade cotton received little attention. Lancashire and mainland merchants made significant purchases. Japan remained absent from the market, except for old orders. It is reported that they are awaiting shipment to Japan. Indian yarn factories were more active than before. Developments in the Far East, with potential for growth, are worth noting. Given the current strong momentum, Japan may re-enter the market in the short term. A summary of last week's statistics is appended below (in thousands of bales):

### Piece Goods: Spring Goods Sales Picking Up

Spot goods mostly in the hands of fellow traders. Jardine & Co. receives large South Seas orders.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market, stimulated by the continued surge in overseas cotton markets, led factories to maintain firm prices. With clear and warm weather, sales of light-colored spring piece goods gradually improved. Replenishment of goods by retailers and wholesalers in various regions was quite busy. However, large-volume purchases were still lacking. Cloth prices changed very little, with Dong Pi fine cloth and fine twill (84 raw cloth) being the firmest. 84 raw cloth further increased by one jiao per piece, and fine twill and fine cloth increased by 2.5 fen. Yanghe brand fine cloth and fine twill experienced a shortage of spot goods, leading to a sharp increase of five to seven and a half fen. Factories' recent futures orders were nearly exhausted. Yesterday, companies such as Ito opened sales of Dragon Head, Flower Bird, Yanghe and other brands, fine cloth and fine twill for May and June futures amounting to nearly a thousand pieces. Factory bids were firmer for near-term and looser for distant-term goods. Recent futures orders were mostly in the hands of large traders. Therefore, although spot business was not very prosperous, prices remained very firm. Transactions mainly involved local colored cloth merchants with a strong demand for dyed blanks. Qingniao Tianjin merchants purchased over two hundred pieces of Qingdao Shuangfeilong fine cloth, due to the firm Qingdao cloth market. Sales of printed and patterned goods were best for striped plain gauze and Sichuan-style Canton silk. Sichuan, Guangdong and Hunan all had wholesale orders urging shipment; other goods also saw activity. Colored cloths such as blue cloth, Shilin cloth, and colored twill remained sluggish in the customer groups. However, small retail sales to inland merchant groups were still good. The factory's coarse cloth and heavy-weight goods were selling best. Jardine & Co. had accepted large orders from South Seas abroad, and as a result, daily shipments from Shanghai were greatly reduced, leading to a shortage of spot goods. The prices of fine cloth and fine twill were stable. There was smooth movement of goods to Guangdong, Yunnan, the Yangtze River region and Shanghai dye houses. However, the number of goods released by each factory was gradually reduced.

### Grains: Soybean Oil and Cakes Soar Again

Primarily due to the influence of the Dalian grain market, coupled with concerns of a potential shortage of supplies. Oil up 7 jiao, beans up 1 jiao, cake up 3 fen.

Yesterday's standard soybean oil and cake markets opened, immediately stimulated by the reported price increase in Dalian. Spot goods saw active demand from both local and outside buyers. Sentiment from both within and outside the industry was uniformly bullish, with both new long positions and short covering, while trading houses initially resisted selling, but after hearing that Dalian news had stabilized, they began to release holdings. However, buying interest from outside the industry remained strong. Market prices saw both increases and decreases, ultimately with standard oil rising 4.5 to 2.5 jiao, standard beans rising 3-4 fen, and near-month cake also rising 1.5 fen. The prices of distant-month futures fluctuated.

The surge in the soybean cake market yesterday was more pronounced than in other markets. This was due to the boost from the jump in Dalian market prices, as well as fears of a potential shortage of supplies, resulting in a dramatic increase. As a result, both peanut oil and soybean oil rose by 7 jiao, soybean cake rose by 3 fen, and soybeans were even more sought after. The main reason was the sharp increase in Dalian, which invalidated previous arrangements, leading to a near-certain supply disruption. Furthermore, bean shipments by rail were also reduced due to insufficient railway capacity. Therefore, traders generally considered the base extremely solid, and uniformly raised prices. As a result, the market price rose sharply by one jiao compared to last Saturday, totaling over 13,000 bags of various beans traded. The future trend is still expected to be bullish with no retreat. The sesame market in foreign firms saw increased activity amidst frequent increases in oil prices. It was heard last Saturday that Japanese merchants were releasing 600 tons, initially priced at 14.35 yuan, which was later raised to 14.4 yuan.

### Flour Prices Decline Steadily Throughout the Day

Excessive market value… sluggish actual sales.

Yesterday's flour market saw an initial period of stability followed by a decline in prices for all months. Prices for imported wheat saw only minimal fluctuations, with differences of only four to eight fen. After opening, initial sentiment was still positive, so opening prices were generally similar to the previous week's closing prices. The new flour market even saw a slight increase of one fen. However, softness was gradually seen in the second session, as the weather had improved but actual sales remained sluggish. Consequently, outside long positions began to offer positions, causing a decline of one fen for all months. As the afternoon market opened, selling pressure increased sharply, and trading activity also intensified, as retail long positions, observing sluggish actual sales, found it difficult to continue holding, and promptly unwound positions, causing the market to decline sharply, falling by three to five fen compared to the morning's highest prices. This situation was largely due to the excessive market value, inevitably leading to sluggish sales, so a trend of market fluctuation is expected.

### Wheat Market Affected by Sunny Weather

Yesterday's futures wheat market also saw a trend of initial increases followed by a decline. Due to fluctuations in imported wheat prices, sentiment outside the industry remained firm. March and April far-term new wheat futures even rose by three to five fen. By the close of the session, due to weakness in the futures flour market, sentiment suddenly turned downward, falling by two to three fen compared to the opening session. The afternoon market saw uniformly softening sentiment, as flour sales were weak and the weather was sunny, leading long positions to take advantage of the situation to sell. Market prices fluctuated by three, five, and eight fen. According to reports from within the industry, there is still an estimated 20-30% of wheat remaining in storage in the Jiangbei region. Assuming steady shipments, there will be no shortages before the new wheat season. The spot wheat market remained stable, with Shaoxing wheat opening at 6.6 yuan, and Tongzhou wheat at 6.51 yuan, with approximately 2,000 bags traded.

### Customer Xian Rice Sales Gradually Improve in the Aftermarket

Yesterday's customer xian rice market saw sluggish movement of goods from both local and outside buyers in the morning, with even more stagnant movement of Guangdong rice. Only three to four thousand bags of rice were traded throughout the day, while new arrivals kept flowing in, leading to very nervous sentiment. Prices of high-grade rice fell across the board by small amounts of five to six fen, with a continued trend of weakness. In the afternoon, local sales rebounded, and Guangdong buyers resumed inquiries, with Xiamen, Quanzhou, Shantou and Beiyang all making small purchases. The market immediately turned around, and prices also gradually recovered, with trading activity also increasing. Total sales increased to over 10,000 bags. If sales continue to be strong today and tomorrow, then market prices may improve further. A total of over 8,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, over 2,100 bags of Hunan rice, and 500 bags of Han rough rice were traded throughout the day.

### Hexia Rice Prices Continue Downward

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, approximately thirty boats arrived from various Hexia ports. Trading activity on the market remained sluggish. White glutinous rice prices fell by small fractions to one jiao. Thin indica rice prices fell by small amounts of five to six fen. Due to competition from late Jiangxi machine-milled rice, sheep indica rice prices fell by small amounts of six to seven fen. Dufu sharp rice prices showed signs of weakness, customer sharp rice was scarce, and other goods were weak. White Yuan fell by nearly one jiao.

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources of supply from various merchant groups increased, with a total of forty to fifty boats arriving, bringing approximately 9,300 to 9,400 piculs of rice. Of this, only about ten boats carried thin indica rice. Sentiment turned weak again. The local sales market turned stagnant. Package sales still consumed over 1,000 bags of thin indica rice, handled by Henan and Qingdao merchants, resulting in a flat and weak market. Thick glutinous rice prices fell by approximately one jiao. The limited arrivals of thin indica rice only allowed prices to recover by a few fen. Dufu sharp rice and Yin Yuan also fell by nearly one jiao.

### Finance: Gold Market Sees Selling Pressure

Although Customs Gold and Settlement Prices Rise, Resulting in an Eight-Jiao Decline

Yesterday, the gold market initially rose slightly due to a slight increase in overseas silver prices and narrowing exchange rates. The closing price of London bullion gold was up one penny. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. Customs gold units rose by three li. Standard gold prices rose to 1,159.8 yuan. The market opened flat, but selling pressure from buying accounts led to a sudden trend of oversupply. The market gradually declined, and continued to be pressured by sellers, remaining weak. A record of the day's market conditions follows:

The market opened at 1,157.8 yuan, the same price as last Saturday. Tong Taichang sold, retreating to 7.4 yuan. Dachangxiang made slight purchases, rising to 7.7 yuan. HSBC's official rates, with both British and American rates unchanged, had little impact. Tianfa, Dadecheng, Yuxinxiang sold bars. Although the plain tax rose by 25, it retreated to 7.6 yuan. Zhiyu took advantage of the low price to maintain positions, rising to 7.4 yuan. Dafeng Heng sold. The afternoon close was 1,157.6 yuan.

The afternoon market opened at 1,157.1 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongchunyuan, Yongda, Decheng, Dafeng, Hengxianghe sold bars. The closing price was 1,157 yuan. The price fluctuated by a total of eight jiao throughout the day, resulting in an eight-jiao decline.

The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, rose to 1,159.8 yuan. Based on the closing price, the premium was approximately less than three yuan. Spot market conditions were still stable. Raw gold was sold by silver shops to Tongfengheng's own brand at a premium of 15 yuan, totaling seventy taels. Tianjin goods were priced at a premium of 14 yuan. The buying price for ordinary goods was eleven yuan, but there were few transactions.

Trading activity was normal. In summary, Tongfengyu, Dachangxiang, Dafengheng, Yingxiang and others were on the buying side, while Tianfa Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yuxinxiang, Xianghe, Chunyuan, Yongyuanmao, and Yong and others were on the selling side. The total number of shares for April futures was 4,144, with a total of twenty-six long accounts and thirteen short accounts. The number of transactions was 189 shares in the morning session and 154 shares in the afternoon session.

Yesterday, Dadecheng released 105 public bills, and Qian Changxiang released 70 bills. Qingfayong received settlement prices of 1,158 yuan. Dafengheng released 56 public bills yesterday, and Qian Changxiang released 7 bills.

Excluding public bills, the remaining shares for this month total 581, with a total of three long accounts and three short accounts.

### Foreign Exchange Market Lacks Momentum

Although Sun Fung and Mobil Cover American Dollars, China Merchants Bank Sells

Compared to last Saturday, the British exchange rate was flat, while the American exchange rate was tighter by .03125. As the market opened, Japanese banks continued to sell East exchange rates. Hong Kong and Jewish merchants continued to hold. Banks still maintained their positions. HSBC's official rates, with both British and American rates unchanged, and the balancing tax up by 25, caused the market to fluctuate and stabilize. Later, although Sun Fung Foreign Company and Mobil covered American dollars, China Merchants Bank sold, and there was no momentum. At noon, the British exchange rate was flat and the American exchange rate was loose. The aftermarket saw banks taking positions, but most transactions were near-term, and there was a lot of exchange rate trading. Trading was relatively stable. The closing price for near-term selling prices was 1 shilling 2.625 pence for the British exchange rate and 29.71875 yuan for the American exchange rate. Compared to last Saturday, both British and American exchange rates were flat. China Merchants Bank saw little change. Hong Kong merchants slightly held American dollars. Qiao Zhifu held shillings.

### Securities: Government Bonds See Negligible Fluctuations

Yesterday, the government bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained extremely sluggish. Large-scale transactions were few and far between. Retail investors were mostly eager to swap positions, resulting in minimal price fluctuations. The trend remained fairly steady, but due to the stability of the current situation and balanced buying and selling pressure, the bond market continued to fluctuate. Throughout the day, the morning opening saw firm and bullish sentiment, with retail investors making significant purchases. Numbers 10, 77 and others also bought a lot, while Numbers 5 and 13 sold. This caused market prices to rise slightly by five fen to one jiao and a half. The trading floor was increasingly quiet in the second session. The above numbers made slight purchases, while retail investors entered and exited haphazardly. C and Ding bonds rose by five fen, while Type B bonds for next month fell by a small five fen. The afternoon market showed an increasingly stagnant trend. The opening involved scattered retail investors swapping positions, with market prices fluctuating only slightly by five fen. At the close, Numbers 16 and 71 and others slightly sold off. C and Ding bonds showed a weakening decline of roughly one jiao, but overall sentiment remained sluggish. The overall result was that all unified bonds only showed a fluctuation of five fen to one jiao. The total number of transactions was 2.6 million yuan. A comparison of the price fluctuations, highs, and lows is listed in the table to the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Sugar Market: Production Prices Reported Higher; Coarse and White Sugar Rebound by Five Fen

Yesterday's sugar market saw a slight rebound as Parisian raw sugar prices turned higher. The association set prices for Grade 24 raw white spot goods at 22.8 yuan and transit goods at 7.4 yuan, both up five fen. Dongbai spot goods and transit goods of numbers 489 all maintained their original prices. The Zhenji Dahua Jinxin factory's refined white sugar and other sugars also saw no changes. The trade of numbered goods was very limited, as actual sales were still not significantly active. Only Guangdong merchants opened sales of over three hundred new arriving Beihai slab Qing sugar, priced at 11.4 yuan. The trend is still strong. Chao sugar production prices were set, and market numbers in Shanghai were also observing the opportunity, with no prospects for development in the short term.

The joint company held its first auction this week for Guangdong sugar futures. Slightly increased trading saw the sale of 2,111 bags of Shunde factory's Five Sheep brand coarse white sugar for 22.6 yuan, and 430 bags of Dongguan factory's coarse white sugar for the same price. Huizhou medium fine white sugar at the original price; no transactions were made.

### North-South Goods: Candied Dates Tighten as Top-Grade Supplies Dwindle

Mid-grade candied dates, such as "Tutu" brand, saw a potentially looser market due to ongoing arrivals. However, the top-grade market was tight due to a shortage of goods. Special Grade goods were selling for 60 yuan, large-face goods for 46-47 yuan, and higher-quality "Tutu" brand goods for 44 yuan, with protection against declines. Lower-grade Gong-face goods sold for 40-38 yuan.

### Nanning Star Anise Sales Turn Weak

Since the beginning of spring, Nanning star anise had reached 40 yuan. However, recently sales have weakened, and a certain company released a batch of inferior goods, revealing a slightly lower price of only 27.5 yuan, inevitably affecting the market. Currently, Nanning goods are priced at 39 yuan, and Beihai goods at 38 yuan, with potentially softer prices.

### Silk and Tea: New Silk Continues to See Selling Pressure Yesterday

Yesterday, overseas silk markets saw no market in New York. Yokohama spot goods briefly surpassed the 900-yuan level, with spot prices up 15 yuan and futures prices up 6 yuan compared to last Saturday. However, by the afternoon, both had fallen back by around 10 yuan. Shanghai silk markets saw continued selling pressure on new silk. For example, B-grade, 7-8 evenness, 20-22 denier heavy reeled silk for June-July delivery from the White Factory was priced at 745 yuan. Companies such as Dachang and Lianna each completed transactions. French silk sales showed no progress. User silk demand gradually increased, and factories such as Mayar each purchased goods. Common B-grade Tiantai goods were priced at 755 yuan, up 15 yuan compared to last week.

### Metals: Wessco Iron Inventory Shallow

New transactions for 200-pound American Wessco iron have recently been very active, with customer groups and factories all procuring supplies. Due to its low price, stockpilers have also been absorbing significant amounts, so market conditions are very firm. Standard prices have been rising rapidly, selling for 42 yuan per box (old steel factory) and 40.075 yuan (new steel factory). However, due to the shallow inventory, prices have improved significantly compared to the past. Based on the recent increase in overseas prices, coupled with limited sources of supply, the outlook for the market is very promising.

### Six-Foot White Iron Recovers Bullish Momentum

Six-foot Dong white iron experienced a softening in the market, retreating to 1.17-1.18 yuan, due to spot goods being released by stockpilers. Recently, overseas prices for black iron sheet and zinc (both raw materials for making white iron sheet) have been rising rapidly, so the market outlook has improved again. Market sentiment has expanded and bullish momentum has recovered. Yesterday, it was observed that 5,500-5,600 sheets were sold, priced at 1.2-1.223 yuan. It was heard that Sichuan merchants had a strong buying intention yesterday, so opening prices are expected to rise further in the coming market.

### Introducing "Report on Observation of Japanese Cooperative Enterprises"

Mr. Chen Zimi, an expert member of the Shanghai Municipal Cooperative Enterprise Committee, was dispatched to Japan last year to observe cooperative enterprises in the neighboring country and gained considerable insights. After returning to China, he immediately engaged in compiling the book "Report on Observation of Japanese Cooperative Enterprises," which elaborates in detail on Japanese cooperative enterprises, as well as cooperative pawnshops, cooperative societies, and companies. It is indeed a valuable reference work for cooperative enterprises. The book also includes prefaces by Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, Director of the Cooperative Department of the Ministry of Industry, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. The book has already been published, with a price of 30 cents per copy. The publisher is Shanghai Liming Bookstore, and it is sold by Shanghai Bank Weekly, Life Bookstore, Nanjing Chinese Cooperative Society, and major bookstores.

### Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (5)

— Pan Shihao

(Two) Company Reporting Form

According to Article 45 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, when a joint-stock limited company or a joint-stock partnership company issues shares, it shall report the total amount of shares, types of shares, amount per share, and business year to the local competent tax collection authority. For shares already issued, each company shall, within one month from the date of implementation of these regulations, report the aforementioned matters to the local competent tax collection authority. Furthermore, according to Article 46 of the regulations, companies... shall, within one month from the date of implementation of these regulations, report the name, address, business, actual amount of capital or share capital to the local competent tax collection authority. The company reporting form is the declaration registration form used to report the aforementioned matters. The matters to be filled in are explained as follows:

(1) Mutual Title

A company must have a fixed name; therefore, the name is listed first on this form. Furthermore, companies are categorized as unlimited liability companies, limited partnership companies, joint-stock limited companies, and joint-stock partnership companies; therefore, the type of company should also be clearly stated in the name. The type of company is actually part of the company name. The information filled in should be the same as that filled in the license obtained from the company registration authority. The name section of this form is pre-printed with the words "股份" (shares). If it is an unlimited liability company or a limited partnership company, these two characters should be crossed out. This should be noted when filling in the form.

(2) Business Type

According to Articles 13, 71, 88, and 217 of the Company Law, the type of business of a company should be clearly stipulated in the articles of association. The company license issued by the Ministry of Industry will reflect what is stipulated in the articles of association. The information filled in on this form should be the same as that stated in the articles of association and the company license. According to Article 12 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 12 of the Guidelines for the Collection of Income Tax on First-Category Profit-Seeking Enterprises, any buying or selling or business outside of the main business and related businesses should be included in the total income if there is a profit. If there is a loss, the tax collection authority cannot consider it a necessary and reasonable expense or loss in business. When filling in the business type on this form, attention should be paid to the scope of the business.

(3) Company Address

According to the Company Law, the location of the company's headquarters and branch offices is also a matter for registration. The company address filled in on this form is the registered location of the company, which is also the address listed on the registration license for the company's headquarters and branch offices issued by the Ministry of Industry. If it is the headquarters, the address of the headquarters should be filled in. If it is a branch office, the address of the branch office should be filled in.

(4) Name of Responsible Person

Article 27 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the business responsible person shall be responsible for reporting and paying the first category of income from profit-seeking enterprises and withholding and paying the second and third categories of income. The nature of the responsible person's name filled in on this form should be the same. According to the provisions of the Company Law, in an unlimited liability company, a limited partnership company, and a joint-stock partnership company, the partners with unlimited liability have the right and obligation to conduct business. However, if the articles of association stipulate that one or several of the partners shall conduct the business, that stipulation shall prevail. The company's external representative may also be specifically designated as a certain partner by the articles of association or with the consent of all partners. If no specific designation has been made, each partner may represent the company. In a joint-stock limited company, the directors are responsible for conducting business. One or several of the directors may be specifically designated to represent the company according to the articles of association or the resolution of the shareholders' meeting. According to these provisions, the business of the company should be the responsibility of the partner with unlimited liability or the director representing the company. However, the Company Law also provides for the position of manager for various companies. The manager should be under the control of the partner with unlimited liability or the director and engage in the operation of the business. Therefore, the manager is also the responsible person for the business. For the convenience of reporting and paying income tax, it seems appropriate for the name of the responsible person filled in on this form to be the name of the manager if the company has a manager.

(5) Total Share Amount, Amount per Share, Paid-in Share Amount

According to Articles 88 and 217 of the Company Law, the total share amount and the amount per share are stated in the articles of association and company license of a joint-stock limited company and a joint-stock partnership company. The information filled in on this form should naturally be the same. However, for unlimited liability companies and limited partnership companies, according to Articles 13 and 11 of the Company Law, there are only provisions regarding the type and value of the partners' contributions, and no mention of the total share amount. As for the amount per share, in this type of company, the contributions of each partner are not called shares, and there is no uniform amount per share. When filling in this form, it seems appropriate to fill in the total amount of contributions in the position of the total share amount and change the word "股份" (shares) to "出資" (contribution). The position for the amount per share can be left blank. Only joint-stock limited companies and joint-stock partnership companies need to fill in the paid-in share amount. According to the provisions of the Company Law, after a shareholder with limited liability of shares subscribes for shares, he can first pay half of the amount per share and does not have to pay the full amount at once. The total amount of shares actually received by the entire company should be filled in on this form to correspond to the total share amount. As for unlimited liability companies and limited partnership companies, the partners' contributions are paid in full at once. The total amount of contributions is the paid-in share amount.

(6) Types of Shares

According to company regulations, unlimited liability companies and limited partnership companies are not allowed to issue shares. The limited liability partner portion of joint-stock limited companies and joint-stock partnership companies can issue shares after company registration. From the perspective of the shareholder's account name, there are two types of shares: registered and unregistered. The amount of unregistered shares shall not exceed one-third of the total share amount. From the perspective of the shareholder's rights, there are preferred shares and common shares. All of these should be clearly stated in this form. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Dream

— (Yan Maode)

Marten once said: "Everything now is but the sum of the dreamers of past eras—the realization of the dreams of past eras makes life valuable, releases mankind from baseness, and elevates mankind from mediocrity and ugliness—we all have to thank our dreamers."

So dreaming is not a bad thing. In dreams, one can gain fresh life, and can guide the path to success. Electrician Edison once dreamed of extracting a milky substance from weeds that could be used to make rubber. He started experimenting from dreams. After two years, he actually discovered it.

But to have dreams without practical application is a waste of energy, without benefiting reality. Having dreams must be accompanied by firm will and determination to realize the dream. Not only should dreams be developed as much as possible, but doing must follow behind dreams. Having only wishes, without exerting strength to realize the dreams, is enough to ruin things. Therefore, one must have practical dreams. Dreaming with hard work, and continuous effort, is useful.

Dreams are stimulants, but also poisons. They can make people foolish, and also make people successful. Let dreams be our slaves, and not let them be our masters.

### Jilin City after the Incident

— Wu Jiang

If you had lived in Jilin before, and return to visit again after five years, the changes there would make you gasp.

Stepping onto the road outside Xinkaimen, what you see are rows of low, flat houses with a different style. The facade decorations and the arrangement in the windows are also completely different. This road is called the Commercial Concession. The × country's consulate is built here, so everything surrounding the consulate is built into uniform residences and shops, forming a different landscape. This cannot help but make you feel as if you are in a completely unfamiliar environment, so strange and surprising.

Walking into Henan Street, the commercial center in the city, the wooden sidewalks on both sides have been demolished. Although the street is wider than before, the market is covered with a layer of extremely desolate atmosphere. Strolling into the Hexinglong Department Store, which is the best in the city, you only see more shop assistants than customers, quiet and deserted. The golden age of bustling crowds has passed. But the opposite is true for those Zuixiange, Yunzhongxianguan..., which have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain on the streets and alleys. Every evening, there are crowded with cars and horses, really bustling. It is said that those "drunk immortals" freeze to death by the hundreds every year in the snowy and icy weather. How alarming is that "hundred"!

On Dongdatan (street name) along the river, you can no longer see people from Shandong, Hebei and other provinces. Before the incident, this street was their gathering base. Every year, many people came from inside the pass to find a living and settled here, so this place became the birthplace of their family businesses. However, in these years, under the glorious light of Wangdao, they could not live as before and fled back to the pass like stray dogs one after another. Now this place has been "taken over by magpies and occupied by doves" by another kind of people. — The street scene is strangely desolate.

The gates of the residences of the wealthy in the Dongguan and Yanjiang Street areas are all tightly closed. The courtyards are as quiet as if no one lived there. No matter how much you knock, they won't easily open the door for you. What's going on? It is said that they are afraid of those ronin or Koreans who visit from time to time. When they step into the gate, they will peddle the things they carry: such as letter paper, envelopes, or towels, soap, etc. It is not accepted to reject their kindness in coming to the door; it is accepted, but you have to give them ten or twenty times the high price to fill their desires. There are also those who come in and tell you about his years of wandering in the Northeast, suffering all kinds of misfortunes, and now want to return to his country, lacking travel expenses, etc. While talking, he takes out watches or rings and other things, earnestly asking you to keep them. Then, if you are smart, you will quickly give him a decent amount of money and return the original object, so that you can avoid all unnecessary entanglements; isn't this called "civilized plunder"?

▼ News from the Painting World The Suzhou National Painting Tutoring and Research Society is hosted by Mr. Liu Junran and other famous painters in Wuzhong. It has been around for years, with complete equipment and serious teaching. Many students follow them. Starting this year, a correspondence department will be added to serve those outside the area who love Chinese painting. Detailed information is available and welcome to request it. Send letters to the society inside the Yuandu Abbot's Room, Yuanmiao Temple, Suzhou. Also, Liu Junwen will hold a public exhibition of hundreds of his masterpieces over the years at the Daxin Company in Shanghai in early April. It is expected that he will gain a great reputation at that time.

### New Year's Eve of Bingzi

— (Tianxu Wosheng)

Suddenly returning home on New Year's Eve, the children started shouting. A dog and three chicks were vying to be around my knees. The crowd spoke in unison, all saying "good, good, good." Two hands were not enough to hold, and two elbows were not enough to hug. My wife came downstairs to greet me, smiling before saying a word. "Why say you won't return? You've finally returned." "Since you were going to return, why didn't you return earlier?" I said unexpectedly, but it felt wonderful. An uninvited guest arrived, why bother sending notice in advance? I was originally in my hometown, ready to be the host, inviting friends in the city to enjoy chicken and millet together. Thinking back to my home, I always feel like someone is missing. Coming by express train is like sleeping. Time cannot be bought. Why waste it? Separation and joy, all depend on the heart. Don't ask about the past, the future is unpredictable. Life is like a bubble. All destinies are coincidences. Tonight, there is no need to sleep. We will sit together until dawn. I am still afraid of being in a dream, hearing the rooster crowing in my ears.

▼ Correction: In the Jianglou Poem on March 1st, "Just a smile" should be "Just started to smile."

### Phoenix Swapping Nests

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Eleven (Whispered Sentiments of Compassionate Parents, Confessions of Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dimming Emerald Dais, Inspired by the Scenery)

But at this time, the scenery in the sky was even more worthy of appreciation, so he still leaned on the window sill, looking out, unwilling to leave. Later, Xiaoju brought up the kerosene lamp with both hands, put it down, and squeezed to the window sill to stand, smiling and asking: "Miss, what are you looking at that is so interesting? I'll take a look too." Menglan saw that she was holding the window sill with both hands, only supporting herself upwards, and said with a smile: "What are you keeping? Why are you working so hard?" Xiaoju said: "Miss, what are you looking at? I'm looking at what you are looking at." Menglan pushed her away and immediately closed the window, laughing, "What are you being silly about?" Xiaoju took two steps back, leaning against the door, looking at him and said: "Am I being silly? Because Miss was squeezing forward to look, that's why I followed and looked forward." Menglan smiled: "I have a mental illness, are you following me to be mentally ill too?" Xiaoju stretched out his head cutely, paying attention to Menglan's face. He asked: "Why is Miss always acting so crazy and dazed?" Menglan said: "You want to ask me this reason? You...you won't understand. But if you don't understand, that's your blessing." Xiaoju looked at him and said: "Miss, what does this mean?" Menglan said: "Tell you what it means, haven't you already understood? If you understand, you won't have any blessing. Do you still want to be without blessing? Don't be silly here, let's go downstairs together." Xiaoju looked at Menglan, smiled with his head down, and went downstairs. Menglan turned up the lamp wick a little, took a book and spread it on the table, just about to sit down to read. But Xiaoju shouted loudly downstairs: "Miss, come down to eat quickly, everyone is waiting for you. Madam told me to call you." Menglan then faced the mirror hanging on the wall, putting on a welcoming smile. Smiling once, she was still afraid that it wasn't very natural. She looked in the mirror four or five times in a row, and then said to herself: "It's probably okay." She touched her hair, and tugged at her clothes, and then went to the main room to eat dinner. When she was sitting at the table, she was always afraid that her attitude wasn't natural enough, so she deliberately talked and laughed with her mother and sister-in-law, showing a bit of happiness. Mrs. Jiang was indeed different from usual when eating this meal, always looking him up and down all over his body. Menglan smiled and ate the meal, but did not immediately go upstairs. She washed her face and drank tea in her mother's room for a long time, chatting for a while before returning upstairs. When eating, the second young mistress was most worried, besides always looking at him, she also followed his tone of voice and found something to talk about. Only after he went upstairs did she feel relieved, but was Menglan's mind really settled? This was the case at home. The next morning, when he went to school, those two eyebrows were wrinkled together again. He was the earliest person to get up in the whole family. He frowned, and only Xiaoju, who got up to serve tea, saw his expression. (142)

Minor Records of Celebrities

### Anecdotes of the World's Four Giants (Part 1)

— Chao Xi

1. Stalin, who Sleeps in Boots

In the Soviet Union, Stalin, the most powerful man today, is famous in the world for sleeping in boots. His hard bed is placed next to his mahogany desk. According to researchers, this desk was the one used by the notorious Interior Minister Trepov, famous during the imperial era, to conduct official business.

It was this Interior Minister Trepov who sentenced Stalin, a highly dangerous revolutionary, to life imprisonment in the salt mines of Siberia. Originally, people sentenced to such exile had no possibility of returning to their hometown. However, in a twist of fate, not only did Stalin eventually return, but he also became the owner of the mahogany desk that had once held the power to control him. Now, Stalin signs and issues his powerful documents on this desk, with its deep connection to the past.

Stalin, the cornerstone of the Communist Party, dresses extremely simply, truly befitting the king of a worker-peasant nation. He wears a rough shirt, black velvet trousers, and always boots. An outfit with a tie and coat is the ultimate in attention to detail. The only decorations in his outfit are the red tie and the collar of his undershirt.

Stalin is a figure who never smiles, but even more remarkable is that what he says is very difficult for people to understand. Unless one has lived in his hometown of the Caucasus, it is not easy to understand his speech. What he says is a kind of mixed language spoken by Slavic Jews, without much grammar. When he was exiled to Siberia, he was influenced daily by the many Jewish political prisoners there.

Stalin, who holds absolute power in Russia, could live a life of extreme luxury, but the only things he eats daily are onions mixed with eggs (seasoned with chicken gravy) and coarse black bread. He is also suspicious that the cook will poison him, and always eats food he prepares himself. He is truly a hard-working man.

2. Kemal, who Loves to Dance

Kemal, the outstanding hero of the new Turkey, was born in Thessaloniki on the Mediterranean coast. He has the natural character of a Turkish soldier. His English is very good, so he not only often speaks English, but also writes all his private letters in English. Being such an extreme person, he never sits on cushions or sleeps on futons like ordinary Turks. He sits on a chair and sleeps in a bed. The only Turkish custom that Kemal retains is the habit of leisurely sipping coffee after eating grilled beef and meat buns.

He is an extremely diligent worker, desperately indulging in play. The introduction of jazz dancing into Turkey and the popularity of dancing in Turkey are entirely due to Kemal. Among them, the tango and foxtrot are his favorite styles. Kemal can be said to be a modern gentleman among the dictators of the day.

### Viewing Plum Blossoms (Part 2)

— Ya Fei

But my strong desire for appreciation cannot be satisfied by watching from the window every day. Therefore, even in the middle of the day, I would carry a volume of my favorite book and stroll towards the plum blossom forest, as simple as snowflakes and as misty as smoke. I would sit on a square platform there, turning the pages of the book while admiring the plum blossoms. The light breeze would carry a burst of fragrance towards my nostrils, intoxicating me. When I read something interesting, the book would fall from my hands onto the grass. My consciousness only felt that something was dazzling me together with the plum blossoms in front of me, but what exactly was that thing? I couldn't remember it for a moment. However, in short, it was powerfully tempting me, grabbing me, making me so leisurely and fascinated!

Occasionally, two small birds would fly around like shuttles between the branches of the plum forest. They seemed to be happily jumping and chirping, one tree after another, making the plum blossoms not feel lonely. But sometimes, touching a thin branch would startle those plum petals, causing them to detach from the branches in a hurry and float to the ground. Floating, floating, one piece fell into the grassy path, and another fell again, tirelessly floating, floating, floating. Finally, this dull gray grassy path was covered with pieces of white things. And even more petals, like lone widows in revolving white clothes, would intimately stick to my shoulders and hair; I bent back my sleeves to take a closer look, and felt that it looked like a delicate pattern. Holding it in my palm, I felt a kind of pitying caress. I wanted to pick some up and treasure them, like treasuring my own life.

— Returning wanderer! Soon you will wander to the ends of the earth again, but your only confidante—plum blossom, perhaps you won’t come to accompany us next year when it blooms again. In speechless silence, I understood the satire that the plum blossoms gave me, but I finally felt ashamed and painful. Looking up, another plum blossom petal was imprinted on my forehead, and I couldn't help but shiver. In that way, a memory that had been lingered on for many years returned to my mind. I remembered my wandering life, remembered the hope of seeing plum blossoms, remembered the innocence and ignorant happiness of my childhood, remembered…

A feeling of a young man being soaked in old age, sadly crossed my lonely heart:

— The precious youth will never return, but the plum blossoms I saw in my childhood are still as lovely as ever!

### The Poisonous Fragrance of Wildflowers

— Le Jia

Accusation of a Double Offense

“The wildflowers are always more fragrant than the domestic flowers.” This saying may be true, but the fragrance of wildflowers is often poisonous. Smelling this poisonous fragrance will give those who love to pick wildflowers a serious blow.

Similarly, those who disregard their families and go outside for wild affairs will also be infected with gonorrhea. Suffering from gonorrhea will give them unspeakable pain.

Moreover, people suffering from gonorrhea not only harm themselves, but also bring disaster to their wives, which can be said to be a "double offense." What is there to say about "wildflowers being more fragrant than domestic flowers"?

As for gonorrhea infection, it is important to seek treatment quickly, because in the early acute stage, although the pain is more severe, it is also easier to cure. If you delay treatment or take ineffective medications, it will become a prolonged chronic condition, with the risk of sudden onset of gonorrhea-related complications at any time. Therefore, gonorrhea patients should only take "Deli Ping." It is based on the latest scientific formula, with the power to directly reach the lesion, completely eliminate gonococci. Whether it is new or old gonorrhea, leucorrhea in women, and all gonorrhea complications, taking it can be effective and achieve complete recovery. Those who have committed a double offense or want to avoid committing one, please pay attention.

### Prerequisites for Implementing a Public Health System (Part 1)

— Zhu Jiqing (Speaker), Kuai Wenquan (Recorder)

Fellow students, the term "public health system" has filled your ears since you arrived at the Public Health Personnel Training Class of the Department of Health. What methods should be used to realize the public health system? Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a substantial study of the prerequisites for a public health system. I will now share my personal research. I would not call this a lecture; I hope that my fellow students will offer their critiques. This is my personal wish.

What is the motivation for a public health system? The need for a public health system is not accidental; it is based on several factors. We can see this from two perspectives:

Looking at it internationally, we can identify three reasons:

1. People's thinking was completely different before and after the European War. The European War can be considered a turning point in the political, economic, and educational transformations of Europe. Before the European War, ideas were based on a minority perspective and lacked foundation. After the European War, everything changed completely, starting from the lowest levels. Floating idly in the upper echelons is no longer viable. Take medicine, for example. Previously, there was chemical physiology, anatomy, etc. Now, with the advancement of medicine, it is felt that previous scholarship is insufficient; it is necessary to study sociology in conjunction for easier effectiveness. This is because medicine is not a pure science; it must arise from social consciousness.

2. U.S. President Hoover established the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care in 1927, which had a five-year plan. When the committee published its findings in 1932, the results were a blow not only to the United States itself but also internationally. People pointed out the errors in medical organization, and we cannot simply copy them.

3. The medical construction in Soviet Russia and several Eastern European countries. They have already implemented a revolution in modern medicine. The art of healing in Soviet Russia was previously handled by private individuals, resulting in disorganized medical facilities based on individual interests. Soviet Russia completely eradicated this traditional concept and established a socialized medical facility based on rational design and organization, which can serve as a model for us.

There are five domestic motivations:

1. National health bankruptcy. The mortality rate is higher than other countries, and life expectancy is shorter. Emphasizing quality over quantity puts us at a disadvantage compared to other nations. Although the physical training of our citizens has been resolved in theory, it has not been implemented. However, the authorities at least have some understanding.

2. Weak national economy.

Health expenditures in rural areas cannot exceed one dime per person, and in urban areas, they cannot exceed 3.5 to 5 dimes per person. The weakness of the national economy has reached an extreme point.

3. Low national education.

According to a survey in Ding County, each person spends an average of five dimes, and each family spends an average of five yuan, on old medicine or praying to gods and Buddhas. Such deep-rooted superstitions must be eradicated, and education is essential.

4. Lack of medical talent.

According to statistics from the Department of Health as of January 11, 1937, there were a total of 8,722 physicians nationwide. Even if there are 2,000 more physicians who have not registered, that is still one physician for every 40,000 people. There were only 19 registered dentists, 2,964 midwives, and 2,269 pharmacists. As for nurses, it is estimated that there are about 7,000 to 8,000, making the total number of medical personnel less than 20,000. Given the size of our country and the population, this is insufficient. Furthermore, physicians are concentrated in cities, and there are none in rural areas. Thus, 80% to 85% of our country's farmers do not receive the protection of scientific medicine.

5. Current medical facilities are not widespread.

Currently, except for a few major trading ports that have scientific medical equipment, the number in remote and inconvenient rural areas is almost zero.

With these five domestic difficulties and the recent significant resolution of international medical issues, the domestic and international medical situations have converged to form a method that suits both the trends and the economic conditions of rural areas: a public health system.

The meaning of a public health system:

1.  A public health system aims to increase and protect the health of all citizens.

2.  A public health system is planned. For example, when traveling from a starting point to a destination, there will inevitably be obstacles. Immediately knocking down obstacles is a revolutionary approach, which is not permissible in our country's social situation. Temporarily retreating when encountering obstacles and advancing when the opportunity arises will eventually lead to the destination. This is an evolutionary approach, which is needed for us to promote a public health system. Retreating and not advancing, or even changing direction, is something we do not need.

### Review of Intestinal Tuberculosis

— Zhong Zhihe

Ulcerative intestinal tuberculosis is the most common complication of pulmonary tuberculosis. According to autopsies at the Metropolitan Hospital in New York, 72% of deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis have ulcerative enteritis. According to a survey by Brown and Sampson, approximately 50% to 80% of deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis exhibit intestinal tuberculosis. According to statistics from Montcfiare Hospital, among 526 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis, 344 had complications of intestinal tuberculosis, accounting for 65%.

Furthermore, at the Metropolitan Hospital in New York, among 744 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, X-ray examinations revealed ulcerative enteritis. However, only 29% of them showed gastrointestinal symptoms during the examination.

According to the research of many physicians, positive sputum (containing tubercle bacilli) is closely related to intestinal tuberculosis. According to the hospital's statistics, among 740 patients with intestinal tuberculosis, only 4.5% had negative sputum.

In addition, lung cavities have a direct and close relationship with ulcerative enteritis. According to statistics, 95% of patients with ulcerative enteritis have cavities in their lungs. The various aspects of intestinal tuberculosis are described below for reference:

(A) Location of Intestinal Tuberculosis

The location of intestinal tuberculosis is noteworthy. Most of the infected areas are in the cecum and the terminal ileum, appendix, and ascending colon.

According to Roepke's survey, in patients with open pulmonary tuberculosis, 50% have involvement of the entire intestinal tract. Damage to the small intestine accounts for 90%, the colon 80%, and the appendix 70%. From the cecum to the rectum, the incidence gradually decreases.

According to Maylerd, citing statistics from Feuwick and Dodwel, among 883 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis, ulcers were found in the intestines of 500 patients. The colon had the highest number of cases, with the ascending colon accounting for 51.4%, the transverse colon 30.6%, the descending colon 21%, and the sigmoid colon 13.5%.

(B) How Intestinal Tuberculosis is Contracted

1.  Tubercle bacilli reach the intestines through blood circulation, leading to infection.
2.  Tubercle bacilli infect the intestines through lymphatic circulation.
3.  Pulmonary tuberculosis patients who swallow sputum containing tubercle bacilli that are not killed by stomach acid cause intestinal infection.

(C) Symptoms of Intestinal Tuberculosis

1.  Night stool is the most valuable symptom. Ordinary colitis often causes diarrhea in the morning.
2.  Persistent diarrhea is also a characteristic of intestinal tuberculosis. The frequency of diarrhea ranges from two to three times a day in mild cases to eight to ten or more times a day in severe cases. Intermittent constipation may also occur.
3.  The stool is thin, brownish-black, or resembles "slag-like" color, with an abnormal odor. It often contains decaying intestinal matter and blood (or occult blood). However, 10% to 20% of patients may experience constipation.
4.  Body temperature is often elevated and persistent, or fluctuates unpredictably.
5.  Relative bradycardia is present.
6.  Body weight decreases sharply due to poor appetite, impaired intestinal digestion, and the inability of the intestines to absorb food, leading to rapid weight loss. According to Fishberg's experience, weight gained over several months, which is valuable and hard-earned, can disappear almost entirely in a week. In two to four weeks, the patient becomes emaciated and haggard.
7.  Severe anemia is present, with a pale, bronze-like complexion. In the late stages of the disease, the extremities often exhibit edema and shortness of breath, and the patient is restless.

(D) Prevention of Intestinal Tuberculosis

1.  Advise patients to avoid swallowing sputum and inform them of the dangers to raise awareness.
2.  For those with insufficient stomach acid, which makes it difficult to kill tubercle bacilli, administer diluted hydrochloric acid to enhance the stomach's sterilizing power.
3.  Pay attention to intestinal stasis and prevent constipation.
4.  For pulmonary tuberculosis patients with symptoms such as gastrointestinal indigestion, diagnose and treat them early. This is especially important for those with diarrhea.

(E) Treatment of Intestinal Tuberculosis

1.  Correct the bad habit of pulmonary tuberculosis patients swallowing sputum. Also, take urgent measures to suppress lung damage, such as applying artificial pneumothorax, phrenic nerve resection, thoracoplasty, or oleothorax, to make the sputum turn negative as soon as possible, not containing tubercle bacilli, which can reduce the absorption of toxins and alleviate intestinal symptoms.
2.  Patients must rest in bed. (A) Most patients have active pulmonary tuberculosis. Resting can reduce the chance of transmission through blood circulation, etc. (B) Resting can reduce intestinal irritation and peristalsis, which is conducive to the damage.
3.  The choice of food for intestinal tuberculosis patients is extremely important. (A) Reduce the amount of fluids ingested. Cold drinks can stimulate the intestinal tract and cause peristalsis, leading to diarrhea and abdominal pain, and should be strictly prohibited. (B) Provide nutritious foods with high caloric value and appropriate amounts of vitamins. (C) Vegetables containing a lot of plant fiber should not be eaten in large quantities. Fatty fruits, sugar foods, honey, and cakes should be avoided as much as possible, as these foods can ferment and produce gas, causing the patient to suffer. (D) Those who can tolerate milk can drink more milk. However, if discomfort is felt after eating, add lime water or sodium bicarbonate, or coffee and cocoa powder. All kinds of food should be eaten hot. (E) Raw eggs and raw milk are not easily digested and are prone to bloating, belching, and diarrhea, so it is best not to eat them. (D) Eat more Vitamin C, such as tomatoes or tangerines. Mixing four parts of tomato juice or tangerine juice with one part of cod liver oil and taking it three times a day is excellent. Gastrointestinal inflammation and chronic pancreatic disease are caused by vitamin A deficiency, so using it to treat intestinal tuberculosis is particularly effective. It is even better to use it with Vitamin D.
4.  Heat therapy: For those with diarrhea, apply a hot water bag to the abdomen after each meal to help digestion and relax intestinal spasms. Abdominal pain can be alleviated. In addition, patients should stay warm, and special attention should be paid to the abdomen. Drinks and food should be hot. Applying Rland enemas is very helpful. For those with gas in the abdomen, adding a teaspoon of turpentine oil for direct irrigation is very effective. Rectal irrigation with hot saline is also good.
5.  Sterilize the patient's excrement thoroughly. According to recent reports from doctors, Dakin's Solution has the strongest bactericidal effect on tubercle bacilli and can be used to prevent transmission. Other disinfectants can also be used.
6.  Light therapy: Natural sunlight and ultraviolet rays are the first choice, but because most patients have pulmonary tuberculosis, improper use can be harmful. Caution must be exercised. Some now advocate using X-rays for treatment.
7.  Drug therapy: (A) Cholesterin can be taken because it has the value of increasing calcium absorption. (B) Hot compresses can be used for abdominal pain, and sedatives can be taken, such as opium preparations or their derivatives, or Atropine Sulphate can be taken orally or injected subcutaneously to relax intestinal spasms. (C) Tannin preparations can be taken for diarrhea to stop astringency. Bismuth preparations have an antidiarrheal effect. Barium Sulphate or Kaomin and other agents also have the same effect. (D) Calcium agents are used for treatment. When calcium agents reach the intestines, they can turn the fat in the intestines into calcified alkali, which has an astringent effect. Second, when it is absorbed, it has the function of relaxing intestinal spasms. Intravenous injection has a faster effect. Commonly used ones are 5% to 10% calcium chloride or calcium gluconate, 10 cc every other day. (E) For anemia, in addition to giving spleen preparations orally or by injection, blood transfusion can also be used. (End)

### Prerequisites for Promoting Rural Health Work (Continued)

— Yi Dan

2.  Medical care must be affordable for the common people.

In recent years, due to the impact of natural and man-made disasters, the entire rural area has reached a state of extreme depression. Rural areas have gradually declined, and there is a tendency for self-sufficiency to be insufficient. Because the foundation of rural areas has fundamentally failed, the rural economy has also presented a panic phenomenon. This bad phenomenon can be verified anytime and anywhere and cannot be denied. Think about where they have any surplus money to pay for medical treatment? I dare say that they usually don't have such thoughts at all. This is from a substantive point of view. At the same time, we should know that today's Chinese farmers, because their bodies have long been in such a difficult and arduous situation, have unconsciously developed the habit of thrift and hard work. Therefore, even some of the very few local rich people, we see that they still eat coarse and unpalatable rice and wheat, and wear tattered clothes, so you would never think that he is a person with tens of thousands of fortunes. In short, their thoughts are transferred by the changes in the environment! They think that money is more important than life, so most farmers, because of economic hardship, are sick and have no money to treat them, so they have to endure it bitterly. Even a few rich people are willing to endure the pain of illness and will never spend money to treat it easily. Only when the illness becomes serious and life-threatening will they be willing to spend a few "funeral money." This has become a common phenomenon. From this type of situation, rural medical care must be made affordable for the common people, and it must be affordable under their economic capacity. Only then will the masses of farmers be willing to come for consultation and treatment, and only then will the masses of farmers be able to get practical benefits. From this, farmers can have a deep and good impression of the health methods we implement.

3.  Promote the increase of agricultural production.

The rural economy should be based on the amount of agricultural production, because the source of the rural economy is obtained from agricultural production. This is a very obvious fact. Seeing the current economic situation of rural China, it has reached the point of extreme collapse. Therefore, the writing of "medical care must be affordable for the common people" is precisely to remedy this deficiency. However, if we continue to implement that method in one direction, we will inevitably fail to achieve the final satisfactory effect. Think about such a vast rural area in China, where does the authorities have such a budget to be used to rescue rural areas? Therefore, our only way is to also promote the increase of agricultural production and run water conservancy and other undertakings that are beneficial to agricultural production, so that the rural economy has a fundamentally active source. Then, the rural economy can be revived and become active again. In this way, a situation of national strength and prosperity, singing and dancing can be created. On the one hand, of course, the government's supply of health funds can also be generous. Then, at the same time, farmers can also enjoy considerable prices for the supply of new medicines and health facilities. Therefore, we can say that promoting the increase of agricultural production is the greatest force for promoting rural health.

4.  Maintain natural hygiene.

Originally, farmers lived in that kind of environment. Apart from spending all day in that cesspool-like small area where humans and animals lived together, nature has given them a lot of benefits invisibly—that is, hygiene! Such as fresh air, full sunlight, beautiful and pleasing scenery, and the unsightly work when half-naked, exposed to sunlight, etc. At the same time, their habit of getting up early to work and returning late to sleep sweetly has also formed a natural phenomenon. These types of natural phenomena are most suitable under hygienic conditions. Where can you enjoy such a privileged environment in a prosperous city? At the same time, how can the masters, wives, and young ladies in the city have such a great and admirable habit? Therefore, in the process of promoting rural health, it is really necessary to bring it up for discussion, because if we can pay attention to maintaining these types of natural hygiene, we can make the determination of farmers' belief more firm and we can get effortless help, and promote the promotion of rural health.

5.  Banning quack doctors and midwives.

According to Malthus's population theory, the reproduction of the population increases geometrically, doubling every 25 years. Therefore, the damage caused by diseases that are not formally proportional is the biggest reason. Just in terms of the number of quack doctors and midwives poisoning life in rural areas, there are simply no numbers that can be statistically determined. And now these types of unconventional itinerant practitioners are almost scattered throughout the entire rural area. Their methods are really clever, they can seduce the masses of farmers and plunge them into their confusion, so that the masses of farmers believe in them and have a close match with them, thinking that the quack doctor is the only healer, and the midwife is a skilled birth attendant. Similarly, this kind of work has become their iron rice bowl, and the opportunity for survival naturally depends on this point. However, can the newly formed facts benefit farmers? I dare say that under their unscientific and unmedical knowledge, there will never be a satisfactory result. We only need to pay a little attention, and the number of farmers who die young from diseases and die unjustly in childbirth is really alarming. This kind of out-of-the-ordinary death clearly proves that it is a tragedy caused by them, but their methods are really flexible. In order to prevent the exposure of incompetence, they added the vague term "doctors can cure diseases, but they cannot cure fate" to cover up their crimes. Now, the practice of reforming rural health is no different from giving them a head-on blow, and under this dangerous situation of life crisis, they will naturally make cunning propaganda at the moment when the masses of farmers believe in them. At the same time, the psychology of the masses of farmers will of course always tend to be on their side. Therefore, it has become a powerful indirect counterattack against us. This competitive situation has become a huge obstacle to promoting health at present, so how can we not try to ban it?

6.  Conclusion

These few conditional problems, we certainly cannot say that they are already complete, but I think they can be considered as several central conditions for promoting rural health, and if any one of them is abandoned, there is a possibility of hindering the promotion of other conditions. Therefore, I can say that in order for my country's current rural health to open up a new path, the above conditions are the work that we should solve first. If we can take on this mission and carry it out effectively, we can generally get considerable gains, but we cannot be satisfied with this, we must generate new methods, and therefore we cannot help but hope that health experts at home and abroad will contribute more to consolidate the strength of promotion. Here, what we need to pay attention to is that if the work of promoting rural health is carried out solely by the health community, the rate will definitely be very slow, and it will not be easy to get considerable achievements. We must also rely on the continued assistance of all parties, unite with each other to jointly plan and promote, in order to achieve the final goal and create the happiness of farmers and the foundation of a strong country!

### Report on Sanitary Inspections in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, etc. (4)

— Chu Jin-fang

(III) Financial Overview

Due to the progress in sanitary administration in the bureau each year, the funding has also increased progressively. The following is a list of the budgeted expenditures for the bureau's sanitary expenses from the 21st to the 24th year:

In the bureau's regular sanitary expenses, street cleaning consistently accounts for more than half of the total expenditure each year, followed by hygiene testing and meat inspection fees, treatment fees, general affairs fees, epidemic prevention fees, school hygiene fees, and hygiene education fees. As for large-scale summer cholera prevention and hygiene campaigns, these are handled with separate temporary funds.

2. Shanghai Municipal Hospital. This hospital is located opposite the Central District Health Bureau of Shanghai, with a site of approximately 80 mu, valued at 300,000 yuan, construction costs of 300,000 yuan, and equipment costs of 150,000 yuan, totaling 750,000 yuan. The scale is grand, but due to the tense situation, the equipment installation, etc., has not been fully completed, so the opening date will still require some time.

The position of hospital director is concurrently held by President Weng of Tongji University. In the future, students from the Medical College of Tongji University will undertake internships at the hospital. The connection between the hospital and the school will definitely be mutually beneficial.

3. Hygiene Testing Laboratory

The laboratory is located next to the Shanghai Hospital, and the equipment is quite complete. Unfortunately, at the time of the inspection, due to the influence of the current situation, the laboratory had stored some important instruments and equipment, and a complete view could not be obtained, which is truly regrettable.

4. Wusong District Health Office

This office is jointly operated by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Tongji University, and other schools and factories in Wusong, but the administrative authority rests with the Health Bureau. It focuses on handling various public health matters, with an attached clinic and ward facilities, with more than ten beds. The daily fee is 3 jiao per person, regardless of grade. It is planned that once the Shanghai Municipal Hospital opens, the ward will be cancelled to fully focus on public health matters.

The office's monthly expenses are 1600-1700 yuan, with Tongji University subsidizing 500 yuan, the Health Bureau allocating 600 yuan, and the rest being raised and subsidized by various schools and factories. In addition to treating the diseases of the public who come to the clinic, the office also sends doctors and public health nurses to various schools and factories to treat the diseases of students and workers, and to handle all health matters for the schools and factories. At the same time, it serves as a practical training ground for some students of Tongji University. Therefore, all schools and factories are happy to help with fundraising.

Furthermore, the registration method of the clinic uses the difference between the patient's age and the year the clinic was established as a standard, so that each patient's medical record becomes a system, making it easier to check, which is unseen in other hospitals and clinics. The method is as follows:

Calculate by subtracting the year the clinic was established from the patient's age. For example, if the patient's actual age is 11 years old and the clinic was established 5 years ago, then subtract 5 from 11, and the patient's age on the medical record should be written as 6 years old.

### What methods will the General Labor Union use to help workers?

— Meng Ruo

In order to promote labor services and improve the family lives of workers, the Shanghai General Labor Union has specially decided to establish a women workers' family service corps, which will be divided into groups to provide services. The work of this corps lies in investigating the living conditions of workers' families, and guiding labor families in hygiene and children's education, among other matters. This approach can be said to be very good, and it shows the General Labor Union's concern for the lives of workers.

The hardships of workers' family lives are known to all. They work hard all year round, selling their blood and sweat. Their contribution to society cannot be considered small. However, their living conditions are like those of cattle and horses. Because the remuneration workers receive is extremely low, even basic food, clothing, and shelter cannot be maintained.

Recently, many people have paid attention to the lives of general laborers, advocating for the protection of labor. However, protecting labor is easy to say, but a little difficult to implement. Protection by national law is naturally powerful. But our country does not lack laws to protect labor, and the result has been little effect. Asking employers for preferential treatment, we are willing to seek it but cannot obtain it. But most employers only see their own interests and do not care about the lives and deaths of workers. They are trying every means to carry out insatiable exploitation.

Then this responsibility falls on the labor union. The labor union is an organization that seeks happiness for workers, and is responsible for relieving pain and rescuing the lives of a group of workers. The resolution of the Shanghai General Labor Union to establish a women workers' family service corps is intended for this purpose.

But what methods will the General Labor Union use to help workers? Investigating the living conditions of workers' families is necessary. Guiding labor families in hygiene and children's education is also very beneficial to workers. However, just conducting investigations is not enough. After the investigation, finding ways to improve their lives is the most important work.

The corps' family visits should focus on what workers suffer from the most and what they hope for the most. From our point of view, the most painful thing for general workers must be the difficulty of life. At the same time, the most hopeful thing must be the improvement of life. This is not just a hypothesis, the facts are like this, and everyone can see it.

Therefore, we very much hope that after the General Labor Union conducts the investigation, it can provide some relief for the family lives of a group of workers. This will not only benefit the workers, but also be a benefit to society.

### A Visit to Tropical Fish

— Nan Ju

Tropical fish, this tempting name, has appeared again in this luxurious and splendid sea. Many people may not understand what exactly tropical fish are. Yesterday, a reporter made a special trip to the newly opened "Good Fun Fish Store" in Shanghai to make a detailed visit to tropical fish. Now, based on what Mr. Li Yihe, the owner of "Good Fun Fish Store" said, I am writing it here for the reference of the newspaper's readers.

The location of the Good Fun Fish Store is at 312 Julida Road. The facade is deep red and the layout is very elegant. The owner, Mr. Li Yihe, has been raising tropical fish for two or three years, so he is very clear about the breeding, price and types of tropical fish. Now let's talk about it separately:

Types of Tropical Fish There are many types of tropical fish, generally there are one or two hundred types. The Good Fun Fish Store currently has about twenty or thirty types. When it comes to tropical fish, what can make people most interested is the color and appearance of the fish. Now let me list a few: ㊀ Angelfish—This kind of fish has the best style, with a flat and wide belly and long whiskers on its tail. It is indeed beautiful when it floats at the bottom of the transparent glass tank; ㊁ Glass fish—The most interesting thing about this kind of fish is that its entire skeleton is completely transparent. Every small thorn on its body can be seen clearly; ㊂ Colored fish—This kind of fish is gray when it is young, but when it grows up, its whole body can turn into five colors, which is extremely beautiful. In addition, there are "long-mouthed fish", the fish are very small, and there is a long barb on the upper lip. It often floats on the surface of the water and is reluctant to swim to the bottom; triangular fish, the body of the fish is triangular; red-toothed fish, the body of the fish is light red; mosaic fish, the whole body is flat gray.

There are also two very strange fish. One is called "fighting fish". It looks like a goldfish, but its body is blue. It comes from India. This fish is combative. When two fish meet, they will fight in the water. Indians often use this "fighting fish" for gambling; there is also a "calling fish", the body of the fish is long and narrow, and it can make low noises in the water.

Producing area of tropical fish The producing area of tropical fish is mostly in Germany, and there are also tropical fish in India, Mexico, and the United States. Because this kind of fish has always grown in the warm waters of the tropics, it is not easy to bring it to China. Often the fish brought back on Tianlun ships die halfway.

Breeding method The average water temperature for raising tropical fish must be between 76 and 80 degrees. If it is too hot, add cold water, and if it is too cold, increase the water temperature; therefore, a specially made glass box for raising fish (transparent on five sides) is now made. Inside, there is a thermometer attached to it, which should be used to check the temperature of the water at any time. The food for fish is water worms, which should be fed about four times a day; the water can be changed frequently. In the glass fish tank, the bottom layer is fine sand, and many aquatic plants from Honolulu are also planted. Ordinary aquatic plants will rot when the temperature is warm, but this aquatic plant does not.

Fish Reproduction The reproduction of tropical fish can be divided into two types: one is viviparous and the other is oviparous. There is a fish called Du Fu Gelami fish, whose reproduction is very interesting. First, the male spits a white froth on the surface of the water, and then it drives the female fish into the froth to let it give birth to offspring. After the female fish lays her offspring on the grass, immediately move the female fish to another glass tank, otherwise it will eat its own offspring.

Fish prices Because this kind of fish is not easy to bring to Shanghai, the price is very expensive. Ordinary small fish cost five yuan a pair, and a specially made glass tank costs more than ten yuan. Larger fish cost more than ten yuan a pair, and they easily die if they are not raised properly. Even the aquatic plants from Honolulu cost one yuan for five inches, and some only sell for two inches. It is really too aristocratic.

### Spring in the Shantytown

— Written by Ma Mengchen

### A Rainy Day Story

— Wang Shengtian

Whenever it rains, I seem to have many stories to tell myself before I feel comfortable: raindrops on branches, raindrops under thatched roofs, and even puddles of rainwater in the fields, all remind me of the impressions brought about by my childhood, these impressions, like pairs of bright eyes, stare at me and make it impossible for me to avoid them.

When picking tea leaves in the valley, I once bravely bathed in the rain on the tea trees for a whole day, so that my clothes were soaked without an inch of dry yarn, but I was still very happy in my heart, and carried a full basket of tea leaves back home.

Time after time, I worked in the fields in the rain, without a raincoat or a hat. I liked this in spring, and I liked it even more in summer. In January, when yellow rapeseed flowers filled the ridges of the fields, I took a hoe to the fields to loosen the soil, and filled the dustpan with rapeseed hearts. If, at this time, raindrops touched my head, I would definitely be naughty and happy like Lao San, who herded the cattle, and we would say in unison, "Old God, don't cry, please give us both longevity and blessings!"

In late spring, the weather often likes to change its face. At this time, the work in the fields became easier, so I was usually sent by my family to the neighboring village to bake tea. During the tea-baking season, it rained eight out of ten days. In the tea-baking room, there were mostly teenage village girls, with small braids tied with red velvet threads hanging behind their heads. Several older people leisurely supervised us. Thus, outside the house was the sound of drizzling rain, and inside the house was the lively sound of singing and laughter.

Once, Yun and I were baking tea together. She was a petite, lively, and innocent country girl. I don't know why, she talked to me about rainy days.

"Don't you know about rainy days?" She opened her big eyes, her eyes full of satisfying doubt!

I just shook my head to show that I didn't know.

"Oh, don't you know about rainy days? It's like this, aren't there many stars that can be seen on clear nights? These many stars are the eyes of the Old God, because he wants to see many people on the ground, so he has so many eyes. The Old God treats us very well, he treats everyone equally, without being partial! The days when we see the sun come out, this is the Old God telling us that he is very happy, because many people on the ground are doing many things that are in line with the Old God's heart; if one day, the weather changes and it rains in bursts, this is telling us that many people on the ground are committing sins, making evil; making the Old God angry and sad; so he sheds tears..."

"Then, why can't you see the stars during the day?" I knew she was making up stories, so I retorted her like this.

"You are really a perfect idiot! Such a common thing, and you still don't know it. I want to ask you, do people need to sleep? What happens to their eyes when they sleep?... We people sleep at night, and the Old God sleeps during the day..."

After Yun became a bride, we had very few opportunities to meet; naturally, such fairytale-like rainy day stories would never be heard again.

Recently, a person ran from Xicun to my house and told us that Yun had hanged herself, and told us that the day before Yun died, his father had a dream of a family dying tragically; later, the person from Xicun solemnly declared to us that Yun's suicide was considered a blessing for Yun's family...

Early spring has entered the human world, and the continuous spring rain is about to follow. When my mind is made lonely by the rainy day, I think of Yun's expression when telling rainy day stories, and even more of the sadness of the countryside in the interior where theocracy is still ruling!

### The Festival of Welcoming the Gods

— Nan Ou

—Customs of Nanyang

When I was still a young child, I always looked forward to the annual festival of welcoming the gods by the Javanese. Needless to say, this motivation was entirely for the sake of joining in the fun. I cannot say that I had any piety for the gods worshipped by the different races. Every time the Javanese happily carried their idols in a parade through the streets for those two days, I and the other children were equally ecstatic; looking back on such things now is truly moving.

We Chinese call such an event "The Javanese Ghosts' Tour." In fact, those going on tour are "gods," not "ghosts." During the day, the area where the Javanese gather is bustling. They go to the streets to drink and enjoy themselves; and the usually heavily guarded temples are also opened. So, the children and I all gathered at the temple. In that crowd, I saw Malays wearing colorful sarongs; Dutch people with blue eyes; Indians wearing red and green headscarves; and naturally, the most were us Chinese. I once heard someone say

Continued on page 5

## Page 21

that the Javanese temple during the festival is the most realistic human race exhibition hall, which is truly an apt description. On that day, no less than tens of thousands of people entered and exited the temple! We scurried around everywhere, from here to there, and finally saw the idol sitting solemnly in the main hall. The Javanese piously kowtowed before it, while European and American gentlemen stood aside smiling, walking around with an attitude of curiosity. Young Javanese also gathered together to beat drums; the sound of the drums rumbled and was transmitted from morning to night, as if they never wanted to stop.

The most lively time was in the evening. The night in the South Seas is filled with the smell of seawater, and the stars and moon are dotted in the black sky. In order to maintain order on the streets, the police were all busy, and on both sides of the street, many people quickly gathered to watch the fun. At this time, I no longer had the freedom to move around. My grandmother had to keep an eye on me, for fear that I would encounter some accident. She carefully led me to wait by the street that the Javanese god would pass through. So, after anxiously waiting and waiting, the piercing sound of drums could finally be heard. Then, a light appeared at one end of the street, the sound of the drums became louder and louder, and a long string of people slowly approached, holding the idol. In front of the statue, a pair of masked people danced, eight cows pulled the idol, and behind it followed countless Javanese. Such a festival of welcoming the gods did not originally have anything particularly worth seeing, but the crowding situation was unimaginable.

The Javanese team walked away, and the people here gradually dispersed. My grandmother then led me home and said, "Okay, you've seen the welcoming of the gods, it's time to sleep well."

Such a festival of welcoming the gods lasted for two days; on the second night, there was another lively scene as usual, as well as a grand fireworks display, and I naturally asked my grandmother to take me to see it. White, red, and green sparks burned, embellishing the quiet southern night sky and exciting people's emotions...

But my age grew, and gradually I lost interest in the Javanese festival of welcoming the gods, and I no longer had that kind of mood to join in the fun. And the air of the colony finally had a day that suffocated me, so I left my birthplace and returned to the embrace of my motherland.

Opening "Wu Shi Returns to Fight the Tiger"

Heroes have always been strong in nature. Why fear tigers and wolves in the high peaks. Just believe the words of the innkeeper are true. Don't walk alone on the mountain. Jingyang Ridge has a striped tiger nearby. Sound the gong to gather the people in advance to guard against it. Wu Song didn't see it and had no worries. Drunk and in a daze, he stumbled along with a stick. It was evening when the stars rose. Looking into the distance, the steep mountains were lush with trees. The tiger's lair was hidden in the thickets. Tired from being drunk, he drowsed on the mountain. The tiger brandished its claws and bared its fangs. Wu Song remembered the stick too hastily. The stick broke in mid-air in panic. Fortunately, he was as strong as an ox. The white-browed striped tiger was subdued in an instant. Therefore, Master Sheng sighs and comments well.

Lyrics of "Moon Round Flower Good"

Butterflies dressed in new clothes in pairs. Delicate flowers spread fragrance branch by branch. Beautiful girls snuggling under the shade of willows. Elegant young men. Sweet hugs and kisses. The bright moon shines brightly. Skillful clouds weave dresses. Sitting close to each other by the stream. Lightly swinging and swaying. Joyful. Playing the pipa and singing. I will always remember. Cool autumn after the rain. Sending you to the crossroads. Reluctant to leave, lingering and hesitant. Hoping you will return to the country and increase its glory soon. The shallow pond water. Waves flowing. We hold hands to watch the mandarin ducks. From now on, we will love each other. As close as lacquer and glue. Growing old together. Happiness is endless.

### Aspects of Life in "Song of a Loving Mother"

Lin Chuchu, the loving mother in "Song of a Loving Mother", worked hard and diligently in her youth, raising her children, and devoted herself wholeheartedly. Even in her later years, although she was wandering around the world, homeless, she still maintained the happiness of her children everywhere, and was willing to sacrifice herself. That kind of ultimate love in the world once moved every audience who watched the screening to tears.

"Song of a Loving Mother" has Lin Chuchu, a kind and amiable loving mother, Hong Jingling, the cunning eldest son, Li Zhuozhuo and Gong Zhihua, the disobedient and unfilial evil daughters-in-law, Zhang Zhizhi, the stingy and greedy son-in-law, Zheng Junli, the selfish and self-interested second son, Li Lili, the hypocritical and ingratiating daughter, Zhang Yi, the third son who takes the blame for his father, Chen Yanyan, the virtuous and kind neighbor girl, and Han Langen, the fair and impartial village chief. There are detailed depictions of aspects of life.

Chinese people who are good at chanting and praying often wish people more children and grandchildren, because having many children and grandchildren is something to be proud of in a large family, but what is the experience of the loving mother in "Song of a Loving Mother", who also has many children?

"Children and grandchildren will have their own blessings, don't be cattle and horses for children and grandchildren." This is a very common saying, which is clearly revealed and painfully depicted in "Song of a Loving Mother".

### "Spring Comes to the World" Re-released Today

Mr. Sun Yu's directorial works have a unique characteristic: they are rich in poetry, make people optimistic, and make audiences yearn for the brightness of humanity. This characteristic is particularly evident in "Spring Comes to the World."

This film stars Chen Yanyan and Mei Xi. Yanyan is gentle and timid because she is a maidservant to a very violent woman. Therefore, her life's dictionary only has the two words "crying." Occupying the balcony behind her house is a young boatman, Mei Xi, who is a cheerful person. He is always playing the flute under the moon and smiling in the sunlight. He hates Yanyan's crying, but in the end, he quietly falls in love with her.

The story takes place in Peach Blossom Village, which is full of blossoming trees and gently flowing spring water. This village has spent a desolate autumn and a cruel winter amid warlord civil wars, and finally, spring has arrived. "Spring Comes to the World" is such a poem full of symbolic meaning!

Spring has come. Due to audience demand, "Spring Comes to the World" has been decided to be given a special screening at the Xinguang Grand Theatre starting today, because "Spring Comes to the World" can allow the audience to receive a piece of pleasant spring!

### A Glimpse of "Crossroads"

### Xinhua Snippets

"Midnight Song" has been playing at the Jincheng Theater for three weeks, and the audience is still crowded, with no end in sight. The Xinhua authorities, in order to treat viewers who have watched it two or three times, have spared no expense to print six types of three-color stereoscopic "Midnight Song" stills, which will be distributed with tickets at the Jincheng starting this week.

The male lead of "Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang" was originally set to be Jin Shan, but due to Jin Shan's foot injury, which has not healed for some time, Gao Zhanfei has been re-hired to play the role. With Lao Gao's past reputation, there is no doubt that he will be able to take on the role with ease.

Wang Cilong is working on "Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang" to the point of almost forgetting to eat and sleep, while Diao Banhua is lingering in the studio, happily forgetting to return, because of her outstanding performance.

Since the start of filming of "Youth March," there have been very few NG shots, and the lead actors Hu Ping, Tong Yuejuan, and Shi Chao have received great praise from Shi Dongshan.

Yang Xiaozhong is currently working hard on the scene breakdown of the script for "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later," hiding at home all day, temporarily refusing to see guests.

The content of this issue of Xinhua Books and Newspapers is becoming increasingly rich. In addition to the original text and photos, which are still sixteen pages each, nine more pages of comics have been added, while the price remains only one dime.
