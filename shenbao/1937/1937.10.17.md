Yesterday, Intense Battles Continued on All Fronts in Northern Shanxi; Our Army Valiantly Recaptured Zijingguan; Seized a Large Quantity of Military Supplies Between Guangqiu; The Line from Niushi, Xiawangzhuang, to Gongjiazhuang Also Occupied After Assault

[Taiyuan] The enemy in the Jingxing area, assuming we were unprepared, launched a sudden attack on Niangziguan with a regiment of infantry and artillery on the 14th. Our army bravely counterattacked, cutting the enemy force into two sections and encircling them separately. After a day and night of fierce fighting, they were completely annihilated. (Urgent dispatch from this newspaper on the 16th)

[Taiyuan] A certain unit of our army, after recovering Laiyuan, continued to advance northeastward, and on the 15th, recaptured Zijingguan, located at the border of Yixian and Laiyuan.

Furthermore, on the 15th, a certain unit of the same army discovered over a hundred enemy soldiers between Guangling and Lingqiu, transporting seventy or more vehicles loaded with flour, biscuits, canned goods, and military supplies. The unit immediately launched an ambush, killing over eighty enemy soldiers and seizing all the vehicles and military supplies.

[Taiyuan] Since the commencement of the general offensive on all fronts in northern Shanxi on the 14th, our army has achieved a major victory. The severity of enemy casualties has set a new record since their invasion of northern Shanxi. In the past two days, the number of dead and wounded has reached five or six thousand. Our side has also suffered significant losses, and brigade commanders Yu and Dong have been wounded. However, our morale is extremely high, and we are determined to continue our advance. On the morning of the 15th, enemy soldiers launched a counterattack on the line of Xinjiu Lian, Shi, Yanzhuang, and Weijiazhuang (all north of Xinkou), initially charging with dozens of tanks. Our army calmly responded, waiting for their infantry to approach before launching a fierce bayonet charge. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, and we seized the opportunity to advance, subsequently occupying the line of Niushi, Xiawangzhuang, and Gongjiazhuang. In this battle, eight enemy armored vehicles were destroyed, and a large number of firearms were captured. Furthermore, regarding the battles in eastern Shanxi, after the enemy occupied Shijiazhuang, they actively made attempts to advance westward. However, our authorities made preparations early on, determined not to allow the enemy to advance past Niangziguan. While our army was advancing westward, the enemy in the Jingxing area took the opportunity to follow and attack our Jia Village in Jingxing front line. Furthermore, a unit of approximately eight or nine hundred men circumvented Changshengkou, reaching Jiuguan directly. On the morning of the 14th, we used the majority of our forces to attack the invading enemy, and after a fierce battle until noon, we annihilated one unit of over four hundred men. Another unit was encircled by us, and by noon on the 15th, they were also completely annihilated. Although the enemy has suffered a setback, they may stubbornly continue their advance. In the near future, intense battles will also unfold in eastern Shanxi. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 16th)

Division commander Li Xianzhou was also seriously wounded but continued to disregard his own safety, directing the advance. Eventually, with the arrival of additional troops, we recaptured the lost ground and routed the enemy's main force. In this battle, over eight hundred enemy soldiers were killed, and a large number of firearms were captured. On our side, one battalion commander and two company commanders were killed, and twenty-two deputy company commanders and lower ranks, as well as three hundred soldiers, were wounded or killed.

[Taiyuan] On the evening of the 14th, the enemy in Jingxing sent a regiment to launch a surprise attack on Jiuguan, south of Niangziguan. Our side was prepared, and when the enemy advanced not far from our defensive positions, we encircled them in one fell swoop, attacking simultaneously from all sides.

[Taiyuan] Several squadrons of our aircraft have been flying over the area of Guoxian and Yuanping for several days, assisting in the battle, and have been exceptionally active in the enemy's positions and rear. Our air force personnel, utilizing their superb skills, dropped bombs to bomb enemy military engineering and transportation hubs, destroying all the transportation lines in northern Shanxi. The enemy's reinforcements and all supplies cannot be delivered as desired, so they are extremely resentful of our air force. When our air force first assisted in the battle in Yuanping, they even used dumdum bullets in an attempt to cruelly kill our air force personnel. A certain hero of our air force, seeing this behavior of the enemy, deeply despised and loathed it, and displayed great might, continuously shooting down two enemy aircraft near the enemy's position fifteen *li* north of Qicun. All five of their pilots crashed to the ground and died. While bombing the enemy's position, several enemy aircraft came again, firing dumdum bullets and shooting at the aforementioned hero, causing him to be wounded in the buttocks, but he still safely flew back to our position. After being rescued by our army, he safely returned to Taiyuan on the 16th and is currently recuperating. Various circles have heard the news and are visiting to express their condolences.

The roofs and sides of the carriages were clearly marked with many Red Cross flags, but the aircraft ignored everything and continued to drop bombs, bombing indiscriminately. The total number of bombs was seven. Fortunately, the aim was inaccurate and none hit. Seeing the emergency, the trains stopped moving, and the refugees and wounded soldiers ran out of the carriages, lying down in the fields.

(Note by the Central News Agency: On that day, our aircraft lost one and damaged one. The claim of eight is merely an attempt by the enemy to make excuses.) It also stated that from October 12 to 14, the targets bombed by Japanese aircraft in North China, South China, and Central China were military trains on the Jinpu Railway, the Hefei airfield in Anhui Province, and the Shaoguan arsenal on the Yuehan Railway.

### Vice Chairman Feng Discusses the Significance of Total War of Resistance

Victory in the Protracted War of Resistance is Assured; Japanese Imperialists Will Inevitably Be Defeated and Collapse

⊙ Xinxiang: Recently, a reporter went to a certain area in the front lines to visit Vice Chairman Feng and inquire about the general situation of the national war of resistance and the war in North China. It happened that Feng and others were picnicking, so he was invited to participate and eat sesame flatbread, fried dough sticks, and other items while talking. Feng, despite being amidst the hustle and bustle of war, was particularly energetic and had a long talk with the reporter. The gist of it was that in this time of national war of resistance, local or temporary victories or defeats absolutely cannot determine the final success or failure. Judging from the situation of the enemy and ourselves, since the start of our war of resistance, the entire nation has been united in hatred of the enemy. The armies of all provinces have also set out one after another. The atmosphere in various foreign countries is also sympathetic to us. The enemy, on the other hand, faces many difficulties. The rulers in their country are constantly being criticized by various parties, and the anti-war movement among the people is also expanding daily with the continuation of the war. Foreign countries, such as the League of Nations, have severely condemned them, and President Roosevelt's speech and the upholding of justice by Britain and France are all enough to make the enemy uneasy day and night. Although we are currently facing severe national difficulties, as long as we grit our teeth and continue the war of resistance, things will definitely get better. As long as we promote the national spirit and, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, fight forward one after another, the Japanese imperialists will inevitably be defeated and collapse before our protracted war of resistance. Our confidence in victory is increasing day by day. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 16th)

Foreign Minister Spaak also instructed Belgian diplomatic representatives stationed in the signatory countries to deliver this invitation to the governments of those countries tomorrow.

Hu Peiguang is a State Department expert on Far Eastern issues, and Morpheus is the Director of the European Division of the State Department and also the son-in-law of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 16th)

[Washington] The conference of signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty is scheduled to be held in Brussels on the 30th of this month. U.S. envoy Davis will lead his staff, including Bell, aboard the steamship Washington to Mecca on the 20th of this month. He recently stated to the press, "The United States will do everything possible to quickly end the dispute between China and Japan through mediation." He did not express any specific opinions beyond this. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt will issue a declaration tomorrow to explain U.S. policy. As for the U.S. government's view of the Nine-Power Treaty conference, it is generally believed that it will be the same as the policy pursued by Secretary of State Stimson before 1932. In other words, the United States should participate in any measures that the countries can decide on against Japan, including the boycott movement, but only on the condition that the countries concerned, especially Britain, show the same attitude. Regarding this level, U.S. personnel are worried that Britain may relapse into its old ways, as it refused to cooperate with the United States in 1932. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 15th)

However, the president did not want to clarify how the peace policy will be pursued thereafter. (Dispatch from the Kuomintang on the 15th)

[London] The British Conservative Party held a party conference in Llandudno, North Wales, yesterday. Foreign Secretary Eden delivered an important speech, which focused mainly on the Spanish issue, in addition to discussing the situation in the Far East. Regarding recent events in China, Eden expressed his hope that all countries related to the Far East could participate in the Nine-Power Treaty conference. As for Britain, it has decided to sincerely participate in accordance with the spirit of President Roosevelt's declaration. Eden also said that Prime Minister Chamberlain had previously warmly welcomed Roosevelt's declaration in his speech in Scarborough. Eden believed that Roosevelt's speech in Chicago was tantamount to a clarion call awakening the countries to return to honest promises and the sanctity of treaties. Eden added, "At this time of international turmoil and disregard for law and order, it is fortunate to have the president of the world's strongest democracy raise his arms and shout, reminding us of our promise not long ago to avoid using force as an instrument of national policy."

Eden continued, "We are now in a time of storm and stress, and some openly hope that the various international unrest will make it impossible to effectively resist illegal acts in one region. However, this is a very dangerous theory, and no country can permanently benefit from following it. Even if it is temporarily spared, it cannot escape the bad consequences forever. However, as things stand, obligations are ignored, treaties are openly torn up, credit is lost, and the method of undeclared war has become the norm. At the same time, they shamelessly claim that their goal is peace. In this confusion of black and white and chaos of terror, whether in Europe or in the Far East, we must resolutely persist, grasp the reality of the present, concentrate our efforts on what people can do, and not aim too high, making empty words to deceive the world, or provoke the unfortunate consequences that we urgently want to avoid. If the whole nation is united, we can succeed, and we will surely succeed." (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 16th)

### The Public Should Not Arbitrarily Damage Aircraft That Land in Various Places

Proper Handling Regardless of Enemy or Ally - Aeronautical Society Issues Circular to All Agencies for Notification

[Nanjing] The military authorities state that people in various places often cannot distinguish between enemy and friendly aircraft and arbitrarily damage them out of indignation, which is highly inappropriate. The Aeronautical Society telegraphed the provincial governments, stating: "Since our air force began engaging in combat, enemy aircraft have been shot down in various places, and some of our aircraft have been forced to land due to mechanical failures or fuel exhaustion after battles. However, the public in various places often cannot distinguish between them, assuming that all landing aircraft belong to the enemy. Their hatred is intense, and they treat both the people and the aircraft with hostility, damaging them out of indignation. While this is understandable, aircraft that have landed have lost their power. Our own aircraft should be vigorously protected to preserve military strength, and even enemy aircraft, once captured, can be turned to our use. Destroying the aircraft out of indignation is equivalent to discarding our own weapons. If the aircrew are our heroic anti-Japanese airmen, they should be properly protected. If they are our prisoners, they should be captured alive and sent to the central government without harm to demonstrate the martial virtues of our army. Compatriots across the country should understand this principle. Since we do not harm prisoners, why should we mistakenly harm our air force combat personnel? Please order the subordinate county and district government agencies to instruct compatriots in various places that, in the future, when encountering aircraft that have landed, personnel should be dispatched to properly guard the aircraft and its accessories, weapons, etc., while immediately telegraphing this society to await instructions for disposal. Regardless of whether the people landing with the aircraft or parachuting with insurance parachutes are enemy or ally, they should be rescued first. Those who are our air force soldiers should be comforted. If they have been injured, they should be quickly escorted to local hospitals for treatment, and this society should be immediately notified of the personnel's names and aircraft numbers. If they are the enemy, their attitude should be observed first, and appropriate force should be used to capture them and send them to the nearest military police agency or county government local agency for detention and guarding, and this society should be telegraphed to await instructions for disposal."

### Our Military Spokesperson Solemnly Denies

Enemy's False Accusation of Our Use of Poison Gas Shells - Foreign Reporters Take It as a Joke

The enemy's spokesperson has repeatedly claimed that our army used poison gas shells, but this is purely fabricated and no one believes it. Yesterday, during a reception for foreign reporters, they even presented two mortar shells, falsely claiming that they were poison gas shells intercepted in our positions. According to the Japanese side, our army used poison gas shells three times on September 23rd and October 12th and 13th, and then on the 14th, they intercepted several shells northwest of Liuhang, with red markings on them. After testing, it was learned that they were suffocating carbonyl chloride gas, which was first used during World War I. It is said that a foreign reporter at the time asked whether there were neutral parties present to prove the chemical tests. The enemy spokesperson directly admitted that there were none. Therefore, foreign reporters laughed it off and no one believed it. Our military spokesperson also solemnly refuted this kind of unfounded slander by the enemy during a reception for foreign reporters.

Enemy Launches Two-Pronged Attack on Jiangwan

Central News Agency, Zhabei, war correspondent with the army, reported at 1:50 AM on the 17th: Yesterday afternoon, enemy tanks in the Jiangwan city center area appeared on Huangxing Road, Qimei Road, and Xiangyin Road, as if preparing for a large-scale operation. At 5:00 PM, two enemy companies advanced towards our Tiyuhui Road positions from Xiangyin Road, and another company attacked our Baziqiao Zhai Bei Ji Zhai area positions east of the Wanguo Stadium. Our army engaged them from the Hejiaxiang Dongzhai area. By around 9:00 PM, our army charged forward, and the gunfire became even more intense. According to the main officers fighting on North Sichuan Road, after our army controlled North Sichuan Road, the enemy had not been active on North Sichuan Road for two days. The enemy's attacks have become difficult.

Central News Agency, Zhabei, war correspondent with the army, reported at 12:00 PM on the 16th: At 1:30 AM this morning, about 300 enemy troops advanced north along the Hengbang River, attacking our Baziqiao. When the enemy troops approached Baziqiao, they were discovered by our sentries, who opened fire to warn the others. Our entire line immediately launched a head-on counterattack. At the same time, our troops near Guangdong East Middle School also emerged from Guangli Road and attacked the flank of the enemy troops in the No. 63 Flower Garden. For a time, the sound of rifles and machine guns resounded in unison, and heavy artillery and mortars were fired simultaneously. Both sides fought a bloody battle until about 6:00 AM, when the enemy troops, unable to hold out, retreated to their original lines. In this battle, our army killed over 70 enemy soldiers and captured eight light machine guns. Central News Agency, Zhabei, war correspondent with the army, reported at 12:00 PM on the 16th: After our army counterattacked and cleared the enemy troops from the streets west of North Sichuan Road, our army has completely controlled the traffic on that road. The enemy is quite threatened and is eager to restore its lost strength. The enemy attacked various street intersections at 11:00 PM the night before. Our outposts immediately engaged them. For a time, the sound of gunfire was as dense as linked beads. At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, our army charged out towards North Sichuan Road again and engaged in street battles with the enemy for four hours. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated.

### Enemy Troops Stealing Across Miaoji the Night Before Were Annihilated

Few Survivors from Two Enemy Companies - Many Enemy Rifles, Machine Guns, etc. Seized

While tanks were in a tense situation on the south bank of Yunzaobang and in the Guangfu Town area, the enemy troops attempted to strike east and west on the previous day (the 14th), stealing across Miaoji, about three kilometers northeast of Miaohang, on the north bank of Yunzaobang, hoping to attack our Miaohang positions. The previous evening, enemy artillery across the river bombarded our army's positions on the opposite bank continuously to cover their troops crossing the river. At that time, because the enemy's artillery fire was too dense, our army was unable to approach the bank. It is estimated that over a thousand people, about the number of two companies, had crossed the river. Our army responded calmly and did not move, waiting until they had crossed the river and had not yet established a firm foothold before launching an attack on them. Our army, a group of crowds, launched a fierce attack. The enemy troops were greatly surprised. During our army's charge and hand-to-hand combat, the enemy's artillery across the river became completely ineffective. The enemy troops panicked and fled backward. For a time, countless people fell into the water to escape. The remaining stubborn resisters were all wiped out by our army's machine guns. Few survived. The bloody battle lasted until 3:00 AM yesterday morning. The enemy troops who had stolen across the river have all been eliminated. Enemy corpses were scattered all over the ground, in a terrible state. Upon inspection of the enemy corpses, several captains had all been killed by our army. Our army seized over a hundred rifles and more than ten light and heavy machine guns. More than ten enemy soldiers were captured alive. The enemy troops across the river have now disappeared and dare not attack again.

### Our Artillery Counterattacks and Destroys Enemy Artillery

Central News Agency reports: A war correspondent with the army in Guangfu reported at 9:00 AM on the 16th: The Jinjialong Daweiqiao near Luodian is the enemy's artillery position. Yesterday, they fired at our Cao Wangmiao area positions. After we determined their position, we counterattacked with heavy artillery. Several of their guns were destroyed by us, and they immediately fell silent. They have not been able to harass us again so far. Also, the enemy facing Pujiamiao has been constantly firing at our positions with rifles and machine guns since last night until this morning, seemingly testing the situation. We know that the enemy does not dare to attack rashly, so we did not return fire. Also, the enemy near Zhu Beizhai has been silent on the front line since the failed forced crossing yesterday evening until this morning. The enemy has not dared to attack again.

### Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in City Center Area

Central News Agency, Jiangwan, war correspondent with the army, reported at 12:00 PM on the 16th: The enemy in the city center area advanced towards our Yejiayouyuan and Tiyuhui Road positions from Xiangyin Road at 4:30 AM this morning, using their tanks and fierce artillery fire to press our army. Our army waited calmly, and when they approached, they rushed out together, intercepting the enemy from various directions. After a fierce battle until 7:00 AM, the enemy troops used aircraft to cover their retreat. Our army then retreated to its original defenses. Enemy corpses were piled up along the way, numbering over fifty, and one tank was overturned and destroyed by the roadside, showing the severity of the enemy's losses.

### Enemy Transports Armored Vehicles, etc. to Shanghai

The Qinghai Maru, an enemy merchant ship converted into a transport ship, arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 15th), carrying a total of over one hundred armored vehicles and military vehicles. Starting at dawn yesterday morning, they began unloading them at the Huangpu Wharf for landing.

### Enemy Aircraft Bombing is a Daily Occurrence

Enemy aircraft were still active in various places starting at dawn yesterday morning, but they were not as active as the day before. They first circled over Zhabei, then dropped large bombs, three in the first wave, six simultaneously in the second wave, and three in the last wave, for a total of twelve bombs. They all fell on the east and west sides of Yongxing Road and Gonghexin Road along the railway line, damaging only a few civilian houses. In Pudong, six enemy aircraft dropped as many as twenty bombs in the Yangjiadu area, killing or wounding three civilians and destroying many civilian houses. At around 3:00 PM, they dropped two bombs near Liuliqiao, killing two residents and wounding four. They then continued bombing in the Yanqiao area, wounding one male and one female resident and killing one girl and one civilian. At around 7:00 AM, they dropped a total of five bombs on Beixinjing Zhenbei Road, killing one civilian and destroying a floating bridge. Also, several bombs were dropped near Xujiahui Station. The area east of the Xinguai River near Jiading was also bombed with dozens of bombs the night before last. Yesterday, several aircraft went there again at 7:00 AM and dropped several bombs, but our fortifications suffered no losses. At 5:00 PM, several enemy aircraft went to Zhoupu and dropped over ten bombs, causing no losses.

### Loyal and Brave Soldier Wang Jun-chen Undergoes Treatment After Being Hit with Sawtooth Bullets

The enemy troops violated international law and repeatedly used the cruel Dumdum bullets, wounding our loyal and brave soldier Wang Jun-chen, penetrating his left arm. Doctors Zhao, Yu, and Fan of the Hongxing Association Rear Wounded Soldier Hospital treated him with surgery.

### Our Aircraft Attack This Morning

At midnight this morning, several aircraft from our army suddenly attacked the enemy's bases in the air above the Huangpu River and the Hongkou Yangshupu area, bombing them. At the same time, our Pudong artillery also fired to assist. The enemy troops suffered heavy losses. In a state of panic and urgency, enemy warships on the Huangpu River responded with anti-aircraft guns, and our air force safely returned to their defenses after completing their mission.

The American working class does not want to be involved in the whirlpool of the Asian and European wars. The territorial integrity of a certain country has been destroyed, innocent civilians have been barbarically attacked, and international law has been blatantly disregarded. Even if we want to maintain neutrality, we cannot. It is only through the joint action of peace-loving countries that we can protect world peace." (Central News Agency, Havas, 15th)

### The Roman Catholic Church Denies Cooperation with Japan to Prevent Communism

The Pope's Views are the Same as the US President's

⊙Vatican City: Recently, there have been rumors that the representatives of the Catholic Church in the Far East have received news that the Roman Catholic Church will cooperate with Japan to prevent communism. Hearing this, the Vatican officially denied it. Archbishop Gang Heng-yi, the former representative of the Roman Catholic Church in China and current secretary of the Vatican Propaganda Group, stated today that the unchanging policy of the Church stipulates that "all churches should avoid participating in any political issues and focus on their religious culture and the welfare of the parishioners under their jurisdiction." This regulation has been rigorously confirmed by Pius XI. Archbishop Gang further pointed out that the Vatican Propaganda Organization's Roman Audience newspaper recently declared that the US President's previous declaration against all wars is in line with the views of the Church.

### Meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee Amidst Tensions Over the Spanish Issue

France Proposes Volunteer Withdrawal Method, Britain Agrees; Italy Agrees to Partial Implementation But Remains Conditional

[London] The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee on the Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting at the Foreign Office at 11:00 AM today. Initially, the French representative to Britain, Ambassador Corbin, spoke, presenting a five-point proposal on behalf of his government:

㊀ The withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain must be realized in the shortest possible time.

㊁ Once the international committee responsible for organizing and supervising the withdrawal of volunteers certifies that the volunteer withdrawal process is progressing well, the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War may be recognized as enjoying certain rights permitted by international law.

㊂ The governments participating in the Adjustment Committee should exert their influence on both the Spanish Republican government and the Nationalist government to ensure the rapid withdrawal of a certain number of foreign volunteers by each side. The number of volunteers withdrawn by each side should be proportional to the number of foreign volunteers currently fighting on each side.

㊃ The governments participating in the Adjustment Committee should mutually guarantee that they will no longer permit the transportation of military supplies and volunteers to Spain.

㊄ The monitoring system based on the recommendations listed in the report of the head of the monitoring office, Dutchman Van Tem, should be studied promptly and then implemented.

Corbin continued, stating that the current situation is extremely tense and serious. Therefore, he hoped that the Adjustment Committee would discuss this issue and make a swift decision. The issue of volunteer withdrawal should be resolved first. The French government now requests the subcommittee to immediately set a deadline within which the relevant governments should submit their replies to the above French proposals. If the current situation remains unchanged and no agreement is reached by the deadline, the French government believes it has sufficient reason to restore its freedom of action.

The British representative, Foreign Office Undersecretary Lord Plymouth (Chairman of the Adjustment Committee), spoke next, stating that the British government was not satisfied with the implementation of the non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War. The situation is extremely serious, and foreign intervention in the Spanish Civil War continues unabated. The longer this situation persists, the greater the future danger. The recent Nyon Agreement in the Mediterranean has created a favorable atmosphere, so the British government believes that the participation of foreign nationals in the Spanish Civil War is one of the biggest obstacles to the future. The British government now supports the request that the Adjustment Committee undertake further efforts to find a solution so that the situation does not repeat past mistakes. It is also necessary to restore the monitoring system based on the recommendations contained in the Van Tem report and make it more perfect and stronger. Therefore, he welcomed the proposals put forward by the French government and would give them full support from the British government. He earnestly appealed to the governments participating in the Adjustment Committee to immediately consider the French government's proposals in the spirit of sincerity, goodwill, and cooperation, so that an agreement could be reached completely within the shortest possible time. Otherwise, the British government would reserve the right to restore complete freedom of action.

The Italian representative, Ambassador to Britain Grandi, then delivered a speech, stating that he was authorized by his government to declare that Italy was prepared to accept the partial withdrawal of foreign volunteers in Spain according to the plan previously proposed by the British government on July 14. However, the number of people withdrawn by both sides of the civil war should be the same. Italy issued a declaration on July 27, preparing to accept the withdrawal of volunteers and the dispatch of monitors by the Adjustment Committee to reside in Spanish ports. In other words, Italy supports all measures accepted by both parties involved in the Spanish conflict, with one condition: that other relevant countries accept the Italian government's views on the monitoring measures and the recognition of both parties in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents. The Italian government has also suggested immediately seeking the opinions of both sides in the Spanish Civil War. It is absolutely necessary to recognize both sides in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents, and an effective monitoring plan must be implemented before the withdrawal of volunteers begins to prevent already withdrawn volunteers from returning to Spain through other channels. Italy also accepts the conclusions of the Van Tem report. In addition, ships transporting military supplies to the territory under the control of the Spanish Republican government often falsely use the flags of certain major powers in the Mediterranean. Italy will protest against this. The Adjustment Committee must reject the view of some countries that consider the situation urgent and serious only because their own interests are involved. Finally, Grandi added a few words, expressing hope for the future and declaring that Italy was willing to cooperate with all countries.

After Grandi finished speaking, the German representative, Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop, delivered a speech, stating Germany's views, which were generally similar to those of Italy. In addition, he launched a fierce attack on the activities of Bolshevism in Spain and elsewhere, and also severely criticized the speech given by British Foreign Secretary Eden in Llandudno the previous day. The Italian representative Grandi also criticized Eden's speech, but his wording was not as intense as Ribbentrop's.

At this point, the Soviet representative, Ambassador to Britain Maisky, spoke out against the fascist countries' aggression against Spain, but agreed to submit the French government's proposal to the Soviet government for review. In addition, the Portuguese representative, Minister to Britain Monteiro, spoke, generally supporting the views of Germany and Italy, but his wording was more moderate. Finally, Chairman Plymouth made a conclusion, stating that the proposals put forward by the French government had been fully supported by the British government, and he asked the representatives of all countries present to promptly submit them to their respective governments for review. The representatives of all countries expressed their acceptance, and the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was already 12:30 PM. Based on the impression gained from today's meeting, people are quite optimistic, believing that the meeting has a strong atmosphere of coordination, and it is expected that an agreement will be reached on the symbolic withdrawal of volunteers. The next meeting of the subcommittee is scheduled for 4:00 PM next Tuesday (the 19th) to discuss the replies from the governments of various countries to the French proposals. At the same time, the Van Tem report will be discussed technically. When the next meeting is held, Foreign Secretary Eden will personally chair the meeting because Plymouth will not be in London. According to the usual practice, when Chairman Plymouth is absent from meetings of the Adjustment Committee, other deputy ministers of various departments act as chairman. However, Foreign Secretary Eden will personally chair the meeting next Tuesday, which shows the importance of the next meeting. (Havas News Agency, Geneva, 16th)

### Stefani Praises the Strength of Our Army

⊙ Rome - Former Italian Minister of Finance and former financial advisor to the Chinese government, Stefani, recently published an article in the 'Stampa' newspaper, commenting on the Sino-Japanese conflict, stating that the spiritual and material strength of the Chinese army has made great progress. Therefore, the war between China and Japan will be more intense and prolonged than generally expected. Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has reorganized the national army into a strong force, and the talents cultivated by the Whampoa and Baoding military academies have been extremely effective, proving the effectiveness of the training. "There is no shortage of clear evidence of the heroic fighting of Chinese soldiers." The Chinese army currently has a total of 160 divisions, and the number of various military equipment manufactured by military factories in various places, except for heavy artillery, is also quite considerable. (Havas News Agency, Geneva, 15th)

### Serious Situation in Palestine

Air Force Port Fire, Religious Leader Flees

⊙ Jerusalem - Although no new incidents have occurred in Palestine recently, the situation remains extremely tense. If the situation does not deteriorate further, martial law will likely be declared. It is reported that two British police officers were killed in yesterday's riots. (Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th)

⊙ Jerusalem - A major fire broke out at the largest air force port in Palestine, Lydda, this morning. The radio station, passport checkpoint, and customs office were completely burned down. It is believed that the fire was arson. A fire also broke out on the streets of Jerusalem last night and did not extinguish overnight. The number of deaths and injuries is not yet known. (National Maritime Telegram, 16th)

[London] According to telegrams from Jerusalem, British authorities there have made final preparations to prevent large-scale Arab rebellions. In addition to completely cutting off trains and highways, a large number of troops and police have been transferred from Hebron and other cities in preparation for unforeseen events. The rumor that the religious leader has fled from the Mosque of Omar and crossed the Palestinian border has been officially denied by the authorities here. According to The Times, the Palestinian rebels have received considerable support from Syrian Arabs. Therefore, British authorities have requested cooperation from the French mandate authorities to maintain peace in both Syria and Palestine. (National Maritime Telegram, 16th)

⊙ Jerusalem - The religious leader of Jerusalem suddenly went missing yesterday after being taken to the Mosque of Omar by British authorities a week ago. This is extremely surprising here. It was rumored a few days ago that the religious leader had disguised himself and escaped from the mosque last Friday, crossing the Palestinian border and arriving in Syria. It is believed that this plan has come to fruition because he cannot be found here, and his family moved away four days ago. Another rumor is that the religious leader is currently ill.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Far East Policy of Britain and the United States

— Yi

Before 1914, even in the early stages of the Great War, the confrontational situation between the world's countries was not very clear. The participating countries were all prepared to mobilize before declaring their positions. Therefore, some historians say that if the Allied countries had made a clear statement as early as 1914, the four years of tragic warfare might have been avoided.

Today's international politicians seem to have learned this historical lesson. In order to prevent the recurrence of a major war disaster, they often frankly express their opposition to aggression in international events before deciding on actual actions. However, when words lose their effectiveness, the arrogance of the aggressor only increases, and the prestige of their own country only decreases. This was the case in the past with the Sino-Japanese incident, and it was the case with the Abyssinian incident. Now, let's see if it will be the same with the Sino-Japanese incident.

President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Chamberlain solemnly declared their determination to uphold the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty. This declaration should be powerful, right? However, we know that the capital networks of Britain and the United States are densely distributed in the Far East. Even though the two countries deeply feel the threat of the aggressor, they still have many concerns. Recent news from London and Washington has revealed that the policies of both countries are limited to mediating the current situation because what both countries hope for most is an early end to the war.

Under the current circumstances, mediation is almost impossible. Even if mediation is possible, this will not benefit our country's future or the world's determination to strive for national freedom with iron and blood. Only in this way can we force Britain and the United States to truly assume their responsibilities for the Nine-Power Treaty.

### Secretary Huang Bodu of the Embassy in Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Going to Nanjing to Report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Situation of Overseas Chinese Returning Home

Mr. Huang Bodu, Secretary of the Embassy in Japan, returned home on official business on the orders of Ambassador Xu and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM on a French mail ship. A reporter from the Central News Agency met him on the ship and received the following comments: "I was ordered to return home this time to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the situation of overseas Chinese returning home. I will make preparations in Shanghai and then go to Nanjing. Approximately 60,000 overseas Chinese in Japan have now returned home. The poor are given subsidies by local consulates from the relief funds issued by the central government and the donations from local overseas Chinese groups, and are jointly managed by a committee formed by leaders of local overseas Chinese groups. After the overseas Chinese return to ports in our country, the travel expenses back to their hometowns are also reduced or exempted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which telegraphed the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways. Recently, the embassy sent personnel to inspect Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, etc. According to reports, all care is properly provided. The overseas Chinese are extremely grateful for the kindness of the central government. As for our students studying in Japan, there were about 5,000 before the war, and they have all returned home one after another. There are only about 100 who are still in Japan, and most of them are children of overseas Chinese who are economically strapped and unable to return home. The overseas student supervision office will provide travel expenses to students who are unable to return home due to financial difficulties from the funds issued by the Ministry of Education, and the embassy will issue free train and ship tickets so that they can return home early. This time, our country is united in sincerity and, under the leadership of the supreme leader, vowed to resist to the death. Our cause is just, our army is strong. In addition, our country has been working hard in recent years, enduring hardships and being vigilant, which is completely different from the situation in the Sino-Japanese War. Final victory in the war of resistance will surely belong to us. Ambassador Xu has been overworked for many years. Despite being ill, he was ordered to return to his post. As the national crisis became more serious, his anxiety and difficulty can be imagined. In early August, when the weather was extremely hot, he suddenly fainted and fell to the ground while visiting the British and French ambassadors. Doctors diagnosed him with cerebral anemia due to overwork, but his heart was very strong, and the medicine was effective. He has been recovering gradually in recent times. For two months, even in the midst of illness, he has not diminished his usual strong and hard-fighting spirit, dedicating his knowledge and contributing his insights, handling important public affairs without rest. He has repeatedly requested to return home, but has not been approved. Under the overall national policy, individuals should obey the government's orders. However, because he deeply believes that a grieving army will win and that those who have the Dao will receive much help, and that justice overcomes everything, the ambassador also instructed me to handle some private matters in Shanghai that are waiting to be dealt with after his wife's death."

### The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed to Welcome Kong's Return Home

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram yesterday to welcome Minister Kong's return home. The telegram reads: "Hong Kong, respectfully to Minister Kong Yongzhi. Serving abroad, just as the war begins. Entrusting the great task to you is a task for extraordinary people. You are tasked with connecting relations with foreign countries and planning the crucial transportation of supplies. The central government relies on you, and the people admire you. Now that you are returning from abroad, we look forward to your imminent return. We send our condolences and welcome you with a telegram. Please accept our sincere greetings. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows."

### A Foreigner Comments on the Enemy's Abuse of Military Supplies

After Two Months of Fighting in Shanghai, Old Stockpiles of Military Supplies Are Gradually Depleted; Bombs Manufactured Less Than Three Months Ago Are Used

The Continental Daily reports that after two months of fighting in Shanghai, the Japanese army is arbitrarily consuming its old stockpiles of military supplies. Today, it is using bombs, artillery shells, rifle bullets, and hand grenades newly manufactured in its arms factories. A foreigner picked up fragments of a bomb on Hongqiao Road on Thursday. The fragments had the words "Showa 12 July" on them. In other words, the bomb was manufactured less than three months ago. The fact that the Japanese army is using newly manufactured military supplies for combat is puzzling. Has the Japanese army gradually depleted its old stockpiles of military supplies after two months of fighting in North China and Shanghai? According to foreign military observers in this port, Japanese soldiers have a tendency to abuse military supplies. For example, if two or three Chinese soldiers are ambushed on the Jiangbin of Pudong and occasionally open fire to snipe, Japanese soldiers will open fire for 15 to 20 minutes to retaliate, spending about 100 bullets. If they were good shooters, two or three bullets would be enough. Military experts believe that no army in the world abuses military supplies more than the Japanese army.

### Foreign Nationals Flock Back to Shanghai

More Than 200 Foreign Nationals Arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday Afternoon

At the beginning of the Shanghai war, many foreign nationals from various countries, such as Britain and the United States, went to Hong Kong to take refuge. However, because business matters needed to be handled and they could not stay in Hong Kong for a long time, they have recently been flocking back to Shanghai. The British ship Kwabsang arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 2:00 PM yesterday, carrying more than 200 foreign nationals. The ship docked at the Wusongkou and transferred to a passenger tender to land at the new customs wharf.

### Meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors of the Certified Public Accountants Association

Purchased More Than 70,000 Yuan of Public Bonds; Donated 2,000 Yuan for慰劳 Money

The Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association convened a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors yesterday. It was reported that: (1) Public bonds for national salvation: Mr. Xi Yushu, captain of the solicitation team of this association, reported that in addition to the 10,000 yuan of public bonds for national salvation already purchased by this association, members have subscribed and solicited for more than 62,000 yuan. (2) Donated 2,000 yuan for慰劳 money for those going north. Director Wang was recommended as the representative for慰劳ing those going north.

### As a Result of Militarism, Enemy Generals and Soldiers Killed Their Beloved Wives and Jumped into the Sea

According to Japanese newspapers, enemy Air Force Captain Ito Kazue, who participated in air combat in Baoding, was shot down by our army. When the bad news reached the country, his wife, Ume, hated her husband's unprovoked sacrifice. In grief, she secretly went to the Kitagawa coast near Izu on the 2nd of this month and committed suicide by jumping into the sea. Japanese warlords only know how to pursue militarism and launch unjust wars of aggression against other countries, but they do not know that their people are making unnecessary sacrifices. The death of Ito Kazue on the battlefield and the suicide of his beloved wife are particularly tragic. No wonder the anti-war atmosphere among the Japanese people is getting stronger and the morale of the soldiers in the front is getting lower.

### When Will Your Rampage End?

— Zhou Xianwen

Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japan's aggression against China can be described as "smooth sailing." The September 18th Incident in 1931 allowed Japan to seize our Northeast four provinces "without lifting a finger." Consequently, Japanese warlords became carried away, acting recklessly. However, the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident finally drove China to the point of no return. To ensure the survival of the nation and its people, China had no choice but to rise in resistance. The sound of artillery fire in Shanghai on August 13th further demonstrated China's determination to resist. The Shanghai battle has been ongoing for two months, and our defensive positions are exceptionally strong. The Japanese warlords' "quick victory" strategy has clearly suffered a severe blow. From now on, "When will your rampage end?"

Japan's reasons for rampaging in China are threefold: first, overpopulation; second, opposition to communism; and third, elimination of anti-Japanese sentiment. It seeks to use the slogan of overpopulation to portray its plight, the slogan of opposing communism to gain international sympathy, and the slogan of eliminating anti-Japanese sentiment to facilitate its aggressive actions. However, the facts tell us that what Japan has in excess is not population but commodities. On the contrary, it is the Chinese people who, under Japan's economic aggression, have no means of livelihood, leading to the phenomenon of overpopulation. Some claim that Japan's population increases significantly each year, taking it as a fact. But this "fact" is a result of Japan's aggression against China, not a cause of it. As for Japan's intention to oppose communism, it is truly a case of "Sima Zhao's intention, known to all." To put it bluntly, opposing communism is the pretext, while invading China is the reality. The Nationalist government spent ten years suppressing the communists, leaving a trail of bloodshed. If Japan were truly determined to oppose communism, it would be eager to provide assistance and friendship, rather than taking advantage of the situation to forcibly occupy the Northeast. Now that the Northeast has been occupied, if Japan had the determination to oppose communism, it should have turned its weapons northward to confront Soviet Russia. However, in the past six years, we have only witnessed the turmoil in North China and the gradual southward expansion of Japanese influence. Under these circumstances, anyone with a sense of morality would inevitably rise up in resistance, unwilling to be enslaved. Yet, Japan falsely accuses this of being anti-Japanese sentiment, turning the cause and effect upside down. Furthermore, it seeks to eliminate this sentiment by force, further revealing its intentions.

Now, fortunately, first, Japan originally intended to use the excuse of eliminating anti-Japanese sentiment to facilitate its aggressive actions, but the result has been to strengthen the internal unity of China. Currently, the Chinese people, regardless of class or political affiliation, prioritize national interests and consider resisting Japan as their greatest task. Japan's conspiracy has not only failed but is akin to carrying firewood to put out a fire, inevitably leading to its own self-immolation. Second, Japan originally intended to use the excuse of opposing communism to gain international sympathy, but the result has been to increase international indignation towards Japan. On October 5th, U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a speech, and the U.S. State Department issued a statement the next day, condemning Japan for violating treaties and invading China. The League of Nations General Assembly also passed a draft resolution from the Twenty-Three Nation Advisory Committee on October 7th, formally condemning Japan's actions in China and recommending the convocation of a Nine-Power Treaty conference. Furthermore, the people of various countries are enthusiastic about boycotting Japanese goods. Japan's schemes have not only failed but have also left it isolated. Third, Japan originally intended to use the excuse of overpopulation to portray its plight, but the result has been to truly make it difficult for the Japanese people to live. Because Japan wants to invade China, it must inevitably incur the costs of aggression. To raise the funds for aggression, "the wool comes from the sheep," and the Japanese people are naturally subject to increased exploitation. The impoverishment of the Japanese people is inevitable.

According to records, in 1931, the year of the September 18th Incident, Japan's total annual expenditure was only over one billion yuan. In the past six years, it has soared to over 2.8 billion yuan, an increase of about threefold. The majority of this increase is used for military expenses to invade China. To put it plainly, in 1931, Japan's military expenditure was only over 400 million yuan, but now it has increased to over 1.4 billion yuan, an increase of about two and a half times. These many military expenses were already difficult for the Japanese people to bear. However, since China implemented resistance, Japan has had to temporarily increase its expenses for aggression. From the Lugouqiao Incident to now, only two months have passed, and Japan has successively increased temporary military expenditures four times, totaling 2.5 billion yuan. Together with the original regular military expenditures, the total reaches a staggering 4 billion yuan. Japan's methods of raising these funds for aggression are twofold: first, issuing public bonds as much as possible, and second, drastically increasing taxes. As of the end of August, Japan's national debt totaled 11 billion yuan, and the majority of liquid capital has been absorbed. Capital for production, on the other hand, has become strained. However, in order to exhaust the pond to catch the fish, the Japanese government does not hesitate to implement the so-called low-interest rate policy, hoping to strengthen the power of public bond sales by reducing the interest rates on general investments. As a result, capital for production becomes increasingly insufficient, and production enterprises feel increasingly difficult. Coupled with the increase in taxes, except for a few military industries, all are greatly devastated. Not only that, but as a result of the expansion of armaments, raw materials for military supplies are continuously imported from foreign countries. As of September 20th, the excess of imports over exports for this year has reached 78.1 million yuan. On the reverse side of the excess of imports, there is the outflow of cash. As of September 20th of this year, Japan's cash outflow has reached 55 million yuan. All these factors contribute to the rise in prices. Taking July 1914 as 100, the retail price index in Japan in September of this year has risen to 177.6, the highest record in recent years. Now that countries around the world have launched a boycott of Japanese goods, Japan's production enterprises will inevitably be further affected. These facts are all pushing the Japanese people to the point where they cannot make a living. If this continues, who can say that the Japanese warlords are not digging their own graves?

Of course, the Japanese warlords are already digging their own graves, but we must not only see the enemy's weaknesses and relax our own efforts. We must also remember that we have many weaknesses of our own and redouble our efforts. Only through hard work can we make up for our shortcomings and accelerate the enemy's collapse. Therefore, for the enemy, we certainly have to ask, "When will your rampage end?" For ourselves, we must also encourage ourselves, "How long can I endure?" And the Shanghai battle of the past two months has proven that we definitely have the ability to endure. Now we only need to work hard. With our hard work, Japanese warlords! "When will your rampage end!"

### Coming and Going in Bombardment

— Guo Moruo

Eight

It's the 24th. The sky is still overcast. Several friends came to visit early in the morning, and it wasn't until nine o'clock that I had some free time. I still felt it necessary to go to the Xinmin Newspaper office to find Tian Han. Now that quite a few friends knew of my arrival in Nanjing, it would inevitably be published in the newspaper sooner or later, so I didn't need to worry too much.

The Xinmin Newspaper office was run by Chen Mingde, a fellow Sichuan native. Mingde's wife, Ms. Deng Jixing, is a lawyer. Last spring, she went to Tokyo, Japan, for medical treatment, and I took care of her, so I also knew Mingde. Tian Han often wrote articles for the Xinmin Newspaper's supplement, so asking Mingde and Jixing would certainly lead to finding his residence.

When I went up to the second floor of the Xinmin Newspaper office, I ran into Mingde head-on. He was surprised and exclaimed, "Oh, oh, oh, you've come! When did you arrive?"

I saw Jixing talking to a female guest by the south window in the room, but she didn't move when she saw me enter the room and heard her husband's exclamation.

Mingde quickly reported to her, "Jixing, don't you recognize him? Mr. Guo is here!"

Only then did Jixing jump up with surprise and come to my side, saying quickly, "At first glance, I almost didn't recognize you. You look much younger than when I saw you in Japan."

"It's because you've changed your attire," Mingde explained, "When I saw you in Japan, you were wearing a kimono. Now you're wearing a Western suit, and you really look much younger."

Yes, that might be one reason, but people who haven't seen me in a kimono have also said I look younger, so this reason seems somewhat insufficient.

"How is Auntie? Have you received any letters? How are my younger fellow students?" Jixing asked solicitously. "We are truly concerned. A few days ago, Mr. Tian Shouchang went to Shanghai, and we specifically asked him to be sure to convey our regards to you."

"Shouchang has already gone to Shanghai?"

Needless to say, we missed each other on the road.

Then they asked about my residence. They insisted that I move into their mansion, saying that hotels were too expensive and the food wasn't convenient.

"Move to our place, definitely move! We have Sichuan cuisine every day!" Mingde said, laughing loudly to himself.

"Okay, I'll move. I'll help you pack. I'll go help you move," Jixing said decisively, turning to leave.

Seeing that they were too solicitous, I really couldn't refuse their kindness, so I agreed to move and agreed to return to the hotel with Jixing.

When I returned to the hotel and asked the bellboy to bring the bill, he said that someone in the accounting office had already instructed that I shouldn't pay for my bill. This was a bit unexpected. I couldn't figure out who the person giving the instruction was. When I left the hotel, I asked the accounting office, but the accounting office also didn't know, saying that the person who made the arrangements had gone out on business.

### Our Newspaper Reporter's Visit to a Frontline Commander: A Discussion on the War Situation

Our Soldiers Seek Survival in Death, with Hearts United from Top to Bottom; An End to Resistance and a Victorious Future Can Be Predicted

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Our newspaper reporter went to the ×× front last night to visit a certain commander and hear about the situation on that line. He set off in the evening, choosing his route carefully, and arrived at his destination without hindrance. When he arrived, the commander was inspecting the frontline and had not yet returned. Director Luo and Secretary Qiu received him warmly. After half an hour, the commander returned and granted him an audience. The commander and his staff recounted the situation of the war and their personal feelings. The details are as follows:

The Significance of the Shanghai Battle is Not Minor

For an all-out war, one must first identify the main battlefield, then devote all efforts to it. Victory on the main battlefield will make it easier to resolve the battles elsewhere. This is the first essential in military strategy. The Shanghai battle is clearly in an important position. First, it concerns international attention; second, Shanghai is a key point in our country's rivers and seas. Therefore, we have concentrated a considerable amount of force here. The enemy has also done the same. For two months, although the enemy has mobilized more than ten divisions of its national elite troops, it has gained only a small piece of land. Its casualties and losses have been unprecedented.

The Strength of Both Sides is Not Very Different

Currently, our armies and divisions are equipped evenly. The deployment of positions varies depending on the strategy, but regardless of which unit they belong to, morale is extremely high. Each unit is determined to live and die with its position. Without orders from higher authorities, even if only one soldier remains, they will never retreat. Recalling the Battle of the Great Wall, the comparison of military strength between the enemy and us was that our seven divisions were only equal to the enemy's two or eight divisions, a ratio of three to one. Now, it is a ratio of one to one. There is no significant difference in strength. Although the enemy relies on its elite mechanized units, its four general offensives have not made significant progress. It also relies on the power of a large number of aircraft, hoping to pose a mental threat to us, but it is still not enough to shake the strong fighting spirit of our soldiers.

We Are Not Afraid of the Threat of Enemy Aircraft

The effectiveness of aircraft is limited to mental threats. In fact, the actual killing effect is mediocre. The frontline soldiers are never gathered in one place, and the explosive power of a bomb is limited in scope. Soldiers lie in deep trenches, and unless they are directly hit by a bomb, they will not be injured. The enemy's operational plan must first concentrate the firepower of aircraft and artillery, attempting to destroy our fortifications. In fact, this strategy may not be very effective. Even if one place is destroyed, it is not difficult to repair it. Moreover, our defensive fortifications are layered, which in strategy is called depth deployment. To destroy all of them would require tens of thousands of bombs. It is merely an ideal and not something that can be achieved in reality.

Seeking Survival in Death, Hearts United from Top to Bottom

In modern warfare, in addition to military force, ideological warfare and economic warfare are also very important. In this all-out war of our country, the enemy is the aggressor, and we are the oppressed. We have only two paths: life and death. If we want the independence and survival of the country and the freedom and liberation of the nation, we have only one method: to bravely resist and seek survival in death. Not only do commanders share this sentiment, but the soldiers also understand this principle. Therefore, in terms of ideology, our army has already gained the upper hand. As for economic warfare, there is no doubt that the enemy is already in a disadvantaged position.

Releasing Poison Gas Only Damages Their Prestige

The enemy, because of the difficulty of the war, does not hesitate to violate international law and release poison gas. In fact, the effect of poison gas is less than that of aircraft. Although its mental power is great, it does not have much serious military significance. The release of poison gas is only limited to local areas. Even to poison a small village, a large number of poison gas bombs must be consumed. It is merely an ideal. Moreover, our army has very complete anti-poison equipment. In short, the enemy's release of poison gas against our soldiers and the enemy aircraft's massacre of innocent civilians only exposes its barbaric behavior, prompting the isolation of its national defense position and losing the prestige of a strong country.

Northeast Compatriots Forced to Fight

What is even worse is that in the enemy's "Precautions for Operations Against China," any wounded soldiers of our army who are left behind on the enemy's side must have a knife jabbed into their heads and be left to die. It is truly the most cruel act in the world. The enemy also recruited the puppet Manchukuo army from the Northeast to serve as a vanguard and selected those who must have family members, using promotion and wealth as bait to induce them to serve as cannon fodder in order to achieve the purpose of exterminating their race. It is pitiful that the simple-minded compatriots in the Northeast were bewitched into this, but it was also out of the coercion of violence, and there was nothing they could do about it. It is estimated that there are more than two divisions of the puppet Manchukuo army in the Shanghai area.

Mechanized Units Disadvantageous in the South

The enemy repeatedly sends reinforcements, and each general offensive can only last for four or five days at most before it is exhausted, resulting in declining morale and no fighting spirit. Moreover, its soldiers cannot endure hardship. When it rains, they are trapped in a state of difficulty, which is more convenient for us. Therefore, even if the enemy increases its forces to more than 200,000 troops, it cannot penetrate our territory. Especially in the southern villages, the rivers and canals are crisscrossed, and the enemy's tanks and other mechanized units cannot exert their full power. They underestimated our army's strength, thinking that we were as vulnerable as before. What they don't know is that we also have mechanized units. After two months of resistance, they realized the strength of our army and suffered heavy losses.

The Plan to Break Through Has Become a Pipe Dream

The enemy's plan for a central breakthrough in the Liu Hang area has not yet succeeded. It has only occupied about one kilometer west of the Liu Hang-Luodian highway. The enemy troops in Luodian have not dared to charge us once. Once our army launches an attack, they immediately collapse and retreat. They even flee at the sound of our army's bugle call. Their morale has declined to such an extent. Although they succeeded in secretly crossing the Wenzaobang River, they have not been able to penetrate deeply. Occasionally, they launched an assault, but were attacked by us from the left and right, and retreated without support. They suffered even more casualties fighting with their backs to the water. Currently, although the number of our army's artillery is less than that of the enemy, its power is much greater. For several days, enemy aircraft have been reconnoitering our positions, but have not found anything. Today (the 15th), more than ten enemy aircraft reconnoitered separately, but were driven back by our anti-aircraft artillery. Later, they raised balloons to reconnoiter in the Luodian area, but they immediately landed after our bombardment. The enemy's fear of our new weapons can be seen from this.

The Dawn of National Rejuvenation Has Already Appeared

The Chinese troops currently fighting in Shanghai include troops from all provinces. They all have strong will and courageous spirit, which is enough to show the determination of the whole country to unite and resist the enemy in all respects. This is nothing less than a sign of the future national rejuvenation and glory. As for the prospects of the war, they are absolutely optimistic. At this point in the conversation, our reporters bid farewell and left. We heard the sound of cannons rumbling. According to the commander, it was our army's artillery bombarding the enemy. At the same time, the machine guns were as dense as strings of pearls, and our army was exerting great power in a certain direction, attacking the enemy. In the dim moonlight, we stepped out of the small lanes and drove back to the hotel. It was already late in the night.

### War Diary (8)

— Special Correspondent Chen Wanli from the Central News Agency

October 14th

I woke up at 5:30 in the morning and heard the buzzing of aircraft, which continued until dusk. There was bombing everywhere all day long. The enemy's goal is to destroy our lives (including combatants and non-combatants) and destroy our property. But besides dropping many tons of bombs, they also distributed a lot of clumsy propaganda.

I saw three kinds of propaganda:

The first kind depicted a person (labeled "Red Russia") hanging a rabbit (labeled "Resist Japan") outside a wooden cage. Inside the wooden cage, a lion (identified as Chairman Chiang) was lunging out. There were also two people wearing clogs and kimonos watching from the side. The drawing was printed with twelve characters: "The Result of Resisting Japan is Communist Extinction." – We don't need to refute whether "the result of resisting Japan" is so-called "communist extinction." Just looking at the drawing, it makes people feel the lion's bravery and endearing nature, but there is absolutely no other impression to be had. This propaganda technique is truly clumsy to the extreme. In addition to this, the propaganda also printed fourteen large characters, saying something like "Dying before the Campaign is Won, Heroes Weep Bitterly." The "Campaign" character is clearly a typo for "Army Division". Like how the Chinese Chess only has a "General" and no "Army Division". As I feel "Dying before the Campaign is Won" is precisely an accurate picture of the enemy. Since August 13th until now, it has been more than two months. Ship after ship of living people is constantly being brought here, and ship after ship of ashes and corpses is constantly being taken back. But our positions have not wavered in the slightest.

The second kind said that Nanxiang and Jiangwan had been surrounded, and hoped that our soldiers would immediately surrender to the enemy. If they surrendered, they would have good food, good clothes, and good housing. The propaganda also printed a photo. In the photo, an enemy officer sat in the middle, and four civilians wearing short shirts and trousers sat on either side. – If they weren't traitors, they were refugees under the threat of the enemy. At a glance, it was obvious that they were not soldiers. The soldiers on the front lines are quite clear about whether Nanxiang and Jiangwan have been surrounded. What use is there in the enemy fabricating this rumor? It is strange that they did not say that Zhabei had also been surrounded. Presumably, in the enemy's mind, Zhabei had already been occupied by them.

The third kind said that resisting Japan is a dead end, and surrendering is a path to survival. In addition, it of course said all sorts of good things after surrendering. "Only Resisting Japan is a Path to Survival" has long been deeply imprinted in the minds of every soldier. Now everyone knows that what the enemy says about "Resisting Japan is a Dead End" is a dead end for Japan. As for "Surrendering is a Path to Survival", that is probably because Nanxiang and Jiangwan have been surrounded. In fact, even if they were really surrounded, we would still resist to the end. Isn't Yao Ying's defense of Baoshan to the death a good precedent? Moreover, the current front lines are still far from Nanxiang. If the enemy really wants to surround Nanxiang, let's see how many more reinforcements they can add.

Next to the second and third kinds of propaganda were printed words such as "Those who come to surrender with this leaflet will be rewarded with 'Yuan' in silver dollars." In fact, what does the enemy have to worry about? Even if it printed "Rewarded with a Thousand Silver Dollars", no one would "come to surrender with this leaflet". The enemy's distribution of these propaganda only shows that they have no way to deal with the war. Aren't the battles on all lines very quiet today?

On the bright moonlit night, our air force flew overhead, and then we saw bright artillery shells flying in the sky, and heard heavy explosions coming from the ground. We relieved the boredom of the whole day and happily looked at the distant sky. (To be continued)

### Italian Fascists Reassign Leader in Shanghai

Angelo Righini, the Italian Fascist leader in Shanghai, has been recalled to his home country and is scheduled to leave Shanghai by ship on the 18th. His position has been reassigned to Luciano Riggio. Mr. Riggio is the manager of the Richang Foreign Firm in this city and has now received an order from his home country to take over.

### Zhejiang People Launch Homecoming Service Corps

The day before yesterday (the 14th) at noon, Zhejiang natives living in Shanghai, such as Chu Fucheng and thirty others, convened a meeting of initiators for the Zhejiang Native Homecoming Service Corps in Shanghai. It was decided that all the initiators would form a preparatory committee and temporarily set up an office in the Quan Zhe Public Association, located in the Donglianzhuli of Avenue Edward VII, in order to actively carry out preparatory work. The initiation of this corps is purely for the needs of the war of resistance, so that natives of Zhejiang living in Shanghai can easily return to their hometowns to serve, either by running industries or engaging in culture, to fulfill the civic duty of supporting the resistance against the enemy.

### Intense Battles, Tense Relief Work

The Relief Committee Needs Monthly Expenses of 100,000 Yuan Urgently. Donations Are Eagerly Awaited.

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to various trade associations, soliciting donations for relief. The letter stated: "Respectfully, we are writing to inform you that the Shanghai Relief Committee is a relief organization for wounded soldiers jointly formed by your association and 38 other organizations. From its inception, it has been beset by war. For the past two months, the work has been arduous. We believe this situation has been detailed in the reports we have repeatedly submitted. Although our colleagues are working hard and suffering, we dare not slacken our efforts, in order to live up to the expectations of the authorities. However, the Committee needs monthly expenses of 100,000 yuan, and its economic sources depend on the assistance of all sectors of society to be effective. We have always admired your association as the backbone and leader of the people in our Committee, with a warm heart for national affairs. Therefore, we are writing to request that, in addition to providing assistance to the best of your ability, you also do your best to solicit donations from all sectors of society. We believe that with a call to action, there will be no shortage of righteous people who are willing to contribute. By accumulating sand into a tower, we can surely achieve our goals. The future of relief efforts depends on your cooperation. Your insignificant efforts are sincerely requested to be approved and undertaken, and we believe that your patriotic and righteous actions will surely be happily accepted.

### Red Swastika Society Relief Team

The Red Swastika Society Relief Team departed for the front line in Zhabei at ten o'clock last night, amidst the continuous intense battles, to rescue 57 wounded soldiers, who were sent to various hospitals for diagnosis and treatment. It is also reported that the Wuxi branch of the Society attaches importance to the relief work in the rear, and has established several temporary hospitals and shelters. As of September 30th, it has sheltered a total of 30,384 refugees, provided relief to 37,982 people, treated 1,589 people in various hospitals, distributed more than 10,000 pieces of clothing, and buried dozens of corpses.

### Women's Education Center Relief Class

The Shanghai Women's Education Center is running a relief training class, with a quota of 100 students. Women with a high school education or above can join. Classes are scheduled to begin on the 24th of this month, with classes held three times a week. The course lasts for three weeks. The registration offices are located at 54 Hualong Road and 630 Xianbaik Road.

### The Enemy Viciously Attacks the Dunwu Temple Position, Our Bloody Battle Lasts All Night, Finally Forcing the Enemy to Retreat

The Enemy-Breached Lines Have Been Completely Recovered. The Enemy Also Launches a Large-Scale Attack on Chenjiaxiang, Failing to Succeed. In the Zhabei and Jiangwan Areas, We Hold Our Original Positions.

The following is a forward report received by this newspaper at 2:00 PM today: (1) The enemy concentrated heavy troops in the Zhusanfang and Shenjiazai areas southeast of Guangfu Town, actively organizing and preparing for days. Starting at 7:00 PM last night, they viciously attacked our Dunwu Temple position. More than ten enemy tanks covered the infantry's charge. Our army calmly met the attack. After several hours of fierce fighting, our army's position was once breached by the enemy. At midnight, our fresh reinforcements arrived and immediately launched a fierce counterattack. The enemy, unable to gain a firm foothold, stubbornly resisted, but their momentum was exhausted. By 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy had collapsed and fled in disarray, and we recovered our original position. (2) Chenjiaxiang, west of Dunwu Temple, is about three kilometers southeast of Guangfu Town. Enemy aircraft and artillery concentrated their bombardment, which did not stop all day yesterday. In the evening, the enemy launched a large-scale attack, coordinating with the Dunwu Temple area, attempting to break through this line and go straight to Nanxiang. After being met with a head-on blow by our defending troops, the enemy left hundreds of bodies behind and fled in panic. (3) The remaining enemy near Heida Huang's residence on the south bank of the Wenzao Creek, except for a few scout troops with occasional activity, remained deeply entrenched, seemingly waiting for reinforcements. The enemy at Miaoji also did not dare to attack again. The enemy's objective on this line is Dachang, and it is expected that there will be fierce battles within days. (4) There was only scout engagement in the Luodian Shixianggong Temple area. The front of Guangfu Town was calm. (5) In Zhabei and Jiangwan, we hold our original front lines. Small groups of enemies came to harass us, and we annihilated them one after another. (6) Enemy warships shelled our Pudong positions all night yesterday, and we also returned fire. The enemy's military base in Hongkou suffered considerable damage. (7) This morning, enemy aircraft continued to wreak havoc in Zhabei, West Shanghai, Dachang, and Zhenru, attempting to destroy our highway transportation from Zhenru to Dachang, but the bombs mostly fell in the surrounding fields, causing no damage.

### The Enemy Viciously Attacks Dunwu Temple Southeast of Guangfu Last Night

One Point of the Position Was Briefly Breached; A Fierce Counterattack Finally Recovered It

The enemy at Liuhang repeatedly attacked our army's frontal position at Guangfu Town and suffered defeat. Therefore, they changed their approach, attacking from the north and south flanks. Dunwu Temple and Chenjiaxiang, located about three kilometers southeast of Guangfu and forming a triangular area with Liuhang and Guangfu, were heavily attacked by the enemy last night, attempting to break through our army's front lines and advance on Nanxiang. Yesterday, the enemy troops at Zhusanfang and Shenjiazai concentrated their forces and, after 7:00 PM in the evening, launched a fierce attack on our army's positions at Dunwu Temple and Chenjiaxiang with all their strength. Enemy aircraft were very active in the dim moonlight, and at the same time, enemy artillery in the rear relentlessly bombarded, covering the advance of their tanks and infantry. The artillery fire was continuous and extremely intense. Our army fought bravely and desperately, advancing wave upon wave. Countless enemy soldiers who advanced were sacrificed in hand-to-hand combat and by machine guns. The fierce battle continued until midnight. Due to the severe damage to our fortifications, one point was finally breached by the enemy. Our army's fresh troops also arrived at that time, and all the troops on the entire line suddenly doubled their efforts and cooperated in a counterattack. Our army charged forward and fought the enemy in a bloody battle. By 3:00 AM this morning, the breached point had been completely recovered. The destroyed fortifications were immediately repaired, and the position was completely restored and became even more solid. The attacking enemy, after this severe blow, collapsed and retreated in disarray. They no longer dare to approach and harass us. Only the sentry squads have engaged in retaliatory fire for mutual alert.

### The Battle on the South Bank of the Wenzao Creek Becomes Intense Again

The Enemy at Heida Huang's Residence Viciously Attacks but is Severely Beaten

The enemy on the south bank of the Wenzao Creek, confined to the area along both sides of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway, has dispersed its forces. Therefore, it is actively attacking the highway line, attempting to break through the encirclement and join forces to attack. According to a report from the Central News Agency's Jiangwan correspondent at 10:30 AM on the 10th, the enemy in the Heida Huang's residence area suddenly moved east last night and attacked our position northwest of Huangjiazhai. Our army was prepared early and immediately met the attack head-on without waiting for them to get close. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the enemy was finally repelled at 2:00 AM. Then, at dawn, the enemy came again with reinforcements, using smoke to cover their advance. Our army insisted on holding its original position and calmly resisted. The enemy repeatedly tried to charge, but they were all repelled by us. At the time of the report, the situation was still at a stalemate.

The enemy east of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway attacked westward at 2:00 AM this morning to provide support. Our army held the position near Tanjiawanzhai and tenaciously resisted. The enemy charged several times, but our army swept them with dense machine-gun fire. The enemy was ultimately unable to stay in front of our position for even a moment. The fierce battle lasted until 5:00 AM in the morning, and the enemy retreated with heavy casualties and no result. The enemy at Huzhai north of the creek boarded several small boats before dawn, attempting to sneak across to Gujiazhai to reinforce their troops. This was detected by our army, which shelled them with mortars, immediately destroying two of the boats. However, the enemy's artillery fire was extremely intense, firing at our Tang-Shenzhai and Su-Zhai areas to disrupt us, without stopping all night.

### The Enemy Repeatedly Harasses Zhabei, but is Repelled

After Three Hours of Fierce Fighting, the Enemy Suffers More Than a Hundred Casualties. Our Front Line in the Baoshan Road Area Remains Unchanged.

In the Zhabei area, from yesterday afternoon to this morning, the enemy army continued to harass our positions incessantly. Last night, the enemy, with a force of one company, attacked our position near Chizhi University from Qujiaqiao near the Qin'ai Patriotic Girls' School. Our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy's flank from Shuidian Road and Guangzhong Road. After more than three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was finally defeated. When the enemy army was defeated and retreated, if it were not for the cover of a large number of tanks, they would have been almost completely annihilated. However, the enemy suffered more than a hundred casualties. Last night and this morning, the enemy repeatedly attacked the areas of Tiantong'an Road, Baziqiao, and Baoshan Road, but they were all repelled by our army. The front line remains unchanged. At dawn this morning, a large number of enemy planes flew to Maigen Road to drop bombs, and at the same time bombed Dachang and Zhenru, attempting to disrupt our highway traffic in that area. However, the enemy planes were afraid of our anti-aircraft artillery fire and did not dare to fly low, so most of the bombs they dropped fell in the fields.

### The Enemy's Attack on Jiangwan Suffers Damage

We Meet the Attack in the Hejiaxiang Area. A Fierce Charge and Melee Cause the Enemy to Collapse and Retreat

In the Jiangwan area, yesterday afternoon, the enemy, with a force of two companies, attacked our Tiyuhui Road from Xiangyin Road, and a part of the force pressed towards our Baziqiao position from the east of the Wanguo Sports Field. Our army met the attack near Hejiaxiang Dongzhai and Beijizhai, and the fierce battle continued until night without stopping. Afterwards, our army launched a fierce charge and melee, and the enemy finally collapsed and retreated, suffering heavy damage. From this morning until noon, the fierce fighting in that area has continued unabated.

### Our Army Firmly Defends Shixianggong Temple

Our army's position at Shixianggong Temple in northeast Luodian was repeatedly attacked by the enemy army, but they were all repelled by our army. Knowing that it would be difficult to attack again, the enemy has been quite silent in that area for days. Our army's position is extremely solid. Last night, the enemy army attempted to harass Shixianggong Temple again. A small team of scout soldiers carried out sporadic fire in front of our army's position, testing our army's strength. Our army unexpectedly annihilated them in one fell swoop, with no one surviving.

### Enemy Warships Move Frequently off Baimao

Repeated Attacks Unsuccessful, They Move Downstream. They Seem to Have Abandoned Their Attempt to Land

After the enemy army's various advances were severely beaten by our army and their invasion plan was repeatedly frustrated, they recently attempted to shift our army's target, concentrating a large number of warships and transport ships at Baimao Estuary in the upper reaches of the Liu River, attempting to land and disturb our army's rear. Our army was heavily guarded, and the enemy never succeeded. According to a report obtained after our army's reconnaissance yesterday, the enemy warships off Baimao Estuary have frequently moved downstream, seemingly abandoning their attempt to land.

### The Artillery Battles Were Very Fierce Last Night and This Morning

On the Pudong Front, the artillery battles between the two sides were very fierce from last night to this morning. Although the sound of enemy naval guns was dense and continuous, the number of shells fired by our army was probably twice as many. The enemy army's positions in the Yangshupu area of East Shanghai suffered heavy damage.

At 9:00 PM last night, enemy warships in the Huangpu River again opened heavy artillery fire on Pudong. At this time, the peaceful front line was once again shaken by strong artillery fire. Our rear heavy artillery units also fired back, thus igniting another intermittent artillery battle. Enemy shells fell indiscriminately. Two shells landed in the Pujiang River outside the Yiyidu Taikoo Wharf, a British business. The rest fell in the fields. At about 10:30 PM, an enemy warship moored outside the Taitong Coal Depot in Lujiazui suddenly sent two small boats, fully loaded with thirty to forty soldiers, to land on the wharf of the depot to steal coal. They made no noise during their operations. Our army had already discovered them and immediately swept them with machine guns. Several enemy soldiers were wounded on the spot. They hastily carried a small amount of coal, boarded the boats, and quickly fled. The enemy warship in the river immediately swept the shore with heavy machine guns, and we also returned fire fiercely at the warship. The two sides exchanged machine-gun fire at the Qichang Depot wharf, and the situation was very intense. It lasted for half an hour before stopping. When our air force came to Shanghai for a night raid at midnight, in addition to resisting the air raids, the enemy warships also fiercely bombarded Pudong to prevent our army from attacking from both sides. At dawn this morning, our artillery units first fired a few shells at the enemy's positions. After being shocked, the enemy warships also returned fire with more than ten shells and then stopped. When the enemy warships in the Huangpu River fired, a shell landed in the Zhifang Bridge area behind the Taikoo Huatong Depot in Pudong and exploded on the ground. Hundreds of Jiangbei thatched sheds had been built there. The home of Wang Zeng, a native of Tongzhou at number 37 and 38, immediately caught fire. At that time, the north wind was fierce, and the fire spread rapidly with the help of the wind. The Pudong District Fire Brigade immediately dispatched personnel to put out the fire, but because the thatched sheds were extremely flammable and the Pudong River was relatively far away, it was very difficult to extinguish the fire at once. It gradually extinguished at 3:00 AM this morning. It is estimated that it burned for six hours, destroying 250 thatched sheds and more than 20 tile houses. The area of twenty acres was completely reduced to scorched earth.

### Enemy Planes Fiercely Bomb Zhabei

At 10:35 AM on the 17th, three enemy heavy bombers formed a squadron and circled over the Baoshan Road area in Zhabei, dropping 18 bombs. It is estimated that the first round dropped six bombs at the same time, all of which landed on the open space of Song Park Road and Liuying Road. Then, they dropped three bombs each four times. Two rounds landed in the Qiujiang Road railway area, and the rest landed in the open space east of Zhongxing Road and north of Song Park Road. Another three enemy planes circled over Tanzigang, dropping more than ten bombs, all of which landed in various places on Jiaotong Road, Zhongshan Road, and Maigen Road Station in that area.

Yesterday afternoon, two enemy planes circled over various towns in the rear of Pudong, indiscriminately dropping bombs and bombing. It was found this morning that a small bomb was dropped at Zhoupu Station. The glass in the station building and civilian houses was shattered. Two more bombs fell behind the nearby Nursery, landing on the bank of the river, breaking half a root of the power line pole. A bomb was dropped on the Yan Family Bridge Tang Yan Family Elementary School, destroying three school buildings. There were no deaths or injuries. Four bombs were dropped one after another at Wu's Great Bamboo Garden in Beicai South. Wu Xiaodi, who had fled there to take refuge, was killed. Wu Jinrong's wife and Wu Xinglin were injured. The enemy also strafed the villagers with machine guns, killing one person picking reed flowers. Then, two more bombs were dropped on the wasteland behind Gu's Great Bamboo Garden in the south, injuring a cow. Six coffins were all shattered by the bombing. Three bombs were dropped behind the Qinci Yangdian Temple, injuring two farmers, Bao Xiu and Xiao Shenshangshigen. They were rescued and treated by the Red Cross separately.

### Enemy Corpses and Ashes Are Secretly Transported to Taiwan

Only One-Tenth Are Sent to Tokyo. Fearing Public Panic, They Intentionally Cover It Up.

According to information obtained by a reporter from the China Eastern News Agency, the enemy secretly transported another ship of enemy corpses, ashes, and bones away from Shanghai this morning. According to reports, they were transported to remote areas of Taiwan for burial. In the past, the enemy has transported away enemy corpses, and most of them were transported to that place. Only one-tenth of them were transported to Tokyo. It is said that the enemy is trying to cover this up because they are afraid of public panic, so they are not even letting the Japanese people know about the corpses and bones.

### The United States Accepts the Invitation to Attend the Nine-Power Conference

Davis Appointed as Chief Representative. Will Adopt a Strong Position.

[Washington] The United States has formally accepted the invitation of this government to attend the Far East Nine-Power Treaty Conference convened in Beijing on October 20. The personnel of the US delegation have also been appointed. The Chief Representative is Davis, the US Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. The other representatives include Hong Peck, Special Advisor to Secretary of State Hull and Director of the State Department's Far East Division; Mo Fei, Director of the State Department's European Division; and two others. The delegation is scheduled to sail from New York aboard the "Washington" on the 20th of this month. It is heard that the initial purpose of the United States in participating in the conference is to promote "consensual peace" between China and Japan. Informed sources believe that the United States will adopt a strong position at the conference, based on the following two considerations: (1) The United States quickly accepted the invitation of the Belgian government, regardless of whether the participants in the conference are limited to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and whether Germany and the Soviet Union are invited. (2) The personnel of the US delegation are extremely strong and well-organized. It is heard that the US government does not place much emphasis on which countries participate in the conference. The United States is willing to cooperate with any country that wishes to join the mediation efforts of the Sino-Japanese conflict. Secretary of State Hull said that, as far as he knows, the conference will be limited to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty until the first meeting. The following is the reply from the United States accepting the invitation: "US Secretary of State, 特, presents his compliments to the Belgian Ambassador and formally accepts the Ambassador's letter of October 16 of this year, which states that the government of the King of Belgium, at the request of the British government and with the consent of the US government, specifically suggests that the signatory countries to the treaty signed on February 6, 1922, hold a conference in Brussels on October 30 to follow the provisions of Article 7 of the treaty, examine the situation in the Far East, and study what peaceful and rapid solutions there are to the regrettable conflicts there. The US government is pleased to accept the invitation and has been selected by the President Mr. Davis as the representative of the United States. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt made a statement to reporters in Hyde Park City yesterday, explaining the mission of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. At that time, the President advised reporters not to speculate on the future development of US policy. The purpose of this was to reiterate that US policy is purely based on the changing circumstances of the situation. President Roosevelt also stated that if the results are good, the US government may be prepared to act as a mediator between China and Japan. As a result, the general public believes that the instructions given to Davis, the chief US representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, are to first seek a basis for compromise. As for this meeting, if a compromise cannot be found, what kind of situation will arise, the State Department has also considered it. The US government still hopes that countries will take common action to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, and has not yet drafted a detailed plan. In addition, US officials also said that although the current tense situation in the Mediterranean has no direct relationship with the United States, the policy of how the United States will cooperate with various countries in the Far East can only be determined after the Mediterranean issue is resolved. In other words, if the results of the London Adjustment Conference can ease the tense situation in Europe, then the hope of resolving disputes in the Far East will inevitably be strengthened.

### The Enemy Army Attacking Niangziguan Suffers Heavy Losses in an Ambush

### 300,000 Comfort Funds Have Been Raised for the Soldiers in the North

Will Depart Once 500,000 Yuan Has Been Raised. Huang Renzhi and Others Will Return to Shanghai to Comfort the Troops.

### Only Cooperation Between the Military and the People Can Ensure Sustained Warfare

Rice is Ripe in the Four Villages, But No One is Harvesting It

This morning, a staff officer from a certain unit on the Luodian front came to Shanghai and spoke with the reporter for a long time, sharing with me the recent situation there. I will summarize and record it below: (1) In the Luodian area, our army is currently firmly defending the line from Shixianggong Temple to Caowang Temple. The fortifications are solid and the arrangements are comprehensive, and we are determined to fight a sustained war. The enemy army in that area launched fierce attacks for a day and a half, knowing that our army is strong and that there is no possibility of making progress. Therefore, for the past ten days, both sides have held their original lines, and there have been no fierce battles. (2) The enemy has shifted their gaze to the Dachang and Miaohang areas, and it is expected that a major battle will occur on that line. (3) We deeply feel that this time, in this total war of resistance, cooperation between the military and the people is essential to ensure sustained warfare. According to the current situation, poor people fleeing from the disaster seem to be able to return to their hometowns as soon as possible to rebuild their old businesses, so as to avoid the interruption of their livelihoods in the future. (4) The rice in the four villages is ripe, but no one is harvesting it, and it is being abandoned on the ground. It is a great pity. If no measures are taken to harvest it, it will have a significant impact on the people's food supply in the future. It is hoped that the scattered farmers will return to their hometowns as soon as possible and cooperate closely with the garrison troops. With the stability of our army's defenses, there should be no security problems.

### Enemy Planes Run Rampant in Wuxi

[Wuxi] At 9:00 AM on the 16th, three enemy planes dropped seven bombs one after another at the intersection of the station and Xiden Road and Fengshui Bang outside the east gate.

### Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Qingdao

[Qingdao] Four enemy planes reconnoitered over Qingdao and the Yindao area at 10:30 AM on the 16th, circling for several weeks before flying west. (Special dispatch on the 16th)

### Xuzhou Citizens Make Cotton-Padded Clothes to Comfort the Wounded Soldiers

[Xuzhou] Xuzhou citizens raised funds to make a thousand cotton-padded vests to comfort the wounded soldiers and continued to make ten thousand cotton-padded coats, which were prepared to be transported to the front line to be given to the soldiers on the front line. (Special dispatch on the 17th)

### Yunnan Female Laborers Make Clothes to Give to Wounded Soldiers

[Kunming] Zhou Yansheng, a female laborer in this city, has a poor life, but she is very concerned about the wounded soldiers on the front line who are resisting the enemy. She generously made four sets of underwear for the wounded soldiers herself and handed them over to the Youth Association to donate to the front line on her behalf. She also instructed them to write a ditty on the clothes: "I do not begrudge the hard work, Making underwear for you, I am ashamed of my limited resources, Do not despise the slight gift, The army is just, we will eventually win, Body wounded, will unmoved, When success is achieved, Respectfully wait for your triumphant return." This shows a glimpse of the psychological state of our national resistance. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)

### Stray Bullets Kill Japanese Residents in Hongkou

At 5:00 PM the night before last (the 14th), when our army fiercely attacked the enemy on North Sichuan Road, the Japanese in the Hongkou area were panicked. Our artillery shells bombed the enemy army's positions in Hongkou with extraordinary accuracy. That night, many Japanese residents in Hongkou were killed by stray bullets. They included Fujikawa Fujijiro of the Japan Telegraph Bureau at the intersection of Xihuade Road and Tiantong Road; Yasukawa, a member of the Peng Road Residents' Association; a Shanghai war correspondent for the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun (name unknown); an Indian policeman from the Hongkou Public Security Bureau; the owner of a cafe on Yalv Road and Wusong Road. A famous elderly ronin couple was also killed by shrapnel. The ronin was the owner of a dim sum shop in Wusong called Takasagoya. He had been living in Shanghai for 28 years, so people called him the Old Ronin.

### British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China Returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong

The Warships Stationed in the Northern Seas Pass Through Shanghai and Sail to Hong Kong to Increase Defense

British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Liddell, inspected the defenses of his fleet in the South Seas and has now completed his mission. He returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong aboard the flagship "Kimpah" and will not go elsewhere for the time being. According to news from the British Navy, more than a dozen warships, submarines, and the aircraft carrier "Eagle" belonging to the fleet stationed at Dagu, Weihaiwei, and Yantai on the northern sea line have been ordered to transfer to Hong Kong's territorial waters to increase defense. They all passed through Shanghai and sailed to Hong Kong on the 16th and 17th.

### Trivial Comments

-- Phases

The famous Japanese commentator, Takano Shinfu, published an article in the Yomiuri Shimbun the other day, entitled "The War Begins Now." Among them, he said: "The two major Eastern nations are fighting bloody battles, killing each other. The more they fight, the more Europe celebrates. Therefore, the two major Eastern nations fighting each other are actually falling into Europe's trap." These few words are indeed very reasonable. But let's ask, who wants to fall into the trap? Our country does not want to enter the trap, but the Japanese insist on dragging us into the trap. Once in the trap, there is only one way to go: to perish together. The Japanese want to escape the trap and extricate themselves, but it will not be easy. This kind of policy is originally the enemy's suicide policy. If Takano Shinfu had said it earlier, and the young soldiers had realized it earlier, it would still be in time. But now, I am afraid they will sink deeper and deeper.

### The National Federation of Commerce and Industry Telegraphs to US Businesses, Requesting Sanctions Against the Brutal Japan

The Enemy Army Destroys Legal Investments of All Countries. Hopes to Adopt Joint Action to Rigorously Implement Severance of Relations.

The Shanghai Chinese National Federation of Commerce and Industry telegraphed the US National Federation of Commerce yesterday, saying: (Street Road) In the current crisis in the Far East, the position declared by your country, such as your government's previous stern condemnation of international illegal acts and advocacy of cooperation to safeguard peace, is deeply gratifying to our business community. Japanese aggression has caused China's foreign trade to fall into complete stagnation, and legal investments by various countries in China have been destroyed, which is extremely painful. We are also encouraged to hear that your country's enlightened people advocate the adoption of economic sanctions to curb aggression. We are currently rigorously implementing economic sanctions against Japan here. We hope that your colleagues will quickly take joint action. Although there may be inconveniences for general commerce at present, if this measure takes effect, peace will be restored, and the purchasing power of the people in the Far East will not be greatly affected by the war. If the incident is resolved early, wouldn't the rapid advancement of your country's commercial prospects in East Asia be enough to compensate for previous losses? We urge you to take a long-term view and lead the crowd, so that the friendship between China and the United States will be maintained for generations to come, and the economic ties between the two countries will become closer and closer. This is our sincere hope. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Commerce and Industry, respectfully requests the stamp.

### Using Government Bonds Interest Coupons to Pay for National Salvation Bonds

Fourth Term of Types A, B, and C; Discount Interest Rates Subject to Separate Regulations

The methods for using valuable securities and deposit slips to pay for National Salvation Bonds were previously circulated by the General Office of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee to all agencies collecting bond payments. However, Article 1 of those methods stipulated that only drawn government bond principal and interest coupons could be used. It is now reported that the Fundraising Committee, in order to encourage the purchase of National Salvation Bonds, has added a provision that the fourth term interest coupons of the 25th Year Unified Government Bonds, Types A, B, and C (due January 31, 1938), can also be presented to the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China for discount to pay for National Salvation Bonds. The discount interest rate is stipulated not to exceed the interest rate of the National Salvation Bonds (weekly rate of four per mille). This is considered extremely convenient for the general public purchasing National Salvation Bonds.

### Active Subscription to National Salvation Bonds

Business Community Continues to Raise 140,000 Yuan

The National Salvation Bonds Business Community Fundraising Team yesterday continued to raise National Salvation Bonds from the iron industry, wool weaving industry, book industry, restaurants and taverns industry, construction industry, bicycle sales and manufacturing industry, knitting industry, tung oil and ramie industry, embroidery industry, rice milling industry, egg industry, pollen industry, silk filature industry, tobacco industry, Chinese and foreign general merchandise industry, egg factories, and silk factories. A total of 142,247.69 yuan, mostly from the second or sixth batches.

Madame Kong, wife of Minister Kong and director of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee Women's Group, hosted more than fifty new team leaders, including Madame Yu, the Mayor's wife. Madame Kong delivered a speech, generally stating that women should not lag behind in saving the country. Ms. Lu Lihua gave a report, and the following important matters were resolved: (1) 900,000 yuan must be reached by the end of this month; (2) Wives of general managers of banks and various institutions throughout the city will be responsible for leading and organizing teams. It is reported that this week's results will be reported by Secretary-General Lu Lihua at the Ministry of Communications Radio Station from 4:45 PM to 5:00 PM today.

The Shanghai Seamen's Union Special Envoy Office, in addition to all committee members and employees enthusiastically subscribing to more than 1,000 yuan, is now listing the benefits of purchasing National Salvation Bonds in order to encourage widespread subscription among its members. It has issued a notice to seamen's branches throughout the country, instructing them to enthusiastically subscribe. The Chinese Women's Movement Promotion Association has been promoting and encouraging purchases among women and has already received more than 300,000 yuan in bonds. According to Team Leader Lu Lihua, speaking to a reporter from the Kuomin News Agency, the association's fundraising results are expected to reach 500,000 yuan by the end of the month and 1 million yuan by the end of the year.

The Coal Industry Association plans to subscribe for 200,000 yuan. Four batches have already been deposited in the bank, totaling more than 80,000 yuan. According to the association's estimates, it may exceed the original target and raise more than 300,000 yuan.

The Shanghai Youth Choral Society has issued a notice to all members, encouraging them to enthusiastically subscribe to National Salvation Bonds to increase the strength to resist the enemy. The results have been quite good.

### Soldiers in the Frontier Need 600,000 Winter Garments Due to Severe Cold

According to news from the Shanghai Office of the × Route Army, the frontier is severely cold, already below zero degrees. It is urgently hoped that compatriots across the country will quickly sew 600,000 cotton-padded garments and send them to both inside and outside the customs. According to their representative, the guerrilla forces are now gathering and dispersing irregularly, and cotton-padded clothes need to be carried at all times.

### Issues Regarding Traveling to Europe via Siberia

Soviet Union and Japan Deny; Western Newspapers Use Facts to Prove

The English-language *China Press* reports that although Soviet and Japanese authorities today (the 16th) both denied obstructing travelers intending to go to Europe via Siberia, the facts are undeniable. Some foreigners in Shanghai who recently planned to go to Europe via the Siberian Railway are now forced to change their route to the sea. The Soviet travel agency claimed today that tickets via Siberia can still be purchased, but travelers must go through Vladivostok or Manzhouli. The Japanese Embassy denied the Soviet travel agency's claim that Japan is currently restricting travelers entering Siberia via the Manchurian border, saying that the Soviet authorities are now doing their best to crack down on travelers entering Siberia via Manchuria. It is rumored that the Soviet Union intends to cut off traffic via Manzhouli, so anyone wishing to enter Siberia must go through Vladivostok. If so, traffic between the Manchurian border and Siberia will be completely cut off. Japanese authorities believe that this Soviet move is to prevent travelers from seeing the troops concentrated along the Siberian border. A senior official at the Soviet Consulate General firmly denied that the Soviet Union had restricted travelers from entering or leaving Siberia at any point, and said that some people had been refused passage through the Soviet Union, and other countries had followed suit, but the vast majority of travelers were still approved by the authorities. As proof, two Germans were only allowed to travel via Vladivostok a week or two ago. According to travelers arriving in Shanghai from Beiping, Soviet officials in Beiping have recently been very cautious about issuing passports for travel via Siberia, and are only issuing them to those who are absolutely reliable. If border points other than Manzhouli are not allowed to enter or exit, it will not affect travelers entering the Soviet Union from China, but those who want to go to the Siberian Railway from more convenient locations in Manchuria will not be able to do so as freely as before.

### Today's Zhu and Peng

— Central News Agency Reporter Wang Shaotong

Central News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch: The "Red Army" has changed its strategy in order to participate in the national resistance against Japan, abandoned its red flag, stood under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, reorganized into the Eighth Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army. They have gone to the front lines of the resistance and have already fought the enemy several times, achieving considerable victories. The general public holds a fervent hope for the past "Red Army's" durability in combat and its unique tactical advantages, that is, guerrilla tactics of exchanging small sacrifices for great victories, hoping that they will perform even better in this national war of resistance and fulfill the responsibilities that descendants of the Yellow Emperor should have in defending their motherland. The reporter shares this wish and, taking advantage of this opportunity to work on the front lines, especially on the morning of National Day, departed from Taiyuan to visit the commander and deputy commander of the Eighth Route Army, namely the two generals deeply imprinted in people's minds, Zhu De and Peng Dehuai. A truck loaded with more than twenty young people, apart from nine news reporters, were all going to work at the Eighth Route Army headquarters. Along the way, they sang various songs of resistance. Although the tunes were not entirely in sync, the voices were powerful and the spirit was radiant, which also aroused the attention of passersby and dispelled the loneliness of our journey. The truck traveled for seven hours on the dirt road, and near dusk arrived at a county town more than two hundred miles from Taiyuan. Departing from the county town, we walked twenty-five miles in the darkness, crossing two mountains. One mountain peak was the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army, our destination.

Impressions of Zhu and Peng

Because it was too late that day, the adjutant's office arranged for our food and lodging, and the head of the adjutant's office, Mr. Tang, accompanied us to chat. The conversation was about the past experiences of the "Red Army." Although we had a day of fatigue, listening to this interesting, meaningful, and previously very undisclosed historical story dispelled our fatigue, and we went to bed late at night. At eight o'clock the next morning, in the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army, a person wearing an old gray cloth uniform and a military cap with a party emblem was sitting at a desk, flipping through telegrams and official business. After being introduced, we learned that he was Peng Dehuai, the deputy commander of the Eighth Route Army. After exchanging greetings, our attention focused on him. The clothing was simple, the same as their orderlies, perhaps not as neat as the orderlies, because he was working. We did not want to disturb him, so we looked at the layout of the room. The four walls were covered with military maps, the desk was made up of two square tables pieced together, covered with a white cloth stained with ink and grease. The stationery was very simple, probably only enough for each of them to use. There were a few long wooden benches to sit on, and nothing else. At this time, an orderly brought up two plates of vegetables and a plate of noodles, lifted half of the tablecloth, and that was the dining table. He stopped working and started his breakfast, and at the same time started talking to us. Eating and talking, without any formalities, without any disguises, the attitude was somewhat romantic, but also very serious. Although the face was kind, the eyes were sharp. The questions we asked were answered in detail and sincerely. After more than an hour of conversation, we said goodbye. Near noon, Mr. Peng quietly arrived at our residence, sat down casually, and started talking casually. In less than half an hour, our lunch came, and he ate with us. Two plates of vegetables and a plate of noodles, a simple meal as usual, but rich in meaning. In the afternoon, we went to the commander's office again. A person wearing a soldier's uniform, glasses, and a full beard was standing at the door. None of us paid much attention and walked into the door, but their chief of staff immediately went over and introduced us, "This is Commander-in-Chief Zhu, just back from the front line." At this time, our hearts were filled with infinite shame, but this was really not surprising. They have no insignias, no collar badges, and even less the air of a general. If there is no writing on the forehead, how can you tell who is the officer and who is the soldier if you don't know them? Even a news reporter who is good at identifying people is at a loss here. He began to talk to us, similarly without any greetings or formalities, and wanted to talk about what he wanted to talk about, slowly but powerfully. The attitude was calm and firm, and the language rarely contained theory. It seemed that the starting point of every sentence was based on factual experience or experience. At more than five o'clock, we ate in the office. This time they were treating us. Three more dishes were added to the meal, needless to say, to express their welcome to the guests from afar. Although the reporter only had one day of meeting with the two gentlemen, their initial ordinary impression had been completely dispelled by the extraordinary conversation and special demeanor. Indeed, there are many extraordinary people in the world, often hidden under an ordinary appearance.

Talking About the Battle of Pingxingguan

The scope of the reporter's conversation with Mr. Zhu and Mr. Peng was very broad, including past memories, current situations, and earnest speculations. The discussion of the Eighth Route Army's operations in northern Shanxi, especially the Battle of Pingxingguan, was of great interest. I will now record the synthesis of what the two said. The battle was launched on the 25th of last month. Because the enemy saw that Yanmen Pass had natural dangers as a barrier and was heavily guarded, it was naturally not easy to attack, so they wanted to advance through Pingxingguan on our right flank. If they were to break through, they could advance directly into Fanshi and Daixian, cutting off the Yanmen Pass line. The enemy's plan was very thorough and vicious, but we had long anticipated this attempt, so the deployment of troops in this area had been very strong beforehand. The higher headquarters partially stationed troops in places like Tuanchengkou and Xiahuan. The Eighth Route Army ambushed in places like Ranzhuang, Baiyatai Pass, waiting for the enemy to advance and simultaneously begin a four-sided encirclement to annihilate them in one fell swoop. This deployment was very strict, and the enemy was completely unaware of the reality here. On the 25th, the 10th and 22nd Regiments of the enemy's famous Itagaki Division brazenly advanced towards Pingxingguan. Unexpectedly, just past the Xiaozhaicun area - this is a ditch between two mountains - the Eighth Route Army suddenly launched an attack from the side. This was something the enemy never dreamed of. For a time, they were panicked. It was really a dilemma. But this was our great opportunity. The Eighth Route Army encircled the enemy in one fell swoop, looking down from a height, and threw hand grenades. Although the enemy resisted fiercely, they could not deploy their heavy weapons in that narrow ditch and could not break through. They could only wait to be slaughtered. In addition to many casualties at the time, the enemy was captured alive more than 1,000 people, seized 74 tanks, heavy armored vehicles, and motorcycles, and seized the enemy's high command post, obtaining many important documents and military maps. They also found a corpse wearing the uniform of a senior general. These important documents have now been transported to Nanjing. The seventy vehicles were destroyed because they could not be transported away. This victory was not accidental. The biggest reason was the secrecy and speed of our march and the use of mountainous terrain to attack, so that the enemy could not use his skills. The only shortcoming was that the other three routes failed to coordinate with the Eighth Route Army, and ultimately a part of the enemy escaped towards Caijiayu. If our forces on the left flank had encircled and suppressed them at the same time, the enemy's losses in this battle would have been over 10,000. Just in this area, the enemy's casualties were already over 5,000, which must be said to be a great victory. Since the enemy suffered a defeat at Pingxingguan, they never dared to advance along this route again, but changed their route to attack through Ruyuekou. Unfortunately, they broke through, leading to the loss of Fanshi and Dai counties. This is truly regrettable. (To be continued)

### Postal Workers' Union Sends Personnel to Serve Wounded Soldiers

Writing Letters for Wounded Soldiers; Also Handling Postal Matters

The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, in view of the fact that wounded soldiers in various hospitals cannot personally write letters, or have money and clothing that cannot be remitted, although there are enthusiastic people who volunteer to go to the hospitals to help, the effectiveness is limited and there are many malpractices due to poor organization. The union has now jointly agreed with the Red Cross and the City Rescue Association that the union will be responsible for sending one to six people to each hospital to specifically write letters for wounded soldiers, remit money, send clothing, and handle other matters within the scope of postal services, from 2 PM to 5 PM every day, so as to provide great convenience to the wounded soldiers.
