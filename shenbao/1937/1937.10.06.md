### U.S. President Roosevelt's Important Speech Striving to Maintain World Justice

The U.S. Cannot Survive in a State of International Lawlessness. Innocent Women, Children, and Civilians are Massacred and Civilization is Swept Away. Willing to Take Active Actions with All Nations to Abandon This Tyranny.

⊙President Roosevelt delivered an important speech in Chicago today, warning the American people that "international anarchy, if allowed to grow unchecked," may subject the United States to attack. He advocated that peace-loving nations "work together" to maintain world justice, and subject those who violate world justice to "compulsory isolation." He said, "The plague of world lawlessness is spreading. When we encounter an epidemic of disease, society can only isolate the sick to protect society from infection." The President expressed doubt about the effectiveness of neutrality, stating only that the United States cannot escape once the flood breaks, but solemnly declared that he is personally determined to "pursue a policy of peace and take all practical measures to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war." The President continued, "The security of all nations is now threatened. Innocent civilians and the majority of women and children are being massacred by air bombs for no reason and without warning. In this so-called time of peace, the majority of civilian ships are being sunk by submarines for no reason and without notice. When civil war breaks out in countries that do not offend others, other countries incite and assist them. Countries that demand freedom for themselves do not allow other countries freedom." Innocent countries are sacrificed by warmongers from other countries. This era of terror and lawlessness has been going on for several years. Now we must take active action to maintain peace. America detests war. America hopes for peace even more. America will work even more actively to seek peace. We have always used national resources to engage in livelihood undertakings. We have no fear and no will to invade. Therefore, our country should not be used to expand armaments." At this point, the President turned to solemnly warn the United States, saying that isolation is not enough to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. The President made this speech at the completion ceremony of the large bridge outside Chicago on Lake Michigan, first stating, "I am now using my position as the head of state to choose this large island city to hold a grand ceremony and speak to the people about important national issues." He also said, "Airborne disasters are rampant, and signs of civilization gradually evolving toward law and justice will now be swept away by international lawlessness. If we want to produce a world that allows us to breathe freely, live in peace and without fear, then peace-loving nations should work together to maintain laws and international principles. Only in this way can peace be created. We must restore trust in promises and the value of treaties. We must recognize that national morality is just as important as private morality."

### The Focus of the War Shifts to the Wenzaobang, Our Army Defends the South Bank to Kill the Enemy

The Enemy Across the River Was Annihilated by Our Bombardment. The Enemy in Zhabei and Jiangwan Did Not Dare to Launch a Fierce Attack. The Enemy on Xiangyin Road Was Defeated by Our Pincer Attack.

Our newspaper's war correspondent reported back to the office at 2:00 AM this morning. Yesterday, he met with a certain high-ranking officer at a certain location. According to him: ㊀ Although the enemy first used aircraft and artillery to fiercely bombard the Taiping Bridge and Doujia Nong near Liuhang, and then densely fired with two regiments, they broke through our army's position the night before. At first, they tried to advance westward, but because the left, right, and front three sides were all blocked by our army's strict formation, they immediately stopped advancing. They then wasted shells to cover the rear and build defensive fortifications, deeply fearing our army's attack from both sides to cut off their retreat. ㊁ Our army's positions in the Dingjiazhai and Xiaopan areas near Luodian were fiercely attacked by the enemy yesterday. We calmly fought back and finally repelled the large number of attacking enemy troops. The original front line remained unchanged. A certain company suffered heavy casualties, with only two people uninjured. Each carried their wounded company commander and another soldier to the rear medical station. When a certain commander saw this, he immediately gave each a reward of one hundred yuan to encourage them. ㊂ Our army's positions west of Luodian were attacked by the enemy at the same time yesterday. Our army temporarily lay down under cover due to the enemy's excessive shelling to observe the situation. When the enemy reached the trenches, they jumped out and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy collapsed and fled, killing more than fifty enemy soldiers and capturing many military supplies, including one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, eleven rifles, and one cavalry saber.

Central News Agency's war correspondent reported at 9:00 PM on the 5th that the focus of the war has shifted to both banks of the Wenzaobang. Enemy aircraft have been active for days, dropping bombs on the Hero's Cemetery in Miaohang and the area south of the bank, and enemy artillery has also been constantly bombarding. Today, two enemy balloons also rose up in Yangxing and Yinxing to observe our army's movements and direct enemy artillery fire. However, we suffered no losses.

### Our Army's Fortifications Are Strong, Defending the South Bank of the Wenzaobang

Central News Agency's war correspondent reported at 1:55 PM on the 5th that the Wenzaobang has become a crucial key to the war. Our army is defending the south bank, having densely laid barbed wire and various defensive fortifications, which are exceptionally strong. The enemy is entrenched on the north bank, very close to us, and the sound of laughter can be heard. Since last night, the enemy has been constantly firing remotely with machine guns, and we have also returned fire. It has not stopped all night. This morning, the enemy released a balloon in the position to observe our side's position. At about 8:00, the sounds of singing and joking could be clearly heard in the enemy positions in the Zhouzhai and Huzhai areas. We immediately aimed and bombarded them with mortars, firing more than thirty shells, all of which hit the target. The singing stopped immediately, and then enemy troops were seen scattering and fleeing in a very embarrassed state. At about 2:00 PM, enemy planes attempted to bomb our positions in that area, but due to poor bombing skills, one bomb actually landed in the enemy's own ranks, which can be said to be a taste of their own medicine. According to the war correspondent's report at 9:00 PM, the enemy launched a fierce attack on Tangqiao, east of the Shanghai-Tai Road on the north bank, but failed. They are currently building fortifications in the northwest area. Baiyangzhai, to the west, is the enemy's artillery position. They have been firing artillery non-stop for days. We have measured the coordinates, and after we fiercely bombarded it with several artillery shells at 2:00 PM, it caught fire. Their artillery position has been completely destroyed. We also severely damaged the enemy at Jiangjiaqiao with mortar fire.

### Our Artillery Killed Many Enemy Officers

All Cars Were Destroyed; People Were Reduced to Ashes

Confirmation, our artillery fired artillery shells towards the enemy's position in the Hongkou area yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. One shell landed near the enemy's headquarters. At that time, many enemy officers were driving by in three cars, and were hit. All the cars were destroyed, and the people were turned to ashes. It has not yet been determined what kind of status the officers were.

### The Battle Situation in Zhabei and Jiangwan

Central News Agency's war correspondent reported at half past noon on the 5th that the fierce battles in Zhabei had not stopped, and our side had a significant advantage. We had crossed the railway line and were pressing east toward North Sichuan Road. The enemy was retreating step by step and had transferred 3,000 reinforcements from Jiangwan in an attempt to stubbornly defend. They recklessly bombed with airplanes and artillery. The situations of the two battlefields are as follows:

Clearing Enemy Traces on the Shuidian Road

The enemy forces in Tan Jiazhai and Qu Jiaqiao used Jiangwan Road as their line of communication. At 11:00 PM on the 4th, they launched a fierce attack on our Zhichi University position in two directions. A bloody battle unfolded on Shuidian Road. We swept with machine guns to prevent the enemy from approaching and fiercely fired artillery at their tanks, destroying two of them. By 2:30 AM, the enemy's offensive had been blunted. We immediately left the trenches and charged toward Tan Jiazhai, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The enemy retreated temporarily upon seeing our fierce momentum, but we pursued relentlessly, killing over two hundred enemies and seizing over seventy rifles. By 6:30 AM, the enemy had been cleared from Shuidian Road.

Our Army Counterattacks on Dongbaoxing Road

The enemy and our army were deadlocked on Dongbaoxing Road all night. The enemy made slight advances, but after we fiercely bombarded them with incendiary bombs, about twenty enemy soldiers were burned to death. At 2:00 AM, we counterattacked and drove the enemy to the mouth of the Henghang River, where both sides were deadlocked. On Guangdong Street, we also had the upper hand. By dawn, we had approached North Sichuan Road. The enemy was extremely panicked and dispatched many tanks to guard the intersections, preventing us from breaking in.

One of Our Planes Came to Shanghai to Help in the Battle

After dawn, the enemy, seeing that all their advances had failed, constantly bombed fiercely with airplanes and artillery. Many shells fell in the Baoxing Road area. At around 10:00 AM, the artillery fire was even denser, and the enemy's large bombers were also constantly active. At that time, one of our planes came to Shanghai to help in the battle, rushing down from high altitude and fiercely firing with machine guns. Our plane fought one against three, charging left and right with extraordinary bravery. Due to the disparity in numbers, it took off and left. The enemy's artillery fire did not stop until the report was filed.

Enemy Troops' Morale Greatly Affected

Central News Agency's Zhabei war correspondent reported at 1:00 AM on the 6th that in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas, the enemy troops had been severely battered by our army for several days, with over 800 killed or wounded. Their morale has been greatly affected. Although enemy planes bombed wildly on the 5th, dropping over a hundred bombs and firing over five hundred shells, our army's positions were not damaged, and the enemy did not dare to launch a large-scale attack. The battle situation was not as intense as in the previous two days. Tiyuhui Road and Shuidian Road remained peaceful until the report was filed. On the Baziqiao front, the enemy troops attempted to attack twice this morning, but after that, the enemy troops disappeared. On Dongbaoxing Road, a unit of enemy troops came to harass us at 5:00 PM, protected by tanks. After our army bravely fought back in a street battle for two hours, killing over twenty enemy soldiers, the remaining troops collapsed and fled in disarray. On Guangdong Street, the enemy troops fired artillery continuously from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, but the infantry never dared to approach. Our artillery also bombarded the enemy's position at 7:00 PM, inflicting heavy damage on them. At 11:30 PM, enemy warships fired dozens of shells at the North Station, but none of them hit the target. At the same time, enemy tanks were active on Guangdong Street, but no attack was seen.

### The Enemy in Liuhang Repeatedly Pushed Towards the Guangfu Town Area

Central News Agency's war correspondent reported at 9:00 PM on the 5th that the enemy in the Liuhang area has been attacking for days, launching several assaults and pushing close to the Guangfu Town area. However, after we fought bravely, the enemy finally collapsed and retreated. Both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle. We still hold Wangjiazhai, Zhangzhai, Yangjiagang, Zhu Sanfang, and several other key points, establishing a tight defense line. Our reinforcements have been arriving steadily and will counterattack at an opportune moment, launching a large-scale punitive expedition. It is expected that a fierce battle will still occur in that area in the future.

### The Enemy Troops Plan to Attack Miaohang

Yesterday Morning, They Approached Us and Engaged in a Skirmish. In the Afternoon, They Repeatedly Bombed West of Miaohang With Artillery.

Central News Agency's war correspondent reported at 1:55 PM on the 5th that the enemy's attack on Miaohang has become increasingly apparent. Our army's eastern front is defended by five key points from north to south: Sunzhai, Hongjiabang, Zhongjiatou, Guo Caizhai, and Yinjiazhai, forming a semi-circle. Sunzhai is on the south bank of the Wenzaobang, about three and a half kilometers from Miaohang, and is facing the enemy across the river. Tianlusi, about two kilometers southeast of Guo Caizhai, is where enemy troops are concentrated. The enemy has been sending reinforcements from the city center area for days, gradually dispersing northward. Today, they gradually advanced westward and approached our outposts, engaging in a skirmish. In the afternoon, the enemy fiercely bombarded the area west of Miaohang with artillery, but we suffered no damage. It is expected that the enemy will launch a large-scale attack in the next few days, but our position is solid and the enemy will never succeed.

### We Defeated the Enemy Troops on Xiangyin Road

Central News Agency's war correspondent reported at 9:00 PM on the 5th that at 2:00 PM, about 200 enemy troops from Nan Zhaojiagang, behind the Tongde Medical College on Jiangwan Xiangyin Road, suddenly attacked and fiercely attacked our army's position in Zhaojiaxiang. We engaged them slightly and dispatched a unit to advance south from Fudan University to flank the enemy's right side. The enemy suffered heavy losses from the pincer attack and collapsed and retreated. We have strictly ordered preparations for a night raid to clear the enemy troops in that area. A large enemy unit is building fortifications in Zhangjiahang Quanjiaxiang, south of Xiangyin Road, and a unit is reinforcing Nan Zhaojiagang.

### Enemy Troops Frequently Bombard Pudong

Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, enemy warships in the Huangpu River again frequently fired artillery shells at Pudong. At the same time, three enemy planes flew over for reconnaissance. Our army was not afraid of this tactic and remained calm and ignored them. The enemy fired a total of over thirty shots, and seeing no effect, they stopped. At 6:00 PM, the Izumo flagship directed artillery fire to bombard Pudong. At the same time, enemy giant bombers flew to the vicinity of Pudong Avenue and dropped four bombs, all of which landed in the fields. The explosions were huge, but there was no damage. Our army took advantage of the enemy planes flying further away and opened fire with several heavy artillery shells, which landed within the Hongkou positions, posing a major threat. The artillery battle between the two sides lasted for dozens of minutes and then stopped. At 7:00 PM in the evening, when our air force came to Shanghai for a night raid, the enemy, in addition to using anti-aircraft machine guns to resist, also fired several artillery shells from time to time to demonstrate, in order to prevent our Pudong army from launching a pincer attack. From this, it can also be seen that the enemy is afraid of the power of our land and air forces.

### The Enemy's Air Force Suffered Heavy Losses

Since the beginning of the Shanghai battle, our air force has achieved initial success, coupled with the tension of air defense forces, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The number of enemy planes destroyed is over a hundred, and over four hundred soldiers have been killed in action. The losses on the naval side are even heavier. The bodies of 21 people, including Major Yoshiwa Yu, who fell into the sea in Guangdong, have not been found yet. The remains of 40 people, including Lieutenant Commander Imamura Masaji, have been transported back in batches. A joint burial was held at Yokosuka Port on the 28th of last month. There are also the confirmed dead whose records have not been seen in our reports, including Captain Sato Kazue (Ba County), Yamauchi Tatsuo, and Umebayashi Kojiro (Nanjing), Lieutenant Shibuya (Cangzhou), Second Lieutenant Ogata Kyoko and Ueno (Baoding), Kawaguchi (Nanjing), Warrant Officer Onuno (Baoding), First Class Private Ikimyo Akio, Banjo Yoshinori, Kobayashi, Takakura (Cangzhou), Nakagoe (Hangzhou), Nakayama Sakae (Shanghai), Yamaguchi (Jiangyin), Second Class Private Nagano Tadazo (Shanghai), and 16 others.

### The Enemy Has Dispatched Reinforcements Five Times

The enemy's fourth reinforcement army, totaling 40,000 people, had all arrived in Shanghai before the 1st of this month. However, in order to launch a large-scale attack to achieve their goal of a quick victory, the enemy decided to dispatch a fifth reinforcement army division to Shanghai. The division was formed by mixing the elite troops drawn from the enemy's various divisions. Part of it consisted of cavalry and artillery, totaling over 5,000 people, who had been sailing to Shanghai in succession two days ago. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, another batch of infantry, about 3,000 people, were transported to Shanghai by the enemy's merchant ship-converted No. 92 transport ship Alaska Maru and No. 30 transport ship Hankou Maru, which docked at the Osaka Wharf and the Huishan Wharf. They landed immediately.

### The Enemy Has Shipped a Large Number of Military Supplies Again

Yesterday afternoon, three more enemy merchant ship-converted ships, the No. 17 transport ship Kitakata Maru, the No. 97 transport ship Nishiyama Maru, and the No. 20 transport ship Kureko Kanmaru, arrived, docking at the Huangpu, Osaka, and Huishan wharfs respectively. There were also over 50 enemy small green military vehicles, over 20 armored vehicles, many tanks, and countless other military supplies unloaded ashore. The transport ship Cbimiya, which had shipped military supplies to Shanghai yesterday morning, finished unloading and sailed out before 2:00 PM in the afternoon. The transport ships Shinyu Maru, Ikuta Maru, Haguro Maru, Meigen Maru, Xingan Maru, Shunchun Maru, Toyokawa Maru, etc., which had sailed to Shanghai continuously in recent days, except for the first two, which were still berthed at Buoy No. 16 and the China Merchants Bureau's central pier, the rest of the ships had all sailed out of the Songkou and returned to Japan on the previous two nights.

### Our Company Commander Jiang Died Bravely

The Enemy Expressed Respect and Gave Him a Ceremonial Burial

The North China Daily News reported that the Japanese military authorities yesterday praised the brave death of a young Chinese military officer. When the Chinese army at Yangjia Village on the Luodian front was forced to retreat by the Japanese army, the officer refused to abandon his position. He held a hand grenade and single-handedly resisted the attacking Japanese army. The hand grenade had not been thrown when he was shot and killed. A Japanese officer told a reporter from a local foreign newspaper yesterday that the Japanese army, out of respect for the officer's bravery, had given him a ceremonial burial.

### Yesterday, Enemy Planes Were Rampant and肆虐

Two Factories on Qichang Road Were Burned Down, Suffering Heavy Losses. Bombing of Qibao Town Killed Over 20 Farmers. -An Enemy Plane Crashed in Flames Northwest of Datong-

West Suzhou Creek

Several enemy planes flew to Qichang Road, across the West Suzhou Creek, at 4:15 PM yesterday and dropped bombs. The China Flour Mill and a certain iron factory were hit by bombs and caught fire. Fire engines from various fire departments rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which took several hours to extinguish. It is reported that the two factories were almost completely destroyed and the losses were estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.

West Shanghai Area

At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, two enemy planes circled and scouted over the area north of Jessfield Road. Our air force, upon hearing the news, dispatched three fighter planes to intercept them. Both sides fired machine guns at each other, as dense as a string of pearls. The enemy planes were unable to withstand the attack and fled east. Our air force chased closely behind and returned near Baoshan Road. At 4:05 PM, three enemy heavy bombers and one reconnaissance plane circled over the area north of Xiaoshadu Creek and Guangfu Road in West Shanghai for about half an hour. A total of over thirty large bombs were dropped on the Xiaoshadu Creek area, destroying dozens of civilian houses. Several places caught fire and had not been extinguished by night.

At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, four enemy planes in Qibao Town, West Shanghai, divided into two teams, first circled and scouted, and then dropped four bombs, two of which landed at the north and south ends of Tangqiao and two of which landed at Hengli. Fortunately, they did not explode, but they did destroy dozens of rafters of houses and kill or injure over twenty innocent villagers.

Pudong and Nanshi

At around 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, one enemy plane again wantonly bombed the vicinity of Lujiazui and Qichang Wharf in Pudong, dropping no less than one or twenty bombs and simultaneously firing machine guns, until around 5:30 PM at dusk, when it flew towards Yangshupu in East Shanghai.

At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, two teams of enemy heavy bombers, totaling six planes, flew to Nanshi for reconnaissance, and then circled constantly over Longhua and Caohangjing in South Shanghai, flying very low, seemingly with some intention. Before long, the six enemy planes flew back from the southwest and again circled constantly over Longhua, for about half an hour before flying towards Zhabei.

Zhabei Area

In the Zhabei area, starting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, another six enemy planes, divided into teams of three, dropped bombs in the area, and civilian houses near Maigen Road station caught fire and had not been extinguished by evening. In Pudong, starting at 5:20 PM last night, multiple enemy planes also went to drop bombs, totaling eight or nine bombs before and after. Except for the damage to civilian houses, our military suffered no losses.

Between 10:00 AM and noon yesterday, enemy planes bombed near Qiujiang Road and the railway line Baoshan Road, Baotong Road intersection, Gonghexin Road, Zhongxing Road intersection, and about two and a half miles southwest of Liuhang. Between noon and 2:00 PM, Japanese planes again bombed near Baoshan Road, Baoxing Road intersection, Baochang Road Qiujiang Road intersection, Dongxing Road Qiujiang Road intersection, Qiujiang Road North Henan Road intersection, and about two miles southwest of Liuhang. According to confirmed reports, one Japanese plane caught fire and crashed about two miles northwest of Datong.

Central News Agency reported that at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy planes wreaked havoc in Datong. One plane was hit by us, caught fire, and crashed. The pilot was killed on the spot.

### Our Air Force Raided the Enemy Airfield Last Night, Hitting Eight Bombs

A Fire Broke Out and Spread, and the Enemy Suffered Extremely Heavy Losses. Our Planes Attacked Again This Morning.

From 6:15 PM to 6:45 PM last night, within this half hour, a team from our air force flew to the enemy warships in the Huangpu River and the enemy's military positions above Yangshupu in East Shanghai, continuously making three round trip night raids. The enemy's anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns were as dense as a string of pearls, and red signals indicated the direction of fire while the guns were fired. The glare of the searchlights was like a rainbow. At the same time, our air force also swept down with fierce machine guns and dropped bombs. Among them, two bombs exploded with loud sounds, shaking the whole city. The enemy's losses were enormous.

Central News Agency reported that according to reliable sources, our air force attacked Shanghai at 6:15 PM last night, dropping eight bombs on the enemy's airfield in Yangshupu, causing a fire to break out and spread immediately. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. When our plane flew over the area, the enemy did not discover it until after three bombs had been dropped in succession. They urgently countered with anti-aircraft artillery, but it was too late. One of our planes was slightly injured during the fierce battle. The pilot calmly flew out of the line of fire and landed safely at ××.

Central News Agency reported that our air force launched another night raid on the enemy warships in the Huangpu River at 12:05 this morning. The enemy responded quickly with anti-aircraft artillery. Our plane safely crossed over and dropped several bombs on the enemy positions in the Hongkou Yangshupu area, inflicting heavy damage on them, and then flew back safely.

Current Commentary

### The Northern War Situation

— Yi

The war situation in the North has greatly improved in recent days. Our army in northern Shanxi has recovered Dai County and Fanshi, and the enemy's rear route has been cut off. Our army on the Pinghan Railway has advanced north beyond Baoding. Our side also has the upper hand on the Jinpu Railway. Now, looking at the map, although there are still many rivers and mountains in the North under enemy control, it can be asserted that as the war develops, there will be no room for the enemy to gain a foothold on any of our territory.

Everyone should understand that the enemy has been carrying out despicable and shameless political conspiracies and engaging in insidious and malicious military deployments in the provinces of North China for many years. They were fully confident that they could seize that part of our territory without firing a single shot. In the enemy's mind, the Lugouqiao Incident was originally the same as the Mukden Incident, but the heroic resistance of the 29th Army and the sincere unity of our national soldiers, as well as the unfolding of the overall war of resistance, were all far beyond the enemy's expectations.

Based on this understanding, we can know that no matter how the war situation in the North changes, there is no reason to be pessimistic. Because the enemy's political conspiracies and military deployments over the years have clearly not achieved much success after the war began. And in the past two or three months, the enemy's unexpected and continuous loss of strength in North China is precisely the enemy's constant failure.

From the recent war reports of our army fighting bravely in the North, we can be even more confident that the development prospects of the war in the North are very bright.

### Our Army Scores Successive Victories, Recapturing Key Locations in Northern Shanxi

### Yan Discusses the Course of Operations Over the Past Month

[Taiyuan] Yan Xishan gave a public speech on the evening of the 4th, discussing the course of operations in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi over the past month, providing a very detailed analysis. Yan stated that the operations in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi can be divided into three stages: (1) the Battle of Ninghaar; (2) the Battle of Northern Shanxi and Eastern Suiyuan; (3) the Battle of Gouzhu Mountain and Heng Mountain. Although the circumstances of these three stages of battle differed, they had one thing in common: the enemy was on the offensive, and we were on the defensive, resulting in the enemy always having the advantage. I will elaborate as follows:

(1) Battle of Chahar: We were caught off guard. At that time, Tang's army (Enbo) of five divisions, the Shanxi-Suiyuan army of nine divisions, and three cavalry divisions were originally prepared to defend the positions in Northern Yan, Eastern Suiyuan, and Northern Suiyuan. When the enemy attacked Nankou, the Military Commission ordered Tang's army to move to Nankou to defend it. At that time, Tang's army only had three divisions; the remaining two divisions were in Northern Shaanxi and Xinzhou. Initially, General Gao moved his troops into Chahar, and Chairman Liu (Ruming) stated that if no reinforcements were added, Chahar could be defended. If reinforcements were added, Chahar would surely be in danger. Later, through the mediation of Lu Ruibo (Zhonglin), Tang's army began to fight at Nankou. Our army benefited from the bravery of the two divisions of the 13th Army and the steep terrain with many trees, making it easy to hide, preventing the enemy's planes and artillery from exerting their firepower. The greatest loss was the battle for the Tenth Ridge Heights, where Chen Changjie's division of the Shanxi-Suiyuan army suffered significant losses. The enemy also suffered heavy losses. When frontal assaults failed, they circled around our right flank. At that time, there was an excellent opportunity to order the troops of Chuan and Shu to use their strong forces to attack the enemy at Shaogong from both sides, which could have eliminated the enemy and more. However, Fu's troops suffered half their casualties, and the enemy was in danger. Unable to do otherwise, a part of the force was diverted to aid Zhang, but to no avail and suffered significant losses. Wei's troops were also blocked midway. At this time, the enemy launched a fierce attack on Juyongguan, resulting in the loss of key locations, which was most regrettable.

(2) After the Battle of Chahar, our nine divisions lost more than half their strength, making it difficult to deploy a defense line of about two thousand li in Northern Shanxi and Eastern and Northern Suiyuan. Therefore, it was decided to adopt a defensive strategy, moving troops to firmly defend Tianzhen, intending to hold out against the enemy for a month, while strengthening the defenses of Datong. (The defenses of Northern Yan and Eastern Suiyuan were the worst at Yanggao and Tianzhen. Originally, Li Fuying was responsible for the construction, so Li was removed from his post but allowed to stay and supervise the work under punishment.) Mangshan was originally a key location in Tianzhen and was ordered to be defended to the death. However, due to the negligence of Li Shengrun, the regimental commander of Li's unit, a surprise attack by the enemy occurred. Before the loss of the position, no reports of battle were received. Upon receiving the telegram of the loss, the regiment, except for a small number of soldiers who broke through, made heroic sacrifices. The loss of Tianzhen, although making it impossible to consolidate the defenses of Datong, did not hinder the plan to defend Datong. At that time, it was decided to use more than 30 regiments to engage in a fierce decisive battle. If victorious, all would be well; if defeated, the Central Government would be asked to send troops to defend Yanmen Pass. After this telegram was sent, Chairman Liu was ordered to retreat towards the Jinpu Railway. Chairman Liu telegraphed, stating clearly that he would wait for the relieving troops to arrive before starting the retreat. A reply was immediately sent, and the relieving troops were telegraphed to quickly proceed to take over. Unexpectedly, before the Eighth Route Army arrived, Liu's troops suddenly retreated, and the enemy attacked our Guangling and Lingqiu. Liu, the division commander of our 73rd Division, was wounded. Under these circumstances, if the battle could not be resolved in the short term, the enemy would be likely to cut off the rear route to Yanmen Pass. Therefore, it was decided to abandon Datong and burn the boats, engaging the enemy in a decisive battle in the Gouzhu Mountains.

(3) After the initial retreat of our army from Datong, they regrouped slightly and decided to break away from the passive state and adopt an offensive posture towards Pingxingguan. Initially, they encircled and eliminated part of the enemy, but the enemy increased the strength of the Itagaki Division. We also added all our reserves. Just as our army's intention to annihilate the enemy was at its peak, the enemy suddenly attacked Ru Yue Pass. Initially, our forces here were no less than the enemy's. General Yang Chengyuan was immediately ordered to gather ten regiments to engage in defensive warfare against the enemy, not engaging in a one-line defense, but fighting the enemy to the death. The position was gained and lost three or four times. The enemy and ourselves suffered extremely heavy losses. However, the enemy used a large number of vehicles to transport the bulk of their forces from the Ping-Sui Railway. After fierce fighting, Ru Yue Pass was lost. We quickly defended Tie Jiao Ridge. The enemy repeatedly attacked and increased their forces, with superior strength. General Yang led his troops in a bloody battle with the enemy for two days and nights, and three reserve regiments were added to the battle. Finally, due to the disparity in numbers, the enemy broke through. Our Brigade Commander Liang Jiantang died in battle, and of his three regiments, only two or three hundred men remained. The intensity of the sacrifice can be imagined. With the fall of Tie Jiao Ridge, the rear route to Yanmen Pass was in extreme danger. It was planned to draw two brigades from Pingxingguan and two brigades from Yanmen Pass, and because the enemy in front of Liu Maoen's army was not very numerous, it was planned to add that army to attack the enemy from both sides. The orders had been issued, but at 9 p.m. that night, the high ground on the left flank of Tie Jiao Ridge was retaken by the enemy, and Pingxingguan was also in danger. Gao Guizi's army also found it extremely difficult to maintain its position as Liu's army withdrew, exposing the left flank of Gao's army. Furthermore, many enemies broke into Fanshi and Daixian, and the fighting was very intense, with heavy losses. Under duress, it was decided to deploy an arc-shaped defense line in Wutai, Guoxian, and Ningwu counties to engage the enemy in a decisive battle. (5th, Central News Agency)

Commentary

### The Problem of Wartime Reading Materials

— Zheng Zhenduo

Are the reading materials needed during wartime different from those during peacetime? What kind of reading materials are most urgently needed during wartime?

During the period of national resistance against Japan, all manpower and financial resources should be used to benefit the future of the war effort as the highest goal. Resistance is above all else! Everyone should contribute their all—life and everything—to this life-or-death national resistance. Writers and publishers, of course, cannot consider themselves exceptions.

Therefore, writers and publishers must provide a large number of reading materials that are most suitable for wartime needs. All reading materials that are not directly or indirectly related should be temporarily suspended to save manpower and financial resources.

When the resistance war just began, everything in Shanghai's publishing industry came to a standstill. But soon, many small publications, many pamphlets related to the resistance, became active on the streets. In order to meet the urgent needs of the war, most of the periodicals and pamphlets were very short and priced very low (from one or two cents to a dime). Periodicals were especially advantageous for shortening publication times. Three-day publications and weekly publications were the most common, and the longest publication period was "ten-day publications." Many former monthly and bi-monthly publications were either completely changed to wartime special publications or completely suspended.

Recently, periodicals have gradually returned to their original state. Oriental Education and other magazines have resumed publication, and the National News Weekly and others have ended their wartime special publications and returned to their original publication periods. Literature, World Knowledge, and others will soon be republished as well. We can say that the wartime publishing industry has surpassed the state of bewilderment and hesitation and has entered a new normal state. As a result, the problem of wartime reading materials has become increasingly serious.

During wartime, what kind of reading materials should writers and publishers provide that are beneficial to the future of the resistance war?

Reviewing the reading materials of these five weeks of war, we can find that there are at least three points that are worth discussing and urgently need to be changed.

First, there are too many publications of the same nature: there are at least six or seven kinds of periodicals like "Resistance Pictorial"; there are no less than seven or eight kinds of small three-day publications priced at two cents; and many pamphlets are also of the same nature. Why can't we divide the work and cooperate? Why can't we avoid the old Shanghai habit of "swarming" to join the fun, even during wartime?

Second, the articles are often too short to accommodate relatively hardcore, long articles: most are discussions, and most are very simple common-sense texts. Even short stories cannot be published. There are only street dramas, reportage literature, essays, and one- or two-thousand-word papers.

Third, many reading materials urgently needed during wartime, such as books and newspapers suitable for soldiers to read, have not been published at all.

Writers and publishers should deeply reflect!

During wartime, the education of civilians and soldiers in the rear has become increasingly important; especially since we have never put in the effort in these areas during peacetime, we must now step up our work. Why is the combat effectiveness of the general troops in the north relatively weak? Why is the importance of this national resistance not sufficiently understood by the people in certain places? Isn't it all because of the lack of training and education?

Wartime reading materials can be divided into three main categories: (1) general reading materials; (2) special reading materials; and (3) professional reading materials.

General reading materials include daily newspapers, periodicals, popular reading materials, literary publications, etc. The daily newspapers and periodicals that are currently available are sufficient to meet wartime needs, and most of them can fulfill their responsibility to serve during wartime. However, due to the inconvenient transportation in the interior, they have not been able to be transported in large quantities, which inevitably loses their due effectiveness. Not many popular reading materials are published in Shanghai. The ten or so popular publications published by Shen Bao are quite popular. The National Salvation Daily has also published four types. It is hoped that writers in general will be able to make as much effort as possible in this part of the work. However, they must be digestible for the general public, not too new, nor too "conventional" to the point that they are no different from the old reading materials from before. As for literary works, there are really too few being published. Great literary works can exert a great influence on the war of resistance. I am afraid there are not few that are brewing and writing.

Special reading materials are reading materials that meet the special needs of various groups, such as soldiers' reading materials, farmers' reading materials, workers' reading materials, etc. On the one hand, they instill the correct awareness of the War of Resistance, and on the other hand, based on their own environment, they guide their lifestyles and raise their level of knowledge. At this time, we can use the quickest methods to remedy the adult education that has been neglected and has not been carried out in the past. This is extremely relevant to the future of the war of resistance. The entire nation's resistance depends on the awakening of the people and the correctness of their views. People who organize and train the masses and soldiers in the rear must feel the need for this type of reading material. We must immediately adapt to this urgent need and quickly provide them with these special reading materials. The Soviet Union has published many soldiers' reading materials, workers' reading materials, etc. Those materials and compilation methods can be used as our reference.

As for specialized reading materials, they are reading materials that meet the needs of specialists, students above specialized schools, and those engaged in political work and mass training, etc. They are relatively advanced and relatively hardcore reading materials. We are most lacking in this type of publication. Special books discussing many specialized issues in wartime must be published in large quantities. Booklets alone cannot meet the needs of specialized workers at all.

In short, during wartime, writers and publishers should work harder and harder to exert their cultural work. These cultural works must give first priority to adapting to wartime needs.

Resistance is above all else!

### League of Nations Drafting Committee Reaches Final Compromise

Still Stipulates Convening a Pacific Conference. Several Points Reserved for Resolution by the Advisory Committee.

[Geneva] The League of Nations Drafting Committee has agreed tonight to the application submitted by China to the League of Nations, but several key points have been reserved for a vote by the Thirteenth Committee. One is regarding the Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition, and whether to include the United States in the report has also been discussed for a long time. The drafted report explains the origin of the Sino-Japanese conflict and expresses hope for what should be done now and in the future. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters)

[Geneva] The drafting committee of the Thirteenth Committee's subgroup of the League of Nations General Assembly's Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee completed a draft resolution on the Sino-Japanese issue this morning, taking two and a half hours to reach a final compromise. The draft resolution will be submitted to the Thirteenth Committee this afternoon to restate the issue and resolve the final difficulties, and then submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly. The Chinese representative's attitude was slightly softened during the drafting meeting this morning, and he accepted the convening of a conference of signatories to the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. However, it has not yet been decided in what way the United States should be invited to participate. The Chinese representative also accepted that the resolution would not explicitly condemn Japan's acts of aggression, nor would it mention that Articles 10 and 11 of the League of Nations Covenant should be implemented. However, the Chinese representative requested that the resolution should state that the League of Nations would not in any way abandon the application submitted by China. Finally, regarding the "principle of non-recognition of territories acquired by violent means" requested by the Chinese delegation, the drafting committee decided not to include it in the draft resolution. In addition, the draft resolution expresses the desire that the conflict between China and Japan can be resolved in accordance with the various principles of international law. (Central News Agency, 5th, Havas)

[Geneva] British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Craibon, attended the League of Nations Drafting Committee today and suggested that the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty and other related countries such as Russia and Germany convene a meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue. As for the procedures, the League of Nations General Assembly would request member states of the League of Nations that are also signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to invite other related countries to hold a meeting.

### League of Nations Committee's All-Night Meeting

My Representative Insists on Original Position; Japan's Various Actions Have Been Confirmed

[Geneva] The 13-nation sub-committee of the League of Nations Advisory Committee held meetings yesterday morning and afternoon, lasting a considerable time, until late at night. It is reported that the report on the Sino-Japanese conflict has been drafted. The sub-committee completed its discussion of the historical section of the Sino-Japanese conflict yesterday morning. Last night, considerable progress was made on the points of conclusion. It is reported that Japan's war actions on land, sea, and air, its invasion of Chinese territory, its blockade of Chinese shipping, its aerial bombardment of undefended cities and towns, and Japan's disregard for the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Pact, will all be acknowledged and recorded. The issue of a resolution seems to have been abandoned, and the issue of recommendations has not yet been fully discussed. It is believed that all the Advisory Committee can do is report. China is naturally dissatisfied with this perfunctory approach. It is expected that the chief Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, will exert pressure to prevent the matter from being concluded in this manner. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters dispatch)

[Geneva] The 13-nation sub-committee of the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Question of the League of Nations General Assembly held two meetings yesterday to draft a report, but failed to reach a complete compromise. Therefore, it appointed representatives from the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, China, and the Commonwealth of Australia to form a working group to draft a resolution this morning and submit it to the sub-committee for review at 11:30 a.m. The sub-committee has held four consecutive meetings since the day before yesterday, spending more than 30 hours. As it has failed to reach a complete compromise, and the attitude of the Chinese delegation has become increasingly firm, the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly, which is scheduled to take place in Geneva, is in danger of being delayed due to the stagnation of its other work. Earlier, before the 13-nation sub-committee met last night, a delegation of Chinese expatriates called on the chief Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, and submitted a petition to him, requesting him to strive with the sub-committee to clearly condemn Japan's aggression. Dr. Koo then attended the committee and delivered a passionate speech, insisting on his original position. The British representative then spoke, attempting to ease the tense atmosphere caused by the speech, and suggested that the resolution include the following facts: ① Japanese land, sea, and air forces have invaded Chinese territory; ② The Japanese navy has restricted the freedom of navigation of the Chinese coast; ③ The bombing of Chinese cities without defensive works by Japanese aircraft should be condemned; ④ Japan has violated existing treaties, namely the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris, after signing and joining them; ⑤ The League of Nations should invite the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, or even invite Russia and Germany, to hold a Pacific conference to seek a solution to the dispute between China and Japan. At this point, the chief Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, did not express opposition, but said that China could not accept the League of Nations withdrawing from the matter. He said, "We not only support the claims we have put forward, but also rely on other countries that show considerable faith in the League of Nations." Although the League of Nations may not need to implement the various sanction measures contained in Article 16 of the Covenant, Articles 10 and 11 of the Covenant must be implemented. In addition, the act of aggression must be recognized, and the aggressor must be identified. In short, the League of Nations must at least provide our country with passive assistance, and then we can participate in the Pacific Conference and promote its success." The British representative said that since they were proceeding with peaceful work through conferences, how could they adopt the procedures stipulated in the Covenant of the League of Nations and contradict themselves? Commentators say that Britain's ultimate goal is to seek a way to mediate the dispute between China and Japan, and therefore it is unwilling to point out the aggressor, which would hinder the mediation work. Although the theoretical differences between the Chinese and British representatives are so different that it seems difficult to reconcile them, fortunately, there is still a possibility of reaching a compromise in practice.

### London Newspapers Discuss the Gains and Losses of Sanctions Against Japan

Japan Has Long Intended to Invade; All Countries Must Prepare for War

[London] British Conservative newspapers do not support boycotting Japanese goods. The Times said in an editorial today that any government that undertakes sanctions against Japan must be prepared to explain this plan; in other words, adopting hostile actions means preparing for war. Furthermore, in order for sanctions to be effective, there must be complete cooperation between the governments of the countries implementing the sanctions. In addition, one point to note is that even if sanctions are successfully implemented, they may not be able to humanize or stop Japan's war against China at this time, but instead make Japan desperate and intensify its actions, because Japan will use any means to end the war quickly before it has exhausted the large amount of military supplies it has stored for many years. Before carrying out its war of aggression, Japan must have considered the possibility of sanctions by the major powers and made every effort to prepare for them. It may not change its policy abruptly due to the threat of external economic pressure. What is urgently needed now is to respond to the appeal of the China Association, the British Church Assembly, and the British Red Cross at the beginning of this month to provide relief to Chinese refugees. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] Regarding the real possibility of a boycott of Japan, the Manchester Guardian said today that there is no doubt that the public supports this demand of the Labour Party, but it is not enough to announce this action; it is necessary to understand the purpose of this action and how to achieve its goal. The public's spontaneous rejection of Japanese goods or the British government's rejection is not enough to seriously affect Japan. Therefore, in order for effective pressure to be thorough and deep, it must be implemented simultaneously by several countries, and the United States must be one of them. Therefore, the first step today must be to ask the United States to what extent it is willing to join this effort. Unfortunately, it is very difficult for us to hope to obtain a satisfactory answer. Furthermore, if sanctions are strictly enforced and made effective, then we must risk the danger of war with Japan, and risking war with Japan means risking a greater European war. Otherwise, even if sanctions are announced, they will have little effect other than moral protest. Furthermore, the Manchester Guardian also attached great importance to the fact that the Polish representative on the Far Eastern Problems Sub-Committee tried hard to exonerate Japan and blame China's provocation for the war. The newspaper said that this adds another piece of evidence to the long-standing view in Eastern Europe that there is a deep understanding between Japan and Poland. The Japanese Embassy in Warsaw and the Ukrainians in Poland do indeed have a close relationship, because the Ukrainians have obviously forgotten their long-standing grievances against the Polish government and are willing to do everything possible to stir up disputes in the Ukrainian region of Soviet Russia. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] The "National Peace Building Action Committee" led by former Prime Minister Lloyd George issued a declaration stating that the committee "expresses its indignation, in unison with the world, at Japan's acts of aggression and its barbaric means of massacring defenseless Chinese civilians." (4th, TASS dispatch)

[London] The mass meeting initiated by the Liberal Party's News Chronicle to oppose Japan's atrocities against China is scheduled to be held tomorrow at Albert Hall, chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Lord Lytton, chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Inquiry Commission in 1932, Morrison, chairman of the London City Council and member of the Labour Party's executive committee, will all attend and deliver speeches, and films will be shown to expose the inhumane nature of Japan's aggression. Political figures believe that tomorrow's meeting can enable the British left wing and church figures to expand the movement to boycott Japanese goods, and say that the cabinet does not support this movement, but senior members of the Conservative Party in opposition will express their opposition, rather than cabinet members doing so directly. Conservative Party figures have also criticized the church authorities for participating in this political gathering, believing that although this move is based on humanitarianism, it is surprising that church figures would rather participate in public gatherings to engage in international disputes than condemn Japan in sermons in churches.

### Anonymous British Person Helps Us with Medicine

[London] Today, an anonymous person donated one ton of disinfectant for the British Presbyterian Church to use to help the wounded in the Chinese war zone, and promised to donate 1,200 dozens of bandages and some wine. This person is related to a certain medical supply company. It is reported that the Presbyterian Church is raising medical supplies, so they generously donated. According to Presbyterian pastors, these relief supplies are specifically for the needs of wounded Chinese, and will not only be sent to Presbyterian churches, but will also be distributed to other hospitals. The problem now is how to transport them. It will take three weeks or a month to produce one ton of disinfectant. It is expected that as soon as some is produced, it will be shipped out at any time.

[Tokyo] At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, a strange Japanese person was seen wandering near our embassy. He was discovered by Japanese police and found to have a short knife on his person and was arrested. (5th, Central News Agency dispatch)

### American Labor Sector Supports Anti-Japanese Movement

Demands the Entire Country Boycott Japanese Goods

[Denver, USA] At a meeting held by the American Federation of Labor today, a suggestion was made requesting the American labor sector to boycott Japanese goods nationwide. Chairman Green said, "I believe that American public opinion should unite to oppose this kind of war action. If opposition is ineffective, I personally advocate that freedom-loving people in all countries of the world should implement a boycott movement against militaristic countries." Although Mr. Green did not specify which country when he spoke, it was obvious that he was referring to Japan. Dr. Gu Ziren of the World Christian Student Federation also appealed to the Federation of Labor, saying, "If international sanctions can be implemented, this kind of aggression can be stopped and peace can be maintained."

[Berlin] The director of the overseas sales department of the German Dyestuff Trust, Mr. Shi Yizi, will soon depart for the Far East to manage the company's business in China and Japan. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters dispatch)

### Changes in Soviet Officials

[Moscow] The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union appointed Melekarov as the chairman of the Soviet People's Committee for Foreign Trade, and the Council of People's Commissars appointed Kabarov as the deputy director of the Soviet National Bank. (4th, TASS dispatch)

### Japan's Controlled Trade in Various Industries Greatly Affected

Small-Denomination Bonds to Be Issued Next Month; Celebrities Organize Current Situation Research Association

[Tokyo] The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry resolved three measures for controlling foreign trade on the 4th, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will announce and implement them on the 10th. Category 1 includes three items: cotton, wool, and wood. Category 2 includes more than 300 items. This measure has a great impact on Japan's international trade and domestic economy. According to general observations, import restrictions can save 80 million yuan for cotton, 75 million yuan for wool, and 20 million yuan for wood. Import bans can save approximately 223 million yuan, for a total of approximately 400 million yuan. Judging from Japan's total import amount of 2.92 billion yuan last year, this accounts for 13%. As a result of restrictions and bans, the prices of domestic substitutes will inevitably rise. Industries that import these goods or manufacturers that use them as raw materials will be hit. However, manufacturers who have been oppressed by imported goods will have no competition in the future and can reap great profits. Tariffs will also be affected to a considerable extent. (5th, Central News Agency dispatch)

[Tokyo] In order to digest the "Incident Bonds," Japan plans to issue small-denomination bonds worth 100 to 200 million yuan in mid-next month, divided into four types: 25 yuan, 50 yuan, 100 yuan, and 500 yuan, with a term of 17 years, issued every three months, at a price of 98, and plans to promote them as much as possible. The remaining amount will still be underwritten by the Bank of Japan. All employees of the companies belonging to the four major financial groups, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda, will purchase bonds with a minimum of 5% and a maximum of 15% of their salaries starting this month, but senior executives will deduct 20% to 30% of their salaries to purchase bonds.

### City Party Headquarters Establishes Methods to Celebrate National Day

Total Mobilization of the City to Subscribe to National Bonds; Meetings to Commemorate in Each Locality

As the National Day is approaching, the City Party Headquarters of this city believes that the methods for commemorating the National Day should meet the needs of this extraordinary period of all-out resistance, so as to enhance the strength of resistance. The headquarters has formulated the following methods for commemorating the National Day, and published them in newspapers to inform all agencies, groups, factories, shops, and households in the city to celebrate by raising flags. The heads of each agency, group, school, and factory should lead their subordinates to hold National Day commemorative meetings in their respective locations at 10 a.m. on that day. The opening ceremony should be simple and solemn. In addition to reporting or speaking, the chairman should supervise the subscription of national salvation bonds, the donation of comfort money, or relief supplies by their subordinates. The amount may be large or small, but the goal is for each person to subscribe to at least one national salvation bond or donate one item of comfort relief supplies, so as to achieve the goal of total mobilization of the city.

### Unanimously Implementing Economic Severance with Japan

Various Industries in This City Closely Monitor Enemy Goods Being Mixed In; People Should Thoroughly Refuse to Buy and Sell Enemy Goods

The violent Japanese continue to invade our territory, bomb our civilians, and commit arson, murder, and robbery, which is inhumane. There has long been no diplomatic relations to speak of. Since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration to sever economic relations with Japan, more than 100 trade associations in this city have unanimously responded and decided to strictly implement it. The Anti-Enemy Support Association has also set National Day as the day to implement the economic severance movement with the enemy, so as to actively promote it, spread it throughout the country, and give the enemy a heavy economic blow. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Canceling Orders and Cutting Off Trade

The violent Japanese invasion of China and various atrocities have caused all Chinese people to hate them with a vengeance and vow to never coexist with the enemy. People of insight at home and abroad have long been automatically implementing economic severance with Japan. All relevant businesses that had dealings with Japan in peacetime have canceled all previously ordered goods and cut off trade since the outbreak of the Shanghai War. Especially in places where our overseas Chinese compatriots reside, such as the Nanyang Islands, they have long refused to purchase enemy goods. Therefore, the enemy's southward economic policy will suffer considerable losses due to the boycott of Japanese goods by our overseas Chinese and British and American people. If 450 million people across the country respond unanimously and implement it thoroughly, then the enemy's economic collapse will not be far away.

Customs Strictly Detains Smuggled Private Goods

The violent Japanese recently set up customs checkpoints in Hongkou and the French Concession to collect taxes. Although only enemy cargo ships go to pay taxes, the Jianghai Customs authorities believe that this move by the violent Japanese is actually destroying our country's tariff system. In addition to reporting and negotiating, they have dispatched many officers stationed in certain places that all cargo entering the country must pass through to conduct strict investigations. If found, they will be detained for investigation.

Various Industries Prevent Enemy Goods from Being Mixed In

The trade associations of various industries in this city, such as seafood, groceries, piece goods, hardware, woolens, sugar, rayon, and fruits, have recently received reports that unscrupulous traitors are disguising enemy goods as domestic goods and preparing to sell them in the market. They have notified the stores in each industry to pay close attention. If traitors are found soliciting goods privately, they should immediately tie up the person and the goods and send them to the military police authorities for investigation.

People Pay Attention to Enemy Goods Being Disguised

Our country has boycotted Japanese goods dozens of times. The results of each time have been due to the fact that they were not universal, thorough, or sustained, and they failed. But the enemy's plot to invade us has been extremely urgent, and the moment of national survival is imminent. At this final moment, all Chinese people should make the greatest determination to never buy or sell enemy goods for life and increase the strength of long-term resistance. They should pay close attention to enemy goods disguised as foreign goods and never be deceived by them, unknowingly using money to finance the enemy, manufacture airplanes and cannons, and use them as tools to invade our territory and slaughter our compatriots.

Federation of Trade Unions Sends Telegram to National Workers

The Federation of Trade Unions of this city and the Workers' Salvation Association jointly telegraphed workers across the country to sever economic relations with Japan. The original text reads: (Omitted titles) Both are aware that the Japanese enemy has provoked war in North China and covets Songhu. The soldiers and civilians in the north and south have risen up to resist. In recent days, enemy planes have wreaked havoc and bombed our important cities, causing our budding industry and commerce to be destroyed and innocent civilians to be massacred. More than one million workers across the country have been unemployed. This inhumane and barbaric act by the Japanese enemy has aroused the indignation of fair-minded people around the world, who have risen up to boycott Japanese goods. Laborers in Europe and the United States have even refused to load Japanese goods, which shows that reason has not disappeared and justice still exists. In addition to leading the 800,000 workers in Shanghai to vow to sever economic relations with the Japanese enemy, our association and others also hope that workers across the country will unite to fight the enemy to the death and defend our territory. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and the Shanghai Workers' Salvation Association respectfully solicit.

Many people who had previously obtained permission slips but had not had time to go and get their goods were still waiting. It is said that there are many foreign goods in the Yangshupu area, and it is feared that even with seven days of opening, it will still be difficult to take everything out.

Continues to Actively Serve; Planning to Organize a Large-Scale Hospital

The Buddhist monk rescue team, founded by the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Disaster Relief Association and the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee, has been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft since it was stationed in □□ Town. Two team members were injured, so they moved out of □□ Town and continued to bravely serve. Unexpectedly, on the 2nd, they were again bombed by enemy aircraft, with thirty bombs dropped one after another. All the civilian houses in the town were destroyed, but the team's stationed location was fortunately spared. When the first team leader, Dharma Master Xingduan, was bandaging wounded soldiers, a bomb suddenly flew over, killing three wounded soldiers. However, Dharma Master Xingduan was safe and sound, but his eardrums were ruptured and his nerves were damaged, so he remained like a wooden chicken for a long time. Now, the team is determined to be diligent and brave, and to carry through to the end, and has moved its station again. It is reported that the deputy team leader, Dharma Master Hongming, came to Shanghai on the 3rd on official business, and is preparing a large-scale Buddhist rescue hospital. It is learned that the first preparatory meeting will be held today to actively plan everything, and it is necessary to promote its realization in the shortest possible time.

Since the Luodian-Liuhang line, our army has made a slight westward move due to strategic considerations, and the enemy has repeatedly attempted to advance westward, but all have been blocked by our army's firepower. Although the enemy army in the Luodian area has continuously used artillery and aircraft to bomb our line from the Shi Xiangong Temple to the Yinjiatai and Xiecun line, hoping to destroy our fortifications, they have never succeeded. They changed direction, concentrated their forces, and attacked our camp south of the Yunzaobang River, from the Zhouzhai, Dongyangzhai, to the Zhongxingzhai area, towards the north of Miaoxing Town and the Tangqiao area along the Yunzaobang River on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, day and night. Our army firmly defends the south bank of the river, bravely and vigorously attacking. The number of enemy soldiers who died in the river and on the north bank is extremely large. Before dawn this morning, a team of enemy troops broke through at Tangshenzhai and Yanjiawan, and our army immediately surrounded and attacked them vigorously. As of noon today, they are still in bloody battle in that area. At the same time, the enemy army has also launched attacks from Gaojing Temple in the central urban area, southward to Lujiajiao and the Liangjiang Sports School, along Xitiyuhui Road, Jiangwan Road, and North Sichuan Road, all along the line in recent days, but all have been defeated by our army, and the casualties are extremely heavy. Although enemy planes and artillery continue to bomb us this morning, it does not affect our military situation.

Our reporter learned the following news from various sources yesterday: ㊀ Yesterday, enemy artillery and planes bombed the North Station, Baoshan Road, and Baziqiao area all day long.

Our army could not stay in the flames for long and moved to the left and right. The enemy thought we had retreated and charged. When we saw part of the enemy charging over, we attacked and surrounded them.

He himself and most of the soldiers felt that this war was very boring and uninteresting, because all problems between China and Japan could be resolved through diplomacy. He did not know why the diplomatic authorities did not work harder. He had been forced to come to Shanghai to fight this time, and there was nothing he could do. Our army authorities are doing their best to treat the captured soldiers favorably.

### Enemy Planes Wantonly Bomb Zhabei Three Times

### Four Battalion Commanders Bravely Sacrificed Themselves in the Intense Battle of Liuhang in Mid-September

In mid-September, the enemy launched a full-scale offensive against our Liuhang, attempting a central breakthrough to shake our entire line. On the 13th, 14th, and 15th, the enemy launched two fierce attacks on us, and the fighting was most intense. Our army bravely resisted and calmly responded, and the enemy was finally repulsed. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and we also suffered considerable damage. Yang Shilu, Chen Hongyuan, Yang Jiucun, and Geng Mingtang, the four battalion commanders of our ××× Division who were in charge of that line, all died heroically. It has been learned that the detailed battle process of the Yang and Geng battalions and the brief history of the two battalion commanders are as follows:

Details of the Battle

From September 13th to 15th, when the enemy was fiercely attacking our front line in the Liuhang area, × Division Battalion Commander Yang Shilu led his troops to defend the section of the position from about 600 meters south of Lidian to Ganxiantou. The enemy bombarded our position with intense artillery fire more than three times every day, and after a general bombing of our position, they continued to charge with infantry. When our army jumped out of the trenches and bravely intercepted and killed them, they turned back and fled, not daring to look back. Therefore, although we fought fiercely for two days and nights, we had not yet gained a greater victory. Battalion Commander Yang felt that it was not a good plan to be attacked by the enemy's artillery and fail to achieve greater gains. Therefore, when the enemy's artillery bombarded, he deployed most of his forces on both wings, leaving only a few scattered soldiers in the middle to resist. When the enemy soldiers charged, our front pretended to retreat, luring the enemy deep. The two wings surrounded the enemy. The enemy knew they had fallen into a trap and could not retreat in time. In close combat, more than 200 were killed or wounded by us. The enemy retaliated, and at 5:00 p.m. on the 15th, they launched a fierce attack on us with planes and artillery, and then used tanks to cover infantry that was twice as numerous as before. Battalion Commander Yang ordered the officers and soldiers to remain calm and wait, and ordered the pistol soldiers of each company to use pistols to shoot inside the tanks from the tank viewing holes when the enemy army was close to within 30 meters. Several tank drivers were shot and killed by us, and the remaining tanks hurriedly fled back without completing their mission. At this time, the officers and soldiers of the battalion and the fourth company temporarily attached to the battalion had left the trenches to meet and kill the enemy. The enemy and we fought hand-to-hand for more than an hour, killing about 300 enemy soldiers. Finally, due to the enemy's superiority in numbers, Battalion Commander Yang was shot several times and died on the battlefield. The officers and soldiers of the battalion also made a heroic sacrifice. Fortunately, our reinforcements arrived in time and repulsed the enemy. As for the battle of the Geng Battalion led by Battalion Commander Geng, at 1:00 p.m. on September 13, because our army attacked and advanced, it was surrounded by the enemy. Battalion Commander Geng led his troops to reinforce and launched a fierce attack on the enemy from the flank, killing more than 100 enemy soldiers on the spot. The enemy was defeated and retreated. Immediately, the enemy increased reinforcements and more than ten tanks, using fierce artillery fire to cover them. The battalion commander still disregarded his personal safety and fought the enemy in a bloody battle, charging six or seven times, and sacrificed his life for the country east of Xiaosongzhai.

Brief History of Yang and Geng

㊀ Battalion Commander Yang Shilu, courtesy name Chongli, was from Qian County, Shaanxi. He was tall and majestic, simple and taciturn, sincere and amiable to others, and loyal, courageous, diligent, and conscientious in his duties. Therefore, from the time he served as a platoon leader, company commander, and battalion adjutant to the present, he has been deeply trusted by his superiors and loved by his subordinates. ㊁ Battalion Commander Geng Mingtang, courtesy name Jianzhou, was 32 years old, from Xuchang, Henan.

### Enemy Attempts to Land at Chunjiang Wharf

Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River Fire on Us Again

At about 3:30 p.m. yesterday, enemy ships sent another speedboat, carrying more than a dozen armed soldiers, led by an officer, to the side of the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong, attempting to land and spy. They came secretly, without any sound. Our sentry troops had already discovered them. When they approached, they used machine guns to sweep them. The enemy boat used steel plates for cover and also fired back. After only a few minutes of engagement, the enemy boat was finally defeated and retreated.

At midnight yesterday, when our air force launched a second night attack, enemy ships frantically used anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns to resist. For a time, stray bullets flew in the Pudong area. Chen Shengbao, a native of Tongzhou, was shot in the left temple by a machine gun bullet, and his life was in danger. He is receiving emergency treatment. At dawn this morning, enemy ships in the Huangpu River and our artillery in Pudong had a fierce artillery battle. For a time, the sound of rumbling was incessant. Our artillery shells all landed in enemy positions in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas. At 9:00 a.m., 19 incoming enemy planes, in addition to four fighter planes, were all giant heavy bombers.

### Random Comments

— Xiang

I have said before that our country's current war of resistance is not only for our nation and country, but also for all peace-loving nations. Moreover, it is not only for all peace-loving nations, but truly for the sake of justice and humanity for all mankind. Therefore, those who consider this war against the enemy to be merely an event between China and Japan are, in their shortsightedness, quite extreme. Take an epidemic, for example. No one can avoid its rapid and cruel transmission. It affects A first, and then it must affect B. Once it affects B, it will inevitably affect C, with no room for stopping. Therefore, if you want to get rid of an epidemic and only use avoidance methods, the epidemic will become even more rampant. The best way to avoid an epidemic is to use a strong disinfectant to eliminate it, and then the epidemic will naturally be eradicated. Well said by U.S. President Roosevelt, "An epidemic of lawlessness is spreading in the world." He advocated that people of all peace-loving countries should work together to maintain world justice and isolate those countries that violate world justice. Otherwise, the United States will also be subject to attack. His words are truly enough to awaken those peace-loving countries that still stand by and watch the fire from across the river.

### Diary of Enemy Air Raids on Guangzhou

From September 21st to 26th, bombings occurred several times each day, with huge bombs being dropped. Our air force responded and shot down many enemy planes. Enemy aircraft carriers were stationed off the coast of Zhongshan and Taishan.

Guangzhou correspondence: Since the enemy aircraft carrier "Ryujo" sailed to the sea off Tangjiawan in the Jinliu District of Zhongshan County, enemy planes have been dispatched to bomb this area multiple times since August 18th. Up to September 20th, there have been ten such raids. However, from September 21st onwards, larger numbers of planes were dispatched to carry out extremely large-scale bombings. The details are recorded as follows:

September 21st

Enemy planes raided Guangzhou twice on September 21st, with great intensity. The authorities had been informed in advance and immediately ordered the air defense units under their command to be on high alert. It rained all day on the 20th, with a slight northeast wind, and enemy planes did not dare to attack. However, on the morning of the 21st, as the sky just cleared, a group of enemy planes, totaling forty-five, arrived in different directions to carry out air raids. According to reports from the watch哨兵 of the local air defense intelligence office, enemy planes were spotted simultaneously in Huizhou, Zhongshan, and Shunde, as well as Humen. It was estimated that there were about ten planes in Nianshan, Huizhou, five in Humen, and thirty between Zhongshan and Shunde, in the area of Wanqingsha. The local air raid alarm was issued at 6:29 a.m., instructing citizens to take shelter, and all air defense units prepared to counterattack. The air force station, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched a team of planes to intercept the enemy planes coming from different directions. The guard troops also mobilized at the same time, deploying in all directions within the city to maintain order and security. Seventeen minutes later, as the enemy planes approached the suburbs, an emergency alarm was issued, and all land and water traffic in the city, except for those with temporary special signals, were uniformly halted. Five minutes later, several sounds of machine guns were faintly heard. Shortly thereafter, the sound of engines could be heard clearly, and the planes were spotted in the northeast and northwest of the city. Our anti-aircraft guns and machine guns immediately concentrated their fire on the enemy planes. At this time, our air force had encountered the enemy and engaged in aerial combat. The sound of guns and artillery was as dense as a torrential rain. Shortly thereafter, multiple loud explosions were heard, and the sound of gunfire became even denser. Around 8:05 a.m., the enemy planes, unable to withstand the attack, fled in the direction from which they came. Our side also issued an all-clear signal at 8:40 a.m. After the event, it was investigated that the units of our air force, after receiving the alarm, had all taken off in separate formations and intercepted in all directions. The anti-aircraft gun and artillery teams had also been set up and were waiting in the air, ready to fire. When our planes reached the airspace over the suburbs, they encountered a group of about fifteen enemy planes scattered, trying to force their way into the city. Our planes then rushed forward to engage them, and another two teams flew to the Humen Fortress and the coastal front line of Bao'an County to intercept enemy planes from coming again. The enemy planes that arrived in the airspace over the suburbs were suddenly attacked fiercely by our planes and scattered in all directions, but still formed five teams of three planes each. As our army pursued them relentlessly, they were forced into our city's airspace. At that time, all anti-aircraft gun and artillery positions fired simultaneously, trapping the enemy planes in a net of fire. The enemy planes were all heavily damaged, but they continued to fight and flee, trying to break out of the suburbs and return to their nest. Our planes then rushed forward to encircle and annihilate them. The aerial battle at that time was extremely fierce, not allowing the enemy planes to drop a single bomb. After a while, the enemy planes were scattered by our attack and lost their sense of direction, soaring high into the sky. However, our planes continued to pursue them closely. To lighten their load, the enemy planes haphazardly dropped several bombs, which landed around the outskirts of the city, with loud booming sounds that echoed far and wide. But when the enemy planes dropped bombs, they turned sideways to do so, so our planes devised a clever strategy of tumbling and firing, and at the same time, three enemy planes were shot down. It was found that two of them were destroyed by the air force and the anti-aircraft artillery team in the airspace over Xiaogang Village in the west of the city. The enemy planes were immediately burned to ashes, and the crew died. However, at the same time, the outskirts of the village also suffered the impact of three bombs, but fortunately there was no major loss. As for the other plane, it was shot down in Shabai Village in the western suburbs of the city. This plane was severely attacked by the guns of our planes and crashed down. In addition, three planes were shot down in the Huangpodong area. It was heard that two of the enemy planes had been burned and one was still remaining. Of the pilots, the two on the planes that had been burned had been burned to death on the spot. As for the one that remained, it was heard that one person had parachuted to escape, and the rest had died with the plane. By 11:00 a.m., the places where bombs had been dropped were heard to include several in the vicinity of Tianhe and Baiyun, but they all fell in the fields. In the western suburbs of the city, it was heard that several bombs also fell in Zengbu. One of the bombs exploded, killing two people and seriously injuring three and slightly injuring two in the fields and civilian houses. Otherwise, there was no real damage. Also, regarding the enemy planes that were shot down this morning, according to the authorities, two enemy planes were shot down in the Humen area and one in the airspace over Chixi in Bao'an County. The local authorities are now being instructed to report the details so that their merits can be recognized. According to statistics, the first phase of the aerial combat resulted in nine enemy planes being shot down. In addition, it was heard that there were still some that fell in the wilderness or crashed into the water and sank, which could not be known in detail. The losses suffered by our side were only a few civilian houses in Zengbu being collapsed, killing innocent civilians and workers. Apart from that, only seven or eight people were injured in all directions. As for the second air raid alarm, it was issued at 1:30 p.m. It was reported that thirty-seven enemy planes were flying from Tangjiawan. Our planes took off to intercept them. At 1:40 p.m., the enemy planes detoured again, one in the northeast and one in the northwest, with the aim of destroying the factories in between. Our anti-aircraft guns and machine guns also fired at the enemy planes at the same time, but they were unable to enter the city and dropped a few bombs outside the northern suburbs. At 2:15 p.m., the enemy planes, unable to withstand the attack, fled in a panic. Our air force pursued them closely and engaged them in a fierce battle again in the airspace over Huangpu Xin Zhou, and shot down another enemy plane there. At forty-two minutes past the hour, when our search found no trace of the enemy, an all-clear signal was issued. Also, one of our air force planes was forced to land in Shijing during the first aerial combat because of the disparity in numbers. The pilot, so-and-so, descended with a parachute at Lizhiwan and was only slightly injured. He went to a nearby hospital for treatment. Another plane had slightly damaged parts, and the pilot injured his foot, but he also landed safely and went to the hospital.

September 22nd

On this day, the enemy aircraft carrier dispatched more than thirty planes in eight batches at 2:21 a.m., when the moon was bright and the stars were sparse, to attack Guangzhou. Each batch was separated by approximately ten to fifteen minutes and passed over Humen. Chen Ce, the commander of the Humen Fortress, urgently reported to the provincial government via long-distance telephone that enemy planes would soon attack, and at the same time, used anti-aircraft guns to strafe the enemy planes. The enemy planes also dropped several bombs over Humen, but they were all aimless, so we suffered no losses. After crossing Humen, the enemy planes gathered between Huangpu and Humen and divided into three large teams, each with about ten planes, taking turns to attack Guangzhou. The time that enemy planes invaded the urban area was: the first team from 2:40 a.m. to 4:20 a.m., the second team from 4:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., and the third team suddenly attacked at 6:40 a.m., after our air defense department issued an all-clear signal at 6:30 a.m., trying to take us by surprise and bomb heavily. However, they were intercepted by our planes. By about 8:00 a.m., they were defeated and fled. At 8:30 a.m., the air defense department issued an all-clear signal. After the enemy planes left, the city returned to normal, order gradually stabilized, and there were more and more pedestrians. Unexpectedly, at 12:20 p.m., more than ten enemy planes attacked for the fourth time. Our air force quickly took off to intercept them, and they fled at 1:20 p.m. At 2:00 p.m., the air defense department issued an all-clear signal again. When our air defense department first received the report from the Humen Fortress, it immediately issued an alarm, ordering citizens to evacuate. All air defense units prepared to counterattack, and the air force headquarters also dispatched several teams of planes to intercept the enemy planes coming from different directions. The guard troops also mobilized at the same time, guarding all roads in the city. At 2:35 a.m., as the enemy planes approached the suburbs, the air defense department issued a second emergency alarm, and all land and water traffic in the city was halted. When about ten enemy planes were spotted in the airspace over the urban area, our anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine gun teams immediately concentrated their fire on the enemy planes. At this time, our air force also encountered the enemy planes, and a fierce aerial battle broke out. The sound of anti-aircraft artillery and machine guns rumbled and shook the roofs. The enemy planes were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. On this day, enemy planes attacked four times, and the battle was roughly the same as before. However, according to statistics, enemy planes dropped more than one hundred bombs, including fifty-pound, one-hundred-pound bombs and incendiary bombs, so we suffered considerable losses. It is learned that a bomb fell at Xiaomalu Road, east of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which used to be a parking lot, about two zhang from the Memorial Hall. The explosive force was not great, and there was no damage to the Memorial Hall. Another bomb fell in the open space on the side of the Memorial Hall, about one zhang away from the Memorial Hall, only slightly damaging the windows and doors in the western part of the Memorial Hall. A water pipe that was originally there was also destroyed. It was found that this bomb was an incendiary bomb, and the explosive force was not great. The soil that was blown up was all sulfur-colored. In addition, a bomb also fell at the intersection of Haizhu North Road near Jinghui Road, with very little explosive force and slight losses. A Guanyin Temple at the entrance of Jinghui Street also suffered slight damage from a bomb and slightly injured several people, who have been taken to the municipal hospital by ambulance for treatment and should be fine. The households affected were those engaged in small businesses such as operating bubble water shops, groceries, foreign goods, and rice flour, as well as residents. In addition, a bomb also fell on the residence at No. 12 Jinghui Road, not far from here, and the neighboring household at No. 10 also suffered slight damage. In addition, there was a bomb on Datang Street, one on Yunlu Street, and one on Chaotian Street, with collapsed houses and injured people. One room was destroyed in Jinlong North, Longjin West, and one room was destroyed in Yuntai Lane, Sipailou. There were no major casualties. Two bombs were also dropped by enemy planes on Zhusigang and Mao'ergang, but the bomb in Zhusigang did not explode. According to news from the rescue team, civilian houses near Baiyun Road and Dongchuan Road were also slightly destroyed, and the injured citizens were sent to various hospitals for treatment. Also, on this day, four enemy planes were shot down by us, two falling near the Shajing Village outside Xicun, and two falling in Yunfeng Village in the suburbs of the city. According to Huang Kun, a farmer from Shanyunfeng Village who transported vegetables to the Anzhan vegetable market in the city, at 4:00 a.m. this morning (22nd), an enemy plane was shot down by our plane in the vegetable field behind the Caishen Temple in the village. The plane caught fire after crashing to the ground and spread to two farmhouses there. At the same time, another enemy plane crashed in Songgang, more than ten li away from the village.

— Xie Zhenqi

Arrogant barbarian cavalry invaded Gui Sui,
Lured into a ring of mountains, surrounded on all sides.

Turned to powder and scattered in the sky.

One cry truly startles people,
The name "Eighth Route Army" is not in vain.
News of the complete collapse of the Japanese invaders,
Standing up to restore the ancient Yan and Yun.

Heroic deeds are marked throughout the land.
The barbarity of the Japanese invaders is not new,
How can their elite troops be wiped out in an instant?

### Cotton Vests for Comforting Soldiers, Resistance Against Cold and Aggression, Deep and Meaningful

Distribute 100,000 pieces to soldiers on Double Tenth Festival,
Hope patriotic men and women will rush to make them within three days.

The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association has decided to send personnel to the front line on the Double Tenth Festival to comfort the soldiers fighting and plans to bring 100,000 cotton vests to distribute to the soldiers. This truly embodies the meaning of resisting the cold and resisting aggression. However, such a huge number cannot but hope that patriotic men and women will send them to the designated receiving agencies of the Shanghai Comfort Committee in the next three days, such as the Jingtu Temple in Guling Road, the Jinli Cotton Cloth Association in Zhou, and the Silk Industry Guild Hall in Beijing Road. If you need to entrust an agent to handle it, each piece costs 6.55 cents, and the payment can be sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on Yu Qiaqing Road or the Shanghai Local Association in the Zhonghui Building, and an official receipt will be given.

Also, since the Association announced the news of sending personnel to collect cotton vests, sanitary shirts, and pants, cotton quilts, and other cold-weather items for distribution to the front line, the number of receipts has surged in the past three days. There are more than 30,000 cotton vests. Donors of more than 1,000 pieces include colleagues from Hexing Tobacco Company and Mrs. Zhang Weiru, and so on. Donors of more than 500 pieces include the Jiuru Shouxing Association and colleagues from Huacheng Tobacco Company, and so on. Donors of more than 400 pieces include colleagues from Hexing Hairong and colleagues from the Salt Industry Bank, and so on. Donors of more than 200 pieces include Chinese staff of Siemens Factory, the Christian Association, Chinese staff of the Public Works Department, and Zhang Daohong's China Company, and so on. Donors of more than 100 pieces include colleagues from Wang Xieji, Mrs. Yang Jingcheng, Yida Yarn Factory, colleagues from Jiabao Salt Shop, colleagues from Dalu Industrial Company, Chen Guoying, Sun Xingji, Lianyi Society, and Hua Tea Company, and so on. Zhang Huang Ruishan alone donated 1,000 sanitary shirts. There are also more than 400 cotton quilts. Other households are not listed. The above items have been sent to the front in batches and are still being collected. Anyone with more than ten pieces can inform the Association by phone, and personnel will be sent to collect them with a receipt. Also, the Association has sent nearly one million anti-enemy biscuits and is now widely recruiting manufacturers in order to achieve the goal of producing 400,000 pieces a day. The Association's telephone numbers are 84844 and 83964.

### Rescue Briefs

The Red Cross's rescue efforts in North China have not stopped. The 24th Hospital is seeking supplies. A free maternity ward for civilians will be added.

The General Assembly of the Chinese Red Cross Society received a letter from a certain place in North China yesterday, stating that the branch is still working normally in a certain hutong. The local rescue committee is still housing as many as 599 wounded people and is trying hard to maintain it. However, the funding and medicines are only enough for a short period of time, which is quite worrying. Although the Red Cross is an international neutral charitable organization, it does not distinguish between boundaries, but it is quite difficult to provide funding and medicines to that place.

The rescue team organized by the Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical circles has achieved excellent results since participating in the rescue work last month. Male and female team members depart every night and transport wounded soldiers four or five times. The Red Cross specially sent them to serve in the rear and moved yesterday. The team also established a field hospital in the rear at the same time.

### The Joint Association of Disaster Victims in Tai, Jia, and Bao Counties is Established

After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang counties, unfortunately fell into the war zone because of their proximity to the riverside. In addition to a small number of disaster victims who moved to Shanghai, Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, and other places, most of the remaining disaster victims were displaced and gathered in the areas of Taqiao, Zhujiaqiao, northwest of Jiading, and Penglang Town in Kunshan County, crying out in the cold and hunger, the situation is extremely miserable. In order to unify the organization and seek solutions to the relief of life, a joint association of disaster victims in Tai, Jia, and Bao counties was specially organized. He Yuanming, Gu Jincheng, Wang Piaoping, and fifteen others were elected as executive members, and Yan Gangru and five others were elected as supervisory members. Six departments, including general affairs, finance, investigation, registration, supply, communication, and hygiene, were established to serve each special function. In order to improve the association's affairs, fifteen local gentry and prominent figures from the three counties, such as Zhang Gongquan, Qin Fen, and Jin Jushan, were invited as directors.

### How to Eliminate the Enemy in the Rear

— Liu Yucai

Since the start of the all-nation liberation war of resistance, our army has loyally annihilated the enemy, and has achieved considerable victories up to now. However, the activities of traitors in the rear have also become as prominent as the war of resistance. Not only are they prominent, but the number of traitors is also alarmingly large. Thus, traitors have become enemies in the rear. In this period of war of resistance that is related to the survival of the nation, we must absolutely not allow these enemies in the rear to have any more room for activity! Recently, the traitors who are active in the concession areas are not putting poisonous water in teacups, but are instead more thoroughly organized. They destroy transportation, investigate military intelligence, investigate the number of refugees and the names and addresses of important anti-Japanese figures, find opportunities to throw bombs everywhere, disturb the peace, and specialize in buying food to supply the enemy! The situation in the past few days has been particularly tense. Doihara is the chief of the special affairs agency in North China. He is an old and cunning master spy. He has arrived in Shanghai these past few days, specializing in leading traitors to do espionage work between the front and rear. At the same time, Kawashima Yoshiko, the queen of Japanese spies, who is known for using her beauty to flatter people and gather military intelligence, and who has achieved considerable results, has also arrived in Shanghai these past few days, having agreed with Doihara. Her method of activity is to use very clever means, her alluring beauty, to ingratiate herself with generally military-related Chinese people. There is no need to say more about the fact that her work and Doihara's go the same way by different paths; the enemy has now sent these two treasures to Shanghai to take charge. The direction of their activities is divided into three major goals: military, political, and cultural. The detective work in the military aspect is: to lead senior spies and well-qualified traitors to survey key passes, investigate our country's military transportation, strength, and deployment of forces, as well as national defense facilities, the location of ordnance factories, ammunition storage depots, rear command posts, the organization of civil defense, the location of fire and power plants, the serial numbers of the army, the changing situation of defensive locations, the types and deployment of weapons, etc., are all examples of methods of investigation and destruction. Others, such as the measurement of traffic on village roads near the war zone, rivers and bridges, and the actual situation of wells, mountains, hills, forests, and plains, etc., are mainly aimed at buying off and corrupting military officers, civil defense leaders, local tyrants, and evil gentry, organizing vagrants and scattered soldiers, alienating the unity of upper-level military personnel, dividing cooperation between the military and civilians, provoking feelings between the military and civilians, spreading terror rumors, promoting how sophisticated Japanese weapons are, how strong their strength is, buying off workers from ordnance factories, power plants, and waterworks to engage in sabotage, and other various types of targets. There is really no end to them. As for the political and cultural aspects, the enemy's important espionage work includes the following items: (1) Investigating the activities of various Chinese parties and anti-Japanese groups, buying them off if they can be bought off, and destroying them if they cannot be bought off; (2) Contacting pro-Japanese intellectuals, spreading pro-Japanese arguments to bewilder the theories of various parties. (3) Confusing China's administrative organization, dividing the relationship between the central government and local governments, and implementing dismemberment. (4) Shifting anti-Japanese goals. (5) Destroying the unity of the central hub. (6) Investigating cultural institutions in major cities, instigating traitors to engage in arson, and so on. After reading the above-mentioned enemy espionage policy, although we deny that enemy espionage activities have achieved considerable success in the course of this war of resistance, Shanghai has already suffered some considerable losses. We must not neglect the activities of these things again. Often the victory or defeat of a war is sometimes determined by the activities of a certain kind of spy or a certain act of a traitor. Now, not only should we not fear, but we must engage in the work of eliminating spies and traitors. At such a critical moment of life and death, each of us must be constantly vigilant, not talk indiscriminately about military intelligence, the number of troops, serial numbers, and the names of generals, military equipment, and the inside story and persons in charge of all organizations related to resisting the enemy, and pay attention to the words and actions of the people around you. If you encounter suspicious people, you must track them vigilantly. If they are indeed traitors, immediately grab them and hand them over to the patrol police or report them, because the people who do espionage work are not necessarily these things, and sometimes even high-ranking officials are on our list of investigations. Not only do we need to pay attention to the poor and Chinese aspects, but at the same time, we must pay close attention to the rich and foreign aspects. Eliminating the activities of spies and traitors is our war strategy in the rear. Killing a spy or traitor sometimes has the same meaning as killing an enemy or even tens of thousands of enemy troops. Therefore, eliminating spies and traitors is the greatest task of our people in the rear during the war of resistance. Everyone can do it, everyone can do it, and it is an important task that cannot be neglected in the slightest. We must quickly rise up to eliminate the power of the enemy in the rear and cooperate with the victory on the front line! We believe that China has 400 million vast people's forces, and spies and traitors only account for a very small part. As long as we organize the people of the whole country closely and make it have a strong secret connection with the military, and the military and the people become one; on the one hand, the refugees in the war zone must be transported to the inland areas in an organized and planned manner to engage in various production work to strengthen the foundation of wartime production, and even train them to replenish the army as reserves. In this way, I dare to believe that spies and traitors will gradually be eliminated, and even eliminated; because (1) With the organization of various types of people, it will naturally be difficult for spies and traitors to gain a foothold. (2) If the general public has a way out in life, they will naturally not be bought by the enemy to become traitors. The situation is extremely urgent and critical. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will unite and rise up automatically to form a close group to eliminate the enemy in the rear--spies and traitors.
