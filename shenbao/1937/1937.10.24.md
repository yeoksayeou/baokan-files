### Our Left Wing Engages in Fierce and Bloody Battle with the Enemy's Main Force Advancing South Along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway

We Move Our Defensive Position at Maqiao and Vigorously Counterattack – Intense Fighting with Advances and Retreats in Chenjiaxiang – Enemy Heavy Forces Attacking Guangfu Have Been Defeated by Our Troops

Starting from dawn the day before yesterday, the enemy launched a full-scale and fierce attack on our left-wing positions, from Guangfu Town to Chenjiaxiang, and the east and west sides of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway on the southern bank of the Wenzaobang Canal. Artillery fire filled the sky, and the fighting was especially intense. The main forces of both armies engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and the bloody battle continued for two days and nights without a moment's respite. Under the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft, the enemy first attacked our newly captured positions from the general offensive a few days ago. Our troops fought valiantly, but ultimately, due to unstable positions, were forced to retreat to the original positions. The enemy then advanced in two directions towards Guangfu with a regiment-sized force, spearheaded by more than 30 tanks and other mechanized units. We waited in strength and calmly engaged the enemy, destroying many of their tanks. The stubborn enemy refused to retreat even at the cost of death. By noon yesterday, after hundreds of enemy corpses were left behind and their main force had collapsed, they dared not linger and fled in disarray. In the Chenjiaxiang area, the fierce fighting was even more intense, with both armies engaging in hand-to-hand combat, advancing and retreating. At 7:00 PM the night before last, the position was temporarily lost. Yesterday morning at dawn, our fresh reinforcements arrived and launched a vigorous counterattack, retaking it by 10:00 AM. After regrouping, the enemy launched a concentrated bombardment with aircraft and artillery, causing significant damage to our fortifications. To avoid excessive casualties, we slightly moved back our positions to wait for an opportunity to counterattack. The enemy also dared not advance rashly, and the situation is currently at a stalemate. On the western side of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, at the southern bank of Fengcun Tang, in the direction of Gejia Archway and Huanggang, the remaining enemy forces are still surrounded by us. Their repeated attempts to break out have been met with head-on defeats. They have now gathered a large number of their main forces and changed their attack direction to the front of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. The bloody battle in the Yujiazhai and Zhujiazhai areas lasted for fifteen hours. Yesterday afternoon, our position at Maqiao was breached by the enemy. We immediately deployed new defensive positions to tightly block the enemy, making it impossible for them to connect with the Gejia Archway area. We are consolidating our positions step by step, and our strength is substantial. Even a few breakthroughs can be quickly addressed with the most rapid deployments and perfect compensation, and it has no impact on the overall war situation. External reports speculate that a breakthrough at a certain point would endanger the entire situation, but this is an observation made without understanding the true situation and without comprehending our military deployment. Even if a certain location is automatically moved back due to terrain conditions, it would only be a matter of dozens or hundreds of meters of movement of villages and strongholds, and it would absolutely not affect the entire war situation.

### Fighting Along the Guangfu-Chenjiaxiang Line is Exceptionally Fierce

Large Enemy Forces Fiercely Attacking Us – Chenjiaxiang Breached, Currently Counterattacking

Central News Agency Guangfu Military Correspondent, 10:00 AM, 23rd, reported that after our counterattack along the Guangfu to Chenjiaxiang line succeeded, retaking several strongholds and pressing towards Liuhang, the enemy on the southern bank of the Wenzaobang Canal was placed under significant threat. To resolve this crisis, the enemy has concentrated artillery fire on this line for the past two days, and large numbers of infantry have launched violent attacks on us. Many of our newly built temporary fortifications have been destroyed, and we have retreated to our original positions. At dawn today, the enemy continued to launch fierce attacks with 30 to 40 tanks, covering a large contingent of infantry. The intensity of their artillery fire is particularly rare in recent days. However, our loyal and courageous soldiers, all embracing the determination to defend their positions to the death, are calmly responding. Around 9:00 AM, the enemy slightly shifted backward, and the Guangfu Town position remains unshaken, while the area north of Guangfu is relatively calm.

Central News Agency Guangfu Military Correspondent, 1:40 PM, 23rd, reported that the enemy on the Luodian-Liuhe Highway, after suffering a fierce counterattack from us on the 21st, launched another fierce attack on us in the evening. Our artillery concentrated its firepower to bombard them, annihilating many enemies. Last night, several hundred more enemies attacked along the Luodian-Jiading Highway. Our troops had prepared early, dispatched teams to intercept them, and encountered them at Wujiazhai, about 200 meters north of the highway. After our valiant defense, we killed many enemies and finally repelled them.

### Maqiao Breached by Enemy Advance

Heavy Artillery Fire Completely Destroys Fortifications – Our Troops Awaiting Reinforcements for Counterattack – Fierce Fighting on Shanghai-Taicang Highway Yesterday

Central News Agency reported that, according to military news, in order to relieve the crisis of the protruding part of Gejia Archway being surrounded, the enemy troops have been constantly pounding the Liuhang-Dachang Highway with tanks since yesterday morning. Our Maqiao (2 kilometers north of Dachang) bears the brunt. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers fought the enemy with their flesh and blood. By the afternoon, due to the intense artillery fire and the complete destruction of the fortifications, they broke through. We are awaiting reinforcements for a counterattack.

Gejia Archway Attacked by Our Forces From Both Sides

Central News Agency Jiangwan Military Correspondent reported at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that the enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal, blocked in the Gejia Archway and Huanggang area, has suffered heavy losses from our counterattacks in recent days. From last night to this morning, our troops launched attacks from Hulizhai, Sujiazhai, and Chenjiazhai, charging bravely and repeatedly approaching the enemy's positions. However, the enemy stubbornly defended their fixed positions, and bullets flew like rain. After dawn, we still retreated to our original defenses.

Three Fierce Battles on the West Side of the Highway

Central News Agency Jiangwan Military Correspondent reported at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that the enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal, on the west side of the highway, was attacked. Now, on the east side of the highway, they are actively advancing. From last night to this morning, there were three fierce battles: ⑴ The enemy currently besieged in Zhouchengzhai launched an attack before dawn today with five or six tanks, covering infantry. However, after our counterattack, they immediately retreated. ⑵ Along the line of Luzhai and Gaoyaqiaozhai, our troops' positions are exceptionally solid. Therefore, in the past twelve hours, the enemy's repeated attacks have suffered heavy losses. Luzhai has not succeeded. ⑶ Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai on the west side of the highway were fiercely contested. The enemy attempted to control the highway and advance towards Dachang, so they constantly attacked regardless of the heavy sacrifices. Their only strategy was to use dense artillery bombardment and tank charges. However, our fortifications are stable, so the stalemate has continued until this morning, and the enemy finally retreated.

Beihoujiazhai Gained and Lost Again

Central News Agency Jiangwan Military Correspondent reported at 10:50 PM on the 23rd that the enemy entrenched in Wanjia Archway and Huanggang has switched to a defensive posture. Our troops are firmly holding the positions of Hulizhai, Sujiazhai, and Chenjiazhai to monitor them. There were only minor skirmishes on the front line throughout the day. The fierce fighting of the past few days has now subsided. However, the fighting on the left wing has become more intense again. The enemy began a fierce attack westward this morning, advancing along Fengcun Tang. Our troops held the line of Beihoujiazhai and Nanhoujiazhai, calmly responding. However, due to the unusually active enemy aircraft and heavy bombing, the fortifications at Beihoujiazhai were destroyed by the enemy and could not be repaired in time, so they were rushed. However, at noon, our troops launched a counterattack and drove the enemy away. But the enemy was still unwilling to give up, and around 4:00 PM, they sent in reinforcements and launched a large-scale attack, finally breaking through again. Currently, we are still holding a certain place west of the enemy, awaiting reinforcements for a counterattack. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle tonight.

Our Troops in Luzhai Slightly Moved Back

Central News Agency Jiangwan Military Correspondent reported at 10:30 PM on the 23rd that the fierce fighting on both sides of the Liuhang-Dachang Highway on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal has not stopped until evening. One enemy force attacked our Zhouchengzhai position. After we repelled them, the enemy switched to artillery bombardment, and the infantry did not attack again. The enemy in the area of Tanjiawan and Changjilou surrounded our positions at Luzhai and Gaoqiaozhai from the northwest and northeast, placing us under considerable restraint. In addition, the enemy's artillery bombardment has been continuous for several days, and almost all fortifications have been destroyed, with the situation being precarious several times. Relying entirely on our loyal and brave soldiers, who are fighting the enemy with their flesh and blood, we have persisted until noon. Our troops slightly moved back to wait for an opportunity to counterattack. Another enemy force attacked Jixiangzhai on the west side of the highway around 3:00 PM. Our troops calmly responded, and the stalemate continued until the evening.

### Our Air Force Bombs Enemy Positions North of Luodian

Enemy Ammunition Depots and Other Targets Exploded – Enemy Armory in Hongkou Also Destroyed

Central News Agency Guangfu Military Correspondent, 1:40 PM, 23rd, reported that last night, our air force came to Shanghai to assist in the battle, flying over enemy positions north of Luodian and dropping many bombs. They hit the enemy's concentration points and ammunition depots. The sound of explosions was incessant at the time, and then the fire soared into the sky, and people's voices were tumultuous. It can be known that the enemy was seriously damaged.

Small Skirmishes in Jiangwan – Enemy Moves North at Municipal Cemetery

Central News Agency Zhabei Military Correspondent reported at 10:50 PM on the 23rd that at 8:00 AM this morning, two enemy platoons attacked from North Sichuan Road towards the Laixing Road intersection. Our troops relied on solid fortifications to deal with the enemy. The enemy repeatedly tried to break through, but they were all shot back by our machine guns. After a stalemate of about two hours, the enemy finally failed and left dejectedly. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, dozens more enemies came to the front of our Zhongxing Road position, seemingly probing our military's strengths and weaknesses, but they were also repelled by our military. After nightfall, eight enemy planes flew in formation over Zhabei and dropped bombs, but our fortifications were not damaged.

Central News Agency Jiangwan Military Correspondent reported at 10:30 PM on the 23rd that the enemy along the Yanjiawan Riverbank is building bridges again under the cover of aircraft and artillery. Although our troops are closely monitoring and constantly shooting to disrupt them, the enemy's artillery fire is fierce, and they finally succeeded in building the bridge. It is expected that the enemy will reinforce and attack there. Our troops have strengthened their fortifications and are closely watching.

Central News Agency Zhabei Military Correspondent reported at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that at 11:00 PM last night, we launched a surprise attack on the enemy from Yajiang Road and Dongbaoxing Road, killing many enemies. We achieved victory at midnight and returned to our original positions.

Central News Agency Jiangwan Military Correspondent reported at 1:30 PM on the 23rd that there were only small skirmishes on Jiangwan Road. The enemy attacked our Tiyuhui Road position from Qimei Road and Xiangyin Road at 2:30 AM this morning. Our troops calmly responded, and the enemy did not intend to actively attack, so both sides exchanged fire with rifles and machine guns. The gunfire continued for more than three hours. After dawn, the enemy retreated. The enemy suffered more than 50 casualties, and we also suffered some losses.

Central News Agency Jiangwan Military Correspondent reported at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that about 200 enemies near the Municipal Cemetery moved north, seemingly to reinforce Zhanghuabang. However, at the time of reporting, the enemy east of Miaohang had not taken any action.

Central News Agency Jianghai Military Correspondent reported at 1:10 AM on the 24th that at 2:00 PM yesterday, the enemy at Sijing Golf Course suddenly moved towards Gaojingmiao. Our troops received the news and immediately dispatched troops to ambush on the side of the road and launch a surprise attack. The enemy troops were unprepared and, under the pressure of our outposts, scattered and hid. After a stalemate of about four hours, the enemy suffered more than a dozen deaths and still retreated to the Sijing Golf Course.

Central News Agency Jiangwan Military Correspondent reported at 1:10 AM on the 24th that at around 4:00 PM yesterday, several enemy tanks came from Qimei Road towards Xiangyin Road, followed by more than 200 enemy soldiers, feigning an attack on our Eastern Sports Association. Our troops went out to meet them and bombarded the enemy with flat-trajectory guns, forcing them to retreat. The enemy soldiers scattered on the side of the road and confronted us, with intermittent gunfire. They retreated at 10:00 PM.

### In Luodian, Our Assault Team Kills Enemy Regimental Commander and Many Others

Large Number of Enemy Officers Killed at Caowangmiao – Important Documents and Military Equipment Seized

Central News Agency Suzhou, 23rd: According to news from the front, in our army's full-scale general offensive on the 21st, all enemy units suffered extraordinarily heavy casualties. That night, in the Luodian area, an enemy Korean guard unit's commander, Takahashi, was killed. A diary and a leader's certificate were found on his body, proving the severity of the enemy's casualties in the battle.

Central News Agency Guangfu Military Correspondent, 1:40 PM, 23rd, reported that the troops holding the Shixianggongmiao-Caowangmiao line, although suffering from the enemy's fierce attacks from land and air, relied on solid fortifications and valiant soldiers to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. On the 21st, in our army's full-scale counterattack, a special assault team was formed, taking advantage of the moonlight to launch a fierce attack. Breaking through their alert line, they drove straight in, unstoppable, and captured large and small villages such as Wujiazhai, Yanzhai, Dingjiaqiao, and Yangzhai. The enemy, hearing the news, were routed, abandoned their weapons, and fled in panic. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle. According to our investigation, there were Captain Kawasaki, Lieutenant Saito, Second Lieutenant Tsurunaga Mitsuyoshi, and about two hundred and sixty soldiers and officers, and more than one hundred and forty-three enemy rifles, five revolvers, two anti-aircraft machine guns, one artillery ranging mirror, and many important documents were seized. In addition, three unmailed letters from Second Lieutenant Tsurunaga were obtained, stating that our army's morale was unusually high, advancing without retreat, and there was a good chance of defeating the "Imperial Army." The so-called "Imperial Army" wanted to conquer certain positions by a set deadline, but it was indeed difficult to achieve. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's senior officers already knew of our army's bravery and did not dare to be arrogant and boastful.

### Over 20,000 Enemy Reinforcements Arrive Again

Aircraft, Artillery Vehicles, Etc. Continued to be Transported Yesterday

Central News Agency Suzhou, 23rd: According to reports from front-line reporters, from the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, more than 22,000 enemy troops arrived in Shanghai as reinforcements.

### Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb and Massacres

Yesterday morning at 8:00, two enemy planes circled over the Tangqiao area of Pudong and strafed with machine guns. At 8:30, the enemy planes crossed the Huangpu River to Nanshi and strafed the ferries. The reporter was on a ferry at the time, and the scene was quite dangerous. Fortunately, the bullets all landed in the Huangpu River and did not cause a tragedy.

Zhabei

In Zhabei, enemy planes went to and from the skies, continuously and routinely bombed the area, with each sortie consisting of three planes and did not stop until the evening. The peak bombing times were between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM, and between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM. Over the course of yesterday enemy planes dropped no less than one hundred bombs on the Zhabei district, with only fifty or sixty houses being destroyed with minimal other damages.

Starting at 8:00 AM yesterday until 1:00 PM, enemy planes bombed Zhabei again on three separate occasions. The first bombing occured from 8:00 to 9:00 AM. Two enemy planes circled around Zhongxing Road and Song Park Road, dropping a total of six volleys of three bombs each. Most of these bombs detonated around the back of the Yong'an Company's Machinery Depot, and the mound of earth commonly referred to as Huarang Tan (Land of the Dead). The second bombing consistited of three planes dropping a total of eighteen bombs. Three bombs landed at the intersection between Zhongshan Road and Jiaotong Road, three more landed near the Southern Jade Emperor Palace Temple in Pengpu Town, and another three landed at the end of Song Park. The rest landed along Baoshan Road, Baoyuan Road, and along the railway line. During the third attack, three planes dropped four heavy bombs each four separate times. The first three landed north of Hanqiao, the second landed along Song Park Road and Liuying Road, and the third and fourth landed along the intersection of Zhongyu Road, Yongyu Road, and the East-West Shiyu Road. At 1:30 PM the attacks paused briefly, then at 4:30 PM to 5:15 PM, three enemy planes once again circled over Zhabei, flying six circuits dropping three bombs each circuit for a total of eighteen bombs. Three volleys of bombs landed at the intersection between Baoshan Road and Saiyuan Road, along the railway line. Three bombs each landed on the south side of the Commercial Press Printing Factory and Library. Three bombs also landed to the east of Shishan Road, west of Baoshan Road, and east of the Jinghu Railway and Gonghe New Road. After the planes finished bombing, two planes first returned, while the remaining single plane flew one circuit over northwest Zhabei before heading to east Yangshupu.

Huxi

In Huxi, at 10:30 AM yesterday, three enemy planes circled back and forth in the sky, north of the Zhongshan Bridge on Zhongshan Road. They dropped three bombs at Shejiazhai, north of Daxia University, killing a woman and injuring a man. Afterwards, they flew low over the front of Daxia University, strafing with machine guns, but fortunately no one was injured.

### Confirmation of Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Huxi the Day Before Yesterday

White Gauze Band Left Beside the Corpse – Various Talismans Enclosed in Pouch

At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (21st), our anti-aircraft artillery in Huacao Town, Huxi, hit an enemy bomber. It crashed into a river near the Suzhou River, and the fuselage was destroyed. Both pilots were killed on the spot. It is now known that beside the body of one of the pilots, named Ono Kazuyuki, there was a white gauze band. Upon careful examination, it was not a loincloth, but something worn as a waist pouch. Opening the pouch, there were several scattered packets of white paper, with the words "Atsuta Grand Shrine Omamori" printed on the cover. Inside the packet was a strip of red silk cloth, seven-eighths to one inch wide and two and three-eighths inches long, with an arched top and a flat bottom, sewn from two layers of coarse silk cloth, with gold thread on the edges, and a "Miyajidake Shrine Omamori 17 Gold" character adhered in the center. The other side was a floral pattern, with crude workmanship and materials, not like something lovingly sewn by a mother or wife. It was probably the so-called amulet sold by the shrine. Friends and relatives gave it to him to wish him a safe return, but unexpectedly the gods and ghosts were of no use, and he suffered a dark and violent end, his blood buried in a foreign land.

### Do Not Obscure the Enemy's Brutal Acts

The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China in Shanghai cabled the London Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "To the Esteemed London Chamber of Commerce, we have recently learned that Japanese commercial groups are cabling various parties in an attempt to obscure the atrocities of their military cliques in China, which endanger both Chinese and foreign people. We believe that the wise people of your country will see through this scheme and will not easily believe it. The reason why all countries in the world unanimously protest Japan's actions is purely based on the facts that have occurred in China. The evidence is all there and cannot be covered up by one hand. Currently, your country's commercial interests in China have been severely damaged. If Japan's brazenness increases, there will be a day when they are completely eliminated. Even your country's Far East market and position in Asia will ultimately be lost. The example of Manchuria can serve as a warning. We are rigorously implementing economic severance with Japan, hoping for success. We sincerely hope that your chamber will lead the way and act in unison. Since the incident, people from your country have expressed deep sympathy for China. Recently, your city's mayor has advocated raising funds for war-torn disaster victims, spreading benevolence far and wide. We are extremely grateful. We hereby express our gratitude and hope for your attention. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of China, kowtows, respectfully."

### Our Army in Northern Shanxi Captures Nanzhuangtou

Fierce Battle for Heights Between Enemy and Our Forces in Eastern Shanxi, Enemy Invading Cixian on the Pinghan Railway Encircled, Our Troops in Tianjin Cross the Tuhai River for a Full-Scale Offensive

[Taiyuan] Frontline dispatch: ㊀ The enemy on the front of Lingshan (about twenty miles east of Xinkou) mostly changed into gray-uniformed puppet troops on the evening of the 20th. The Japanese soldiers wearing yellow uniforms and steel helmets mostly withdrew to the west of the Hutuo River. ㊁ A certain battalion of our army attacked Nanzhuangtou (north of Weijiazhuang on the left flank) at 12:00 PM on the 21st, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness. A portion of the troops charged into the village and engaged the enemy in street fighting, destroying one enemy heavy machine gun and two armored vehicles. Another portion ambushed the road north of the village, killing sixty to seventy mules and horses and destroying three trucks. At dawn on the 22nd, the enemy dispatched more than ten trucks carrying over two hundred soldiers from Yan Zhuang to reinforce. A fierce battle ensued with our forces. In this engagement, a total of fifty to sixty enemy soldiers were killed, and our forces suffered over thirty officers and soldiers killed in action. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

[Taiyuan] Eastern Shanxi: Enemy and our forces were still engaged in fierce fighting in the Heyuan area on the 23rd, with a very intense struggle for the heights there. As a result, both sides suffered heavy casualties. In order to strengthen our forces in that area, a certain fresh force has been transferred to join the battle. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

[Taiyuan] Xinkou area: After the fierce fighting on the 22nd, our army still firmly holds Guancun (i.e., the original defense line of Guanzhuang and Gongjiazhuang) and recaptured two heights. On the 23rd, the fighting on both lines was quiet, and there was no contact on either the left or right flanks. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

[Jinan] Military news: ㊀ Our army has crossed the Tuhai River for a full-scale offensive. ㊁ Our guerrillas have been attacking the enemy's rear in the Pingyuan, Zhangzhuang, and Dongguang areas for several days, destroying communications and burning enemy supplies. The enemy is exhausted from running around and preparing to retreat. ㊂ The enemy in Ling County has been surrounded by us. (Special dispatch, 23rd)

[Jinan] From last night to this afternoon, there was no fighting on the front lines. During the artillery battle yesterday afternoon, a shell landed at Yucheng station, causing no major damage. Two enemy planes spied on Yantai Fushan today. (Special dispatch, 23rd)

[Taiyuan] A reporter inspected the battle on the Niangziguan line on the morning of the 21st. Since the 13th, the enemy, under the command of two regiments at Chuan'an, has repeatedly attacked eastern Shanxi without success. On the 16th and 17th, they launched a fierce attack on the Niangziguan front with one regiment, while another brigade attempted to bypass and attack Jiuguan. After our courageous resistance, we ambushed the enemy's one regiment, capturing countless firearms and horses, and destroying twenty-three of their artillery pieces, inflicting heavy damage. On the evening of the 18th, our army launched a night attack on Jiuguan, killing several hundred more enemy soldiers. The enemy was heavily encircled. On the morning of the 19th, the enemy launched a counterattack with the remnants of their forces, and at the same time, added about 4,000 troops from the 37th Division of the Puppet Manchukuo Army, launching a fierce attack on our Heyuan and Da Xiao Geyuan (fifteen miles east of Niangziguan). After fierce fighting until the evening of the 21st, they were finally defeated by our forces and turned to attack a certain high mountain area near Heyuan and the Beiyu area outside the pass (five miles east of Niangziguan). By noon on the 22nd, the enemy's momentum was unsustainable and they began to retreat. Currently, there are only 2,000 enemy troops remaining in Heyuan and Beiyu, and they have been heavily surrounded by our army. Given that the enemy has penetrated deeply and their rear is extremely vulnerable, a large number of fresh troops have been transferred to the front lines to completely annihilate the enemy in the near future. The morale of our army at Niangziguan is extremely high, and they are determined to fight to the death. On the 16th and 17th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our Gonglingguan, thirteen times in all, without success. A soldier in a certain unit of our army killed thirteen enemy soldiers with a bayonet. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

⊙ Xinxiang: The enemy invading Cixian, about a brigade, was lured into our position on the 19th and is now heavily encircled. On the 20th, the sound of artillery fire was frequently heard at Anyang station, and the Zhanghe River bridge has been partially destroyed. There are solid fortifications along the coast, and our army is determined to defend to the death. More than forty enemy tanks are now preparing to retreat to the Jinpu Railway due to the fierce attack on the Pinghan Railway front. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)

[Taiyuan] The United Press correspondent Mr. Belden, at the frontline of the Chinese army in northern Shanxi, reported: The Japanese army claimed to have achieved a great victory in the southward advance on the Pinghan Road and the western seizure of Sui'an and occupation of Shanxi. In fact, the Japanese army's victory was due to only minor contact. The Japanese army's transportation and supply lines are now becoming increasingly fragile, and the Chinese army has now begun to counterattack. The period that follows will be a true test of the Japanese army's bravery. The Japanese army that entered Shanxi from the north totaled about 80,000 people, including four divisions and several independent brigades. In addition, there were two divisions attempting to attack from eastern Shanxi, with Taiyuan as their target. Therefore, the total number of Japanese troops attacking Shanxi was 100,000. Shanxi leaders believe that the war in Shanxi cannot develop as it did in Shanghai, because it is located in a mountainous area and the focus is not on capturing cities, but on destroying the enemy army. As the battle line expands, defense becomes more difficult, so it is impossible to quickly move troops to resist the Japanese army. Currently, Shanxi military officers are carrying out the following principles on the front lines: ㊀ The troops in each county are trained in guerrilla warfare so that they can operate individually, attacking the flanks and backs of the Japanese army. ㊁ It is necessary to abandon the line of defense and instead use guerrillas and commando units. ㊂ It is necessary to wage guerrilla warfare and train farmers to use the strategy of exhausting the enemy. The success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition in 1925 was mainly due to the people having political organizations, but military leaders outside of Shanxi have not yet used this political organization of the people. According to the military leaders here, it will take about two months to organize the farmers of Shanxi so that they can dedicate themselves to the country.

Japanese Say Conflict Between Soviet and Japan Possible, Two Cities Have Been Captured By Volunteer Armies, No More Reinforcements Will Be Sent to North China

[Nanjing] The Japanese army's dispatch of a large number of troops from Tianjin to "Manchukuo" for reinforcement has made the Chinese here deeply believe that this is due to the increasingly serious situation outside the Pass in the past week. The Kwantung Army, which entered the Pass in July to assist the North China Garrison Army in combat, has now withdrawn one after another and is heading to Manchuria. The Kwantung Army will no longer send reinforcements to North China. The Kwantung Army leader telegraphed the Japanese army in North China, saying that there is a possibility of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, so it is necessary to reserve full strength to defend "Manchukuo." 20,000 members of the "Security Force" belonging to the Jidong puppet organization have already been transferred to Shenyang to protect "Manchukuo" and maintain order. The Kwantung Army has ordered the cessation of transporting "Manchukuo" puppet troops to the Chinese front lines, because many puppet troops are loyal to their motherland and surrender to the Central Army on the battlefield. Currently, the Northeast Volunteer Army is very active, and it is said that two cities in the eastern and central parts of "Manchukuo" have been captured by the Chinese Volunteer Army.

### U.S. Secretary of State Calls for Maintaining International Law and Order in Speech

Resorting to Military Force and Breaking Promises Will Ultimately Harm Oneself - Hopes to Inspire Humanity's Conscience to Create World Peace Together

⊙Toronto, Canada The University of Toronto today conferred an honorary doctorate on U.S. Secretary of State Hull. After receiving the degree, Hull delivered a speech attacking international lawlessness and appealing to humanity's conscience to promote the restoration of world peace. Hull came here for a courtesy visit to Canadian Governor-General Lord Tweedsmuir. His speech did not specifically mention the wars in Spain or China. He said, "Seeing that sooner or later a society or a country uses inspired conscience to promote great efforts to restore law and order, I dare to believe that humanity's inspired conscience will also promote great efforts. This can create unshakable law and order in the scope of international relations. It is particularly effective to make these remarks in the territory of the United Kingdom. My country and the countries that make up the great federation of Great Britain all advocate maintaining a just state in international relations, which is peace rather than war. Those who violate law and order and destroy peace will eventually succumb to the will of the vast majority of mankind. For what mankind wants is the existence of human civilization, not dishonorable degradation." Hull then issued a warning, saying that in the new world, no country engaged in large-scale warfare can escape the repercussions of war. The inviolability of promises must be a firm belief. We must hold the willingness to resolve disputes peacefully, rather than seeking victory or adding insults. The opportunity for war, once launched in any part of the world, will lead to no safety, no trust, no joy, and no spiritual strength anywhere. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 22nd)

### British "Times" Discusses Prospects of Nine-Power Conference

Difficult to be Overly Optimistic - Japan's Participation Uncertain

⊙Beijing The governments of Denmark, Canada, and Portugal have formally accepted the invitation to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Currently, only Japan and Bolivia have not responded to the invitation from the Belgian government. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

[London] The Times stated in an editorial today that under the current circumstances, it cannot be said that the prospects of the Nine-Power Conference are extremely hopeful. Japan has previously expressed its aversion to foreign mediation. China, in its struggle for survival, has had considerable success. Unless under conditions unacceptable to Japan, the Chinese people's animosity and the government's long-considered policies will not readily seek peace. Therefore, it would be foolish to hope that the Nine-Power Conference can magically make the belligerents lay down their arms, like stopping two dogs from fighting with pepper. However, the Beijing conference is not incapable of doing anything. Reconciliation proposals may not be acceptable to the belligerent countries at present, but one day they may become the basis for compromise between the two sides. As for the adoption of economic pressure as a tool to stop the war, although it will evolve, it may not make any progress. It is hoped that those participating in the Beijing conference will not make broad attacks on Japan that cannot be implemented. Excessive theoretical criticism only serves to allow Tokyo to spread propaganda to its people that foreigners do not understand Japan. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

[Tokyo] A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry denied today that Japan intended to request a postponement of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The spokesperson only stated that Foreign Minister Hirota received the Belgian invitation too late and may not be able to attend the conference. According to those familiar with the matter, Japan's attitude is clear evidence of its request to postpone the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, Japanese official circles are currently adopting an absolutely silent attitude toward the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (National Telegram on the 23rd)

[New York] According to a report from the Tokyo correspondent of the New York Tribune today, the Belgian Ambassador to Japan told Hirota that if Japan expects the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be postponed, the Belgian government may be able to find a way to postpone it. It remains to be verified whether the American newspaper's report is accurate. (National Telegram on the 22nd)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe gathered members of the Japan Diplomatic Association at his residence this morning, including Kurachi Tetsukichi, Yosawa Kenkichi, Hayashi Raisaburo, Hatta Yoshiaki, Nomura Kichisaburo, and others, to exchange various important opinions on diplomacy and current issues.

### British Journalist Wythe Suggests Ways to Promote Peace in the Far East

[London] British writer and journalist Wythe gave a speech in London today, suggesting ways to promote peace in the Far East. He said that if the war in the Far East is prolonged and Japan seeks oil on the market, the United Kingdom and the United States can inform Japan that we do not want to adopt economic sanctions and shame Japan before the world, but if Japan refuses to participate in the conference, we will cut off the supply of oil to Japan. He believes that this method is more likely to succeed than attempting to promote sanctions in the current environment, because the Anglo-American trade agreement is completed, and this policy is more powerful, and its effect cannot be offset by Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

### Chinese League of Nations Association Cables Geneva

Seeking to Achieve Three Goals

[Geneva] The Chinese League of Nations Association cabled the League of Nations Union yesterday, stating, "The resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly condemning Japan's aggression is deeply supported by this association. The efforts of various countries for peace and justice, especially the United Kingdom's convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the United States' support, are also greatly appreciated by this association. We hereby request that the League of Nations Associations of various countries urge their respective governments to ensure that this conference achieves results as soon as possible. As for the goals of the conference, this association advocates: ㊀ the troops of the aggressor country should withdraw from China; ㊁ China and Japan should agree not to invade each other; ㊂ efforts should be made to mediate the current disputes between China and Japan, in order to achieve a fundamental solution. If such efforts fail due to Japanese obstruction, there is no other practical solution except to fully implement economic sanctions." (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

### U.S. Republican Congressman Advocates Neutrality

Attacks Roosevelt's Policies

[Washington] Republican Congressman Fish made a radio broadcast speech today, stating that President Roosevelt's actions are directly contrary to the will of Congress and the American people to adhere to neutrality and avoid war. Fish also criticized President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Davis for wanting to force the United States to join the League of Nations, even at the cost of dragging our country into the vortex of maintaining peace for other countries. Fish solemnly declared that the United States has decided to refuse to participate in any sanctions of the League of Nations or tasks that could lead to war. The United States is unwilling to interfere in the deep-seated grudges between other nations, nor is it willing to advise on the border issues between other countries. He continued that the United States is not entirely indifferent to Japan's cruel actions of bombing Chinese civilians, women, and children, but China has a long history of being invaded by foreign tribes. The Mongols and Manchus in the past have ravaged China, and Japan is only the most recent invader of China. Therefore, according to Fish's view, resisting Japanese aggression is China's own business, and the United States need not intervene. What the United States should do is to firmly adhere to neutrality. (National Telegram on the 22nd)

### Comparison of Naval Strength

Britain Builds Port in Singapore - To Be Fully Completed Within the Year

[Washington] According to the latest statistics from the Navy Department, the current naval strength of the United States, Britain, and Japan is approximately as follows:

In addition, the U.S. shipbuilding plan includes 87 ships totaling 335,585 tons, the British shipbuilding plan includes 95 ships totaling 541,190 tons, and the Japanese shipbuilding plan includes 23 ships totaling 79,272 tons (however, the figures for Japan's replacement of old ships are currently difficult to obtain). The U.S. shipbuilding plan includes four large battleships of 35,000 tons, each equipped with 16-inch diameter guns, with an estimated cost of US$50 million per ship. However, it is not yet known when construction will begin. It is also understood that the current year's plan includes the completion of 14 ships, including one aircraft carrier, the "Yorktown," and two light cruisers. One submarine has already been launched. The plan for the coming year stipulates the completion of 30 ships, including two aircraft carriers, one heavy cruiser, five light cruisers, six submarines, and four destroyers, which have also been launched. However, they still need to undergo speed tests and other controls before they can join the navy for service. (National Telegram on the 22nd)

⊙Newcastle, England Sir Samuel Hoare, the Home Secretary, recently delivered a speech at a banquet of the Chamber of Commerce in this city, stating, "The construction project of the Singapore naval base will be completed in approximately several months. The British Navy's activity in the Far East will be unprecedented in modern times." He also said that the situation in the Far East and Europe is becoming increasingly unsettling. People in both the United Kingdom and the United States are increasingly valuing the important truths about correcting international relations. If this common sentiment is allowed to develop naturally without hindrance, it will inevitably foster a boundless strength in the future." (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 22nd)

### German Ambassador to Britain's Mission to Italy

Musha Koji in Rome - In Contact Regarding Anti-Communist Pact

[Berlin] The German Ambassador to Britain, Richard von Hencke, flew to Rome yesterday. Political figures are very certain about this matter. Although official sources claim that Mr. von Hencke's trip is purely for private travel, well-informed sources say that when von Hencke recently returned to his country to report on his duties, he went to Berchtesgaden and had discussions with Führer Hitler. Therefore, this trip to Italy may be on Hitler's orders to contact Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Diplomats believe that Ribbentrop's contact with Mussolini should involve four aspects: ㊀ Italy's attitude towards the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact; ㊁ Italy's attitude after the London Adjustment Committee's negotiations on the non-interference method in the Spanish Civil War reached a stalemate; ㊂ the situation in Central Europe; ㊃ Germany's demands for colonies. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

[Berlin] Well-informed sources recently stated that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Musha Koji, is currently in Rome and will not return to Berlin until the 25th of this month. It is reported that the purpose of the Ambassador's trip to Italy is to contact the Italian government on the issue of that country's participation in the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact.

### Director of International Labour Office to Visit Far East at End of Month

[Geneva] The Director of the International Labour Office, John Winant, is scheduled to depart for the Far East on the 28th of this month. At the International Labour Conference this year, the Japanese delegation invited Winant to visit the country to study the social and economic situation. Subsequently, the governments of the British and Dutch colonies also extended similar invitations to Winant, which he accepted. However, the current situation in the Far East is unstable, and war has broken out between China and Japan. Therefore, Winant's trip will be limited to the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia and he does not intend to go to Japan. He is expected to return here at the end of January next year.

Current Commentary

### An Opportunity for Diplomatic Efforts

— Yi

The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is about to open in Beijing. It may not necessarily be the main key to the transformation of international relations in the Far East. But after this conference, at least the true policies of the major powers towards the aggressor country in the Far East can be tested one by one. In any case, our country should make every effort to use this opportunity of the conference to develop the international situation in a good direction. There are two points to pay attention to at present.

First. We cannot ignore Japan's diplomatic activities. Now Japan is still waiting for the invitation from the Belgian government. Obviously, it is waiting for further development in the military. But whether it participates in the conference or not, Japan's diplomacy has a tendency to compromise to cooperate with the policy of quick battles and quick decisions. Therefore, we must closely monitor Japan's diplomatic activities in the international arena. If it is allowed to develop, the emergence of a "Hall-Laval-style" mediation plan, creating a situation of dividing China, is very possible.

Second. We must promote the situation of collective security in the Far East. Because the Nine-Power Treaty actually has no binding force or sanctions. Our country cannot get any guarantee from the treaty alone. Only by launching a collective security system can the aggressor country be effectively sanctioned. To achieve this goal, we must first work together with the Soviet Union, which has the same interests.

Our country's past diplomacy is obviously not active enough. To cope with the current international situation, it must have more proactiveness and initiative.

### Reflections on the People's Voices

▲ Soliciting Perfect Clothing Materials

When we make clothes, we must choose materials that are strong, wrinkle-resistant, colorfast, elegant, generous, and good at keeping warm.

The "Vienna" Triangle brand produced by the Sanyou Industrial Society on Nanjing Road perfectly meets the above various excellent conditions and caters to the psychology of the people. Therefore, buyers praise it and wearers are satisfied.

### Japan's Ugly Face Fully Exposed: Education Representatives Not Fooled

Newspapers Change Speeches, Completely Losing True Meaning - Spending 750,000 Fails to Buy Public Opinion

In August of this year, the World Education Conference of the International Education Federation was held in Tokyo. Our country's education circles refused to participate because the conference allowed representatives of the puppet state of Manchukuo to attend. According to the Dalu Bao yesterday, when the International Education Federation in Shanghai held a meeting this Friday, Mr. Ames, a teacher at the Lester Institute, gave a speech recounting the ugliness of the Japanese at the Tokyo conference. He said that there were about 2,000 teachers from about 50 countries attending the conference. The Japanese took this as a great opportunity for propaganda. In the first few days of the conference, the speeches of the representatives were published in newspapers, but many sentences were changed, completely losing the true meaning. The purpose was to make readers feel that the representatives unanimously supported Japan's claims. The speakers were shocked when they saw this and collectively condemned the Japanese government, and asked the embassies of various foreign countries to negotiate with the Japanese government to demand corrections. However, the Japanese authorities ignored this. Therefore, the organizers of the conference, in order to remedy the situation, prepared radios in the conference hall and recorded every word of the representatives' speeches. The Japanese were then at their wit's end, and because the newspapers had recordings to check, they no longer dared to be as bold as before. However, the Japanese still made great efforts to promote to the world's teachers and educators, explaining their policy and aspirations for using troops in China, believing that they would give speeches to their countrymen after returning home, praising Japan's mission in China. The Japanese also spared no expense to lure them, and during the week that the representatives stayed in Japan, they provided attentive and meticulous hospitality. It is said that the expenses used amounted to more than 750,000 Japanese yen. On the day the representatives left Japan, they gathered 2,000 children, dressed in colorful and beautiful kimonos, shouting "Banzai!" to bid farewell at the wharf to win the hearts of passers-by. During the week, in addition to the time for the conference, guides led the representatives to watch plays and browse, and held grand banquets every night, accompanied by various entertainment activities, and small boxes were distributed to the representatives, filled with books and pamphlets, exaggerating Japan's great achievements in the puppet state of Manchukuo and the empire's sacred mission in China. Many European and American representatives were uneasy for a while, but all the representatives took the road through China to reach Japan and knew a lot about the relationship between China and Japan. When the conference began to discuss Japan's aggression, they all spoke fairly. This proves that educators cannot be fooled by heavy bribes and sweet words. Although Japan spent a lot of money and made every effort to promote, the representatives still sympathized with China, which greatly disappointed the Japanese. In addition, Dr. Munro, the chairman of the conference, used his intelligence to handle the affairs of the conference, so that the conference was not immersed in the Japanese propaganda trend. One more point is worth noting: when the conference solemnly passed the resolution advocating world peace and goodwill understanding, not far from the conference hall, hundreds of Japanese children were shouting "Banzai!" to see off the troops heading to Shanghai and North China to fight. Is this not like advocating vegetarianism at the butcher's door? How can it be helpful?

### Coming and Going in the Bombing

— Guo Moruo

Fourteen

It was the morning of the twenty-sixth when I was able to leave Nanjing. It was really a coincidence, it was raining again today. Enemy planes rarely sortie on rainy days, maybe I am really lucky?

On the way, I encountered an air raid alert while eating lunch somewhere, but I didn't hear any bombing sounds. I went to ×× again to report to him on the situation after going to Nanjing. I only stayed for about twenty minutes.

Chunru, who was traveling with me, seemed to be even more eager to enter Shanghai earlier than I was. He wanted to rush into the concession before curfew. He said that entering the concession early, having dinner at a Sichuan restaurant, and then taking a bath at a hotel would allow him to sleep comfortably for one night. This cannot be said to be extravagant: because a whole day in the car is really enough to make people tired. Moreover, the highway is not very smooth. The car always liked to jump, and once when crossing a bridge, it jumped so high that it injured both of our heads.

But I myself did not dare to be optimistic. I have traveled back and forth on the highway near Shanghai many times, and the degree of unevenness is even more severe. I dare not believe that I can rush into the concession before curfew. But I didn't want to say it to destroy Chunru's hope. When a person has hope, even if they suffer, there is still some sweetness, but when hope is destroyed, the pure suffering will be doubly unbearable.

As I expected, when the car reached somewhere nearby, the highway was so bad that it was a bit absurd. Several trucks were stuck in the mud one after another and could not move. I prayed in my heart, hoping that our car would not also get stuck. However, this prayer did not work after all. Having only passed two or three stuck trucks, the eastern wheel was also stuck. Oops, what to do? It was still raining, and the muddy ruts were about a foot deep. In front were also stuck trucks and cars, and behind were also stuck trucks and cars, probably more than a dozen in a row. Fortunately, it was at night and raining, but by tomorrow morning, wouldn't these dozen cars be a very obvious target for enemy planes? Oops, what to do? Chunru's worries seemed to have already shattered his hopes, and the time was already ten o'clock at night.

Chunru and the attendant who came with him got out of the car and found some people from the trucks stuck in front and behind to try to push the car. I also got out of the car to push, but the mud was so rotten that it didn't allow you to stand, and the driver kept revving the engine. The car itself seemed to be on fire, venting its anger like a mad cow, so anxiously that its wheels emitted a rubbery smell, but it couldn't move at all.

— Oops, what to do, Chunru also became anxious.

I thought that it was not far from ×××'s residence. I said to Chunru: We have no choice but to find him, and if possible, ask him to send a car to pick us up and let him find someone to figure out how to get the car unstuck.

We found a coolie, asked him to lead the way, and walked in the muddy road in the rain. After a lot of trouble, we arrived at a ×××××. After negotiating with the person in charge here, we asked them to prepare ten coolies to push the car. It was said that the bad road was only a short section, and as long as that section was pushed through, there would be no problem. Chunru also called ××, but since there was already a solution, he didn't bother him again.

The coolies were all wearing straw raincoats, bamboo hats, and straw sandals, which seemed to be the best armor to withstand the heavy rain and mud.

Back on the highway, standing in the rain next to a stuck truck and waiting, this waiting was probably like standing in court waiting for a life or death sentence, although I have never had the experience of waiting for such a sentence.

The coolies were gone for a while, and headlights flickered in front. Before long, the horn roared happily towards us, it was the grass-colored, unstreamlined car we had come in. We, like the car, gained the joy of rebirth.

We stopped the car and waited for the coolies to come back. Chunru took out ten dollars to reward them and thanked them. They were also very happy. "Those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money," perhaps this is a good example here. Part of the money spent by those who have money should be used to solve the lives of those who have strength, so that the source of strength will not be exhausted.

The car started again. At this time, Chunru told me the origin of the car.

It turned out that the car was Madam Ci Xiu's dowry, originally a red car. Because there was a shortage of vehicles at the front, Madam Ci Xiu donated her own money, had the car skin repainted, and rushed it to the front. We were considered to have the honor of taking this expedition car for the first time.

Hearing the origin of the car, I couldn't help but understand why Chunru was so anxious just now. And the car itself was also so anxious. If it got stuck there and couldn't move, or was destroyed by enemy bombing and became scrap, wouldn't it be betraying Madam Ci Xiu's sincere patriotism, and increasing our, especially my own, sins?

Knowing the origin of the car, I felt a little uneasy sitting in the car. Such a respectable and precious car is really not something that a lazy person like me with muddy feet should be sitting in. Someone like me should only drag my muddy feet and drag this car through the mud. For some reason, sitting in the car, I felt like I was about to cry – even now, when I write this, tears are always welling up in my eyes.

The driver from Nanjing didn't know the way. He stopped to ask everyone he met on the highway, and stopped at every intersection. Therefore, it was already past two o'clock when we arrived at ××. I was very hungry. There was a stall selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks by the roadside. The attendant and the driver bought sesame cakes and fried dough sticks to eat; I also ate some.

Chunru said: This is probably the first time you've eaten sesame cakes and fried dough sticks since you returned to the country, right?

I said: No, last time I went to ××, Mr. Feng Huanzhang had already treated me to them once.

Chunru said again: We didn't get to eat Sichuan cuisine, so we're eating fried dough sticks and sesame cakes. He said, laughing to himself, and then continued: You will definitely have good articles to write this time. When you write, don't forget this episode of fried dough sticks and sesame cakes.

Yes, I respect my friend's earnest advice, and I will also record this trivial matter here, the so-called "tiny fly."

Around three o'clock, we arrived at Xujiahui. Needless to say, we couldn't enter the concession. The four of us spent the night in one car. But I myself slept very comfortably. Being able to spend a night in such a respectable car is probably the greatest luck in my so-called "great luck" of "being very lucky at forty-six."

On the morning of the twenty-seventh, in the clear sky, the car reached Fenglin Bridge, and after considerable trouble, we were able to enter the concession. I returned to Shanghai from Japan on July 27, and returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on September 27, exactly two months.

### Aftermath of the Yarn Exchange Turmoil: Recovering Fines from Various Firms

Nine Yarn Firms Were Fined; Seven Have Already Paid

In May of this year, a major turmoil occurred in the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange due to conflicts between the two parties. Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang and others personally came to Shanghai to investigate, causing a great disturbance and shocking the time. The case has been brought to a conclusion after being transferred to the court. However, at that time, nine yarn firms violated Article 16 of the Exchange Law and should be fined 5,000 yuan each in accordance with Article 17 of the same law. The Ministry of Industry issued Instruction No. 1 in Shanghai, ordering the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau to execute the case according to law. After receiving the order, the bureau immediately forwarded it to each firm to pay the fine. Seven of them complied with the order and paid the fine. However, the address of Yu Ji Chuan Ji No. 1 is unknown, and the order cannot be delivered. The bureau reported the situation to the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Industry has instructed the bureau to make a public announcement and pursue the recovery of the fine according to law.

### The Enemy Sends Traitorous Scum to Undermine the Resistance Movement

Difficulty in Selling Enemy Goods; The Enemy Side Greatly Disappointed

Shen Shi News Agency reports that the establishment of the pseudo-customs by the enemy forces on Yangshupu Lan Road has caused serious concern from all parties. However, this matter has suddenly become silent. According to investigations, the enemy originally planned to transport a large number of goods to Shanghai for dumping in order to solve their domestic economic panic. However, recently, the movement of our people to boycott enemy goods has risen sharply, and the emotions are unusually tense. Not only are the Japanese goods that have been transported here unable to be sold, but also the enemy goods that arrived before August 13 and were stored in the customs warehouse are not easy to sell after being taken out. Therefore, the enemy side is greatly disappointed. At present, in addition to maintaining a stern attitude and waiting for the situation to change, they are still secretly sending a large number of traitorous scum to move around, attempting to destroy our resistance movement and divide the anti-Japanese forces of the people. If our people persist for a considerable period of time, the pseudo-customs will disappear on its own. In addition, the clothes and belongings left behind by the Chinese employees of the Jianghai Customs when they left have now also been looted by the enemy.

### Songjiang

Diary of Enemy Plane Raids on Songjiang

On the afternoon of the 19th, at 4:00 PM, enemy planes flew in from the southeast and dropped three bombs at the West Railway Station. They landed in the middle of the air-raid shelter at the foot of Yuetai Mountain. The soil immediately collapsed, and two female passengers in the shelter were slightly injured, one in the foot and one in the forehead. They were rescued by the Public Security Committee and sent to Rongcheng Hospital for treatment.

On the morning of the 20th, at 8:15 AM, three enemy planes attacked Songjiang and dropped five bombs at the Mingxing Bridge Station, but fortunately, no people were injured. At 1:00 PM and 4:15 PM, enemy planes passed by, but did not drop bombs.

### Enemy Shells Fall in the American Defense Zone; American Commander Lodges Protest

Enemy Commander Hasegawa Sends Personnel to Apologize; Guarantees That Similar Incidents Will Not Happen Again

Shen Shi News Agency reports that some time ago, a piece of enemy shell fragment fell on the American flagship Augusta. Afterwards, American Navy Commander Yarnell protested to the enemy side. Unexpectedly, the enemy planes dropped bombs at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibaige Road the day before yesterday, injuring more than forty passersby. The place happened to be within the defense area of ​​the American Marine Corps. Therefore, the commander of the Second Marine Regiment of the American Navy, Pimon de, immediately lodged a protest with the commander of the Third Fleet of the enemy, Hasegawa. Hasegawa immediately sent personnel to apologize and guaranteed that similar incidents would not happen again.

The Zi Lin News reports that a Japanese plane dropped an incendiary bomb on Xinzha Road at 4:15 PM on Friday, killing or injuring forty or fifty Chinese people, all of whom were burned. There were at least three children and many women among them, which was heartbreaking to witness. Two Indian policemen were also burned, one slightly injured and the other seriously injured. The place where the bomb fell was at least seventy yards away from the nearest point of the Suzhou River, which was within the American defense zone. Therefore, Brigadier General Beaumont, commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, protested to Commander Hasegawa, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Fleet of Japan. The result was only an apology. The Central News Agency reported that the day before yesterday afternoon, when enemy planes were bombing Zhabei, a shell fell near the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibaike Road, south of the Suzhou River, killing or injuring more than forty Chinese and foreign people. The area is the defense zone of the US Navy. After protesting to Commander Hasegawa, Commander of the Third Fleet of Japan, the Japanese side expressed its apology. However, the American side is still not satisfied. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military spokesman still tried to quibble yesterday when he received foreign reporters, saying that it was a gasoline can from the plane, not an incendiary bomb. At that time, a reporter who had witnessed that it was indeed a bomb immediately reprimanded him.

### Taxpayer Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Requesting Return of Clothing

Refugees from 引翔 Lack Clothing; Please Follow Example of Foreign Nationals

The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter yesterday to the Director-General of the Municipal Council, stating: "We are writing to you directly. According to a letter from the Refugee Association of the 引翔 District of Shanghai, since the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13th, two months have passed in an instant. Hundreds of thousands of our compatriots in the war zone have fled in haste to the Special Area, all experiencing immense suffering. The tragic situation, we believe, is well known to your Council. The citizens of East Shanghai have suffered even more severely. At the beginning of the war, they fled with nothing but their own persons, without being able to take care of their belongings and clothing. However, since the beginning of autumn, the weather has suddenly turned cool, and the lack of warm clothing has become an urgent problem. As the severe winter approaches, refugees residing in the Special Area feel the lack of clothing and warm coverings and fear the suffering from wind and snow. We believe that the authorities of the Special Area have previously found ways for foreign nationals to go to the war zone to retrieve items. Therefore, we should request the same treatment, allowing our compatriots who have suffered in East Shanghai to return to see the remnants of their destroyed businesses, or to retrieve at least some clothing to extend their lives a little longer. We hope your Council will investigate and respond accordingly."

### Wounded Soldiers in Hospital Thank Medical Staff

Excellent service, benefited greatly

A letter from all the wounded soldiers hospitalized at the Shanghai Seventeenth Rescue Hospital states: "Since the August 13th Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, more than two months have passed. The enemy has used its mechanized forces to attack our army day and night, attempting to break through our defense policy. Our comrades have been nurtured by our principles and followed the orders of leaders at all levels, and have come to Shanghai to participate in the war. All of our officers and soldiers have sworn to fight to the death, lying in the trenches and engaging in deadly battles with the enemy at night, so that the enemy has ultimately failed to succeed. Fortunately, our patriotic people have raised funds to purchase goods as gifts, or established hospitals to rescue wounded soldiers, demonstrating our nation's patriotic spirit and determination to overcome national difficulties together. We are currently staying at the Shanghai Seventeenth Rescue Hospital due to our injuries. Except for those with severe injuries and disabilities awaiting treatment, those whose injuries have slightly healed are planning to transfer to hospitals in the rear for recuperation in accordance with the central government's plan. Now that our wounds have gradually healed and we are about to transfer to other hospitals, we must express our heartfelt gratitude to the hospital's directors and all the enthusiastic staff, especially the hospital director, Zhu Gongmei, deputy director Chen Gongshouzhi, secretary director Zhou Juncaoyi, and medical director Yu Junxinyan. They have done their best to improve the health, medicine, and food for the wounded soldiers in the hospital, even with the hurried preparations. Their enthusiasm is admirable. We have written a brief account of our experiences to express our gratitude. Please disclose this to show our appreciation. Sincerely, The Shanghai News Editor, Representatives of the officers and soldiers of the various troops stationed in the hospital: Zhou Huan, Li Nianxun, Fan Shigong, Yu Zhong, Wu Dingguo, Liu Peiwu, Peng Zhenkun, Wen Zhenwei, Wen Chungui, Li Quansheng, Wang Jichang, Liu Jingxun, Chen Hengzhi, Xing Shusheng, Peng Maosheng, Wen Changsheng, Huang Heqing, Liu Yaoting, Xu Guo, Li Songqing, Xu Shiming, Gao Xiangbin, Zhang Guangcheng."

### No Need to Fear Mechanized Weapons

— Te Gong

This time, the enemy army is fighting in Shanghai, thinking that by using its mechanized weapons of the navy, army, and air force, and using cruel annihilation tactics, it can cause our army to suffer a terrible defeat in a matter of days. Then it can drive straight in and force our government, as its Prime Minister Konoe said, to kneel to Japan. Unexpectedly, our army officers and soldiers, because of the enemy's aggression over the years, hold pain in their bones. Now that they have the opportunity to resist, everyone is inspired by patriotic enthusiasm and rushes to fight the enemy. For two months, they have shown great power, making the enemy's mechanized troops completely ineffective. It has failed four times in its general offensive and has been reinforced six times. And now it actually admires the bravery of our army. Even friendly countries that used to worry about us are now praising the anti-Japanese spirit of our army. This spirit is entirely aroused by patriotic enthusiasm, so the ancients said, "Sincerity can communicate with the gods," and the regulations also say, "Spiritual power surpasses material power." However, mechanized weapons are not useless in war. If we had the same mechanized weapons as the enemy, we would have driven the enemy out of Shanghai long ago. However, mechanized weapons are very useful for assisting in battle, but it is impossible to win by relying on them alone. There is another point, using mechanized weapons to wage a cruel war of annihilation to seek a quick victory is the illusion held by today's fascist countries. Therefore, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe repeatedly announced at the beginning of the war against our country that he hoped for a quick victory, but when faced with a long-term war, they will be at their wit's end. In August of this year, the American Happiness magazine published an article that explained these two points in detail. The following is an excerpt, hoping that our compatriots will not be afraid of the enemy's mechanized weapons after reading this article and will strengthen their determination to fight a long-term war.

The threat of war almost always comes from countries that are dissatisfied because their economic status is inferior to that of other countries, but precisely for this reason, the current aggressor countries in Europe, such as Germany and Italy, dare not rashly challenge other countries unless their military advantage is clearly assured of victory at the beginning of the war. The war that they have instigated must be a quick victory. The main strength of fascism lies in two things: strict discipline and thorough propaganda, which are very effective in sudden, large-scale military attacks. Its main weakness, however, is that discipline must be maintained with force, and propaganda must be effective with stimulants. A government that uses force and stimulants is not suitable for engaging in long-term wars that are difficult to win and in which each victory must be separated by a long time. Democratic countries are rich in resilience and have abundant national power, and these two advantages can ultimately be realized in a long-term war. Therefore, Germany and Italy are unwilling to make waves and provoke wars unless they have a guaranteed method of achieving a quick victory.

Italian General Douhet boldly and frankly published his strategy, saying: In the next world war, the attacker will use all kinds of mechanized weapons in a swift and cruel manner. The first thing is airplanes, without prior warning, to attack the enemy's major cities and industrial areas at the same time, guaranteeing a great victory overnight.

This opinion has now become one of the main threats to peace in the minds of Europeans. British Air Force Commander Charlton's "War on England" speculated on General Douhet's aspirations, roughly described as follows:

"One day, the British Air Force was performing at Handen, and most of the senior army and navy officers were present to watch. While the planes were maneuvering in the sky, three squadrons of bombers from the four allied countries of Italy, Japan, Germany, and Poland suddenly flew into the middle of them and showed their power. Most of the British Air Force was immediately wiped out, and the spectators were poisoned by gas and killed by bombs. London had 10,000 fires due to incendiary bombs. The attacking planes also completely destroyed the power plants of the underground railways. When the people were rushing home from work, the entrances to the underground railways were filled with poisonous gas, and 80,000 people died. Parachutes descending from the sky constantly emitted green gas and mustard gas and other poisonous gases. England surrendered on the fourth day of the war. The fighting spirit of the British army was completely broken and no longer existed."

Although this is a fantasy insertion, it is enough to make the reader thrilling. However, the fascist dictatorships do not regard it as a fantasy, so the most important key to European peace today is whether the recent tactical mechanical advances can enable countries willing to fight with the most cruel means to attack suddenly and achieve great victories in a short period of time, like sweeping away dead leaves.

The Spanish War has provided definitive evidence for this point. Undoubtedly, Germany and Italy have used live targets in this war to test their latest weapons. The Soviet Union has also tested them, but to a lesser extent than Germany and Italy. These weapons were sent to Spain not for use by the army, but only for a short-term test, and were carefully guarded by people sent by the exporting countries to prevent outsiders from peeking, not even the Spanish rebel commander Franco and his officers. After the test, the results were recorded and transported back to Germany or Italy. The overall evaluation was that the new mechanized weapons could not give the attacker a greater advantage than those available in the World War, in other words, they had not yet reached perfection. Franco launched a large-scale offensive from Seville to Madrid, leading a well-trained new army, relying on mechanized transport, marching in a mighty manner. But when he arrived in Madrid, the enemy's untrained army, holding fortified positions, resisted him, and actually beat him to a pulp and completely defeated him. But Franco still proceeded according to Douhet's strategy, often using two or thirty bombers to bomb Madrid, hoping to break the fighting spirit of the people in the city. Because the government army had very weak anti-aircraft artillery power, the planes were able to fly and drop bombs like rain. He bombed thirty times in forty-two days, but life in Madrid remained active. The four cinemas never closed, and even because it was commonplace, no air raid alarm was issued. The effect of this air raid only increased the fighting spirit of the people.

Later, Franco's Italian friends attacked the government army with mechanized troops, but the result was an even greater failure. This time, a large army of 30,000 men, carrying a large number of tanks and armored vehicles, sped along the road, thinking that they would be successful as in the ideal held by the Fascist Party. But when they arrived at Guadalajara, the government army's infantry and artillery opened out to meet them, showing great power, and the mechanized troops immediately lost their attack effectiveness. The tanks and armored vehicles collided with each other and became stuck in the mud, becoming targets for the enemy army. At this time, all the roads were blocked, and Soviet planes attacked in the sky. The mechanized army was almost in a position of being tied up and waiting to be killed.

But most military experts who have not personally experienced it still believe in new destructive weapons and stubbornly argue. According to them, the scope of the Spanish War was too small to exert the power of these weapons. In the next world war, weapons such as the flying boat in Sunday magazine, the robot-driven bomber, death rays, colorless smoke that stops the activity of aircraft engines, disease-spreading microbes, and strange gases will definitely appear and have incredible effects. Even so, most of these items have been scientifically tested and proven to be ineffective. For example, although microbes can make the enemy army sick, it is difficult for one's own army to avoid being infected. Furthermore, not long before his death, Marconi talked to a friend about death rays: "The results obtained in the laboratory so far with death rays can only kill a mouse three feet away."

In short, from the end of the World War in 1918 to the present, it seems that no new weapons have been successfully developed. All the achievements are just improvements to existing weapons. (To be continued)

### Special Commentary: Cultural Work and National Mobilization

— Tao Wan

At the beginning of August, when I and a few friends were in Nanjing, the situation in Shanghai was already very urgent. We met Mr. Bai Chongxi, who had just rushed into the capital from Guangxi to face the national crisis together. He is one of the most determined advocates of resistance among our country's soldiers, which particularly aroused our respect. As soon as I met him, I said with emotion that at this time when a full-scale war of resistance is about to be realized, the gun is extremely important as the vanguard, and we who hold the pen should do our best to follow the gun. Mr. Bai said no, the pen is actually the vanguard, and the gun is just following the pen. Mr. Bai is a soldier, and of course, he meant to be modest when he said these words to the people holding the pen. We will never underestimate the important position that the military occupies in the period of resistance. Not only will we not underestimate it, but we will also universally respect it. This can be seen from the general public's eager anticipation and meticulous care for the frontline soldiers who are fighting bloody battles to fight for the nation's survival. However, the morale of the military and the people are closely linked. Modern warfare especially requires the support of the majority of the people. In this regard, no one can deny the importance of cultural work in creating correct public opinion, arousing the people's awareness of resisting insults, and strengthening the people's will to fight.

The invincible Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, and the cultural work of the May Fourth Movement, can be said to be the vanguard. The seeds spread by cultural work and the revolutionary military cooperated to produce a brilliant flower. The main reason why the warlords of the Northern Warlords were overthrown at that time was that they were abandoned by the people on the one hand, and had a foundation among the people on the other hand, and received various support from the people. This foundation among the people, this various support from the people, can never be summoned by sending out a few troops. Before the military is launched, and during the course of the military, there must be cultural work in the folk broadcasting the seeds of revolution and cultivating the emotions of struggle. Military mobilization can be done by a few orders, but national mobilization is not so simple. Efforts must be made on the ideological and conscious levels, and efforts must continue to be made in the process of struggle.

I have received many letters from readers in the interior reporting on the drafting of strong men and conscription in various places. Because the villagers do not understand the meaning of this sacred war of resistance, nor do they understand the responsibilities that the people should have to the country, coupled with the excuses of the local bullies and gentry, coercion and extortion are ubiquitous, resulting in various unfortunate phenomena. This contains very serious political problems, and the lack of cultural work in the countryside, or simply no so-called cultural work at all, is also a very important reason.

The active construction of the Soviet Union is admired by the world, especially their success in the great cause of collective farms among such backward peasant masses who have suffered various obstacles and difficulties. But they once mobilized thousands upon thousands of hardworking and loyal party members to go deep into the countryside to do education and propaganda work, so that the stubborn and conservative peasants deeply understood the meaning of rural reform for them, thereby changing their attitude towards this new movement. In the initial period, there were even party members working in the countryside who were assassinated by ignorant peasants, but they were not afraid of hardship, and continued to work hard according to the entire plan. Later, not only did they sweep away the stubborn and conservative habits, but they also mobilized millions upon millions of peasants to work together on the great construction of agricultural production. People only know to marvel at their great movement to mobilize the people, but they easily overlook their arduous efforts in cultural work.

I often think that if China wants to fight a protracted war, national mobilization is the most important thing. And this so-called mobilization, part of it is to mobilize to directly participate in the front-line war, and most of it is to mobilize to participate in large-scale economic construction for national defense that is rapid and intense with an entire plan. Complementing this economic construction and advancing in parallel is the mobilization of a large number of cultural workers to participate in cultural work that is rapid and intense with an entire plan.

### Continuous Settlement of Funds Tightens Foreign Exchange Market Prices

Foreign firms unanimously absorb, resembling pre-war conditions; Japanese exchange dark market suddenly tight, fear of enemy goods active

Since the war of resistance, all industries have been relatively stable. The foreign exchange market, although once very loose, has not deviated from the norm and has severely hit enemy banks. Afterwards, it gradually tightened, mainly because foreign firms unanimously absorbed, and Mobil Oil's settlement was even more intense. In addition, although enemy banks have funds to supply, they are not trusted by foreign exchange colleagues, and Chinese brokers are even refusing to cooperate. As a result, demand exceeds supply. As of yesterday, the British exchange rate has tightened to 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 25, and the US exchange rate has also shrunk to 29.5 yuan, similar to pre-war conditions. However, the Japanese exchange dark market suddenly tightened to around 102 yuan, a difference of 2 yuan from the cheapest time. Although there were no clear transactions during the process, there is no doubt that enemy goods have become active again. Fortunately, the Chinese people are paying close attention. Yesterday's closing prices, recent selling prices, were: British exchange rate 1 shilling, 2 pence, 25, November 1.875 and 1.5625 matching, US exchange rate 29.5 yuan, November 25, Japanese exchange rate 102.25 yuan, November 101.5 yuan. As for the Central Bank's official exchange rates, they are still British exchange rate 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 5 cents, and US exchange rate 30 yuan. Customs gold is 2269. HSBC's official exchange rates also remain the same: British exchange rate 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 25 cents, and US exchange rate 29.25 yuan.

### Youth National Salvation Service Corps Holds Graduation Ceremony for Cadre Training Team

### Yu Qiaqing and Others Benefit Wounded Soldiers

Yu first donates 3,000 yuan to raise 250,000 yuan

Yesterday at noon, the Shanghai Saturday Luncheon Society heard Mr. Di Huangren report on his return to Shanghai after inspecting Jinan, Xuzhou, and other places. He said that Chairman Han of Shandong Province is determined to resist the enemy. After arriving in Jinan, he visited him several times and was told that he only knew how to obey the government and resist to the end, and that he did not know anything else. Mr. Huang then reported on what he saw at the ×× wounded soldier station yesterday morning. He felt that the manpower and material resources there still needed to be supplemented. The soldiers on the front lines are sacrificing their lives to kill the enemy, resulting in serious injuries. If there is no spiritual consolation or material supply, how can we live up to them? On the spot, Mr. Yu Zhiqing donated 3,000 yuan for bread expenses, Mr. Qian Xinzhi donated 3,000 yuan, and Mr. Zhang Weiruyi donated 500 quilts. Mr. Yu Qiaqing also said that he would be responsible for raising 250,000 yuan for the expenses of rescuing wounded soldiers in the future. The wounded soldiers can be comforted.

### Youth National Salvation Service Corps Training Team Graduates

Anti-poisoning students go north to assist the work of a certain division

The Volunteer Army Cadre Training Team, run by the Military Department of the Youth National Salvation Service Corps, has had more than 80 students since the beginning of training. They are highly focused and extremely diligent. Now that the semester has ended, a graduation ceremony was held at 2:00 PM yesterday. Corps Commander Zhang Yuliang personally came to give instructions and gave encouragement. In addition, in response to the needs of a certain division on the front lines, the corps has specially dispatched 100 anti-poisoning training students, who are scheduled to depart tomorrow afternoon to take on the anti-poisoning work of the division.

### Vice President Kong Congratulates Soldiers on the Front Lines

Continue to fight bravely; Admiring their spirit

Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was extremely concerned about the war of resistance when he was overseas. After returning to China, he learned about the actual situation of the battlefields everywhere. He deeply admired the bloody battles and sacrifices of the soldiers on the front lines and the leaders who supervised the army on the front lines and took the lead. Therefore, they were able to inflict heavy damage on the enemy, win the sympathy of friendly countries, and make the international situation increasingly better, which is of great benefit to the future of the war of resistance. He sent telegrams to the generals and soldiers on the front lines yesterday to express his warm condolences and to encourage their morale to continue fighting bravely to achieve the final victory.

### Wartime Japan in All Its Forms (Continued - Part 1)

㊃ Japan's Attitude Toward the Nine-Power Treaty

A special dispatch from the Shen Shi News Agency reports that after the news that the League of Nations had decided to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue reached Tokyo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately stated that the Nine-Power Treaty was concluded fifteen years ago, and the situation in the Far East today is very different from what it was then. Therefore, the treaty has become a scrap of paper and is utterly insufficient to resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese problem can only be resolved by China and Japan themselves, and no third-party intervention is allowed.

When the United States formally expressed its attitude, agreeing with the League of Nations' opinion, and determining that Japan's actions this time violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and criticized it, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on October 9, sophistically claiming that the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was initiated by the unlawful shooting of Chinese troops and was entirely a measure of self-defense. The August 13 Shanghai Incident was due to China's violation of the 1932 Ceasefire Agreement. What Japan demanded was that China abandon its anti-Japanese war strategy and coordinate with Japan, with no territorial ambitions. China's use of force to reject Japan is truly a violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

Regarding whether to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty conference convened by the League of Nations, it has been reserved. Newspapers are desperately promoting the refusal to participate. Recent news has come that although the military still insists on refusing to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty conference, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to participate. News from the Havas News Agency in Paris on the 16th said that Japan may allow attendance, but we should note that even if Japan attends the Nine-Power Treaty conference, its motive is entirely to undermine the existence of the Nine-Power Treaty and not to uphold it. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun on the 11th repeatedly emphasized that the Nine-Power Treaty had become a dead letter after its conclusion and that peace in the Far East had far exceeded the new stage that could be guaranteed by simply abiding by the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, it advocated outright rejection, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on the 9th showed a lack of decisiveness by being reserved. The newspaper also claimed that even if it attended the meeting, it should advocate the abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty, or at least respond to it with a major revision. A dispatch from the Tokyo Alliance on the 19th stated that the Asahi still believed that there was no need to convene the Nine-Power Conference. If the purpose of the meeting was to study the causes of unrest in the Far East and find ways to eliminate them, Japan might take the opportunity to make the following statements: ㊀ The Nine-Power Treaty does not conform to the current state of affairs. ㊁ China's policy of exclusively excluding a certain country must be condemned. ㊂ China's violations of the clauses and resolutions passed by the Washington Conference must be exposed. For the above purposes, Japan may participate in the meeting. If Japan attends the Nine-Power Treaty conference, its purpose is generally as described by the Asahi, to demand the abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty. This is something our people cannot ignore.

㊄ Japan's Anti-British and American Movement

The atrocities of Japanese planes killing Chinese non-combatants and bombing undefended cities have aroused widespread attacks from world public opinion. Not only does Japan not reflect on its actions in the slightest, but it also retaliates. Various newspapers have published inhumane acts by Britain and the United States against people of color, with the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun being particularly fierce. Tokutami Soho, a veteran of the Japanese press, former president of Kokumin Shunbun, and current guest of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, wrote an article on October 12, saying that Britain and the United States not only do not thank Japan for punishing the Reds on their behalf but also do not investigate the reasons or examine the truth. They call Japan inhumane and criticize Japan as an aggressor, which is extremely ignorant and imprudent.

The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun on the 12th published a lengthy special article with the headline "Aerial Bombardment of Demilitarized Zones: Cunning Britain Takes the 'Lead'," and the sub-headline "Looking Left and Right While Talking About Other Things, Exposing Its Own Contradictions to the World." This article emphasized that Britain was the one who reached out to invade China and showed the world the model of bombing demilitarized zones.

The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, one of Japan's two major newspapers, launched such a malicious counterattack against Britain, showing that it not only does not reflect on the cruelty of its own aircraft but also cannot accept the good words of world opinion. Japan is acting entirely on its own. Will there be a day when it regrets its actions?

㊅ Japan's Suppression of Speech

The suffocation of Japan's media has been going on for a long time. The fact that Dr. Minobe, a scholar of law and politics, suffered because of the "Emperor Organ Theory" should still be in the memory of the people. The number of magazines and books censored in Japan is staggering.

After the outbreak of the war, it goes without saying that the Japanese rulers intensified their suppression of speech, and the irrationality of their suppression is both laughable and infuriating. War reports, of course, cannot be published without being censored by the military. Even photos transported from the front by plane must be marked with the words "Inspected by the Ministry of the Army" and "Inspected by the Ministry of the Navy." The most troublesome thing about war reports is the large amount of censorship. For example, "The XX unit led XX people to attack XX place on a certain day at a certain time." What can readers know from such a pile of censorship? Even the location where telegrams are sent must be represented by censorship. For example, "Shanghai XX Telegram from the Allied News Agency" and "XX Telegram from the Allied News Agency on the Jinpu Line." It is truly ridiculous.

If war reports are like this, then speech can be imagined. Every day, the editorials in newspapers and the essays in magazines, in addition to following the military in shouting about punishing China, are doing their best to maliciously and degradingly expose China's weaknesses. Photos of bound feet, opium, and smoking lamps have reappeared in Japanese newspapers, and more progressive people have even disappeared from newspapers and magazines, let alone hear their opinions. Intellectuals across the country are silent, trembling with fear. Occasionally, when discussing national affairs in public places such as barbershops, bathhouses, and cafes, if there is news that is unfavorable to the Japanese army, they are immediately arrested and punished for spreading rumors. Even "China expert" Asataro Goto was arrested by the military police and sentenced to one and a half years in prison for criticizing the war's inability to establish a great cause in a speech at the Meiji Seitoku Memorial Hall. Tamaki Tsuguru, the editor of "Constellation" magazine, traveled to Shanghai before the summer vacation and corresponded with Chinese writers such as Wang Raorao after returning to Japan. He was arrested by the Japanese police for making anti-war remarks in a lecture somewhere, and the publisher of "Constellation" was also implicated. This is just one example. It is not known how many others have been convicted and imprisoned for their writings.

### Postponement of Government Bond Delivery

Proposed extension to February next year; submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval

The public bond account of the Securities Exchange was previously facing difficulties in handling delivery. Representatives from the Exchange's board of directors, the brokers' association, and official and commercial banks were selected to hold joint meetings. After several consultations, an understanding was reached, and it was decided to postpone the delivery to February next year. Regarding the interest subsidy issue during the postponement, an intermediate approach was agreed upon, with the next bond interest issued by the Ministry of Finance going entirely to arbitrageurs with short positions. (According to usual practice, the Ministry of Finance should issue interest of three yuan at the end of January next year, deducting income tax of one and a half cents, resulting in an actual receipt of two yuan and eighty-five cents, which corresponds to a monthly interest rate of slightly more than eight percent from September to the end of January next year.) At the same time, it was added that if the war ends early and the market recovers, an interest subsidy of one percent per month will be provided. The draft has been ratified by the brokers' assembly and is currently being submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval, but no reply has been received to date.

### The Agricultural and Commercial Bank of China (ACBC) Continues to Handle Agricultural Loans in Various Provinces and Cities

Except for provinces in war zones, which are temporarily suspended

The Vice Presidents of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank of China (ACBC), Qian Xinzhi and Wang Zhixin, have not yet officially assumed their positions. The resignation of President Chen Zhenxian has been approved, and He Lian has succeeded him. For agricultural lending in safe areas in various provinces and cities, such as agricultural warehouse loans, transportation and sales loans, and agricultural product exchange, operations will continue as usual and will not be suspended due to the impact of the war. However, various agricultural loans in provinces in war zones have been unavoidably suspended temporarily.

### The Chinese Women's Occupational Association Will Hold Its General Meeting Today

The Shanghai Chinese Women's Occupational Association is scheduled to hold its general meeting at 2 p.m. on the 24th to report on the work of various groups over the past two months, discuss important association affairs, and hold the graduation ceremony for the second nursing class. The association's publicity group also plans to perform programs, welcoming members and non-members to participate actively.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: Having just read in the news section of your newspaper that yesterday at 11 o'clock, the Huachang Match Factory on San Guantang Road, Xinma Road, was hit by two sulfur bombs dropped by enemy planes, causing a fierce fire, etc., I find that the facts are completely incorrect. What was bombed and destroyed yesterday was a Chinese-made raw material factory in a mud-walled enclosure in Pudong. Our factory is still safe. I am concerned that the spread of misinformation will lead to inaccuracies. I am therefore writing to request a correction to reflect the actual situation. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely, Huachang (October 23rd)

### The Enemy Is Attacking with All Its Might, and Fierce Bloody Battles Are Unfolding on All Fronts

On the Shanghai-Taicang Road front, we are holding the line at Fengjiazhai. A fierce battle raged all night in Chenjiaxiang, with heavy losses on both sides. The enemy attacked Guangfu Shixianggong Temple but was repelled by our forces.

Our newspaper received a front-line battle report this afternoon stating that from last night to this morning, the enemy forces, using their substantial naval, land, and air power, launched a fierce attack on our forces in multiple directions west of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway and south of the Yunzaobang River, aiming for Dachang and Zhenru. The main force was divided into two routes: one advanced southward along the east and west sides of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, using dozens of tanks and taking advantage of the highway's convenience, with a brigade of infantry, under intense artillery fire, attacking despite our army's rain of bullets. Our army rose up to counterattack, and a fierce battle raged all night. Countless enemies were sacrificed under our firepower. By dawn this morning, enemy planes had again come out to bomb our front at the positions around Maqiaozhai, which was largely destroyed, and we had to retreat to the line at Fengjiazhai and Hujiazhai, relying on solid fortifications. This morning at around 8 a.m., a fierce battle was still underway near the south side of Maqiaozhai. The other route was from the direction of Dunwusi and Zhu Sanfang, launching a fierce attack westward along the Yunzaobang River. The enemy forces on this route were also equipped with approximately two regiments of troops, with small tanks as the vanguard, charging our positions under extremely heavy artillery cover. Our army also launched a fierce counterattack in multiple directions. From last night to this morning, a bloody battle raged all night without stopping for a moment. The casualties on both sides in this battle were extremely heavy, so corpses were scattered everywhere and blood flowed into rivers in the area near Chenjiaxiang. At dawn this morning, our army finally withdrew from the Chenjiaxiang position to the Lujiatou to Qianzhai and Wotouqiao line due to heavy casualties and a disparity in numbers, awaiting an opportunity to counterattack. As for the fighting in the Huanggang and Hulizhai areas, although it was not as intense as in the two areas mentioned above, our army had to retreat as well because the positions of the left and right armies had shifted. They are now blocking the line at Jiejingzhai, Shengjiazhai, and Majiazhai. The enemy east of Guangfu Town also attacked in several routes last night. Our army, because the villages of Nanbei Meizhai, Shizhai, and Daizhai, which had just been recovered, had not yet been able to rush to build fortifications and had no danger to defend, retreated to the positions around Guangfu Town. Because the fortifications there are strong, the original positions and lines of defense have not changed. According to military sources, although the enemy has sent heavy troops and spared no major sacrifices, attempting to take Dachang in one fell swoop, our army has extremely strong fortifications on the Dachang line and is stationed with substantial forces. If the enemy advances further, they will suffer a major blow. It is expected that there will be an unprecedented main battle in the next few days.

### Artillery Battles Raged All Night on Both Sides of the Highway

We have set up strong fortifications and are waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.

A Central News Agency (CNA) military reporter with the troops in Jiangwan reported at 12:00 noon on the 24th that artillery fire was intense on both sides of the Liuhang-Dachang highway south of the Yunzaobang River and did not stop all night. Our army also returned fire with heavy artillery. The front lines from Guangfu, Chenjiahang, and Gejiapailou to Maqiaozhai east of the highway were all shrouded in artillery fire. The enemy and our army were both fighting to the death, and the battle raged all night. First, our strongholds in Chenjiahang, Maqiaozhai, Luzhai, and Gaorenqiaozhai were broken through by the enemy. The Xinmuqiao and Shiqiao areas in front of Guangfu, which we had recovered through counterattacks, were too exposed, so they were voluntarily withdrawn to their original positions. The entire line from Chenjiahang to Maqiaozhai was attacked bravely by our army, with mutual advances and retreats. However, the enemy repeatedly attacked and focused on holding the breakthrough points. Because our counterattack had not made progress, we immediately set up strong fortifications on the spot, waited in strict formation, and waited for an opportunity to counterattack.

### Enemy Artillery Bombs Our Guangfu Position

Covering infantry advances, which were repelled by our forces.

A Central News Agency (CNA) military reporter with the troops in Guangfu reported at 10:30 a.m. on the 24th that from last night until this morning, the enemy forces shelled our positions along the entire line north and south of the Luodian-Jiading highway and Guangfu with intense artillery fire. Three to four hundred enemy soldiers, under the cover of artillery fire, launched several fierce attacks on our positions in front of Xiaojiazhai. Our army responded calmly and killed many enemies, but the enemy ultimately did not succeed. The artillery fire gradually stopped at dawn.

### Our Forces and the Enemy Exchange Fire on Xiangyin Road

A Central News Agency (CNA) military reporter with the troops in Jiangwan reported at 12:00 noon on the 24th that yesterday evening, many enemy tanks were active in formations on Xiangyin Road. Our army was on high alert. At about 2 a.m. this morning, the enemy did indeed cover three companies of infantry to attack. We attacked from the East-West Sports Association Road, using machine guns to form a network of fire to press the enemy. Back and forth, the battle lasted until 6 a.m., when both sides retreated to their original positions.

### The Enemy Repeatedly Attacked Zhabei But All Attacks Were Unsuccessful

A Central News Agency (CNA) military reporter with the troops in Zhabei reported at 12:30 noon on the 24th that at 3:00 a.m. this morning (the 24th), approximately two companies of the enemy attacked Dongbaoxing Road and Qiujiang Road. Our army bravely met the enemy and charged onto North Sichuan Road, joining the sentries stationed at various alleyways, and夹击 the enemy with machine guns and direct-fire cannons. The enemy gradually became unable to withstand it and retreated at 6:30 a.m. In addition, more than two hundred enemies attacked from the 63 Garden at 1:30 a.m., attempting to spy on our Baziqiao position. Our army confronted the enemy along both banks of the Yokohama Creek, killing many enemy sentries. At about 4:30 a.m., the enemy's main force continued to attack south. Our army also bravely charged out and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, killing nearly a hundred enemies. By dawn, the enemy had ultimately failed to succeed.

### Enemy Planes Continue to Carry Out Atrocities in All Directions

Starting at 6:15 a.m. this morning, many enemy planes, in the midst of thick fog, took off from the Yangshupu area and headed northwest in succession, totaling approximately more than thirty planes. At 7:30 a.m., three enemy giant planes circled over Zhabei and the Public Concession, with their target seemingly being the North Railway Station. They dropped heavy bombs four times, three each time, all landing at Yifuli, Laianli, the Qiujiang Road railway crossing, and Shengshunli. They escaped at around 8 a.m. At 8:45 a.m., three more enemy planes came, dropping six times, three bombs each time, landing in the vicinity of Xinmin Road East and Gonghe Xin Road and Zhongxing Road. The enemy planes left at 9:40 a.m. During this time, two enemy giant planes in the northwest flew back to Yangshupu. When passing through Zhabei, they were attacked by our army with anti-aircraft artillery. One plane was forced to fly low and escape. At 9:50 a.m., three more enemy planes came, also dropping six times, three bombs each time, landing at Xinmin Road, Yipinli on Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road South of the railway, and Baoshan Road North Renchunli and Yifuli and the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Baoshan Road. The above enemy bombs were not only of varying sizes, but also mixed with incendiary bombs and explosive bombs. However, most of them fell into the mud and rubble, without causing any loss.

At dawn this morning, eight or nine enemy planes took off from Songkou one after another to reconnoiter over Pudong, the South City, and the western part of Shanghai, and carried out indiscriminate bombing and low-altitude strafing in Zhoujiaqiao, Chenjiaqiao, and Qiuqiao in the western part of Shanghai. This went on continuously, dropping thirty to forty bombs until noon, without leaving the area. However, most of the enemy bombs fell in the fields, so the losses were minimal. Whether any residents were injured remains to be investigated and reported. As for Pudong, around 8 a.m., seven enemy planes flew to the Tangqiao Township area to reconnoiter and strafed at low altitude with machine guns. At around 8 a.m., one bomb was dropped, also falling in the fields and not exploding.

At about 6 a.m. this morning, two enemy planes again carried out atrocities in Pudong. One bomb landed at Dong Yangjiazhai, injuring Wu Kecai, and one bomb landed at Wangtang, east of Yangjing, injuring Jin Chuan and Zhang Linsheng. In addition, enemy planes fiercely bombed the Catholic Church in Zhangjialou Town in Nanhui yesterday afternoon. Three land-based planes and two seaplanes came, circling in turn, dropping a total of fourteen bombs. Because the targeting was inaccurate, most of the bombs fell in the west of the town, destroying two buildings and forty-two flat houses. The Catholic Church itself was also hit by a bomb, destroying three houses and the roof of the cross, which has also tilted. The large general store of Mr. Qu, a local gentry in the Yangjing District, was also completely destroyed. The town, which is a small town relatively far from Pudong, has suddenly suffered this disaster and has become half rubble. In addition, Zhangjiangzha Town, north of Yuanbei in Nanhui, was also hit by a bomb yesterday afternoon, injuring only a farmer, Lu Zitao.

### Our Artillery Bombs the Enemy's Ammunition Depot

The fire is fierce and cannot be contained.

The Shanghai Machine Ice Factory at the intersection of Tang En Road and Diswei Road was hit by our artillery fire at 8:30 a.m. this morning, causing a fire. A large amount of enemy ammunition was stored in the factory, so after the fire started, there were violent explosions, which could not be contained. The Public Concession Fire Brigade went to the scene to rescue at risk upon hearing the news, but the fire had not been completely extinguished by 1 p.m., indicating the fierceness of the fire.

### The Enemy Deploys Artillery Positions in Eastern Shanghai

According to people coming from the Yangshupu area, the enemy is now deploying artillery positions in the area of the Jilin Road Huishan Park. Most of the artillery used was just transported from Sasebo yesterday. There are six cannons with a caliber of four inches, and more than ten cannons with smaller calibers. The cannons are brand new and seem to have been recently manufactured. It is said that their intention is to attack our Chendi in Pudong and Zhabei.

### The Enemy Continues to Transport Bullets and Fuel

At about 6 a.m. today (the 24th), another enemy transport ship, the Shiritoko, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the northern pier of the China Merchants Bureau, carrying more than a thousand boxes of bullets and a large amount of coal. In addition, four transport ships converted from enemy merchant ships that have sailed to Shanghai, the Xishanmaru, Wakumaru, Ryukomaru, and Chikugomaru, are docked at the Huangpu, Osaka, and Huishan wharves and have not yet sailed out. This morning, a large number of shells, fuel, feed, and other military supplies continued to be unloaded ashore.

### A Night Record in the Army (Part 2)

— Huai Qing

"The meals of the troops on the battlefield are really simple. They only eat two meals in 24 hours, one in the evening and one at dawn. Everyone below the battalion commander is the same. As for the dishes, that's even more out of the question. The soldiers all have their own food supplies. The best food is dried radish. Our army is used to enduring hardship. Two meals a day are enough to keep them alive. When the war is tense, meals cannot be delivered. It is not uncommon to go without food for two or three days. Eating is done by company or platoon. After the rice is cooked, it is distributed to the front. About ten people in a company are responsible for delivery."

"Sleep depends entirely on the situation of the war. When things are tight, they can only steal time to take turns napping. Usually, of course, they can sleep soundly. The war always has times when it stops. That's the time for eating, resting, and sleeping. The enemy is the same. And they still stipulate the time for eating and sleeping as usual, so when it comes to noon and dinner, the enemy must be in a state of rest. They need to sleep fully at night. So the enemy comes out during the day and rests at night; we rest during the day and come out at night. Make it impossible for the enemy to sleep peacefully, which is deeply painful."

"In short, fighting in Shanghai is very convenient and comfortable. We used to be in Gansu. We had to march on foot, walking ten miles per hour and one hundred and ten or twenty miles per day. There was no water in dozens of miles of ground, and a small pot of water was not enough to eat. That was really hard!"

"Report, the Chief of Staff is here!" The guard interrupted Secretary Nang's words.

The short and 精悍 Chief of Staff walked in from outside and sat on the seat vacated by Secretary Nang.

"You guys are working hard. We are here to delay your official business. I'm very sorry. The situation on the front line is very good today, isn't it?"

"The front is fighting very well. The fighting on the xxx side is very fierce today. Our cannons are the newest type, that is. They are the same caliber as the enemy's, but our range is longer and the power is greater. Today, more than a dozen enemy planes came to our positions to scout, and were repelled by our anti-aircraft guns."

"They are very afraid of our new weapons. One word expresses great confidence."

"Also, the cannons on many enemy ships in the Huangpu River and the land cannons cannot beat our machine guns in Pudong. Every time they concentratedly bombarded the place where we made machine gun sounds, but they couldn't hit it. As soon as the cannon sound stopped, our machine guns rang again, making them confused."

The guard brought out bowls of steaming fresh milk. While drinking, they bit into 葉西點. Some were chatting, and some were writing quickly on paper with pencils. "Report to the Chief of Staff, the Commander is coming soon!" The tone was very urgent, and everyone's emotions suddenly became tense. At this time, everyone was imagining how to be a great soldier.

"The Commander is here!" About ten minutes later, a tall and sturdy senior officer bearing a major mission, followed the guard's report, stepped over the threshold, and then bowed to us and said kindly, "Sorry for not greeting you sooner! Sorry for not greeting you sooner!"

In the dim candlelight, the Commander's魁偉 became more prominent. His face was round and brown, his eyes were sharp, and his tone was soft, but it concealed a sense of determination. He was wearing a yellow斜布 military uniform, which showed the state of being 戎馬倥偬. This outfit was simply indistinguishable from the rank of a small soldier.

"We are sorry to be hindering the Commander's official business!"

"Don't mention it. It is a great honor to have you all here."

The Commander was a very健談 man, talking endlessly, especially answering many questions we raised in great detail. We talked for a long time (for details, please read this newspaper's "A Certain Officer's Talk on War" on the 17th. I will omit the details here.) Seeing that it was getting late and we had to return to work, we said goodbye and left.

Mr. Shen Jianhong said, "This is exactly the model of a soldier that I have always idealized."

Walking out, we suddenly heard a "Password!" from behind. We stopped in surprise and turned our heads to see a brother quickly grab an unidentified person. barefoot. Wearing a long military cotton coat.

"Who are you?" The tone was rapid and severe.

"I am from the xxx Division," he looked very timid.

"Do you have a symbol?"

"…………"

We helped search him, but found nothing.

"What are you doing here?"

"…………"

"Take him in!"

"Go!"

On the way back, we wondered if this unidentified person was a traitor!

### Zhang, Battalion Commander of Su Village, Died for His Country

He Took the Lead and Charged into Enemy Territory, Sacrificing Himself for His Country; All Officers and Soldiers of the Entire Division Wept Upon Hearing the News

Since our Army's XXX Division participated in the Battle of Shanghai and Nanjing Line against Japan, all officers and soldiers have been determined to sacrifice themselves for the country. Since February, they have fought bravely against the enemy, and the enemy has never been able to enter the division's position. On the 19th of last month, the enemy attacked Su Village with the superior force of three squadrons. Zhang Yimo, the battalion commander of the division, was ordered to fight the enemy with one company. Battalion Commander Zhang took the lead in a bayonet charge, advancing and retreating three times. Our rear reinforcements joined the battle in time, and the three enemy squadrons were completely defeated. Dozens of rifles, more than 70,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, two light and heavy machine guns each, and countless other spoils of war were seized. However, Battalion Commander Zhang, who bravely killed the enemy, was unfortunately shot in the head by an enemy machine gun 30 meters into the enemy's position and died. All officers and soldiers of the division wept for him. Battalion Commander Zhang was from Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, and a graduate of the Huangpu Military Academy. It is said that his parents are still alive, and he left behind a widow and young children.

### Japan Intensifies Air Force Training

Remarks by Chen Cipou, Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan

After the Battle of Shanghai, our heroic air force displayed great power and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese air force. The Japanese government and public were greatly shocked. Therefore, they are now working hard to strengthen air force education. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency recently interviewed Chen Cipou, the supervisor of students studying in Japan, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Japan. According to Chen, after being stimulated by the recent Battle of Shanghai, the entire nation of Japan has intensified air force education, cultivated air force talents, and strengthened air force combat effectiveness. The situation is as follows: ㊀ The University of Tokyo and the National Aviation Research Association have established aviation courses, etc., and recently decided to greatly expand them. Aviation classes will be added to all universities across the country, such as Tohoku University, Osaka University, and various higher industrial schools, to create new air force talents. The budget for this has been approved by the Japanese government, and the schools are actively preparing to implement it uniformly starting in April of next year. ㊁ Various universities are researching various military weapon technologies and theories separately. For example, the famous Doctor of Science, Kotaro Honda, presides over Tohoku University, researching the aviation machinery material department to improve aviation machinery. ㊂ Many private aviation schools have been established. Now they are all increasing the number of volunteer aviators. Local people's organizations are doing their best to promote aviation movements to arouse people's aviation enthusiasm. Anyone with a primary school education can join the volunteer aviators and enjoy free treatment to universally cultivate aviation talents.

### Two Silk Factories North of the Suzhou Creek Resume Work

Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, such as those in Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, etc., have mostly stopped work due to the impact of the war. Only the Yihua factory on North Chengdu Road in the Shanghai International Settlement has resumed work independently. Overseas sales of Chinese silk in European and American markets have decreased significantly, and the price of high-grade silk is 750 national currency. However, Japanese silk is also in the same situation in European and American markets. As for domestic sales, there is no trade because the silk factories are closed. The price of cocoons has also fallen, with high-grade dry cocoons falling from 220 yuan per dan to 180 yuan. At the same time, various silk manufacturers plan to resume work in the silk factories in the concession area north of the Suzhou Creek because the cocoons they have stored are not easy to sell. The working hours are from 5:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Two companies have successfully organized: ㊀ The Fenghua Silk Company's silk reeling factory is scheduled to resume work on the 26th. ㊁ The Heyu Silk Factory will resume work as soon as the machinery is repaired.

### Frequent Ships Make the Shanghai-Ningbo Route Smooth

100,000 People from Ningbo Recently Left the Country

Since the launch of the New Beijing and Ende ships from Shanghai to Ningbo, they have carried more than 100,000 people from Ningbo out of the country. However, because the Ningbo Fellow Association has advised against it, there are very few passengers coming to Shanghai from Ningbo. In addition, the Lisheng ship will depart from Shanghai to Fujian tomorrow (15th), carrying a group of refugees from Fujian who have taken refuge in Shanghai back to their hometown.

### Cotton Vests

The Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps of this city, entrusted by the City Comfort Association, has raised no less than 50,000 cotton vests, which have been completed one after another and sent to the Comfort Association for transfer to the front lines. It is reported that the Second District Corps of the Corps has raised as many as 30,434 pieces, and five Boy Scouts, including Qin Zhongyao, Lu Bingzhang, Ying Zhongjie, Lu Jingxian, and Liu Mingchuan, have raised more than 1,000 pieces each, with outstanding achievements and commendable enthusiasm. The superiors will give them honorary awards to encourage them.

Xiang Sheng Automobile Company recently delivered 1,360 yuan to the local association to make 2,000 cotton vests for transfer to the front lines. The association sent them to the Dafeng Military Uniform Company to make them, and also made 2,000 labels, which were sewn on the left front pocket of the cotton vests to indicate the source of the donation and express gratitude.

Since the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School in this city moved to its new location and started school this semester, the number of students has reached more than 700. Recently, the acting principal, Gu Fengcheng, has painstakingly planned and made considerable progress in various facilities. He has also hired Jin Guangmei as the director of training to lead the students together. The student-organized wartime service corps is actively engaged in rear work and is making every effort to promote the three major movements. They are already fundraising for national salvation bonds, and each student is making a cotton vest herself. They have also raised 1,000 first-aid kits. In addition, they are voluntarily sewing all the cold-weather clothing for the soldiers at the front donated by all sectors of society. If they are entrusted by all sectors of society, they will be very welcome. Please send them directly to the school.

### (Brief Commentary)

After the enemy occupied Tianjin and Beijing, they are now brewing a puppet autonomous organization, hoping to use "accomplished facts" to lobby diplomatically. In a time of full-scale resistance, occasionally occupied places cannot be considered accomplished facts. Because victory and defeat are common occurrences in war. Occasional victories can also be occasional defeats. Occasional losses can also be occasional gains. How can they be considered accomplished facts?

The so-called "accomplished facts" is inherently untenable. For example, thieves steal people's property. After they have stolen it, they declare to people that this is their acquired right and an accomplished fact. Is there any reason for this? If so, there is no use for police and everything code can be discarded.

### On the Way to Shanxi (1)

— Shi Ren

On the Jinpu Line

In the drizzling rain, the train left Pukou and disappeared into the thick clouds. Before arriving at Puzhen, I encountered many refugee trains, but the carriages I was riding in were first-class bedrooms or first-class dining cars, which made the reporter feel a kind of satirical meaning.

Originally, it would take nine hours to reach Xuzhou from Pukou, but now, due to heavy traffic, it took more than fifteen hours. The reason for this was not due to the reduction in the speed of the train, but because of waiting for oncoming emergency trains. Therefore, before the construction of double tracks on the national trunk lines, this phenomenon is unavoidable.

Along the Jinpu Line, there is generally a good harvest, and the same is true in Anhui, which could not but make the reporter nod in congratulation. However, according to the farmers who boarded the train at the stations along the way, it is difficult to see a good harvest of agricultural products, and they feel quite troubled due to the stagnation of sales and transportation. The reporter believes that the government authorities or the banking industry must provide them with the convenience of large-scale purchases or mortgages. Because in the current long-term war of resistance plan, food is not only the lifeline of the militia, but also the foundation for the stability of the current rural areas. If the phenomenon of "killing the cheap and hurting the farmers" occurs again, the blow to the rural areas is self-evident, and there is also a great possibility of shaking the foundation of the entire war of resistance. Therefore, for the sake of stabilizing the rural areas, it is hoped that the government will make appropriate adjustments to this year's good harvest.

The train arrived in Xuzhou at more than seven o'clock in the evening. At the station, it was possible to find traces of the Japanese bombing in recent days. However, because the Railway Bureau was conscientious in its work, it was able to repair the tracks immediately after the bombing, so as not to interrupt traffic. Moreover, for the safety of passengers in recent days, they have tried their best to have the trains depart as soon as they arrive, so as to avoid the devastation of the Japanese planes, which is the kindness of the people in charge of the Xuzhou station.

According to a person at the station, although Xuzhou suffered great losses, it was far less than Lianyungang. The construction of the port has been almost destroyed. Observing its attempts, it is not only the so-called attempt to land, but also to destroy China's hard-won construction projects and disrupt the rear. This kind of vicious skill is the specialty of the Japanese!

On the Longhai Line

After arriving in Xuzhou, the reporter rested for a while and boarded the slow train to Chang'an. The train was full of passengers. Before the train reached Dangshan Station, the conductor asked the reporter to get off at Dangshan and wait for a blue steel-skinned train in the evening, because the blue steel-skinned train was not only able to catch up with this slow train, but also comfortable and spacious. Therefore, the reporter listened to the conductor's well-intentioned advice and got off at Dangshan, a famous place for pears.

At Dangshan Station, there was also a student going to Northeast University in Si'an who got off the train with me. The two of us quietly waited in the waiting room, which aroused the suspicion of the local police. After a luggage inspection and identity investigation, they found that the reporter was carrying Japanese books and two or three Japanese camphor pills. Thinking that the reporter was a traitor, they were asked to go to the bureau chief's office. Fortunately, the bureau chief was a man of understanding, and there were also two League Department cadres. After looking at some identification documents of the reporter, they politely released me and explained their difficulties to me. According to the police chief, in recent days, bandits have been occurring in the area bordering Jiangsu and Henan. These bandits neither kidnap people nor rob, but specialize in propaganda work. They are one of the traitor organizations taught by the Japanese. Their lies are that a great chaos is coming and that the True Destiny Lord has descended to earth, etc., to disturb the people in the rear. These bandits mostly wear markers: the reporter has seen two types, one is copper with the size of a two-corner silver coin, and the other is the same size and material, but engraved with an image of a Taoist holding a sword and holding a gourd on his back, and the reverse side is a spell. This Taoist image was somewhat similar to the Buddha image in one of my Buddhist books, which aroused suspicion of me.

Regarding this unexpected embarrassment, the reporter not only did not feel any displeasure, but also admired the efforts of the local military and government in cracking down on foreigners. So, while hating the traitors' pervasiveness, I braved the cold night and waited for the express train to Zhengzhou to arrive.

On the Pinghan Line

Zhengzhou Railway Station was crowded with refugees, most of whom were retreating from the Pinghan Line, because the loss of Baoding shocked the war situation in Pinghan.

After boarding the slow train on the Pinghan Line, I saw an infinitely chaotic scene: especially the comings and goings of soldiers at stations along the way added to the chaos on the train.

In the next carriage, I suddenly discovered an old friend, Mr. So-and-so, who was a classmate of the reporter in Tianjin. Now he has given up his final year of planning at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and gone to the front line XXX to do some work. The two of us thought of the fact that we were still gathering happily in Tokyo last month, but today we are both leaving our homes and relatives and embarking on our respective journeys to save our dying motherland, which is truly filled with infinite emotion.

### The Enemy on the Jinpu Line Front Retreats Sharply

Our Army Advances in Victory; Jinan City is Stable

Correspondence from Jinan: Since the fall of Tianjin and Beijing, the enemy has advanced aggressively along the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Hankou lines. For the past two months, their momentum has been very strong. Taking the Tianjin-Pukou Line as an example, they have advanced hundreds of miles from Tianjin across Dezhou. More recently, they have crossed Pingyuan and forced Yuancheng, less than a hundred miles from Jinan, separated only by the Yellow River, a narrow strip of water. Enemy planes have been bombing wildly every day, turning the stations south of Jinan and north of Xuzhou into scorched earth. People from all sides have been worried about Jinan, a large and isolated city, being separated from the stubborn enemy, and many have feared for its safety. However, Han Fuju, the commander-in-chief of the Third Army Group, remained calm, calmly deployed, and dispatched surprise troops, and was finally able to turn danger into safety. Now, the main force is advancing north across the Tuhai River and has recovered Pingyuan. Sangyuan in Dezhou is also within our grasp. The process is described as follows:

The Situation on the Front Line

The enemy crossed the Old Yellow River from Dezhou and invaded south. Pingyuan fell. On the 16th of this month, they advanced to the north of Yuancheng Station, which was the most tense period of the war. However, the enemy's isolated army penetrated deep, and their strength was only on the railway. There were no traces of the enemy within thirty miles on either side of the railway. Such a strategy is considered the most dangerous move by military strategists. Therefore, our army adopted a large-scale flanking strategy on the right flank. They led their troops forward from Lingxian, and the guerrilla forces of so-and-so and so-and-so suddenly attacked Nanpi and Dongguang. Our main force, led by so-and-so, the division commander, crossed the Tuhai River on a pontoon bridge and advanced on the evening of the 17th, placing the enemy's rear and left flank (that is, our right flank) under heavy threat. They had no choice but to retreat sharply in order to preserve their strength. Because the enemy's forces on the Jinpu Line, the 10th and 16th Divisions, were not sufficient to be distributed on this hundreds-of-miles long front line, and there was a possibility of being cut off at any time and place. Therefore, they had to rely on bandit and puppet forces. According to investigations, there are about 5,000 people from Dezhou to Yuancheng, all from Li Shouxin's troops, commanded by Li Qian. Except for the artillerymen and those who drive tanks and the platoon leaders of the infantry, who are Japanese, the rest are Koreans and people from the Northeast. From Dezhou to Cangzhou in the north, there is only one regiment of Japanese soldiers. On the 14th of this month, Li's bandit troops, in conjunction with infantry, cavalry, and artillery, attacked our positions north of Yuancheng in the area of Suizhuang and Majiaqiao and were repelled by us. On the 15th, our army fought the enemy four times in close quarters in Cuiweizhai and Yuanjiamiao, killing more than 500 enemies. There was no major battle on the 16th. At night, our army crossed the Tuhai River and advanced to Shiyilimiao, where they came into contact with the enemy and engaged in fierce fighting. On the 17th, the enemy's rear lines in Lianzhen, Dongguang, and Dezhou were repeatedly threatened by our guerrillas, and they retreated sharply. Our main force then launched a large-scale attack, crossing the Tuhai River on a pontoon bridge in Yuancheng, and launched a fierce attack in coordination with our powerful troops who had copied the enemy's actions. The battle was the fiercest in Shiyilimiao and Maojiayuan. The enemy rallied reinforcements from Huangshan and Lijizhai, with more than 2,000 infantry and artillery in the area south of the northern district. The enemy was defeated and retreated. On the 18th, our army recovered the cities of Ningjin and Gaotang along the road, and the front advanced to Pingyuan. There were no traces of the enemy in Pingyuan. The enemy's armored vehicle touched our landmine 15 or 16 miles north of Pingyuan. One train was blown up. It is expected that our army will enter Pingyuan within days and attack Dezhou.

Talks by a High-Ranking Official

A high-ranking official here once spoke to the interviewer about the war on the Jinpu Line. According to his conversation, "I was originally ordered to hold the Zhao River Line, but I could not bear to see the fall of northern Shandong. Therefore, I adopted a step-by-step resistance strategy in the flat military area without any fortifications (that is, northern Shandong). The enemy's combat power is inherently weak, and they only rely on their superior artillery fire. If they are in a place where artillery fire is useless, they will be defeated every time they come into contact. I am determined to use XXX as the final defense line and defend it to the death. As for Jinan, there is still the Yellow River to isolate it, so there is no danger."

Recent Situation in Jinan City

One month ago, the Grain Industry Association, the Money Industry Association, the Cotton Industry Association, and various transactions were in a state of suspension. However, the market was still quiet, and all kinds of daily necessities and shops were operating as usual. However, there were air raid warnings from time to time, and most shops only opened one door. They closed earlier in the evening. Entertainment venues were open as usual, but there were few customers. The Provincial Theater and the Provincial People's Education Hall, together with the Traveling Troupe of Students from Beiping, performed national defense dramas, which aroused the citizens' enthusiastic anti-war sentiments. Since the enemy invaded south along Dezhou and Pingyuan, and Jinan was getting closer and closer to the front line, although many people moved south and east, the market was maintained by the military and police and remained as stable as ever, only slightly more deserted than usual. The prices of food items did not rise sharply, so there was no disturbance. Wounded soldiers retreating from the front were rescued by the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee and various charitable organizations. Although enemy planes were constantly watching, citizens were able to go to the shelters according to regulations every time an air raid warning was issued. All agencies were also working as usual, and there was no panic. With the recent military progress, people's hearts will be more stable. (October 19)

### Telephone Company Refuses to Accept Checks, Threatening Users with Disconnection

After Receiving the Company's Deadline Disconnection Notice, the Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department, Stating that the Company Will Be Responsible for the Losses Caused by the Disconnection

The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Director of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "Regarding public utilities and the payment of taxes, the use of checks is a very common practice. This association checked your department's letter of September 6, which stated, 'Your letter of September 3, regarding the method of payment of fees for users of the Shanghai Power Company and the Water Company, etc., has been received by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and we have paid attention to it.' However, for telephone users of the Shanghai Telephone Company, the company can arbitrarily refuse to accept checks and force them to pay in cash, otherwise they will threaten to disconnect the line. Has your department paid attention to this company? Or is this company considered an exception to the Shanghai Power Company and the Water Company? Furthermore, this association follows the orders of the Ministry of Finance and will naturally pay the company's telephone bills by check. Unexpectedly, the company has repeatedly refused, and now it has even issued a notice to disconnect the line on the 25th of this month. Such an action shows that the company has a lack of cooperation with its users, and your department really needs to pay attention to it. This association must declare that if the company actually disconnects the line on the deadline, then the losses suffered by this association due to the disconnection of the telephone line shall be borne by the company. I am sending you a copy of the company's disconnection notice for your reference and assistance."

### Resistance War Correspondence

— Zhao Bangying

In the all-out war of resistance, publicizing the cause to the masses requires sustained and multifaceted efforts.

Here is a simple and easy method that everyone can do, which is to carry out resistance propaganda in our usual "letter writing," temporarily named "Resistance War Correspondence."

For ordinary literate people, writing letters to friends to inquire about their well-being, and writing letters to family members to report on their recent situation, is almost a routine matter. Naturally, in the midst of enemy bombings, this will not be an exception, and perhaps even more letters will be written – because reporting on the current situation is even more necessary for friends and family.

But in the environment of enemy atrocities, how should these letters reporting well-being be written? I think there is a principle that we must abide by: do not speak discouraging words in the letters, but report more positive and encouraging news. Specifically, when writing family letters, absolutely avoid saying how dangerous you are in the war zone, how uneasy you are, and how bad the environment is, etc. On the contrary, we should tell our family members about "the necessity of China's long-term resistance," that the personal sacrifice for the sake of national survival is not to be regretted, and our confidence in the final victory of the resistance. To friends, we can use more encouraging tones to arouse the other party's resonance and empathy.

If, when writing, you feel that your observation and thinking are not strong enough, then it is best to cut out a section of comments from newspapers and publications, add a few of your own opinions, which is especially beneficial and welcomed by relatives and friends in the mainland. In addition, you can also cut out some pictures and attach them to the letter, which will have even greater power. Those pictures should be:

(1) Exposing the enemy's brutal behavior;

(2) Praising the loyalty and courage of our army;

(3) And all materials showing our country's determination to resist to the end.

At the same time, there are two things that should be especially emphasized to relatives and friends in the mainland: First, I hope that everyone will do their best, stand at their posts, and work hard in their respective jobs in their current locations. Second, they should be advised not to leave their hometowns casually, but on the contrary, everyone should be more actively united in the local area and cooperate with the overall situation of this all-out war of resistance!

I hope that this easy "writing" work – Resistance War Correspondence – will become a widespread mass movement, that everyone will do it automatically, and that everyone will voluntarily make a rule to write at least one letter to relatives and friends a week to do this kind of "propaganda" – making this work a personal habit, until we achieve the "final victory" of our all-out war of resistance.

Here, I hope that intellectuals who have relationships with friends abroad will also do this small job – communicating with foreign friends to promote the resistance! For friends with whom you usually exchange letters, you should emphasize the propaganda of the resistance at this time, especially by attaching some photos to them, which will definitely have a very cordial and grand impact. If you haven't communicated with friends for a long time, take this opportunity to greet them and then report on everything about our resistance. This work is much easier and more economical than going across the ocean to be a special envoy, and at the same time, the materials for daily propaganda are fresh and readily available. I think this approach can be regarded as a kind of national diplomacy, right?

There is also a kind of happy connection method that people usually do, and I think it can be promoted now to make it a "Resistance Propaganda Connection." The method only requires one person to preside over it, draw up a list of recipients, the number is unlimited, but the region should be wide, paying special attention to friends in the mainland. The host will cut and paste a propaganda item every week and send it to the first person on the list, and then forward it in order. This is like a group of friends reading a fresh anti-Japanese publication.

Finally, I want to propose a method that I hope everyone can implement, which is to write letters to comfort the frontline soldiers. The letter will naturally be both comforting and encouraging. Like the recently collected cotton vests, I think those who want to make them might as well make a pocket on them. If the female compatriots who make these cotton vests can write and attach a comforting note in the middle, no matter if you write three or two words or one or two encouraging sentences, as long as it is beneficial to the resistance, we can write something. In addition, now the young men and women students in large, medium and small schools, I hope that they also write a comforting letter every week and send it to the front, or use writing such a comforting letter as a topic in the writing time of middle and small schools, which is also very meaningful. In this kind of letter, what we should say to the frontline soldiers should be:

(1) Report the enemy's atrocities against our rear civilians;

(2) Convey the significance of the rear people supporting the resistance to the end;

(3) Promote the great power of the government's anti-Japanese decision-making;

(4) Cite the sympathy of people around the world for us and their contempt for the enemy.

At the same time, in this letter, attaching a vivid photo of the resistance, a powerful satirical cartoon, or an inspiring quote from a celebrity, I think it must be the ultimate comfort for the soldiers in the frontline artillery fire. Naturally, in the letter, attaching a small souvenir, such as a handwritten painting or calligraphy, or a delicate weaving, are all very meaningful things.

I hope that a group will come out to take on this work of the comforting letter movement recently, and it will definitely be more thorough and powerful.

In summary, my meaning is to hope that—

(1) In letters to relatives and friends, do positive resistance propaganda;

(2) People who have foreign friends should do "national diplomacy" resistance propaganda;

Unite friends to form a regular "Resistance Correspondence Connection";

(4) Young students should use writing letters to promote the resistance as a writing topic;

(5) Use the method of communication to comfort the frontline soldiers.

This is a small thing, so it is something that most people can do. The propaganda of the all-out war of resistance needs to be sustained and multifaceted, so let "writing letters" be one of our regular jobs - everyone's regular job!

### Headquarters Protects Commercial Transport

The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, pursuant to the tele உத்தரவு of Commander-in-Chief, established checkpoints on key waterways and roads, strictly prohibiting officials from intercepting commercial goods. As a result, transportation in various industries in the city feels very convenient. Therefore, the circulation of goods is smooth, and the financial sector relies on it to be flexible, and raising national salvation public bonds is also more smooth. It is reported that yesterday alone, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued 171 certificates of shipping goods in accordance with the authority of Article 3, Paragraph 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. The certificate was approved by the Commander-in-Chief and released by the checkpoints to facilitate it. It is heard that Yang, the Commander of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, issued a proclamation in order to protect merchants and follow orders. If the certificate of the Chamber of Commerce is held and there is still a situation of being intercepted and detained, it is allowed to record the symbol of the officer and soldier as much as possible and send it to the Headquarters for investigation and strict identification.
