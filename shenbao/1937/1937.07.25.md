### Japanese Side Attaches Importance to the Attitude of Our Central Authorities

Various Newspapers Observe That There Will Be No New Troubles - Asahi Shimbun Advocates Adjusting National Relations - Nichinichi Shimbun Still Holds a Tough Stance

[Tokyo] Today, the focus here, although still watching whether the 37th Division will completely withdraw on the scheduled date, is paying more attention to Nanjing's attitude. The special telegrams from various newspapers have different observations. Generally speaking, most of them say that there will be no new troubles. The people of Tokyo are becoming more calm. Stocks are still rising, either rising ten or eight yuan, or rising twenty-three or four yuan compared to the lowest price after the incident. The parliament will hold its opening ceremony on the 25th, elect various committees on the 26th, and the ministers of state will give policy speeches on the 27th. The speeches of Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Hirota, and Army Minister Sugiyama on the China issue are most noteworthy. According to reports, Army Minister Sugiyama and Foreign Minister Hirota had important consultations on the night of the 23rd, and are probably secretly discussing fundamental adjustment methods. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)

[Tokyo] Today's Asahi Shimbun editorial is gradually becoming more moderate. After discussing the course of the incident's resolution, it said that the certain doubts of the Chinese side caused by the temporary dispatch of troops will soon disappear and are not a cause for concern. Nanjing's concerns about the loss of national rights and the possibility of being severely restricted in the future for the local resolution have led to the policy of non-recognition, but there is no real cause for concern and can be transformed. From a general point of view, the political and military opposition between China and Japan still exists. If a comprehensive solution is not quickly sought, a long-term opposition is still inevitable. Recently, commentators have said that it is appropriate to strive for fundamental adjustments, and we cannot help but agree. We sincerely hope that the people of both countries will return to calm, first disarm their minds, be open-minded, and cooperate to improve national relations. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)

[Tokyo] The Nichinichi Shimbun's editorial holds the opposite view from the Asahi Shimbun. It first describes the still uneasy situation in North China, and then discusses the tough attitude of the National Government, saying that if the ministry continues to be well-off, the stability of North China that Japan has been looking forward to will not be guaranteed. The transfer is even more likely to lead to a dangerous situation. Since the incident, we have argued that there is no other way but to resolve it with force, and we now feel the need to be more decisive. To establish a peaceful foundation, we must build from the foundation. Sacrificing for lasting peace is truly unavoidable. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)

### Peking University Professors Issue Declaration

Recounting the Atrocities of Japanese Ambitious Militarists; Japan Should Bear Responsibility for Disrupting Peace

[Beiping] All professors of Peking University, today issued a declaration regarding the Lugou Bridge Incident, the text being over a thousand words long, recounting the truth of the Lugou Bridge Incident, declaring to the world the responsibility for disrupting peace. (24th, Special Dispatch)

[Beiping] All professors of Peking University have issued a declaration regarding the Lugou Bridge Incident, which states: "The Chinese nation has always been peace-loving. As early as the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, our ancient sages advocated the great principles of 'stopping war' and 'non-aggression'. For thousands of years, we have always held a principle of settling matters peacefully with our neighbors, treating them with propriety and righteousness, and expecting sincerity and trustworthiness from them. If not for those with the ambition of wolves and the cunning of foxes who plot mischief, we would never bear to meet them with arms. This is commonly known to those who have read Chinese history. Since September 18, 1931, Japan has illegally occupied our four northeastern provinces, forming a puppet organization, forcibly occupying Shanhaiguan, invading the Great Wall, coercing Tianjin and Peiping with violence, interfering with our country's internal affairs, protecting smuggling with armed forces, corrupting China's customs duties, and even more so, condoning vagrants, poisoning North China, sheltering traitors, disturbing local areas, arbitrarily stationing troops within the passes, and forcibly conducting street fighting exercises in the city. Such actions are not what modern countries that respect justice would do. Our government, after the revolution, is working hard to shift power from a minority of violent aggressors to the majority of the people. If Japan's national policy is not determined by adventurous ambitious figures who are gambling everything, but by wise and experienced elders, then friendly relations between China and Japan are not impossible, and peace in East Asia should be increasingly consolidated. Unexpectedly, this hope of ours has become a castle in the air. The Japanese ambitious warlords have become increasingly irrational and arrogant. In mid-October of last year, they unreasonably forced us to withdraw our garrison from Fengtai. On July 7th of this year, they again conducted live-fire exercises near the Lugou Bridge in the middle of the night, attempting to imitate the old trick of attacking our Shenyang, invading our Wanping County seat, in order to control our ancient capital, the cultural center of seven hundred years. After our defending soldiers stopped them, they took the opportunity to provoke, opening fire and bombarding. For two weeks, the Japanese side has not only been untrustworthy, repeatedly violating the agreement of both sides to withdraw troops simultaneously, but also occupying our Beining Railway, transporting heavy troops, invading our farmland, and harming our crops. Within our territory, they have arbitrarily established Japanese military airfields, and in Tianjin, our important northern town, they occupied the station, inspected mail and telegrams, and arrested reporters. To the west, along the Pinghan Railway line, they used machine guns to strafe trains, killing passengers, and forcibly conscripted laborers and requisitioned military supplies everywhere. Relying on force, they bullied the good and honest people. These atrocities are commonly seen and heard by Chinese and foreign people. These atrocities are not only intolerable from the standpoint of our nation, but also intolerable from the standpoint of humanity and justice. Although our nation loves peace, we cannot abandon our duty to defend our country, nor can we sit idly by and watch humanity and justice be destroyed without rising up to protect them. Now, the hope for peace has reached a critical juncture. Our government still adheres to the policy of 'seeking self-preservation and co-existence,' and has always been intent on safeguarding peace. The speech delivered by Chairman Chiang a few days ago has already gained the sympathy of rational people around the world. Whether China and Japan will forge eternal hatred, and whether Japan is willing to be the leader in destroying peace in East Asia, all depends on the attitude of the Japanese government and the actions of the Japanese army. If Japan still does not repent, then we, the whole nation, will have to sacrifice everything and resist to the end. Unfortunately, when that time comes, we will fight to resist violence, to protect our territory, for humanity and justice, for the freedom of mankind, and for the peace of the world. If the majority of mankind has sympathy for maintaining humanity and justice, and has the determination to protect freedom and peace, we are confident that we will eventually achieve final victory. We are engaged in education, and have the responsibility to maintain culture. We are engaged in promoting peace and justice every day. We cannot bear to see our neighbor, of the same script and race, taking the risk of defying the world, to be the first to destroy human culture and disrupt peace in East Asia. We sincerely hope that comrades in the world of culture will jointly help us awaken these Japanese politicians and soldiers in their dreams. If they do not immediately come to their senses and force our peace-loving nation to rise up in resistance, then not only will China and Japan suffer a great calamity together, but the waves of horror throughout the world will also be stirred up from this point on. We are willing to sacrifice ourselves for humanity, for justice, for freedom, and for peace. We only hope that the wise people of the world will recognize that the culprit who destroys peace and destroys culture is Japan, not China. (24th, Central News Agency)

### The Great Path for China to Save Itself and Survive

— Feng Youlan

According to reports, the first general meeting of members of the China Cultural Construction Association closed on the 11th. On the 12th, a declaration was issued, one of the main points of which was: "Agriculture is the foundation of our country. Therefore, agriculture is still the first step for our country to increase production. We should move from a purely agricultural country to a country where agriculture, industry, and commerce develop together." The original text of the declaration has not yet been seen in the north. Let us discuss the few simple sentences quoted here for the time being.

Speaking of the distinction between agriculture and industry, it should only be discussed in terms of the objects of production, not in terms of the methods or tools of production. In terms of the objects of production, agriculture can only be agriculture. In terms of production methods or tools, agriculture can also be industry, because we can use machines to cultivate and produce on a large scale. Anyone who uses machines for large-scale production, we call him industry. Using machines for cultivation to produce on a large scale is called the industrialization of agriculture. Like the United States and the Soviet Union, either they have become industrialized countries, or they are about to become industrialized countries. We say that they are industrialized countries only in terms of their production methods. If we talk about the objects of production, the agricultural products they produce are also not in the minority. In terms of the objects of production, as long as the natural environment permits, no country is unwilling to be a 'country where agriculture, industry, and commerce develop together'. Those who only act as industrialized countries are actually limited by their natural environment. A country without vast fertile land cannot have agriculture. But if we talk about production methods, then there is no such thing as a 'country where agriculture, industry, and commerce develop together', because agriculture has also been industrialized. In terms of production methods, there is no distinction between agriculture and industry. As for commerce, it is not a production system and cannot be compared with agriculture and industry.

The China Cultural Construction Association's so-called 'country where agriculture, industry, and commerce develop together' must be in terms of the objects of production, which is not objectionable in itself. However, generally speaking, people often fail to clarify the distinction between agriculture and industry, thinking that agriculture and industry are always opposed in any respect, which often causes many misunderstandings. Some people are also confused by the saying 'Our country is founded on agriculture', thinking that we seem to be able to do without industry, or without a lot of industry. In order to dispel these mistakes, I would like to further explain this point here.

We often hear people proposing an economic cooperation plan for us. According to this plan, China is an agricultural country and only develops in agriculture. They are industrialized countries and only develop in industry. China exchanges its agricultural products for their industrial products; they exchange their industrial products for China's agricultural products. In this way, the two sides can cooperate economically without conflict. If there is no economic conflict, then other conflicts will naturally disappear. According to the views of those who advocate 'Our country is founded on agriculture', this method also seems to be 'well-founded and reasonable.' But if we really do this, imagine what China will become. China will truly become a supplier of raw materials and a consumer of production for others. A country that is a supplier of raw materials and a consumer of production for a country is exactly a country's, without any discount, complete and authentic colony. The ultimate goal of the political and military suppression of weak nations by modern powers is nothing more than to want the weak nations to permanently be their suppliers of raw materials and consumers of production. We have recently seen that some European countries are demanding a redistribution of colonies or a redistribution of raw materials, the two being different names but the same reality.

If we want not to be a colony, we must catch up quickly and hurry to industrialize. What we are afraid of is that others will not allow us to industrialize. We ourselves must not be influenced by what 'Our country is founded on agriculture' and have some unnecessary doubts and fears about industrialization. In fact, as long as we are industrialized, our agriculture will naturally increase production. There are only purely agricultural countries that often suffer from famine due to natural disasters such as floods and droughts. I have never heard of people in an industrialized country being more foodless than people in a purely agricultural country.

To go a step further, even if industrialization really has many problems, we must have it. Because in the present world, non-industrialized countries have no way to go except to be colonies.

Let's take war as an example. We often hear about war now, but it seems that very few people notice that in the present world, a non-industrialized country is not qualified to talk about formal large-scale warfare. War must use tools, just as economic production must use tools. The war tools of the past were handicraft-style; the war tools of the present are industrial-style. That is to say, war tools are now mechanized, and fighting now is not about using people, but about using machines. Cannons and machine guns are machines; airplanes and tanks are also machines. I think the book Investiture of the Gods is the most superstitious and the most scientific. It is the most scientific because in it, fighting does not rely on people, but on 'magic weapons'. It is the most superstitious because in it, magic weapons come from magic rather than from the application of natural laws. However, in any case, the current war is really like the war in the Investiture of the Gods. If one side offers an airplane, the other side must also offer an airplane, or at least offer many anti-aircraft shells. If one side offers a magic weapon, and the other side has no magic weapon to break it, then no matter how many troops you have, you can only admit defeat. May I ask where these magic weapons come from? Where does a non-industrialized country get these magic weapons?

China's national strength has been growing in recent years, and this is because China is now on the road to industrialization. We have seen the Soviet Union become a world power because of rapid industrialization. We have also seen that Japan has recently announced a new grand plan for further industrialization. It is probably afraid that the Soviet Union and China will catch up, so it will start from the bottom up. This is indeed fundamental. We must industrialize in order to solve China's problems. Our current industrialization is a great path, a unique path, to build a modern country and save it from destruction.

This path, because it is unique, is the path that China, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present, has generally followed intentionally or unintentionally. Although sometimes it detours, it soon turns back, because other roads are broken rivers and dead ends. When it hits a wall, it will naturally come back. However, because it sometimes detours, China's industrialization has lagged behind our neighbors. For example, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was planned in the late Qing Dynasty and was only completed now. This industrial backwardness is the root cause of China's being bullied.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that action is easy but knowledge is difficult, and this can be proven in this regard. China's industrialization can be said to have started in the late Qing Dynasty with Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, Li Hongzhang, Zhang Zhidong and others, but we now have a clear understanding of the meaning of industrialization. Since we know its meaning, we must accelerate its progress, catch up, and never hesitate again, lest we make one mistake after another.

In the Weekly Forum of this newspaper on April 18, Mr. Xu Xusheng had the following criticism of me. He said: 'They advocate that the only problem in China now is the problem of industrialization, which is putting the cart before the horse. Not having a strong interest in the natural world, only paying attention to industrial improvement, will inevitably lead to water without a source, and 'its drying up can be waited for.' Mr. Xu seems not to understand our meaning. We did not say 'The only problem in China now is the problem of industrialization.' We only said that China's only way out is industrialization. To think of this way out, there must naturally be many conditions, and scientization is one of them. Industrialization can include scientization, but scientization cannot include industrialization. Therefore, we only say industrialization.

### The German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact Has No Relationship with the Sino-Japanese Dispute

Berlin Authorities Reiterate Statement; Anglo-Japanese Economic Negotiations Have Been Suspended

[Berlin] Regarding Germany's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute, a statement was issued here today, first stating that Germany is very concerned about the disturbance of political relations between the two major countries in the Far East. Because Germany has no political goals in the Far East, the Sino-Japanese dispute will affect Germany's economic interests. Therefore, Germany hopes to obtain a solution in the Far East as in Europe, guaranteeing economic construction and international trade in goods. The statement also mentioned the declaration issued by the German ambassador to the United States in Washington, and the welcome of world opinion to that declaration. The statement also sternly condemned the report of French radio stations, that Germany and Italy hope that the Sino-Japanese dispute will expand due to the Spanish civil war. Taking the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact as the basis for such slander is a characteristic of propagating Germany's purpose and interests to the world in an irresponsible manner. The German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has absolutely no relationship with the Sino-Japanese dispute. (23rd, National Maritime Telegraph)

### Belgian King Orders Prime Minister to Establish International Economic Research Bureau

Solving Major Economic Problems, Extinguishing the Fire from Underneath to Save Humanity from Slaughter

Brussels: Prime Minister Tsiran, having previously been entrusted by the governments of Britain and France to study the economic conditions of various countries in the world to determine whether it is possible to eliminate various obstacles to international trade, King Leopold III specially sent a long letter to Prime Minister Tsiran for this matter. He proposed the establishment of a permanent International Economic Research Bureau, where many of the most famous economic authorities from various countries would cooperate in their personal capacity, rather than as representatives of their respective governments. The letter also stated: "If we truly want to reduce war and restore peaceful sentiments among people of all countries, then we must have the courage to consider economic issues in their entirety. All major economic problems that threaten the overall stability of the world, such as the allocation of raw materials, exchange rate issues, the distribution of the world's labor force, and maintaining a balance between agricultural and industrial countries, should all be resolved. I deeply feel that the timing for this attempt is quite favorable at the moment, and I believe that this attempt will not only receive the support of governments of various countries, but also of major social, religious, and charitable organizations, and will also bring the world closer together. And we can use this to show all of humanity, especially to people in the East, that we value spiritual power above materialistic attempts." (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)

Brussels: King of Belgium has written to Prime Minister Tsiran, advocating the establishment of an independent international economic organization to solve major problems antagonistic to humanity. The letter stated that current disputes threatening peace cannot be resolved by reducing tax barriers or other partial measures. “If we truly want to avoid war and restore peace of mind to mankind, we must have the determination to use all economic issues to solve all major problems that harm the Tao. The King of Belgium also stated that humans in the world are currently infringing on each other, but if we can find a way to reconcile them, we will contribute to humanity with humaneness. We can also show the people in the East on the facts, not in empty words, that we Westerners value the spiritual strength that comes from friendly and sincere feelings far above direct material interests." The characteristics of the economic research institution to be established in the future are universality, permanence, and independence. Its purpose is to study the various elements of the universal economic institution and adapt them to the ever-changing environment. Furthermore, in order to enable this institution to fulfill its mission, it must strive to be independent from national forces, and create harmony in the world by cooperating with those who are well versed in agriculture, industry, commerce, finance, and labor.

Yesterday, the Minister of Finance gave a speech when attending the annual meeting of the "German Family Association" held in Frankfurt, saying that the government hopes that civil servants will marry in time, and that the government regards late marriage of civil servants as having more disadvantages than advantages. In order to encourage early marriage, the government will grant certain privileges, for example, in the past, the income tax for married men was lower than that for unmarried men. In the future, the government will increase the salaries of married civil servants, regardless of their seniority. In addition, the government will order schools to find ways to reduce education expenses for children. Poor families with four or more children can receive bonuses or subsidies from the government. As of the time of the regulations, a total of 400,000 poor families had received government bonuses, with an average amount of 390 marks.

[London] Regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop visited American Foreign Secretary Eden this morning to discuss ways to break the deadlock. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)

[London] Sources familiar with the situation recently announced that the subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee on Spanish domestic unrest will continue to meet on Monday and Tuesday of next week. The British government will submit a list of questions drawn up by the country's experts for discussion at that time, in order to break the deadlock. The list of questions makes a written request to the relevant countries, asking them to express whether they agree to each article of the compromise plan proposed by Britain on the 14th of this month. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)

[London] Despite Britain's various efforts, the deadlock over the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish domestic unrest has not yet been broken. After three days of private discussions among the parties concerned, opinions on the procedure for carrying out Britain's new proposal remain divergent, as before. Witnessing this deadlock, all sectors of British society feel that procedural issues should not be the cause of the stalemate, and hope that Italy will show more concrete reasons for its shared attitude, or propose its own compromise plan. If Italy does not make any statement on this, then Britain will believe that Italy does not agree with Britain's desire to quickly resolve this issue. The British government will then have to abandon its proposal and adopt a new attitude towards the non-intervention issue. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 24th)

[London] It is now known that the subcommittee of the Committee of Adjustment on Non-Intervention in Spanish domestic unrest will meet on the 26th of this month.

The so-called seven questions are: ㊀ Should inspectors be dispatched to board ships of all countries subject to supervision according to previous methods? ㊁ Should the naval surveillance plan on the Spanish sea surface be abolished? ㊂ If so, should inspectors be dispatched to supervise the ports of West countries? ㊃ Should the land border surveillance plan in the West country be completely restored? ㊄ Should the two parties involved in the civil war in the West country be recognized as belligerent groups, and enjoy the rights of belligerent groups in the sea under their jurisdiction in accordance with the conditions contained in the British compromise plan? ㊅ Should the volunteers from various countries within the borders of the West Country be withdrawn under the supervision of the Supervisory Committee? (VII) Should the British government immediately conduct negotiations with the parties involved in the civil war in the West Country on matters ㊂㊄㊅? Also, Foreign Secretary Eden held talks with French Ambassador Courbin at 6 pm, and the above list of questions was discussed.

### Roosevelt Remains Optimistic After Failure of Judicial Reform Plan

Supreme Court's Interpretation of the Constitution Has Adopted a Broader View

[Washington] President Roosevelt declared today that although his Supreme Court reform plan has failed, this action has already had an intangible effect on judicial reform. Since the judicial reform plan was proposed in February, the cases adjudicated by the Supreme Court have no longer displayed their previous rigidity. He also said, "Although we have made some progress, we still need to work hard in the future." (National Telegram, 23rd)

[Washington] Regarding the judicial reform bill previously proposed by President Roosevelt, which has been rejected by the Senate and replaced with a new bill, the President expressed optimism to the press, saying that the Supreme Court's recent judgments and interpretations of the Constitution have adopted a broader perspective. He added that the Supreme Court is more adaptable to the various needs of modern government, which is gratifying. He also stated that he has considered various necessary measures so that the country can have a perfect organization to cope with future economic panic. He further stated that the government is not yet prepared to appoint judges to replace the retiring Supreme Court judges. In addition, political figures predict that some Supreme Court judges may resign on their own in the near future. Several of the oldest judges on the Supreme Court originally intended to retire, but after President Wei proposed the judicial reform bill, the judges did not want to give the impression that they were yielding to the government due to the President's threat, so they have not yet resigned. Now that the President's judicial reform plan has failed, some judges may resign and retire in the near future. If so, the President will no longer need to pass laws to reorganize the Supreme Court. Some political figures believe that the President still holds an optimistic attitude towards judicial reform, and the reason should be sought in this. (Havas Telegraph, Central News Agency, 13th)

French Correspondence

### A Look at the Future World Economic Conference (Part 1)

— Xiao Ke

At a time when countries around the world are massively increasing their military budgets and actively expanding their armed forces, suddenly the international community hears about reducing armaments and convening economic conferences, etc. The Disarmament Conference Committee of the League of Nations in Geneva did hold a meeting quietly at the end of last month, which in fact yielded no results, something that was expected. However, on the other hand, the attention of European politicians is mostly focused on U.S. President Roosevelt, hoping that he will take the lead in convening a world economic conference, hoping to seek economic compromise among countries and ease the competition in armaments. Looking at the intention of the U.S. President's delegation of Davis, the former U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, to attend the International Sugar Conference and the coronation of the King of England, it may be a sign of convening a world economic conference.

In fact, we know that since Hitler began his insane expansion of armaments, he publicly declared to the German people that cannons can replace butter and coal can turn into bread. This slogan temporarily intoxicated the people, making them endure the government's massive extraction of sweat and blood to support military expenditures. But on the other hand, Hitler's military policy has forced his neighbors to be drawn into this arms expansion vortex. France's budget this year has to issue national defense bonds of 10,500,000,000 francs to fill the budget deficit for special national defense expenditures. This is a reaction to Hitler's arms expansion policy. Britain has been even more affected by Italy's occupation of Abyssinia, which has changed Britain's advantage in the Mediterranean. The route to India has also felt the threat from Italy, so it has no choice but to resolutely follow France with a huge amount of 1,400,000,000 pounds (16 billion francs), to reorganize its military over five years (of which 40,000 pounds are borrowed from the public through the issuance of bonds). Britain's traditionally balanced budget has also become a deficit due to special budget expenditures. When it comes to Germany's military spending, it has always been considered a state secret and is not made public. However, we can prove the extent of its military expansion simply from the amount of its borrowing. Last year, it borrowed a total of 5,000,000,000 marks (about 4 billion francs), of which 2.3 billion marks were public debt, and the rest were supplemented by the method of credit expansion, issuing paper marks with no gold reserves. Germany's current dangerous fiscal policy is entirely dependent on the mysterious economic minister and president of the Deutsche Reichsbank, Dr. Schacht, and the strict policies of the National Socialist Party to barely maintain it.

After the expansion of armaments by various countries in continental Europe and the passage of Britain's large-scale military reorganization policy in parliament, the prices of non-ferrous metals necessary for the military industry in the international market have been affected and have continued to rise. The following is a comparison table of London market prices:

We speculate that the soaring prices of non-ferrous metals in the world are partly due to the opportunity for speculators to manipulate them, but the increase in consumption and the demand exceeding supply in the market is of course the main reason. The world's major steel producer is the United States. Since the implementation of the European arms race, Anaoonda's stock, which was worth less than five dollars when Roosevelt entered the White House, has now risen to fifty dollars. In just one and a half months in March, Britain ordered a huge amount of steel from the United States worth 40 million to 50 million yuan. Therefore, the US President declared: The soaring prices of non-ferrous metals in the world and the slow rise in wages mean that after prosperity (Boom), there will be panic (Krach). The remedy for this phenomenon lies in Europe. This further highlights the crisis of the arms race. France's financial stability has become extremely difficult due to its increased military spending. According to Premier Leon Blum's report: of every 100 francs of national treasury revenue, 42 francs are used to repay public debt, 27 francs are used for military needs, and the remaining 31 francs are used for all other government expenses. When the reporter filed this manuscript, the Leon Blum cabinet had already resigned due to financial problems. Germany, in addition to not allowing waste of all the gold used for military needs, is now lacking iron ore, so General Göring has had to start restricting the use of iron ore by other industries.

The rising prices of non-ferrous metals required for armaments are well known to us, but gold, which is valued by the world as a symbol of wealth and credit creation, is instead experiencing panic due to oversupply. The following table shows the phenomenon of the world's gold production, which has been increasing in recent years:

### Britain and the United States Share the Spoils in the Davis Cup Challenge

Austin and Budge Each Win a Singles Match

▲ (Central News Agency, London, 24th, Havas Telegram) The Davis Cup tennis championship challenge match between Britain and the United States began this afternoon in Wimbledon. In the first day of singles matches, Britain and the United States each won one set. The results are as follows:

### Recollections of the United States in the Decade Before the Davis Cup Final

Predictions Give the United States a Five-to-One Advantage

(Central News Agency, London, 24th, Reuters Telegraph) The United States will compete with Britain today in the Davis Cup challenge to determine the champion. It is believed that the United States has a five-to-one advantage, as the British lineup this year is extremely weak and can hardly withstand the sharp-edged American team. The American team will be led by Wimbledon champion Budge, with Parker as the first singles player and Budge and Mako paired for doubles. When the United States and Germany held the inter-zone final, the American second singles player was originally Grant, but Grant was in very poor form, losing both matches and disappointing everyone. Therefore, Parker has been replaced this time. We should remember that in this year's Wimbledon men's singles competition, Budge was unstoppable and won the championship. Only Parker was able to win a set against him in the semi-finals. Therefore, Parker's strength is actually more abundant than Grant's.

The British team this year is incomplete due to Pan's entry into the professional field and Hughes' inability to play doubles due to illness. The championship will inevitably be handed over. The draw order for the three-day competition is recorded as follows:

The last time the United States won the Davis Cup championship was in 1926. At that time, the United States had held the cup for seven consecutive years. It was not until 1927 that the Four Musketeers of France (Lacoste, Cochet, Borotra, and Brugnon) defeated the United States and took the Davis Cup across the Atlantic. Since then, the United States has reached the final week six times, but its wish to regain the cup has not been fulfilled.

In 1926, the United States defeated France 4-1, which was the last victory in keeping the Davis Cup. The results were as follows: In singles, Johnston defeated French players Lacoste and Borotra, Tilden defeated Borotra but lost to Lacoste. In doubles, Williams and Richards defeated French players Cochet and Brugnon.

By 1927, French players had made great progress. In the first singles, Lacoste defeated Johnston and Tilden. In the second singles, Cochet, although defeated by Tilden, defeated Johnston. In doubles, Borotra and Brugnon also defeated Tilden and Hunter in a five-set thriller. (Note: In 1933, Britain defeated France and won the Davis Cup, which it has held until this year.)

### Two Matches in the Mayor's Cup Minor Ball Tournament

The second Mayor's Cup All-City Open Minor Ball Tournament was originally scheduled to end last week. However, two matches in the Wu-character group, namely Postal Workers vs. Samsung and Lion's Roar vs. Yi Ming, have not yet been held. They are now scheduled to be held at the Mackie Road court starting at 4:00 PM today.

### The 12th Wimbledon Tennis Championships of 1937

— Our European Correspondent Lieshan

Day 10

As a result of today's women's singles matches, Polish player Ms. Jedrzejowska defeated American player Ms. Marble in straight sets. British player Ms. Round defeated French player Madame Mathieu, also in two sets. The defeats of Ms. Marble and Madame Mathieu were somewhat unexpected, but the two winners did have wonderful performances today. In particular, Ms. Round's hitting technique has the posture of a champion.

Marble Admits Defeat

Ms. Marble's defeat today is just like Ji Chengji's defeat to Mako. She could not exert her strengths, and her weaknesses were controlled by the enemy. Not only could her cannonball serve not overcome Ms. Jedrzejowska, but her weapon of rushing to the net also rarely had a chance to try because of the opponent's heavy strokes. As a result, she had to use the method of baseline strokes to defeat the enemy. In terms of stroke technique, Ms. Marble is naturally not as good as Ms. Jedrzejowska.

However, after watching this match, we know that the weight of the ball hit by a first-class female tennis player is definitely no less than that of a man. Ms. Jedrzejowska's forehand stroke is terrible. After the ball is hit, the racket seems to be about to crack. Every time she hits a wonderful ball, the audience exclaims in unison. The reporter heard several spectators constantly praising, "Is this kind of hit from a woman? What is the difference from a man?"

After the start of the first set, Ms. Marble's momentum was strong. Both sides used backhand strokes, but when the opportunity arose, Ms. Marble rushed to the net, thus scoring more points. She was first 4-2 ahead, then 5-3. She was only a little away from winning this set. However, at this critical moment, she was obviously a little flustered and repeatedly lost good opportunities. Her most reliable net interception in peacetime also lost its effect. Seeing 5-5, 6-6, she finally lost 6-8 instead. In this fierce battle, although she adopted an effective strategy, using the opponent's weakness in backhand strokes, Ms. Jedrzejowska's backhand stroke was unexpectedly excellent today, with no flaws. This is also considered Ms. Marble's misfortune. However, the general audience was satisfied, because this kind of wonderful tennis match is not easy to see at Wimbledon. Especially Ms. Jedrzejowska's name is not easy to pronounce. Every time the referee announced her name, it always caused a burst of laughter from the audience. Later, the referee kept shouting "Quiet!", but which spectator would listen to him? Everyone thought, how funny is the name Jedrzejowska, how can you stop people from laughing? (A digression - the transliteration of our country's Xu Chengji is also a mystery in the eyes of the British. He transliterated it into KhoSinKie according to the Xiamen dialect. This time he also wrote S.K.Kho. on the Wimbledon list. According to Ms. Round, when Xu Chengji and Mako were competing, an old English lady told her companion, "What a pity, choosing an A-class player from China to come here to fight his own people." This old lady could not see Mako's face clearly and only heard the referee's report. Mako and Yi Ge ("One Ge" in Chinese) thought that Mako was also Chinese.

In the second set, Ms. Marble was not as successful as in the first set, and made more mistakes in hitting the ball. Ms. Jedrzejowska's (Jedrzejowska) ball had more weight. It was the first time in the reporter's life that she had seen such weight on a female tennis player. The score between the two sides was first 2-0, then 5-2. Ms. Marble, to the regret of the audience, lost this set again. The score was 6-1. Ms. Jedrzejowska won and got the final women's singles final.

▲ Round is Impressive

Then Ms. Round and Madame Mathieu took the stage. Judging from today's tennis match, Ms. Round is undoubtedly the "dark horse" of this year's women's singles. She is an all-around female tennis player with no weaknesses. Perhaps only her backhand stroke is slightly worse. However, this cannot be her fatal flaw. Especially when dealing with Madame Mathieu, who cannot run, there are more methods of relief. After the start of the first set, it was almost whoever served lost. Madame Mathieu once led by a score of 3-1, but was quickly caught up by Ms. Round. The score turned to 5-3. Madame Mathieu then not only won one game, but also almost reached a score of 5-5 in the tenth game. At this time, the audience was worried about Ms. Round, perhaps she would have the same fate as Ms. Marble and be caught up by the opponent. However, Ms. Round has rich combat experience. She is much calmer than Ms. Marble. She finally won this game with a wonderful stroke, and also won this set. The score was 6-4.

In the second set, Ms. Round was able to use her hitting skills more freely. It seemed that wherever the ball was going, she could hit it as she pleased. She quickly took a 2-0 lead. At this time, Madame Mathieu lost a ball in vain due to a miscall by the linesman, and her spirit was naturally more affected. After that, Madame Mathieu seemed to have no intention of fighting and only wanted to end this match quickly. As a result, Ms. Round won the second set again with a score of 6-0.

The results of today's men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles matches will all reach the final stage. The only unexpected thing is that last year's women's doubles world champions, Ms. Stammers and Ms. James, lost to another British doubles pair, Mrs. King and Mrs. Winterbottom. The score was 1-6, 5-7. Ms. Stammers' hitting has not returned to normal after her illness, and Ms. James played even worse today, so they were finally eliminated in straight sets.

### Carson Wins Conti Beauty Cup Singles Final for Two Consecutive Years

Wins Over Squires 3-1 in a Tense Match. The Collasa Couple Win Mixed Doubles

In the Conti Club Beauty Cup tennis singles final, Carson defeated Squires 3-1 yesterday to retain the championship. Squires has recently made rapid progress in his skills, defeating Collasa and Forbes in succession. His strength is strong and impressive. The match was difficult to break. At the start of the match, Squires took the lead and easily won the first set. Carson caught up to tie the score at one point each. At this time, Carson's hitting technique gradually improved, with powerful high shots and frequent feats, while Squires gradually felt physically exhausted, making many mistakes and being tied by Carson. In the second set, both sides performed well and the performance was wonderful, so the situation fluctuated and remained in stalemate for a long time. Carson finally relied on long shots to win again. In the fourth set, Squires was hoarse and exhausted, and had no ability to resist. Carson was able to easily win 6-1. As a result, Carson eliminated Squires 3-1 and retained this year's championship. Mr. Dai Genhua, the manager of the Huacheng Tobacco Company, which donated the cup, was unable to attend due to illness, so the club temporarily invited Miss Luo Feishi to present the awards. The champion and runner-up each received a silver cup. The champion, Carson, also retains the honor of the Beauty Cup for one year. Carson has now won the championship for two consecutive years. If he can retain the championship next year, Carson can keep the cup permanently. Another mixed doubles match was an exhibition match between Li Guofan and Miss Luo Feishi, and the Collasa couple, who were invited by the club. The strength of both sides was similar, and the match was evenly matched. The Collasa couple relied on their skilled partnership, while Li Luo was temporarily paired, so the Collasa couple won in straight sets. Today's order is empty. The semi-finals of the doubles tournament will be held starting tomorrow. The club has scheduled the semi-finals for the 29th and the championship final of the doubles tournament for the 30th.

According to the two officers, a Japanese merchant named Okazaki passed by D'Isle Road that evening and saw a Japanese soldier fighting with two Chinese men. Then a car drove up and took the Japanese soldier and the two Chinese men away. After receiving the report, the police station immediately sent officers to investigate the alleged fight location. Nearby residents said that they had not seen a Japanese soldier fighting with Chinese men that evening. At the same time, our Chinese police authorities also sent personnel to investigate, but found nothing. However, after the two Japanese officers left the police station and returned to the Japanese Naval Landing Forces barracks, they immediately dispatched Marines to patrol in all directions, cut off traffic, and search pedestrians.

The Situation Became Quite Serious

At Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, D'Isle Road, Seymour Road, and Jiangwan Road, more than a dozen Japanese Marines were stationed, inspecting pedestrians and vehicles very strictly. A small number of sentries were stationed near the Tiantong'an Road train station and the Yokohama Road area. Patrol teams and motorcycles equipped with machine guns were constantly moving back and forth in the North Sichuan Road area. For a time, rumors spread, the situation became tense, and residents were extremely panicked.

Mayor Negotiates by Phone

After learning of the situation, Acting Mayor Yu immediately contacted Japanese Consul General Okamoto by telephone, saying that the report of the missing Japanese soldier needed to be investigated to verify if it was true. The city government would also assist in the investigation to clarify the truth. The actions of the Marines only caused panic and affected the city's security. It was hoped that the consulate could stop such actions by the Marines. Okamoto replied that the actions of the Japanese Marines were solely for alert and vigilance and had no other intention, and asked not to be misunderstood. However, regarding the missing Japanese soldier, he requested that efforts be made to investigate the matter.

Military and Police Authorities Negotiate

The military camp authorities negotiated with the Japanese military regarding the deployment of Japanese Naval Landing Forces for patrol, requesting caution. The Japanese side replied that the deployment of the Marines was intended to search and be prepared, with no other intention, and hoped that the Chinese side would also exercise caution. According to our military and police authorities, the current situation is still peaceful, and our side has decided to take a calm and prudent approach to prevent the situation from escalating and deteriorating.

Inspection of Zhabei This Morning

At 2 AM this morning, our newspaper reporter made a special trip to Zhabei to inspect the situation. The reporter first went to the Sun Temple branch of the Xinzha Sub-bureau to inquire. According to the officer at the branch, the true situation was still unclear, and no other reports had been received. After the officer finished writing, he asked the reporter for his press pass. The reporter replied that he did not have it with him due to the suddenness of the matter. The officer then called our newspaper to confirm. Only after clarifying the situation did he answer other questions. At that time, the reporter expressed exceptional admiration for the officer's humble attitude and conscientious service. After the reporter finished talking, he left the bureau and patrolled eastward along Zhongxing Road. Groups of three or five people whispered privately in the streets, and the roadside checks were very strict. The security was especially tight at Huiwen Road, Hongxing Road, and from Xibao Road to Qingyun Bridge.

Situation Has Eased

At 4:30 AM this morning, the reporter went to various parts of Zhabei again for a final inspection. Compared to the situation at 11 PM last night and 2 AM this morning, the situation had greatly eased. The Japanese Marines on the opposite bank of the Yokohama River had mostly withdrawn, with only a very small number of sentries remaining.

Telegram from the Postal Workers' Union

(1) To the postal workers' organizations throughout the country: Recently, the Japanese army in North China violated agreements and provoked incidents, attacking our Lugouqiao garrison and bombarding Wanping and its suburbs in an attempt to expand their occupied territory and annex North China. All Chinese people are deeply indignant. Fortunately, our 29th Army is loyal and brave in defending the country, resolutely resisting the war, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a statement on the 17th of this month, declaring national policy, stating that when the final moment comes, we must resolutely sacrifice and prepare for war. His words are righteous and the world is shaken. After feeling excited, we fully support Chairman Chiang's intentions and pledge our loyalty, ready to listen to the central government and be the vanguard for the country. We hereby state this clearly and hope for your response. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union. (2) To whom it may concern, the Japanese army in Tianjin has been inspecting postal items at the Hebei Postal Administration for days, insulting our country and undermining our sovereignty. All of us are deeply indignant. Our association has already petitioned the Ministry of Communications to actively negotiate and ensure that the inspection is stopped to maintain postal service and protect national sovereignty. We hope everyone will rise up together and vow to be the government's support. This is a request to all postal workers' organizations throughout the country. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union.

Youth National Salvation League

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Youth National Salvation League's Anti-Enemy Fundraising Committee has been working very hard. The committee recently stated that the situation in North China is still serious and that the soldiers at the front urgently need assistance. Fundraising efforts should continue actively, and representatives from various schools are working very hard. The results are still excellent, and another telegram was sent to the soldiers of the 29th Army, urging them not to be taken advantage of by the enemy and to properly negotiate without humiliation. The original telegram is as follows: To the entire 29th Army in Beiping, the enemy has amassed a large army, threatening to form an alliance under the city. The territory and sovereignty of North China are in imminent danger. This is the moment when our nation and our country's life and death depend. The youth of the southeast are all filled with righteous indignation and want to take up arms to defend the country. Your patriotic deeds are glorious in history. We hope you will continue your efforts and be the first for the people. Today, if there is a new compromise, it will be a humiliation to the country. You must force the enemy to quickly withdraw its troops, which is the only way to survive. Success or failure, honor or disgrace, all depend on this. Protests are ineffective, so start fighting! Wait for ten years, and the violent Japanese will surely perish. The 100,000 youths of Shanghai are willing to follow you and die on the battlefield, all becoming heroic ghosts. We are saddened and don't know what to say. Shanghai Youth United National Salvation League.

Emergency Meeting of the National Medical Association

In light of the Lugouqiao Incident, the rampant actions of the violent Japanese, the attacks on our garrisons, and the forcible occupation of our territory, the National Medical Association of the city believes that the national crisis is severe and has reached its final stage. Although the atmosphere of peace is strong, the Japanese army continues to increase its forces. The soldiers at the front are bravely defending the country and resisting the war, and the people in the rear should do their best to assist. Therefore, an emergency standing committee meeting was convened last night to discuss the methods of implementation. The following resolutions were adopted: (1) Notify all members to save money and donate to the association, which will forward the funds to the front lines. (2) Nominate Zhu Hegao, Shi Jiqun, and Tang Jifu as representatives to participate in the city's Anti-Enemy Support Association. (3) Unite the city's medical organizations to form a relief team to be sent to the front lines in case the war expands.

### Train Service Between Shanghai and Peiping Has Not Been Restored Yet

Service Still Only Goes to Tianjin

Train service between Shanghai and Peiping was interrupted after the Lugouqiao Incident. Service was briefly restored but then interrupted again. Now that the frontline troops have withdrawn, the line should be able to resume service soon. However, a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency learned from the Railway Bureau on the morning of the 24th that joint tickets are still only being sold to Tianjin and tickets to Peiping are not being sold yet. When service can be restored is still difficult to predict, but it is understood that the situation in the front is gradually becoming peaceful, so passengers may be able to continue on to Peiping by taking the Beining train there when they arrive in Tianjin.

### Cattle and Sheep Industry Requests Exemption from Slaughter Tax; Two Petitions to Nanjing

Ministries of Finance and Industry Decide on a Compromise Solution; Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval and Implementation

The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association believes that it cannot bear the burden of the municipal government's Finance Bureau's proposed cattle slaughter tax. Its first petition did not achieve its objective. Furthermore, recently, cattle from the north have been purchased in Qingdao by people of a certain country for large-scale slaughter and storage as military supplies. The source of cattle in Shanghai has decreased sharply, market prices have soared, and the entire industry is suffering losses. Adding a slaughter tax now would be like throwing stones down a well, hastening its bankruptcy. Therefore, Yang Zhaosheng and two others were sent to Nanjing for a second petition the day before yesterday. The representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday. To clarify the results of the petition, the reporter went to interview them. According to the representatives, at 9 AM on the 19th, they first went to the Executive Yuan and were received by Secretary Zhang, who said that the case had been submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for consultation. Then they went to the Ministry of Industry and were received by Secretary Jin and Section Chief Liu, who said that the case was being decided by the Ministry of Finance and was still under discussion. Finally, they went to the Ministry of Finance and were received by Tax Division staff member Chen Li, who said that the case had been jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval by the Ministry of Industry. In order to take into account the suffering of the merchants, a compromise solution had been determined. After the representatives stated the reasons for the petition and pleaded for the rejection of the existing resolution, Section Chief Chen replied that a decision would be made after the Executive Yuan approved it. It is heard that if the second petition fails to achieve its objective, a third petition will be made, determined to persist to the end.

### Measures for Issuing Nationality Certificates to Naturalized Citizens and Those Who Have Regained Citizenship

City Government Orders Police Bureau to Comply

The city government issued an order yesterday to the Police Bureau stating that it had received a dispatch from the Ministry of Interior regarding the issuance of nationality certificates to the wives and children of naturalized citizens and those who have regained citizenship, as well as those who have acquired citizenship due to marriage, adoption, recognition, and other relationships, in order to prove their nationality. A simplified procedure has been formulated whereby the person applying for the nationality certificate (or their parents on their behalf if they are underage) must prepare a handling fee of 60 cents in national currency, two recent 4x6 cm half-length photos, and a written application, which must be filled out in Chinese and foreign languages according to the prescribed format. The application must be submitted to the local government of the applicant's current residence, which will then forward it to the Ministry of Interior for direct issuance to facilitate verification. The order instructs the Police Bureau to comply.

### Overseas Chinese Merchant Xiong Fei Talks About Promoting National Porcelain

Business in Singapore is Gradually Improving; Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Donate to Resist the Enemy

Xiong Fei, a leader of the overseas Chinese merchants in Singapore, returned to China in early April to investigate national porcelain. He went to Jiangxi, stayed in Ganzhou for two months, and then went to Hankou before coming to Shanghai via Nanjing. Xiong said that business in Singapore is improving daily and encouraged Chinese people to go there to do business and develop the market for national products. The reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency recorded the details as follows:

Investigating and Purchasing Jiangxi National Porcelain

Xiong returned to China this time to purchase Jiangxi national porcelain and investigate the status of the porcelain industry there. After returning to China, he immediately went to Jiangxi Province and stayed there for two months. He said that the materials of Jiangxi porcelain are very good and better than foreign products, but the designs still need to be improved. He purchased a large quantity of porcelain in Jiangxi and plans to ship it to Singapore for trial sales. In the future, he plans to ship more to Singapore. There are many overseas Chinese in Singapore, and they all love to use national products. The southward sales of national porcelain will not be a problem in the future. Especially recently, the Guangda Porcelain Company was established in Jiangxi Province, using scientific methods to produce porcelain and increase production. The improved products are good news for our overseas Chinese merchants.

Encouraging Chinese People to Do Business in Singapore

Xiong also talked about the recent situation of overseas Chinese business in Singapore, saying that Singapore is a major port in Southeast Asia, and most of our overseas Chinese reside on the island. Doing business there is more promising than in other places. In the past year or two, due to the rising prices of rubber and tin ore, the commercial market has been booming. Whether or not various businesses in Singapore are prosperous depends on the rise and fall of local products, so the overseas Chinese economy has also improved significantly. The Singapore market for national products can be greatly developed. Therefore, this time, he took the opportunity to encourage Chinese people to go there to do business and jointly develop overseas sales channels. At the same time, to encourage Jiangxi merchants to go to Singapore, the Jiangxi Fellow Association in Singapore also plans to expand its business this year and build a three-story Western-style building, for which it has already hired someone to draw up plans. It will cost about 40,000 yuan. A portion of the money has already been raised. This time, Chairman Xiong returned to Jiangxi and was very concerned about the self-built guild halls of our overseas Chinese, believing that they can unite the feelings of overseas Chinese and develop international trade. He automatically donated construction funds to show his support.

Overseas Chinese Raise Funds to Overcome National Difficulties

Xiong has been in Singapore for 30 years and also serves as the Director of the Jiangxi Fellow Association. He is very familiar with the situation of overseas Chinese. Speaking of the situation of overseas Chinese toward the motherland, he said that overseas Chinese work hard overseas, and their destination and wishes are in the motherland. Overseas Chinese have always been able to do their best to support domestic construction, warning each other that "without a country, there is no home." This time, the Japanese caused the Lugouqiao Incident, which is truly regrettable. He had already returned to China at that time and believes that the emotions of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia must be very tense again. When the reporter asked about the ban on overseas Chinese fundraising by the Singapore authorities, Xiong said that according to past experience, there have been cases of overseas Chinese being banned from donating for war, but their patriotic feelings are still enthusiastically encouraged. Therefore, each time, overseas Chinese donate automatically, without the need for solicitations. It is expected that this time, although fundraising to resist the enemy has been banned again, the results will still be considerable.

### Shanghai Silk Factories Run Out of Raw Materials; Association Issues Statement of Appeal Yesterday

Factories Selling Forward Contracts Cannot Deliver; Silk Workers Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Relief

Since the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang banned the export of dry cocoons and announced measures for managing silkworm rearing, silk factories such as Yuanchang and Hetai were forced to shut down yesterday. The Tongle Association issued a statement yesterday appealing to all sectors and decided to petition the municipal government tomorrow. Silk workers in the city held a general meeting yesterday to discuss relief. The details are as follows:

Forced Shutdown

Since the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang banned the export of dry cocoons, the various silk factories in the city have been unable to transport the dry cocoons that they have already collected and stored in Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places to Shanghai, resulting in a shortage of raw materials and panic. They jointly requested relief from the industry association. The Yuanchang Silk Factory in Erjiawan, Zhabei, with 120 machines, and the Hetai Silk Factory, with 120 machines, were the first to be forced to announce their shutdown at 1 PM yesterday. In addition, the raw material stocks of factories such as Fuxing, Xinchang, Gufeng, Dongyi, and Jincheng are running out and they will soon be forced to shut down as well.

Association Petitions

The Silk Factory Industry Association, after a general meeting, decided that at 9 AM tomorrow (Monday), representatives Shen Lianchen, Zhang Peishen, Tang Zhiqin, Xu Peixiong, and eight others will be sent to petition the Social Affairs Bureau of the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters to report everything in person and request that the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang be consulted immediately to rescind the ban on silkworm and silk reeling equipment and machinery and to abolish Article 6 of the silkworm rearing management measures (i.e., the restriction on silkworm rearing) in order to save the national industry and prevent the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers. They are scheduled to gather at the industry association at 8:30 AM on the same morning.

Delivery Conflicts

The various silk factories in Shanghai that have sold forward contracts for near-term silk and are due to deliver the goods will inevitably be unable to fulfill the deliveries due to the exhaustion of raw materials. After receiving reports from member silk factories, the Silk Factory Industry Association issued a statement to the Raw Silk Export Association. Wax Feng, Chairman of the Export Association, considered the matter to be of great importance and sent a secretary yesterday to contact Shen Lianchen, Chairman of the Silk Factory Industry Association, requesting that the factories fulfill their deliveries according to the contracts. Chairman Shen replied that unless the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang rescind the ban, so that the raw material supply of silk in Shanghai is not cut off, it will be difficult to fulfill the deliveries.

Workers' Meeting

The silk industry unions of the 4th and 6th districts stated that the ban on the export of dry cocoons from the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which in effect dictates that Zhejiang cocoons must be reeled in Zhejiang and Jiangsu cocoons must be reeled in Jiangsu, has caused the dry cocoons purchased and stored by Shanghai silk merchants to be banned from transport. As a result, the raw materials of the city's silk reeling factories are running out and they will soon be forced to shut down within a month. The silk reeling workers throughout the city are therefore panicking greatly. A joint meeting of representatives was held at 2 PM yesterday at the Huaxing branch of the 4th District Union on Zhaotong Road. Union members Yuan Yunlong, Yang Gengti, Liu Sanzhi, and others from the 6th district union, Chen Xiupu, Yang Hongmei, Zhu Yi, and others from the 4th district union, and all 30+ directors and supervisors attended. Chairman Chen Xiupu resolved to: (1) Hold a joint representative meeting of silk reeling workers throughout the city on the morning of July 27 to discuss everything. (2) Issue an appeal and elect Chen Xiupu and Yuan Yunlong to draft a declaration. (3) Have all the directors and supervisors of the two unions go to the municipal party headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union on a regular basis to appeal. (4) Organize a joint office of the silk reeling party and labor unions throughout the city to unify steps and facilitate everything. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were made.

### Wu Tiecheng Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

He arrived at the North Station at 6:50 AM yesterday morning. Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, Police Chief Yao Jinjun, Security Commander Ji Zhangjian, Secretary Tang Shixuan of the municipal government, and others went to welcome him. After getting off the train, he returned to his private residence on Haige Road to rest. It is learned that his toothache has been cured after being treated in Hong Kong last time. As official duties in the province await his handling, he does not want to stay any longer and will return to Guangzhou soon.

### Foreign Firms Temporarily Suspend Insurance on Sino-Japanese Goods

Insurance Premiums for War Risk Doubled Along China's Coast; Chinese Insurers to Discuss Limitations

In light of the severe situation in North China and the possibility of escalated conflict at any moment, Chinese and foreign insurance companies in this city have been exchanging views on the issue of war risk insurance. It is reported that foreign insurance companies have already begun to double the war risk insurance premiums for goods carried on ships along the Chinese coast, the Yangtze River, and in Hong Kong. They have also temporarily suspended insurance on goods carried on Chinese and Japanese ships. A reporter from the New News Agency visited the person in charge of the local insurance association. According to them, international war risk insurance, with the exception of North America (the United States and Canada), was suspended in February of this year. Germany has also canceled war risk insurance for the Far East. The reason for the suspension by various countries is due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, which caused huge losses to people's lives and property. War risk insurance companies suffered severe blows and were unable to sustain operations, causing great turmoil in the London market. Therefore, all countries agreed to cease operations. War risk insurance originally included riot and disturbance insurance, focusing on losses caused by local emergencies, rather than losses caused by wars between countries. Our association has discussed war risk insurance with the local foreign merchant association. The foreign fire insurance association is scheduled to convene a general meeting of members on the 30th of this month, and the Chinese insurance association is also scheduled to convene a regular meeting of members on August 2nd to conduct a thorough study and discussion on the issue of war risk insurance before making a decision.

### Japanese Residents in Shanghai Discuss Evacuation Measures Yesterday

Discussions and decisions were made on how all Japanese residents should evacuate in the event of an incident and other related matters. It is said that Japanese shops in the Hongkou area have purchased a large number of candles in preparation for power outages.

Japanese residents in Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, and other places have been ordered to return to their country and have arrived in Shanghai via Hankou to transfer to ships leaving China. Therefore, Japanese ships departing in recent days have been fully loaded with Japanese women and children. More than 30 Japanese residents living in Wanxian, Yichang, and other places arrived in Shanghai from Hukou on the Japanese warship Hirato. The warship docked near the consulate yesterday at noon and brought the residents to Shanghai to board ships back to their home country.

### Donate Scrap Metal to the Government

Do Not Sell for Petty Profits to Junk Collectors

Chinese people have never valued scrap metal. As a result, there have been times when foreign countries have bought them cheaply. Currently, with the nation facing a crisis, citizens Yang and Yao have proposed that leaders of Chinese newspapers and organizations announce to all citizens of Shanghai that if they have any scrap metal at home, regardless of the quantity, they should not sell it for petty profits to junk collectors.

To send a letter to all churches in the country to immediately conduct (1) united prayer for the nation, (2) organize and train rescue teams, (3) make efforts to raise funds for relief, (4) report on the work being carried out to the council, so that it can forward it to churches in various places to unite and increase strength.

To inform the Japanese Christian Council of the unreasonable actions of the Japanese army in North China in recent days, asking them to pay attention to justice. D. To send the military actions of the Japanese army in China and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration on the current situation to the World Christian Council, to clarify the truth and judge right and wrong, so that churches in various countries can contribute and speak out for justice and uphold justice. E. Recently, the Beijing Christian Joint Council organized a war zone service and relief committee, which carried out fundraising and relief work, and sent a letter to the council to call on churches across the country to pay attention, take consistent steps, and go to the national crisis. The council believes that the various plans proposed by the joint council have been actively carried out by the Christian Citizens Committee. However, the military and civilians in the war zone are waiting for relief, so it has decided to first allocate the funds previously received from churches across the country to the joint council, asking it to represent them in expressing condolences to the wounded soldiers and civilians in the front. It is also said that the council plans to convene a meeting within days to determine the detailed rules and methods for working during the national crisis.

### Increased Salaries for China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Employees

Pilots, Engineers, Harbor Pilots, and Radio Operators; Seamen's Salaries Increased Appropriately

The issue of the treatment of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's sailors has been ongoing since Cai Zengji took office a year and a half ago. The sailors have repeatedly negotiated for improved salaries and benefits, but to no avail. Recently, all the engineers on the ships felt that the difference in salary between them and the pilots was too great, and their request for an increase was not granted, so they threatened to resign en masse, which aroused unfortunate incidents. Later, representatives of the engineers went to Beijing three times to petition the Ministry of Transportation, requesting an increase. Finally, Minister Yu granted permission and ordered the bureau to quickly revise the regulations on the salary and treatment of ship engineers and submit them to the ministry for approval. A total of twelve articles (lengthy, omitted here) were officially announced yesterday, and the salaries of all sailors, harbor pilots, radio operators, and seamen have been appropriately increased.

### Fecal Examination Results Show Not True Cholera

Harbor Quarantine Office Announces Results; Typhoid Fever Rampant in the City

The Harbor Quarantine Office announced the results of the first cholera germ test of the year yesterday, which showed it was not true cholera. This confirms that no cholera has been found in the country this year. The details are as follows: The Harbor Quarantine Office reported an outbreak of cholera in Ningbo, but whether it was true needed to be verified. Therefore, it immediately asked the Sino-American Hospital in Ningbo to send a sealed letter to Shanghai with the patient's feces, kept in cold water. The office handed it over to the Wusong Second Hospital for testing. After testing by Dr. Boleis of the hospital, the results were announced yesterday afternoon, confirming that it was not true cholera. It is believed that the reason for the suspicion in Ningbo was due to the extreme similarity of clinical symptoms. According to the Harbor Quarantine Office, typhoid fever has been rampant in the city in the past week, with a high mortality rate. There were 27 cases of typhoid fever among Chinese, with 20 deaths, and 3 cases among foreigners, with one death. At the same time, dysentery symptoms were also prevalent in Hankou, with more cases than in Shanghai. In Hankou, there were 23 cases of dysentery among Chinese in the past week, while there were only 17 cases in Shanghai, including 3 among foreigners.

According to the Shenzhou News Agency, the Harbor Quarantine Office of the Ministry of Health announced the statistics on infectious diseases in the city for the past week: (1) Two Chinese cases of smallpox, one foreign death, one Chinese death; (2) Two Chinese cases of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis; (3) Twenty-seven Chinese cases of typhoid fever, five foreign cases, twelve Chinese deaths; (4) Thirty-five Chinese cases of bacterial dysentery and amoebic dysentery, three deaths, six foreign cases; (5) Seven Chinese cases of diphtheria; (6) Twenty-three Chinese cases of scarlet fever, three foreign cases, four Chinese deaths.

### Zhejiang-Shanghai Anti-Smoking Office Proclamation

Chen Lingyun, the special commissioner of the Zhejiang-Shanghai Anti-Smoking Office of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, issued Proclamation No. 4 yesterday, stating: This is an announcement regarding the matter that this special commissioner was appointed by Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government and concurrently Director-General of Anti-Smoking, to handle the anti-smoking affairs of Zhejiang and Shanghai. This office was established in Hangzhou on April 1st of this year, and a Shanghai office was established on May 15th. Reports have been submitted and notices have been issued to all parties. The central government has made a firm determination to eradicate opium addiction, and the two-year deadline for drug prohibition set by the Director-General has long expired. The six-year deadline for opium prohibition is also approaching. In Shanghai, Chinese and foreigners live together, and opium addiction is rampant. In Zhejiang Province, the remaining opium addiction has not been eradicated. Despite repeated strict prohibitions issued by the provincial and municipal governments, ignorant people still violate the bans. As the special commissioner, this causes me great concern. This proclamation is issued to inform all people in Zhejiang and Shanghai. If any illegal elements dare to privately sell or smoke opium, they will be handed over to the military law authorities for strict punishment in accordance with the law, without leniency. Obey this order, and do not violate it.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Employees Apprehend Wanted Criminals

Unauthorized Surveying of Important Bridges Along the Route; Admitted to Acting Under Instructions from a Certain Party

On the evening of the 23rd, around 6 PM, four people with suspicious behavior were found surveying around the tracks of Bridge No. 31 and Bridge No. 34 between Songjiang and Shihudang stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway (Note: These two bridges are important and relatively large bridges on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway). Railway employees and soldiers discovered them and immediately arrested them. They were taken to the Songjiang District Command for interrogation. One of the criminals claimed to be a resident of Jiaxing. At the same time, a detective from the Jiaxing Police Station was present and took him away for investigation. After a thorough interrogation, seven more people were apprehended. They all admitted to acting under the instructions of a certain party, with the organization based in Shanghai. They also claimed that there were a total of twenty people, some of whom were not yet adults and worked as iron menders and bowl repairers. Each person was given fourteen yuan before departure as a family allowance. The case is currently being jointly investigated by the military and police authorities in Jiaxing and Songjiang, and the accomplices are being pursued and brought to justice.

### Third Concubine of Wu Guangzong Sues Second Concubine for Embezzling Huge Sum of Inheritance

Case Still Under Investigation; Hearing Postponed

Wu Guangzong, a native of Fujian who served as chief of staff and director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau under Sun Chuanfang, the warlord commander of the Five Provinces Allied Army, was assassinated in Shanghai in August of the 31st year, leaving behind an inheritance of over 600,000 yuan. The inheritance was managed by his second concubine, Wu Zhang Yuqing. His third concubine, Ying Zhong Hui Zhen, was in Fujian, and his legal wife, Lin Zhuzui, was also not in Shanghai, leading to a property dispute among the wives and concubines. A custody committee was formed by relatives and friends, including current Deputy Minister of the Navy Li Shijia and Jiangnan Shipyard Director Ma Boliang. However, lawyer Shen Yuesheng embezzled over 100,000 yuan and fled, leading to years of litigation. Now, Wu Zhong Huizhen, along with her son, filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division against Wu Zhang Yuqing for valuing the inheritance, requesting that the entire property be handed over for distribution in four shares to be inherited by Wu Guangzong's three sons and one daughter (the eldest son, Shi Qiang, and his wife, Xiu Yu, are the children of the legal wife Lin, the second son, Shi Yue, is the son of the defendant, and the third son, Bao Jun, is the son of the plaintiff). After Qiu, the judge, repeatedly opened the court for interrogation, both parties held their own views, and the defendant denied embezzlement. The court postponed the hearing for investigation. The previous report has recorded all this information. Now, during the postponement, the court found a deposit in the name of Wu Baojun at the Datong Bank, and Wu Guangzong's family members presented 11,000 yuan. The case was heard again yesterday morning, but the plaintiff did not arrive. The defendant's lawyer stated that they denied withdrawing money from Datong Bank in Wu Baojun's name. The court found that the case still needed investigation and postponed the hearing to August 5th.

### Lihang Municipal Committee Requests the Establishment of a Clinic

Requests the Municipal Government to Order the Health Bureau to Rescind Its Decision

Zhang Qiwen of the Lihang District Municipal Committee, because the Municipal Health Bureau planned to close the clinic in the district, requested the Municipal Government to order the Health Bureau to rescind its decision in order to emphasize rural construction and public health. The original petition is recorded as follows: "In order to improve the health of the people in the district, the committee plans to use the remaining funds from the temporary epidemic hospital to purchase a piece of land north of the Xinlu Station and on the left side of Qixiu Road, donating it to the Health Bureau as the site for a rural hospital in the district. Before the hospital is established, please first set up a health office or clinic to pay attention to epidemic prevention in summer and autumn, diagnose and treat diseases for the people at ordinary times, and pay attention to midwifery, to meet the special health needs of the people in this area. Health Bureau Director Li sent personnel to the countryside for investigation and personally inspected the site, considering it appropriate. It was then reported to your office for approval to establish a clinic. The clinic has been established for several months and has diagnosed and treated diseases for the people, vaccinated against smallpox and measles, and injected preventive vaccines, for no fewer than six or seven thousand people. Even the clean-up of sanitary administration is more advanced than before. The people unanimously praised it, saying that this facility of the Health Bureau is truly the pioneer of all rural construction. However, recently, the Health Bureau decided at a bureau meeting to close the clinic from August 1st. After careful consideration, the committee believes that there are four reasons why it is not feasible. The district purchased land to assist in the establishment of the clinic as a base, and the committee reported it to your office for approval by the Health Bureau. It also plans to continue to raise funds to build a clinic, using the situation of the Health Bureau and your office building the countryside to promote it to the people as much as possible. The people in the district, almost all women and children, know this. If it is suddenly closed, the administrative credibility will be greatly lost, and it will be more difficult to organize public welfare in the future. This is the first reason why it is not feasible. The number of people receiving treatment when the clinic first opened was not very large, and some thought that the expenditure was not economical. However, rural undertakings are generally not very developed when they are first started, and they must go through considerable efforts and a considerable period of time before they can be expected to flourish. If we want to strictly demand economic efficiency at the beginning of the establishment, then the rural people will ultimately not be able to enjoy the same benefits as the urban people. This does not conform to reason and is not feasible. Moreover, the clinic's mission, as determined in the original plan, includes the prevention and control of epidemics, attention to midwifery, the dissemination of health knowledge, and the promotion of sanitary administration. Treating diseases is only one of the missions. It seems that it is not possible to dismiss it based on the small number of people receiving treatment and stop its operation. If the Health Bureau really wants to seek a large number of people to receive treatment in order to achieve economic efficiency, it should also enrich its content from a positive aspect to increase public faith, rather than suddenly stopping its operation from a negative aspect, cutting off the sprouts of the health undertakings of the people in this area. This is the second reason why it is not feasible. In modern times, if a country wants to prosper and compete with the rich and powerful countries of the world, it must increase the health of all people, enlighten the knowledge of all people, and enrich the economy of all people. Therefore, the central government has repeatedly declared that it hopes that the rural areas across the country will work hard to build, and health undertakings are one of the important tasks to improve the countryside and increase the strength of all people.

A Counterfeit Currency Ring Busted by the Criminal Division of the Municipal Council

Ten Chinese and Japanese Criminals Arrested; Counterfeiting of Five-Yuan National Currency of the Bank of China; Japanese Criminals to be Transferred to Nagasaki for Trial

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the Criminal Division of the Municipal Council received a tip-off several days ago, stating that a counterfeit currency operation was located somewhere in Hongkou. A certain Mr. [name], who was selling counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, resided at 610 Wusong Road. A Chinese deputy detective was dispatched, posing as a buyer, to negotiate with the counterfeiters. After lengthy discussions, a price of seventeen yuan per hundred yuan of counterfeit currency was agreed upon. When the counterfeiters handed over two thousand yuan worth of counterfeit five-yuan banknotes, four Japanese and two suspected Chinese criminals were apprehended in a house on Jing'an Temple Road. A printing press, codebooks, and six printing plates for Guangdong Bank banknotes were seized at Seward Road. It was also learned that a certain Chinese man, who was managing and distributing these counterfeit banknotes, was going to a certain house in the French Concession. Detectives waited at the location and arrested the man when he arrived on Friday afternoon. In addition, one Japanese man and one Chinese man and one Chinese woman were arrested at that location. During the night, another printing press, a cutting machine, and a quantity of counterfeit Guangdong Bank banknotes were seized in a house in Zhabei. A total of ten Chinese and Japanese individuals were arrested. The police are still searching for other accomplices. According to the arrested criminals, they had shipped 20,000 yuan worth of counterfeit one-yuan Guangdong Bank banknotes to Guangzhou three weeks ago, and it is believed that these banknotes have already been circulated in the market. These counterfeit banknotes were sold in Shanghai to a certain person at a price of fourteen yuan per thousand, and then resold by that person to another person at a price of sixteen or seventeen yuan per thousand. Therefore, it is difficult for the police to find the mastermind of the case. The arrested Chinese individuals have been interrogated by the First Special District Court and ordered to be detained pending further investigation. It is reported that the Japanese individuals will be transferred to Nagasaki for trial, as counterfeiting currency is a serious crime under Japanese law, and the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai can only handle cases punishable by imprisonment of one year or less. According to the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," the Municipal Council arrested six counterfeiters at 6:30 AM on the 2nd and 12th on Seward Road, Chapoo Road, and Jing'an Temple Road. The arrested included Japanese nationals Nobukata Ishii, Masatsugu Shimada, Gihei Yoneyama, and Hideo Wadamoto, as well as Chinese nationals Yuqing Zhou and Bing Liu. Two printing presses, two thousand yuan in counterfeit currency, and steel plates were confiscated. The main suspect, a Cantonese man named Zhu, has reportedly fled. It is claimed that this counterfeit ring counterfeited 30,000 yuan worth of five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China.

Jinan University Invites Fan Zhongyun to Lecture on "Recent Developments in North China"

The students remaining at National Jinan University during the summer vacation, in light of the tense situation in North China and the repeated violations of agreements by the violent Japanese, formed the "Aid North China Soldiers in Resistance Against the Enemy Association" the other day. Since its establishment, the work has been extremely intense. Yesterday, the association, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the Chinese issue, invited former professor of the university, Fan Zhongyun, to give a lecture titled "Recent Developments in North China." More than two hundred students remaining at the school attended the lecture. Xu Dahua gave an introductory speech, followed by Fan's account of the occurrence of the North China Incident, which was by no means accidental. The Lugouqiao Incident concerns the survival of Beiping and Tianjin. We must strengthen our capabilities; only with fighting power can we speak of peace. To speak of peace without fighting power is surrender. The lecture lasted for one and a half hours, and the audience was deeply moved.

### 黃包車商之子被綁釋回供述歷險經過

Son of Rickshaw Businessman Released After Abduction Recounts His Ordeal

Moved to Several Counties in Over Twenty Days; Zhou Changgui Attempts to Evade Responsibility in Abduction Case; Only Admits to Participating in the Robbery on Boone Road

Lu Changsheng, (deceased) residing at No. 1, Lane 59, Rehe Road, made a living by managing rickshaws. His nine-year-old son, Deming, attended the nearby Nanyang Elementary School. On the 25th of last month, at 7:15 AM, Lu Deming, accompanied by his maid, Zhu Jinshi, was on his way to school when he was suddenly abducted by bandits who forced him into a car and sped away. Subsequently, Lu's family reported the incident to the police at the Mixed Court. Chinese Detective Sergeant Shang Wu, Detectives Li Wenbin, Ji Xiujuan, and others successively arrested suspects Zhou Changgui, Yao Fuquan, Liu Ruan (Zhou's mistress), Lu Shougong, and others from Jiangbei. Zhou, fearing punishment, attempted suicide in the police detention center by stabbing his temples with bamboo chopsticks. He was sent to the hospital for treatment and then interrogated after recovery. The hostage, Lu Deming, was suddenly returned by the bandits in a hired car on the 15th of this month, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Zhou Changgui, having recovered from his injuries, was, along with the other three suspects, brought to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Court Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that during the rescheduling process, it was found that Yao Fuquan and Liu Ruan were not involved and would not be prosecuted. Zhou Changgui and Lu Shougong were prosecuted for extortion under Article 347 of the Criminal Code. It was also found that on January 31, 1935, Zhou, armed with weapons, led a gang to rob the home of Yao Guo at No. 24, Lane 228, Boone Road, stealing property worth 305 yuan. He was also prosecuted under Article 330 of the Criminal Code. He stated the case that after Lu Deming was abducted and reported to the police, an investigation began, revealing that at 6:00 AM that morning, the bandits had rented a car (license number 4533) No. 18055 from the Hetong Motor Company on Shantou Road, driven by driver Hua Yeheng. When the car reached a deserted area on Xishixing Road in Zhabei, the bandits tied up Hua, threw him out, and tied him to a bamboo fence. One of the bandits drove off in the car. Afterwards, the driver shouted for help and was rescued by passersby, who reported the incident to the nearby police station. The stolen car was found on Dongshixing Road at around 10:00 AM that morning. The police arrested Zhou Changgui and later Lu Shougong and the other three. Driver Hua Yeheng identified Zhou as the one who had tied him up in the car and held a pistol. While the police were searching for the hostage, he was unexpectedly released and sent home on the 15th of this month. According to Lu Deming's statement to the police, after being abducted, he was taken to a grass hut by a river. At midnight, one of the bandits took him to the train station, where they boarded a train to Changzhou and stayed for six days. They then went to Yongle Rice Shop in Taixian, Jiangbei, and stayed for seven days. He was returned to Shanghai and stayed at Yongle Village for four days, then taken to No. 72, Mingxing Bridge, Songjiang, for four days. He was brought back to Shanghai by public bus. At Nanyang Bridge, the bandit hired a rickshaw to take him home. While he was in the bandits' lair, he was treated well and given one yuan for personal use each day, but when he was released, the money given to him was taken back. A silk handkerchief that Lu Deming had when he was abducted was found in Zhou's home at No. 15, Lane 176, Chongqing Road, inside a shirt pocket hanging on the wall. Since the hostage was abducted for no reason, it should be investigated whether his family paid a ransom for his release. As for the robbery on Boone Road, the fingerprints left by the bandits at the time matched Zhou Changgui's fingerprints. However, because the fingerprint report is not yet complete, a request for rescheduling is made. Afterwards, Lu Deming described the circumstances of his abduction, but he could not identify the two defendants who had been arrested. Hua Yeheng testified that Zhou Changgui was the bandit who had tied him up and held a pistol. When questioned, Zhou Changgui evaded responsibility for the abduction case but admitted to participating in the robbery on Boone Road. Lu Shougong vehemently denied the charges. Judge Fu Lin reviewed the statements and ordered the defendants Lu Shougong and Zhou Changgui to be remanded in custody for a hearing next Thursday morning.

### 魚販夾運私鹽案辯論終結候判

Fishmongers Smuggling Salt Case Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

Prosecuted under the Law for Punishing Salt Smuggling

Fishmongers Li Zongyuan and Zhong Deming brought shellfish and razor clams from Kanmen, Zhejiang, to Shanghai on the Xinhai Men Steamer on the 23rd of last month for sale. At the same time, they also smuggled four baskets of salt, weighing over eight hundred catties, on behalf of a fellow passenger, Wu Fumu (alias Wu Mumu). They delivered the goods to Taichang Fish Market and instructed the head clerk, Lin Xiangfa, to bring them into the market for sale. However, the market owner, Xu Yangxian, discovered that the upper layer of each basket was fish and the lower layer was salt. He reported the matter to the Mountain Police Sub-Bureau and the Fifth Jiangsu Tax Police Bureau, who sent officers to detain the people and goods and transfer them to the local court for investigation. During interrogation by Prosecutor Li, the defendants, Li Zongyuan and others, claimed that Wu Fumu had asked them on the ship to notify him, and that they were unaware of the contents. However, the market owner, Xu Yangxian, testified that before the discovery, the defendants only referred to the owner of the goods as a "current customer" and did not clearly state his name. After the discovery, they pleaded with the market owner to return the goods and not report the matter, so he was deemed to have knowingly committed the crime. They were prosecuted under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Law for Punishing Salt Smuggling. Yesterday, Judge Lu presided over the hearing. The defendants were defended by lawyer Xiang Xun, while the market owner, Xu Yangxian, testified that after the discovery, the defendants requested the return of the goods, and because he feared responsibility for the market, he reported the matter to the police for investigation. Wang Wenqing, the purser of the Xinhai Men Steamer, testified that the defendants did not declare the goods and that they were unaware of the situation, otherwise they would have charged them freight fees. The court adjourned the arguments and will announce the judgment at a later date.

Due to a moment of carelessness, he accidentally touched an alternating current wire, immediately collapsed, and was on the verge of death. He was taken to Baolong Hospital by Constable No. 20 and then transferred to Renji Hospital for treatment, but the efforts were in vain, and he died at approximately 4:30 PM.

At 3:00 AM a month ago, a passerby named Chen Er found a person lying on the ground, covered in blood, on the back door of No. 12, Xin'an Lane, Dajing Road in the city. He immediately reported the incident to the police officer on duty, Zhang Qiuting, who sent an ambulance to Shanghai Hospital. He was diagnosed with a broken left arm and severe injuries to his head and feet. After treatment, his left arm was amputated. After a month of treatment, he was interrogated and identified as Wang Zhaokui, 32 years old, from Yangzhou. He confessed that he was attempting to steal from the house that night when he was discovered and pursued by the owner, Chen Ye. He fled to the sun deck and attempted to climb down the railing, but the iron railing was not sturdy and collapsed, causing him to fall and be injured. He lamented that he would be crippled from now on and could no longer be a thief. The police station in charge of the area has brought the suspect Wang Zhaokui back for questioning and has transferred him to the court for trial.

She was discovered and rescued, but she had already died. It is truly said that she died in vain.

Flour Exports - Quantity Issues, Spot Sales Active

On the 16th of this month, the Customs received an order from the Ministry of Finance to prohibit the export of flour. As a result, flour exports have virtually ceased for the past week. The day before yesterday (the 23rd), the Customs received a new directive from the Ministry of Finance, issuing new measures regarding the prohibition of flour exports. "Namely, with the exception of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang (the three northeastern provinces), including Dalian," exports to these areas are prohibited, while all other ports are to be unblocked. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Upon learning this, various merchant guilds rushed to shipping companies yesterday to report shipments, with a total of more than 100,000 bags. Unexpectedly, the Customs then announced that exports from Shanghai would be limited to 45,000 bags per day, causing renewed panic among the merchants, who requested an increase in the quota. The Customs agreed to request instructions from above. Today is a weekly holiday, so the matter can only be resolved tomorrow. Today, shipments have already been made, including 8,000 bags on the Fusheng ship bound for Tianjin, and 20,050 bags on the Xinming ship bound for Fuzhou. It is also heard that the new ban includes a prohibition on the export of bran to foreign countries. It is well known that bran and soybean cake meal are primarily needed by Japan, with astonishing quantities being shipped there annually. Other countries have never been known to purchase them, so this ban will have a considerable impact on Japan.

The benchmark markets for flour and wheat remained open yesterday at the limited prices, with no change. As for spot market conditions, trading has commenced and is quite active, as flour can now be shipped as usual, except to the three northeastern provinces and Dalian ports. However, consignees must provide written guarantees before shipments can be reported. Bran, whether for export or transshipment, remains prohibited. Therefore, factories are still quoting 4.30 yuan for spot goods, with no sign of easing. As for wheat, medium-grade remains stable, while high-grade is slightly tight. Six-He wheat opened at 6.05 yuan, Xuancheng wheat at 6.04 yuan, Dongge wheat at 6.09 yuan, Huaian wheat at 6.08 yuan and 6.03 yuan for the second grade, Xiangnan wheat at 5.912 yuan, Wuxi wheat at 6.10 yuan and 6.09 yuan, Wenzhou wheat at 6.00 yuan, Hankou large-grain wheat at 5.97 yuan, and Yangzhou wheat at 6.05 yuan. Fuxin processed 6,000 bags, and Shenda processed 1,000 bags, it is said.

Shanghai Rice Stocks Amount to Approximately 480,000 Bags

In Shanghai, during this extraordinary period, the most important preparation work is whether the people's food supply is sufficient. This issue has long been a cause for concern, but the results of general large-scale estimates suggest that the city's stocks are only sufficient for a couple of months, and accurate statistics are still lacking. The grain industry lacks investigative organizations, and no official announcements have been made. There is an urgent need for these statistics for public reference, and it is an issue that cannot be delayed. Therefore, we are specifically listing the recent (23rd) rice stock quantities in various warehouses in the city based on our investigation:

Rice Industry Unites Not to Aid the Enemy

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 3,400 to 3,500 shi of goods arrived from various guilds. Sales in the street market remained sluggish, so few transactions were made. Only the Qingdao and Tianjin guilds sold just over 600 bags of Bo Dao rice. Merchants from Qinhuangdao, Dalian, Yingkou, Andong, and other guilds maintained an absolute refusal to trade, so although the goods arriving were not numerous, the market remained stable. The prices of thick and thin Japonica rice showed no gains or losses. Du Yangjian and Yin Bian Yuan were also stable.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about ten rice boats from various waterways downstream of the river arrived at the閘. The market opened in the morning, and merchants took some goods, but prices remained soft. Later, as customer sentiment strengthened, retail sales gradually increased, causing medium-grade white Japonica rice prices to recover from weakness. Very little high-grade white Japonica rice was inquired about, and prices remained weak. Bo Dao rice continued to arrive, with normal retail sales and slightly lower prices. Yang Du Jian prices were fixed, and Bai Yuan prices fell slightly by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan.

Customer Rice Production Prices Rise

Yesterday, guest rice (客秞) was difficult to prosper at the beginning, and sales became more active. In addition to continued brisk sales in this street, there were also small purchases from Beiyang and Ningbo. In the interior, Wuxi, Shantou, and Quanzhou were all greedy for imports. The total number of transactions reached around 15,000 bags. High and medium grades were stepped up by 0.01-0.02 to 0.03-0.05 yuan. Given the current active sales and rising prices in producing areas, even if there is an end to supplies, market prices will not easily fall. Yesterday, 7,824 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2,000 bags of Hansha unpolished rice, 4,550 bags of Hunan rice, and 100 bags of Yong Yuan rice were sold.

### Yarn and Cotton

Yarn Market Plunges Sharply - Uneven Distribution of Chips - Sparse Transactions but Large Fluctuations

After rising for two consecutive days, the yarn market suddenly reversed downward yesterday. This situation was due to the absence of major players and the strict crackdown on speculation. Registration procedures cannot be handled carelessly. According to market applications, there are five to six hundred applicants, but currently only forty or so have been approved after review. The uneven distribution of chips in the market makes transactions sparse, but the strength of fluctuations is significant. Furthermore, with a unanimous decline in the overseas American cotton, three-ply yarn market, market sentiment was affected, and the market plummeted along a straight line.

Standard Yarn Plunges by Four to Five Yuan

In the previous market session, standard yarn opened with a sharp decline for all months. The drop was sharp, as American cotton and downstream Japanese Osaka three-ply yarn plummeted by more than four yuan. This caused a sudden setback in market sentiment. The current month fell sharply by four yuan, while the remaining months fell by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The second session was triggered by heavy selling, and the current month rallied by two yuan. However, forward sales of spot yarn were heard to be less active than the previous day and appeared mediocre. By the close, the market re-entered a state of fatigue and fell again by over one yuan. As a result, standard yarn for all months fell sharply by 3.4 to 5.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Da Feng sold 250 bales, He Xing 800 bales, Chang Ji 600 bales, Chang Yu 250 bales, Feng Tai 200 bales, Shen Ji 550 bales, Yuan Da 400 bales, Run Kang 700 bales, and Xie Cheng 600 bales. Qing Da bought 300 bales, Yuan Da 500 bales, Sen Kang 1,100 bales, Tai Chang 360 bales, Yi Chang 200 bales, Yong Da 450 bales, Jin Kang 500 bales, and Yi Ji 100 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the half-day are listed on the left.

Spot Sales Less Than the Previous Day

A total of 1,015 bales were purchased by various guilds throughout the day, with a price drop of 0.02 yuan. The purchase amount of each guild is as follows:

Term Cotton Collapses - US Cotton Market Conditions Are Miserable - Domestic Weather Also Appears Favorable

The cotton market has resumed its downward trend, with a sense of endless decline. The catastrophic collapse of the US cotton market is exceptionally frightening. Predictions for the future suggest that the 0.11 yuan level will be difficult to maintain. As a result, market sentiment has declined, coupled with favorable domestic weather and good prospects for the harvest a month ago, resulting in a situation of collapse.

All Months Fall by 0.9 to Over 1 Yuan

In the previous market session, standard cotton opened with a decline of over thirty points in US cotton. The situation was very weak. Dagu three-ply cotton fell sharply by 1.8 to 2.2 yuan. As a result, the market was shaken, and selling resumed. All months fell by 0.8 to 0.9 yuan. After the second session, the yarn market was heard to be unstable, and the decline continued. As a result, standard cotton for all months fell sharply by 0.9 to 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Da Fu sold 4,100 dan, Da Ji 900 dan, Zhen Da 700 dan, He Xing 2,800 dan, Xing Chang 800 dan, Ren Feng 1,500 dan, Run Kang 3,000 dan, Xie Cheng 800 dan, Xin Cheng 3,300 dan, and Xin Hua 700 dan. Tong Xing bought 800 dan, Yuan Da 2,300 dan, Shen Chang 3,200 dan, Shen Ji 900 dan, Yuan Yi 3,800 dan, Yong Da 900 dan, Yi Kang 800 dan, Xin Chang 1,300 dan, and Chang He 3,300 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the half-day are listed on the left.

Factory Demand Also Appears Quiet

Spot cotton consumption has also entered a standstill. Due to the sharp fall in US cotton, spot prices have broken through the 0.12 yuan level. Trends are difficult to stabilize, and three-ply term cotton has fallen by 2.2 yuan. In this sharp decline, manufacturers are naturally hesitant, and factory demand is quiet. The Yao cotton arriving at the dock amounted to 240 bales.

Sunny Weather, Many Bulls Painfully Cut Losses - US Cotton Plummets by Over Thirty Points

Yesterday, US cotton opened with unfavorable news from Liverpool. The weather and cotton harvest conditions were favorable. Foreign merchants sold, and many bulls painfully cut their losses. All months fell by 7 to 11 points. After the recent sharp decline, sellers were hesitant, but buyers saw mediocre exports. Except for some industry players and Japanese merchants buying at limit prices, transactions were few, and there was caution. Hester estimated that factory consumption this week would be 157,000 bales, and Liverpool stocks would be 301,000 bales. Before the close, Roosevelt's statement that there was a possibility of 0.08 yuan per pound caused the public to sell, and market prices weakened again. Spot prices fell by 34 points, and futures fell by 31 to 36 points. British spot cotton fell by 8 points, and futures fell by 6 to 7 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to excessive rainfall, but returned due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and bulls taking profits. Pingguoer rose by 0.75 rupees, Aomu La fell by 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 23rd)

Three-Ply Yarn Strong, Cotton Weak - Qinghan Yarn Term and Spot Prices Fluctuating

▲Osaka, Osaka telegram on the 24th. Spot yarn prices rose and fell by 2 to 4 yuan. 16-count Sensu-men 237 yuan, up 2 yuan. 20-count Kingyo 258 yuan, up 4 yuan. 40-count Gosei 348 yuan, down 2 yuan. 42-count Kiji 365 yuan, down 2 yuan. Three-ply term yarn fell by 3.9 to 5.7 yuan, with the nearby month at 253.2 yuan and the distant month at 240 yuan. Term cotton fell by 1.8 to 2.2 yuan, with the nearby month at 70.8 yuan and the distant month at 72.2 yuan.

### Securities

Public Bond Market Conditions Chaotic - Some Floating Multiples Emerge... Others Add to Arbitrage

Yesterday, the public bond market conditions on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were chaotic. Initially, it turned downward due to an excessive sharp rise the day before, followed by rising interest in arbitrage trading, which raised market sentiment. Transactions for the current month have only Monday of next week left, so both long and short positions were generally able to break even with the help of arbitrage trading, preventing any major squeezing. Yesterday, those who had floated gains emerged, and arbitrageurs proceeded, so transactions were still strong. Nos. 4, 32, 43, and 46, etc. all had arbitrage transactions, with Nos. 6 and 54 buying, and Nos. 7 and 43 selling. In the second session, most returned to 0.06 to 0.08 yuan, while Class A alone was strong at 0.55 to 0.06 yuan. No. 10 had a larger quantity of purchases, and the trend spiraled upward. Whether the environment will change is difficult to predict. For the time being, there should be no major waves. Market prices fell slightly by 0.01 to 1.56 yuan, etc. The total number of transactions totaled 27.55 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)

US Stock Market Recovers After Rising

Yesterday (the 23rd), the New York stock market initially rose due to the failure of the comprehensive judicial reform plan, followed by profit-taking by long positions. The results were mixed, with 910,000 shares traded. According to broker opinions, there is no major risk of a decline at present.

### Finance

Foreign Exchange - Pound Loose, US Tight - Red Shells Continue to Fall, Standard Gold Steps Down

The foreign exchange market opened yesterday with London closing up 0.0625 for the near term and 0.125 for the distant term. The New York silver market was unchanged. The pound against the dollar narrowed by 0.08 cents, the pound against the franc fell by 0.38 cents, the pound against the yen was unchanged, the dollar against the pound narrowed by 0.0175 yuan, the dollar against the franc rose by 0.125 yuan, and the dollar against the yen rose by 0.03 yuan. The opening selling price for the near term was 1 shilling, 2.25 pence and 2.28125 pence per dollar, and the US dollar was 29.53125 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the pound was loose and the US dollar was tight. East Asian exchanges were also slightly looser at 102 yuan. After opening, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were sold at the current shilling rate and absorbed by banks. HSBC quotes for the pound and the US dollar were both flat, and the situation was calm. Later, banks traded among themselves, and the process spiraled. The afternoon closing selling price for the near term was 1 shilling, 2.25 pence and 2.28125 pence per dollar, and the US dollar was 29.53125 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the pound was loose and the US dollar was tight. The Japanese exchange rate was slightly looser at 102 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were sold at the shilling rate.

Yesterday, HSBC traded a large amount of current shipment Hong Kong position for 2.28125 shillings, which was favorably sold to Macgarry for a current rate of 2.28125 shillings, with a volume of about 50,000 pounds.

Yesterday, Hua Bi sold current shipments for 0.5625 to Da Tong, and Anda sold September contracts for 0.4375 to Da Tong, with a volume of about 300,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the Tianjin guild sold current shipments for 102.25 yuan to Zhengjin Sumitomo, and Mitsui Joseon sold July contracts for 101.875 yuan to foreign firms, with a volume of about 500,000 yuan.

The gold market fell slightly yesterday, and red shells continued to fall to 1170 yuan. Initially, the London spot gold price rose by 3.5 pence. The central bank's quotes were announced, and the British and American markets were flat. The customs gold unit rose by 0.04%, and the standard gold price rose to 1137.1 yuan. The morning opening was still 1142.5 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong continued to supply, and although Yi Yu bought, the afternoon closing still fell to 1142.3 yuan, falling 0.2 yuan compared to the previous closing and rising over 5 yuan compared to the closing price. Red shells stood at 1170 yuan, sold by Da Feng Heng to the Hankou guild for 100 taels, Sheng Yuan Yong for 50 taels, and Qing Fa Yong for 40 taels. Yesterday, Da Chang Xiang discounted Sheng Yuan Yuan for 3 yuan. There were 588 August contracts remaining, with 6 long positions and 5 short positions. There were 833 September contracts, with a total of 14 long positions and 9 short positions. There were 77 transactions in half a day.

### Silk and Tea

Export Silk Prices Gradually Converging

Yesterday, the silk market was mediocre abroad, while Shanghai gradually became more active. Orders from Europe and America and spot transactions were converging substantially. For example, Lienart bought 10 dan of 83.13 - 15-count white silk at 930 yuan, a firm and reliable deal. In other cases, a 16.18 grade Golden Double Eagle brand had a foreign limit price of 860 yuan, which was over 30 yuan away from the Shanghai market price. Ordinary B-brand foreign firms returned a price of 790 yuan, which Chinese merchants were willing to sell, but lately, silk production has coincided with the hot summer. Silk factories have felt insufficient water, so the export weight is often deficient. Therefore, silk merchants are quite hesitant and make few transactions. If French and American silk prices can continue to strengthen and receive higher sales offers that can offset the light weight loss, then foreign trade should be easier to close deals on. Yesterday, domestic silk sentiment recovered, and market prices rose slightly accordingly. There were 30 dan of opening orders and 10 dan of transactions by foreign firms.

Qimen Floral Scent Sells Quickly Upon Arrival

Qimen floral-scented black tea has been very popular since new goods arrived in Shanghai. Because the Russian Zhuang route is not weak and the British Zhuang have a large demand, it sells quickly upon arrival. Yesterday, 50 new patterns were displayed, and Jardine Matheson exclusively purchased 40 patterns, totaling over 2,000 boxes, with a fixed price of 33-34 yuan. As for other black teas, the General Distribution Office is currently planning the entire sales process. The Pingshui tea market had the China Tea Company handle 959 boxes of Du Zhan Kui Da Bang yesterday, pulling the price to 40.05 yuan. The movement of Mei tea remains active. Yuanzhu is sluggish, and the high-quality Zhen Mei tea from Luzhuang shows no signs of improvement. Stocks of Xiu Mei tea are already scarce, with steady sales and prices. Low-grade goods are more active, it is said.

### North and South Goods

Lily Flower Market Continues to Loosen

The price of new lily flower goods had an initial period of competition with high raises and low presses due to the uneven distribution of peers, but this has since returned to harmony. Recently, the sources from various producing areas have been prosperous, and the number of arrivals has flooded the market, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Selling prices have also gradually loosened. Currently, Da Xing tea is being offered at 107 yuan, with a market price of 23 yuan, and slightly inferior tea is at 22 yuan. Looking at the market situation in the future, if sales are low, there is still a risk of continued decline. However, top-grade high-quality Zhuang tea has not yet been seen.

### Piece Goods

Autumn Velvet Flannel Off-Market Sales Active

Recently, with the hot weather, the velvet flannel industry has been busy drying out mold, so transactions have been unusually slow. Both retail and wholesale transactions have decreased. Most businesses must pack and put away summer goods before starting autumn business. Therefore, summer goods sales are all seeing price decreases. Although autumn goods have not yet officially opened, momentum is extremely high. Yesterday, Dong Huo power is ordinary at 3.4 yuan, white beiji at 3.85 yuan, and 55 zhi gong at 5.5 yuan. Xi Huo 1111 white beiji at 5.2 yuan, Bai Sui Fang at 6.1 yuan, Hao Hua white zhi gong at 9 yuan, and Chang Tai stripes pang pi at 5.25 yuan. Guo Huo Da Guang Ming plain beiji at 2.95 yuan.

### Hardware

White Lead Skin Sales Active, Prices Rise

White lead skin sales have been strong due to the passing of the mold season and the battery factories starting work. Demand has suddenly increased. Recently, military factories and military needs have been frequent, so sales have become more active. Buying and selling in the market is becoming more lively, and sales offers have also advanced suddenly. Yesterday, fine pattern Nos. 2 and 3 sold for 168 yuan, No. 4 sold for 165 yuan, No. 5 and 6 sold for 158 yuan, No. 7 sold for 152 yuan, and Nos. 8 and 9 sold for 150 yuan. Other thick patterns also sold for 160 to 165 yuan.

### Anti-Heat Movement

— Mu Jie

Children! If you have paid attention to past current events, you may remember that Chen Yi, the chairman of Fujian Province last year, promoted a kind of anti-heat movement? He ordered the provincial government office staff to continue working as usual even in the sweltering heat. At that time, everyone thought that the anti-heat movement fully demonstrated the spirit of working, and they praised and responded to it.

What kind of content is the anti-heat movement I am talking about now?

The anti-heat movement I am talking about now is different from the path promoted by Director Chen. Roughly divided, it can be explained from two aspects:

On the one hand, pay attention to hygiene in summer and strive to prevent infectious diseases: because summer is the season when germs are most prosperous, and all kinds of diseases that endanger human lives are very prevalent. Flies and mosquitoes are introducing diseases to people anytime and anywhere. If you are slightly careless in your diet, daily life, and actions, dangerous diseases will come immediately. You are not very old yet, and you may not know how to pay attention to hygiene and prevent diseases. Then you must always ask your teachers and follow the teachers' careful instructions. Moreover, you must pay attention to hygiene in everything. Eat less food that is harmful to your stomach, change dirty clothes that are harmful to your health often, and always pay attention to your food, clothing, housing, and transportation.

On the other hand, do not relax the work you should do just because the weather is hot: because the hot summer weather makes people feel dizzy and sitting still may cause you to sweat profusely, let alone working as usual? Of course, it is extra difficult. I know that you often have this mentality: 'The weather is so hot, working is really uncomfortable, why not just enjoy the cool breeze and play for a while!' Oh no! This kind of mentality may feel comfortable for a while, but when you feel annoyed because you have not finished your work, children! I ask you, do you still feel comfortable? Therefore, no matter how hot the weather is, you should still do your work. You must not relax the work you should do just because the weather is hot.

During the long summer vacation, you must have many things you want to do. Let me tell you! Nothing is more important than the anti-heat movement. Do you want to spend the hot summer safely? Then you must start implementing the anti-heat movement from today.

Come! Children, work hard to promote the anti-heat movement!

### Ying'er's Diary

— Wang Yi

Drafting Summer Vacation Work

The alarm clock on the bedside table kept ringing incessantly, waking me up from my sleep. I rubbed my sleepy eyes and hung up the mosquito net. I only saw two or three squares of sunlight shining diagonally on the floor through the room. I looked at the clock again, and it clearly told me—it was seven o'clock.

As soon as I finished washing, Qin and Cheng arrived at my house one after another; it turned out that we had made an appointment yesterday after school broke for summer vacation to gather at my house today to discuss how to draft our summer vacation work? My father knew about this and was very happy. He earnestly said to us: ‘No matter how you plan your work, you should always pay attention to the spirit of sacrificing yourself for others, and your words and deeds should be consistent so that you do not waste your summer vacation.’

After a thorough discussion, we reached a conclusion agreed upon by everyone: the morning is our time for self-study; the afternoon is our time for service. Most people have their daily work in the morning, and we are also unwilling to sacrifice the precious time in the morning, so we set the morning time as our own time to read newspapers and books, do summer homework, and other work. In the afternoon, because most people take a nap and avoid the heat under the bean trellis and melon rack after finishing their work in the morning, we are willing to use this time to do our work of serving the community. In this work, we divide it into three aspects to implement: first, diligent study; second, explaining current affairs news; and third, practicing singing patriotic songs.

In the afternoon, we went to the district office together to ‘meet with the district chief, and convey this meaning to him, asking him to help us from the side. He agreed very much and encouraged us. After returning home, I wrote a letter to the teacher, asking him to criticize and teach us more about our summer vacation community service work.

### Introducing a Few Child Stars

— Zhen Sheng

㊂ Mou Ling

At the Shanghai Municipal Government's 10th Anniversary celebration, the Oriental Hollywood Night unfolded at the city stadium. Many brilliant stars shone brightly, illuminating the earth with starlight. Mou Ling, a naive little child star, also appeared to participate in the grand event, performing a tap dance, leaving a deep impression on many viewers!

The name Mou Ling is probably not as well known as Juan Juan and Rong Rong. The reason is that she is a new child star in the film industry! She is also the youngest, only seven years old this year. She is from Chongqing, Sichuan, the same town as Juan Juan. Her father, Mou Hongyi, graduated from South Manchuria Medical College, and her mother, Chen Baojian, is a top student at Tongde Obstetrics Hospital. They are both doctors who save people and treat the world. They only have her as a daughter. She is the apple of their eye. She has no brothers or sisters, so they like and care for her especially. Xu Suling, the director of Yihua Company, is a good friend of her father and often goes to her house to play. Seeing such a naive and lively little girl, and because the Yihua authorities were thinking of finding and creating a little child star, they asked Mou Ling's parents for their consent. Mou Ling herself was also very happy to hear this. After discussing some of the procedures that needed to be handled, both parties signed a five-year contract. It has been seven or eight months since then. She is currently studying in Class B of the first grade at Weida Primary School on Chen Lingde Road. Every morning, her mother takes her in her own car, first to Gujiazhai Park for a walk, doing some stretching exercises and fitness exercises, breathing fresh air. After lunch, the car picks her up again. When school is over in the evening, her mother personally picks her up again. When she comes back, she goes through Gujiazhai Park and runs in to rest and walk for an hour or two before going home. Besides studying, she also studies under tap dance expert Ji Fengchun, just like Juan Juan. Because she is very smart, she has already gained some insight in less than a month. After a month, she has truly become proficient. During the summer vacation, she studies very diligently. She told me that she likes to study arithmetic the most. “＋12＝15”, “45－20＝25” are often silently recited in her small mouth. Sometimes she gets confused about multiplication and division. If she doesn't get the answer, she would rather not rest for two hours, working tirelessly! Maybe she will be a mathematician in the future.

### The Airman and the Glider (Part 2)

— Dong Xun

The structure of a glider is similar to that of a small airplane, except that it lacks an engine. Therefore, it needs the assistance of another power source to take off. The best place for a test flight is a large plain surrounded by gently sloping mountains or a seashore, with forests nearby being the least suitable.

Gliders are further divided into two types: gliders for preliminary gliding practice and gliders for long-duration flights in rising air currents. During flight, either human power or steam engine power (see Figures 5, 6, and 7) is used to tow them up from flat ground or plateaus. After reaching a certain altitude, the towrope is released, allowing them to fly freely in the sky at a speed of up to 1.5 meters per second (see Figure 8).

Currently, the world's largest glider is the "Austria I," designed by Dr. Kober of Austria, with a wingspan of 30 meters (see Figure 9).

Recently, China's aviation school plans to build a glider for a demonstration at the next National Games, and the Eurasia Aviation Corporation also plans to manufacture several to promote the sport.

Gliders can also be arranged in a train and towed in the air by airplanes or airships. The United States and Germany have experimented with this, and the results have been excellent. The Soviet Union once used an airplane to tow three gliders for 3,550 kilometers in 39 hours, truly making it an 'aerial train'!

### Loyalty (6)

— Xin

They were now determined to elect a commander-in-chief to oversee all military affairs. Marquis de Lescure nominated Cassarino, the peddler, because he was the first to raise an army. This was truly a strange thing; so many nobles, gentlemen, and other experienced military officers who had received military education were willing to obey the command of this uneducated peddler, without any selfish or jealous thoughts. Cassarino also showed no signs of pride, remaining as humble as ever. However, his every action and every word demonstrated his intelligence and competence, truly deserving the title of 'Saint of Anjou' given to him by the peasants. At this time, their hopes reached their peak; their numbers had increased considerably, and all their weapons were much better. They had even discussed how to march on Paris, welcome the young master back, and crown him in the capital town of La Fontenay, reorganizing their government.

Cassarino led his troops and turned towards the area of Nantes, leaving Henry and a group of peasants to defend Saumur. However, he could not prevent them from returning to their hometowns, because they were homesick, there was nothing to do at the moment, and they did not understand the importance of defense, so they slipped away to their homes one by one. In the end, only Henry and a few officers were left. Every night, they would go to the places that should be guarded and shout, 'Long live the King!' to show that they were prepared. Unfortunately, the number of people decreased more and more, until only eight people were left. Henry could not maintain the defense, so he had to leave Saumur and contact the comrades in the Anjou area. At that time, they luckily rescued a group of priests who had been imprisoned by the enemy and were about to be executed. The priests were happy and grateful, thanking the peasants who had rescued them. The peasants hurriedly said, 'Don't thank us, we were fighting for you in the first place. If we couldn't save you, we wouldn't dare to return to our homes. Now you are free, which shows that God is still helping us.'

However, the situation changed again. The Paris government sent a strong force to the Bocage region, brutally burning and killing. Clisson was burned to the ground, even the gunpowder factory was destroyed. Marquis de Lescure had anticipated that his hometown would inevitably suffer, but in order to reassure the people, he did not move anything from his mansion. His family had long been united with the army, and only by following the army could the weak and helpless be safe. Cassarino's attack on Nantes also unfortunately failed, and he himself was seriously injured. He died a few days later, but he was very willing to die for his loyalty to the country.

### Resistance

— Zhen

On a Sunday, Min'er and his brother Cong'er were playing ball on the small lawn at home. While they were having a great time, Min'er accidentally kicked the ball far away with great force, but after a while, it gradually stopped. He unconsciously thought of this question: how did it stop? So he opened his mouth and asked his brother.

His brother said, 'The ball rolls on the ground and stops after a while, so we can guess that there must be a force between the ground and the surface of the ball that can make the ball gradually stop. Although we cannot see this force, it must exist. Otherwise, why would the ball stop on its own? We call this force resistance. Resistance is the opposite of a driving force, and it often reduces the effectiveness of the driving force. For example, if we walk too much, our feet will feel sore, which is also due to resistance, isn't it reducing the effectiveness of the work? So we consider this resistance to be the most annoying thing, so we often try to eliminate it. For example, isn't it necessary to add oil to the axles of machines from time to time? This is all to reduce its impact.'

'Then, if we don't need this resistance, wouldn't it be better to make the machine produce more things?'

'No, it also has its uses, and we use this resistance in many places. If there were no resistance in the world, it wouldn't work, and nothing could move on the road. The reason why we can walk is thanks to resistance, otherwise we can only use our feet to resist the ground and move our feet. Why is the ice surface so slippery? This is because the resistance on the ice surface is small, so we cannot go on the ice. Similarly, if there were no resistance, a ladder could not lean against the wall for us to go up and down the stairs. Let me give you another example: if a rickshaw is pulled and produces a driving force, this driving force is forward, but resistance occurs between the wheels and the ground. Because resistance is backward, the two forces are in opposite directions, so they become a relative force that makes the wheels turn forward. If there were no resistance, the wheels would only turn in place and would not move forward. So resistance is essential to us, we need it very much, but at the same time we hate it. Something is both beneficial and harmful, so we only look at whether it helps us or harms us, and if it is harmful, we should always try our best to reduce it.'

Talk

### On Reading Zhang Zizhong's Talk

— Shi Yi

Having said "Zhang will never do anything to betray the people," yet being the most active in running around for the so-called "peace negotiations," Zhang Zizhong recently published a talk, in which he said: "One should know that China is a whole country, and the Chinese nation is a whole nation. If it is a matter of the entire country, it should be handled by the central government. If it is only a local matter, one should obey the orders of the Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council..."

Then, is the Lugouqiao Incident a "whole incident" or a "local incident"?

"China is a whole country, and the Chinese nation is a whole nation." The movement of a single hair affects the whole body. Since Hebei-Chahar is Chinese territory, the events that occur within Hebei-Chahar are naturally national events.

Regarding the Lugouqiao Incident as a planned conspiracy by the enemy, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had already said it at the Lushan talks. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said: "Our Northeast Provinces have been lost for six years. Following the Tanggu Truce, the conflict point has now reached Lugouqiao at the gate of Beiping. If Lugouqiao can be coerced and forcibly occupied, then Beiping, our five-hundred-year-old ancient capital, the center of northern political culture, and a military stronghold, will become Shenyang the second. If today's Beiping becomes yesterday's Shenyang, today's Hebei-Chahar will also become yesterday's Northeast Provinces. If Beiping can become Shenyang, why can't Nanjing become Beiping?" From this, we can see that no matter from which point of view, the Lugouqiao Incident is definitely not a "local incident."

But what is strange is that without the approval of the central government, the 37th Division, which was resisting the enemy, was driven back to a defensive area outside "the Beiping area."

Taking ten thousand steps back, the Lugouqiao Incident can be resolved by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. But is the Hebei-Chahar Political Council an administrative organ belonging to the central government? Is it "obeying orders" for an administrative organ belonging to the central government not to adhere to the four minimum requirements indicated by the central government?

If it is said that it is not, then how can one explain "China is a whole country, and the Chinese nation is a whole nation!"

Director Li of the 29th Army's Shanghai Office said at a Shandong fellow villagers association reception: "I hope that the public opinion circle will do more encouraging articles and less stimulating arguments, so as not to fall into the enemy's trap." I think that this statement is correct in principle, and it is not limited to the 29th Army. But if unfortunately some people have already "fallen into the enemy's trap," then even if they want to write "encouraging articles," they will have no way to start.

### The Mentality of "Civilization"

— Yin Ti

When I was a child, I often read stories and phrases such as "judging the heart of a gentleman by the mind of a petty person" in novels. Looking up and observing the relationships between people, this kind of phenomenon does exist. But at that time, I always thought that this was a special product of China, or at least it was only among "barbaric" nations that this kind of mentality would arise.

But later, reading international news every day, I suddenly discovered that this kind of mentality is not only a unique "advantage" of "barbaric" nations, but the more "civilized" a country is, the more obvious this kind of mentality becomes. Even in "benevolent" countries, apart from expressing this kind of mentality more strongly and obviously, there are no more brilliant ideas. At this point, I fully understood that the mentality of "judging the heart of a gentleman by the mind of a petty person" is quite "civilized," and not at all barbaric or contradictory.

These past few days, the Sino-Japanese relationship has become increasingly tense.

## Page 20

Following this, I read a piece of news in the newspaper:

"Nanjing, 22nd dispatch from this newspaper" According to sources in relevant circles: Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the staff and expatriates of our embassy have been under close surveillance. There are many plainclothes detectives and policemen stationed near the embassy. When staff members go out, plainclothes detectives closely follow behind them, obliterating the dignity and privileges of diplomats. This is truly an evil precedent that has never existed in any country in the world. Chen Bosheng, the special correspondent stationed in Tokyo by the Central News Agency, has also been under close surveillance by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department since the incident occurred. In addition to being followed by detectives in every move, he has also been given a car. No matter where he goes, he must ride in that car, and the driver must report Chen's actions to the authorities every day...

Japan could originally be called a "espionage state." Not only does it have a dense network of detectives everywhere in the country, but it also has a considerable number of detectives operating abroad. Those operating in China under the cover of "×××" and "××××" stickers are even too numerous to count.

Effortlessly seizing the Northeast Provinces, propping up the puppet Puyi, establishing the rebellious Yin Rugeng's false autonomy, alienating Inner Mongolia... etc., these are all the proud masterpieces of these bigwigs. Kawashima Yoshiko, Doihara, and Major General Matsumuro are all "stars" in their history of aggression.

Having become accustomed to doing this kind of thing themselves, they cannot help but suspect that others are also operating on their own territory. This is "human nature." This is the concrete manifestation of the so-called mentality of "judging the heart of a gentleman by the mind of a petty person."

In old Chinese novels, there are often stories of "police officers who were originally thieves." Originally, "police officers" are specifically for catching thieves, and only thieves themselves are most familiar with the behavior of thieves. Therefore, using thieves to be "police officers" is truly appropriate. But there may be problems, and they are big ones. Because they themselves have done this kind of thing, they are naturally particularly careful about this kind of thing. Therefore, even an extremely ordinary little thing will often cause their suspicion, and even "stir up waves without wind," so that in the end, people will laugh crookedly, and they themselves will end up neither crying nor laughing.

### Pitiful Worm

— Guan Yinxi

In that exquisite, somewhat Oriental-style wine tavern, I often met him, a thin, honest fisherman. Wearing tattered clothes and a sorrowful, unkempt face. With his attire and his face, he didn't seem like someone who often came to wine taverns, but in fact, I often ran into him. As soon as he stepped in the door, everything else ceased to exist. He would hang his head dejectedly and go straight to the unnoticed table in the darkest corner to sit and worry, his eyes dull and staring blankly at the ground.

He never participated in anyone's conversations, drinking a little wine, or eating some snacks. When the wine tavern opened, he was the first customer to come in, and when it closed, he was the last customer to leave. In this fishing village, he was considered half a person, because in people's eyes, his whole body was numb, dead, with only a vague consciousness.

Stories about him were circulated by people in the form of anecdotes. A friend told me:

"Don't look at him as a fool, he used to have a good life. But a woman ruined him. He fell too hard three years ago and still can't get up."

These words aroused my strong interest, and I decided to pay him a visit. Therefore, on a quiet, midsummer night, I walked along the beach towards the fisherman's shack where he lived. The house was built of oyster shells mixed with mud, small, damp, and chaotic. Moonlight shone in from the window, illuminating some rotten furniture, revealing infinite melancholy and desolation. I stood there and groped for about a minute, but saw nothing.

"He hasn't come back yet," I thought, and started to walk back along the same route.

The beach was bare, the moonlight shone dazzlingly in the air, and a faint light shot out from the sand grains. Everything was quiet around, the tide had receded, and the sea was resting. I was very eager to walk on the beach. After no more than five minutes, a black spot caught my eye. I walked along a row of footprints to look at him, and it was indeed that "half a person." He was sitting there indifferently and sadly, staring foolishly at the sea, like a dead man. When I approached, he didn't even move.

"I came to see you especially, friend!" I said, starting with the words I had planned.

He still didn't move, as if he hadn't heard.

"Because people are spreading stories about your life that I find deeply interesting."

He shrugged slightly, raised his eyes, and looked at me sadly, his gaunt face full of sadness and timidity, as if saying, "Is that so?"

"So I wanted to talk to you," I concluded finally.

His eyes left me, lowered, and fell onto his chest.

"Are you willing to tell me? I want to hear about your past." I sat down beside him.

"Past?" he repeated to himself in a low voice for the first time, his voice very hoarse and weak. "Are you the gentleman from the city?" He suddenly became excited and stared fiercely at me in a histrionic manner. "Is that so? I saw you in the tavern."

I agreed that it was exactly what he had guessed.

"Then you've seen a lot of people?" he asked carefully.

"Of course! There are all kinds of people in the city..." I replied with a smile.

"Have you seen a woman? A short but sturdy woman."

"There are plenty of such women there, as many as you want to see."

"Is that really so? My wife is just such a person!" he sighed, changing to another tone and saying sadly, "Three years ago, when I went out to sea, she was abducted by a Japanese from the fishing cooperative using a boat. I still haven't found her yet. But she's a good woman, she wouldn't leave me, she'll come back. Therefore, I often go to the tavern to wait. Last year, I met a man there who told me that he saw her in a brothel in Taiwan. She told him that she was about to return and told me to wait in the tavern."

"Do you believe this is true?"

"Why wouldn't it be true? She wouldn't lie to me," he said, firmly revealing a smile.

As I walked away, he still saw me off for a while behind me, whispering:

"If you, sir, go back to the city and meet her, please take a message to her for me..."

I replied, waved my hand, and walked away. All the way home, I was still constantly disturbed by the pitiful fate of this pitiful worm.
