(D) The resolution to conclude the Preparatory Committee. Resolution: Passed. After the discussion was completed, Wu Dingchang gave a speech, stating that he had two points he hoped all members of the Preparatory Committee would convey to the shareholders: (1) The government's initiation of this company is not to compete with the people for profit. The government's subscription of shares is for promotion and not for profit. Therefore, if commercial shares exceed the quota, government shares can be transferred. (2) Since the government is not established to compete with the people for profit, the company is also not established to place personnel from various parties. Therefore, it is hoped that all shareholders will conduct the election of directors and supervisors with a fair and impartial attitude. In the future, the recruitment of company employees will also be absolutely open, so that people can be selected for the job and not the job created for the person. Then the future of the national products movement will have unlimited brightness and hope. After Wu's speech, he announced the adjournment of the meeting. At 7 p.m. on the 9th, Wu specially hosted a banquet at the Queen's Hotel to entertain the members of the Preparatory Committee to show his appreciation.

### Registration of Smuggled Goods in Tianjin Begins

The British and French Concessions are Willing to Assist; The Municipal Government Asks the Customs to Thoroughly Inspect.

[Tianjin] The registration of smuggled goods in Tianjin began on the 9th. The Customs negotiated with the authorities of the British and French Concessions. The British Concession readily agreed to assist, and the French Concession is also expected to be able to cooperate. The Italian Concession originally had no shops and does not need inspection. Only the Japanese Concession still has many more than 30 smuggling foreign firms and unscrupulous merchants, and it is fundamentally difficult to discuss this matter with them. The Customs is generally optimistic about handling this matter. (Special dispatch, 9th)

[Tianjin] The Municipal Government, based on the presentation of the Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter to the Customs Tax Department, stating that all merchants should comply with the Customs' anti-smuggling and inspection measures and register smuggled goods. It hopes that the Customs will thoroughly ban smuggling and strictly inspect all important land and water routes in the recent two to three months to cut off the source, so that legitimate merchants will not be harmed after the registration of smuggled goods. (Special dispatch, 9th)

[Tianjin] According to Customs information, the peak period of smuggled goods entering Tianjin this spring saw as many as 14,000 pieces arriving daily. Last month, there were still 4,000 to 5,000 pieces per day. Now it has fallen to only more than 200 pieces per day. If all the smuggled goods stored in Tianjin are registered, the total value will reach 30 million yuan. Although the smuggling south from Tianjin has not been completely eliminated, it is only in small batches. Smuggled goods on passenger trains on the Jinpu Railway have disappeared due to the strict interception by the Dezhou Inspection Branch. (Special dispatch, 9th)

[Tianjin] The number of smuggled goods transported from Yingkou, Dalian, and other places to Beidaihe in northeastern Hebei is decreasing daily. This is due to the impact of the excessive stockpiling of smuggled goods in Tianjin and the strict crackdown. The puppet organization, due to the relationship with military and political expenses, is planning to expand sales channels for merchants who smuggle goods to Chahar and Shanxi. The highways in Changping, Yutian, and other places are being rushed to build to facilitate the movement of heavy trucks. Japanese people are buying large quantities of copper coins in Tianjin, and a certain bank in a certain concession is entrusted by them. When Japanese ships arrive, they secretly transport them in large quantities for domestic military and industrial use. On the 8th, the police intercepted a sack of copper coins weighing 285 pounds purchased from Qing County and confiscated it. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Tianjin Municipal Government to inquire about the incident last month in which a Korean smuggler injured a porter named Li Baogui with a gun at the East Railway Station, intending to protest to the Japanese side. (Special dispatch, 9th)

[Tianjin] The Tianjin Customs has received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that anyone who colludes with foreigners to smuggle goods worth more than 10,000 yuan will be sentenced to death, and the administrative authorities are requested to carry out the sentence. The Tianjin Customs issued a public notice to all parties on the 9th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

### Kodama Meets Sato, Suggests Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations

Concrete Policies to be Decided After Kawagoe Returns Home; Yasukawa Yunosuke to Visit China Alone for Inspection

[Tokyo] Kodama Ryukichi, the head of the economic observation mission to China, visited Foreign Minister Sato on the afternoon of the 8th and reported on the situation in China and the content of his exchange of views with key Chinese figures in the business community. He made some suggestions regarding the adjustment of relations between the two countries and the promotion of economic cooperation. He left after two hours. The gist of Kodama's suggestion is that China is now striving towards the goal of a unified nation, and the people are also cautiously devoting efforts to assisting the government. Japan should correctly recognize this fact and implement various policies. As for the issue of economic cooperation, opinions have been fully communicated with each other, so it is not impossible for the two countries to work together to adjust their relations in the future. Foreign Minister Sato also valued Kodama's opinions and plans to discuss China policy with relevant authorities in the coming days, and implement concrete policies after Ambassador Kawagoe returns home. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 9th)

[Tokyo] Regarding the meeting between Kodama Kenji and Foreign Minister Sato Naotake, the authorities are maintaining strict secrecy. It is widely believed that Kodama reported on his trip to China and suggested ways to adjust relations with China. When this matter was raised to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was said that they only knew that Kodama and Sato had met, and nothing about the content was announced. However, this morning, all newspapers published Kodama's suggestions in a prominent position, which can be divided into two categories:

(1) Politically, Kodama suggested adjusting the political relations in North China, especially the puppet organization in eastern Hebei and the smuggling issue, which should be implemented voluntarily as a preliminary step to break the Sino-Japanese deadlock. It is said that Kodama explained to Sato that both the Chinese government and the public hope that Japan can make a decisive decision on this issue. Kodama personally suggested that the Japanese government should satisfy China's wishes as soon as possible.

(2) Economically, Kodama, in addition to explaining the rapid economic construction of China in recent years, and mentioning the progress of Britain in China and South China, strongly argued for the urgent need for economic cooperation with China, and suggested the establishment of government agencies to adjust and promote Japanese economic activities in China. Regarding the latter, many specific plans were put forward for government adoption. It is heard that Sato will consult with Ambassador Kawagoe, who is expected to return to China in late April or early May, and then formulate his own policy. Kodama will hold talks with Finance Minister Yuki Toyotaro, Kodama Hideo, and other important government officials on the issue of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations in the next few days.

### Key Points for Improving Sichuan Province's Finances

[Nanjing] The joint budget for Sichuan Province and the Central Government for the 26th year of the Republic, after Guan Jiyu, the special commissioner of the provincial finances, and Liu Hangchen, the director of the finance department, came to Beijing to repeatedly consult with the Ministry of Finance, has been roughly compiled. Revenue and expenditure can barely be balanced, and it is said that concrete decisions can be made in the coming days. It is reported that there will be significant improvements in Sichuan Province's finances in the 26th year of the Republic, and the key points are as follows: ① Sichuan's land tax was collected four times a year in the 25th year of the Republic. In order to reduce the suffering of the people of Sichuan, the Central Government has decided to reduce and exempt one collection in the 26th year of the Republic, changing it to three collections a year. ② Sichuan's local taxes were listed at 5 million yuan in the 25th year of the Republic. The Central Government believes that this type of tax revenue is similar to likin (internal transit tax) and especially hinders the development of Sichuan's foreign trade. Although it was not possible to completely abolish it in the 26th year of the Republic due to heavy expenditures, it has been decided to first reduce the collection by approximately 3 million yuan, with the aim of gradually reducing the restrictions on Sichuan's foreign trade. ③ Sichuan's business tax was only piloted in areas such as Rong, Yu, and Wan in the 25th year of the Republic. In the 26th year of the Republic, it has been decided to gradually promote it in counties and cities with prosperous businesses throughout the province, with the aim of cultivating good sources of tax revenue.

### Ministry of Education Orders Training of Teachers for Civilian Schools

[Nanjing] Since the implementation of supplementary education for illiterate civilians by the Ministry of Education, according to reports from various provinces and cities, the number of enrollees has exceeded 12 million, which is in line with the original planned quantity. However, in the 26th year of the Republic, there should be 20 million illiterate civilians who need to receive this supplementary education, requiring more than 100,000 teachers. In the future, it will be necessary to increase the number by 40,000 each year. It is urgent to pre-train this huge number of teachers. To facilitate the smooth implementation in the future, the training of civilian education cadres and civilian school teachers in various provinces and cities should be handled conscientiously. Special regulations for training classes for civilian education cadres and measures for training classes for civilian school teachers in various provinces and cities have been formulated. On the 9th, an order was issued to various education departments and bureaus, instructing them to follow the regulations and select qualified students to receive training in Beijing before May 30.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Legend of the World Economic Peace Conference

— Hua

Recently, the World Sugar Conference was held in London. Political and diplomatic figures from many countries attended. In addition to discussing the world's sugar production issues, the conference also touched on general economic issues. At this time, two rumors have emerged internationally. One rumor is that US President Roosevelt will soon initiate a World Economic Peace Conference to discuss economic cooperation between countries and the joint reduction of armaments. Another rumor is that the British and French governments have suggested to the Italian government that Prime Minister Mussolini contact various countries to discuss eliminating trade barriers and promoting international economic peace. The former rumor has been denied by US Secretary of State Hull, while the latter has been accepted in principle by Mussolini, who has begun conducting investigations. According to general observations, the time for convening a world economic conference is probably not yet ripe. However, in any case, the emergence of this news has received widespread attention.

The emergence of the above news and the widespread attention it has received are not accidental. Last month, British Secretary of Commerce Runciman visited the US, including factors of economic and political cooperation between Britain and the US when visiting the White House authorities. This sugar conference held in London was attended by the US representative Davis. Davis can be said to be the US diplomatic envoy stationed in Europe. His attendance at the sugar conference is said to have been with the intention of discussing a plan for an international peace conference with the chairman of the sugar conference, MacDonald. Therefore, many people believe that if this sugar conference can achieve some success, it can further discuss a more active plan for international economic cooperation.

The current international political and economic situation has indeed reached a critical juncture. On the surface, the politics of many countries are stable, and their economies are recovering to prosperity. But in reality, countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan have established military fascist systems. The entire country has lost its free will and is rushing towards the dangerous path of war and destruction. Due to the all-out arms race of these countries, Britain, the US, France, the Soviet Union, and even general countries, large and small, are forced to expend huge amounts of manpower and financial resources on war preparations. In terms of the economy, the appearance of prosperity is really limited to the military industry and various departments related to war. The result of this prosperity is to prepare for a great destruction. Many keen observers are now predicting that if this situation continues, some countries will either quickly launch a war or only fall into their own implosion.

Japan's invasion of China, Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, Germany and Italy's reckless interference in the Spanish Civil War, and their unified proposal to redistribute world colonies and open up undeveloped resources can all show their hasty, chaotic, and blind actions. And in order to actively prepare for war and attempt armed plunder, they have to use limited resources to create so-called self-sufficient economic states, raise tariffs, restrict imports, and manage exchange rates. In countries with abundant resources such as Britain and the US, they are also taking urgent steps to create economic blocs centered on themselves. Britain at the Ottawa Imperial Conference and the US at the Pan-American Conference both hold such intentions. So, on the eve of the second world military collision, we first see a stage of intense economic collision.

Many countries are concerned about the arrival of war, so they hope to hold an economic peace conference at this time, hoping to ease this economic collision, and thereby also ease the great military collision. However, in the current political situation, this hope is also very slim. Britain believes that lowering tariff barriers is not necessary, and Japan believes that the requirement for this conference is that Britain should first lift import restrictions. According to the German opinion, it is believed that general economic cooperation can only be discussed after the three issues of foreign debt, colonies, and raw materials are resolved. Obviously, with each country adhering to such a fortified attitude, the issue of world economic peace will always be just empty talk.

### Japanese Military Actively Participates in Elections

Seeks to expand influence among the people, openly rejects liberalism

[Tokyo] As the Japanese nationwide general election campaign is underway, the Ministry of the Army, regardless of whether a new party can be formed, is now doubling its efforts to independently spread its political influence among the people to suppress the governmental trends within established political parties. This trend is becoming increasingly apparent. Minister of the Army Sugiyama Moto yesterday solemnly declared to 600 retired generals at a gathering of retired officers that since the army is the central force in advancing the nation's destiny, it should not be limited to the position of a driving force, but should instead maintain the position of a pioneer. This statement has greatly agitated society, which has assessed it as "the first voice of the Minister of the Army." Furthermore, the commanders of all divisions in Japan recently held a meeting. At the conclusion of the meeting, the so-called three chiefs of the army informed the divisional commanders at a farewell gathering that the key leaders of the military are deeply concerned about the lack of accurate understanding of political parties regarding the situation, and instructed them to instill in the soldiers, and also in the people within the areas of their respective armies, an accurate understanding of the army upon their return to their posts. At the same time, news has spread to Tokyo that local associations of retired servicemen have put forward slogans such as "electing people who have an accurate understanding of national defense and the national polity and who have strong魄力" and "rejecting liberalism," provoking a fierce struggle against established political parties. The slogans of the proletarian party call out to "reject dictators" and "protect constitutionalism." (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] On the ninth day of the election campaign, the political battle has intensified. From the morning of the ninth, a large number of candidates have been nominated, and by noon, the number has exceeded 500. However, compared with the previous year, it is still at a disadvantage, with a large difference of more than 200. Both the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties have fewer candidates than last year. The Seiyūkai, which started later, has gradually engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Minseitō. The nomination of candidates has now spread throughout the country, but compared with the situation during the campaign period last year, when the Minseitō was pulled over by more than 40 candidates on the ninth day, there is no such boldness yet. The factions within the Seiyūkai are still stuck in a stalemate, and neutral factions are suddenly making a comeback with new candidates entering the arena. This, when contrasted with the government's statement on the new party movement, has a deep meaning. As for whether more than 200 candidates can be produced between this afternoon and evening, and compete with last year's number of candidates, has become the focus of interest. In short, the struggle of the second phase of the political battle is reaching its climax. As of 2 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, the number of candidates nationwide is as follows, totaling 581.

### World Textile Conference

Chinese Representative's Speech

[Washington] At the World Textile Conference today, the Chinese representative, Ying Shangde, spoke, criticizing a certain country's people for armed smuggling in China, and the government of that country appearing to tacitly condone it. Ying also touched on the issue of foreigners infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, stating that some countries enjoy extraterritorial rights in China, using concessions as shields to evade Chinese law, leading to unfair competition. The Chinese market has long been fought over by various industrial countries, and the Chinese government cannot freely increase or decrease tariffs to protect emerging domestic industries. Powerful nations take the opportunity to dump surplus goods in China. China currently loses one million yuan in tax revenue every week due to smuggling. If foreign forces continue to protect smuggling, legitimate businesses will be driven to bankruptcy. This is truly a struggle between justice and power, law and chaos, merchants and pirates. China originally had plans to improve its industries, but they are often obstructed and cannot develop. China could be a major customer, but due to foreign exploitation, its purchasing power cannot increase. China hopes for an open door policy, but a certain foreign force obstructs it. A large number of foreign troops are still stationed in China, constantly interfering in internal affairs. However, the Chinese government is still making efforts to cooperate with various countries to solve industrial problems, it is said. British labor representative, Dickin, stated that Japan should submit reports on the weekly and daily working hours of its rayon industry. French labor representative, Robertma, opposed the proposition that Asian workers' working hours and wages should be treated exceptionally, arguing that industrial stability must be based on the whole world, and at least part of Asian factories must implement a 40-hour work week. Eighteen years ago, various countries had already decided to adopt a 48-hour work week, but factories in the Far East have not yet implemented it, it is said. US President Roosevelt also held a tea party outside the conference at the White House today, hosting representatives from various countries at the textile conference, claiming that those who advocate a 40-hour work week are moving forward on the path to improving society, it is said.

I must arrive in London around 3:00 PM Greenwich Mean Time (11:00 PM Shanghai time on the 9th). If I can land in London as scheduled at 3:00 PM, the total time required for the entire journey will be 94 hours.

### Japanese Government and Public Hold Celebration Rally

Home-Built Airplane Actually Succeeds - British and French People Cease Not Praising and Envying

[Tokyo] The "Kamikaze" airplane has already covered most of the journey, completing the aviation record for connecting Asia and Europe, which is completely confirmed.

First, the ministers will give congratulatory speeches, followed by dances, music, and other entertainments.

[Paris] When the "Kamikaze" landed at the Bourget Aerodrome in Paris, hundreds of Japanese residents in France gathered at the airfield, all holding Japanese flags to welcome it. A large Japanese flag was also displayed on the roof of the airfield's office building. As for the ash-green French military aircraft and civilian aircraft of various colors, dozens of them soared near Paris to welcome it. At that time, as the "Kamikaze" flew in, it was surrounded and escorted by French aircraft. Thousands of spectators gathered at the airfield, cheering like thunder. Before long, the silver, dazzling heroic figure was displayed on the white-lined airfield. Thousands of spectators showed amazement on their faces, believing that French aviators had made several efforts but had not yet achieved the 100-hour connection record between Tokyo and Paris, but it was actually achieved by Eastern warriors, which was very amazing and admirable. Therefore, many celebrities shook hands and spoke happily with aviators Iinuma and Tsukagoshi, and there was quite a rush, it is said. (9th Allied Electric)

[London] The "Kamikaze"'s speed has amazed Londoners. Even aviation experts are making every effort to praise the aircraft made in Japan, because it has created such a record in just four days since departing from Tokyo, which is truly not an easy task.

Also, the same company of the puppet Security Team encountered about 100 members of the Volunteer Army Jinshanhao unit at Gan Gouzi in the ninth district at 3:00 PM on the 31st and fought fiercely for up to five hours. Also, the Benxi puppet Security Team No. 1 Company, in conjunction with the Japanese army unit, encountered more than 50 members of the Volunteer Army Zhu Haile unit while searching the border of the county at 8:00 AM on March 27, and fought each other for three hours. In the above battles, both sides suffered casualties and losses of guns and ammunition, but the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavier losses. Also, San Yun, a sergeant under the command of the puppet Security Team Guerrilla Cavalry Regiment of Fushun County in the puppet First Military District, encountered about 300 members of the Korean Revolutionary Army Kim Il-sung unit at a height east of Daying in the county at about 4:30 PM on March 28. They immediately engaged in battle. In this battle, the puppet military officer Major Zhang Guixin, the company commander, and many other soldiers, including Private Gong Mingxiang, were killed. The Korean Revolutionary Army won a complete victory.

Zhao Shangzhi Unit

Machida, the captain of the Japanese Takeuchi unit guarding the vicinity of Longmen Mule on the North Hei Line, upon learning that the Zhao Shangzhi unit of the Volunteer Army had infiltrated the northern mountainous area, immediately led a large group of Japanese soldiers to attack on March 26. At 2:00 PM on the 27th, they encountered about hundreds of members of the Zhao unit (holding 40 heavy machine guns and 40 light machine guns) at a location about twelve miles southeast of Longmen Post. They immediately engaged in battle. After a fierce battle, the Volunteer Army once withdrew to lure the enemy, and then launched a large-scale encirclement and attack. The entire Japanese army team was deeply trapped in the battle formation. In this battle, Captain Machida was killed, and 20 other Japanese soldiers were killed. It was found that Machida was a 35th-term graduate of the Japanese Army Academy and was 36 years old. He was a powerful young officer of the Japanese army and was proficient in Russian. Even more strange was that his father had also served as a company commander at the age of 36 and died in the Russo-Japanese War. The names and origins of those killed in the Machida team are recorded below: ㊀Captain Machida (Tokyo City), ㊁Warrant Officer Watanabe Takao (Yamanashi Prefecture), ㊂Military Supervisor Oyama Mitsuo (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊃Private Ii Nichijiro (Yokohama City), ㊄Iino Eimi (Izuri Prefecture), ㊅Yamazawa Seiji (Yamanashi Prefecture), ㊆Akasako Kiyoshige (Yamanashi Prefecture), ㊇Matsumoto Matsuo (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊈Private Miura Hisao (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊉Shindo Taro (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊉㊀Wada Tomejiro (Yokosuka City), ㊉㊁Takahashi Nagayoshi (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊉㊂Naito Mitsugu (Yamanashi Prefecture), ㊉㊃Umi Shigeichi (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊉㊄Kobayashi Yoshihiro (Yamanashi Prefecture), ㊉㊅Anzai Gisaburo (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊉㊆Akikawa Shunpei (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊉㊇This Kino Morizo (Kanagawa Prefecture), ㊉㊈Watanabe Toshimata (Yamanashi Prefecture), ㊁㊉Korean interpreter from the Longzhen County Police Bureau (name unknown).

### Taiwanese in Xiamen Collude with Communist Bandits

Huang Guotai's Henchmen Extort Ransom in Xiamen - Taiwanese Responsible for Contacting for Ransom Payments

Xiamen Communication: Huang Guotai, a well-known bandit in Zhangzhou, with a certain background, runs rampant in the countryside of Haicheng, Longxi, Zhangpu counties and the sea between Xiamen and Zhangzhou. Last winter, the garrison troops launched a painful encirclement and suppression of the Huang bandits, and they began to restrain themselves slightly. Recently, they retreated to the border of Zhangpu, but last winter they sent henchmen Kang Zaide and Gan Jianwu to Xiamen to set up an agency in a Taiwanese company on Jukou Street, specializing in collecting "flag fees" from ships sailing between Xiamen. The Public Security Bureau surrounded and arrested the agency but failed to capture it. At the beginning of March this year, Gan Jianwu secretly came to Xiamen again and was captured by the police on a ship. Kang Zaide is still in Haicheng, gathering bandits and appearing in the Qingyu Haimen area, robbing at sea and on land. Last month, Kang Fu came to Xiamen and hid in the Gulangyu concession. At that time, there was a boat owner named Yongmao who owned a firewood boat and transported firewood from Qingpu Dashikeng to Xiamen for sale. When he docked at Gulangyu at night, Kang suddenly led two bandits with guns to board the boat and kidnap Yongmao to another small boat, which sailed back to the Qingpu bandit's nest. He released a shipmate and instructed him to inform Yongmao's family, asking them to prepare money to redeem the ticket, and to contact Granny Ji, a Taiwanese woman living in the Qinshui Cheng of Siming North Road in Xiamen. Yongmao's family received the news and sent his relative, Qi Tuo, to visit Granny Ji, but they were unable to see her. Later, it was discovered that the tickets kidnapped by the Kang bandits were all handled by a certain place for contacting ransom matters, but strangers were not received, and there was a fixed liaison to convey information indirectly. This liaison was a Taiwanese man named Zhang from a certain company on Datong Road, so he entrusted Zhang to contact Granny Ji. After several exchanges, the ransom was agreed upon (150 yuan). Qi Tuo borrowed the money and handed it over to Zhang, promising that Yongmao would be released in a few days. Unexpectedly, when the deadline arrived, the bandits did not keep their promise. Qi Tuo went to inquire Zhang, and the bandits changed the price again, demanding 300 yuan. However, Yongmao's family was not rich and could not afford to double the price, so they pleaded to reduce it, but the bandits refused. Negotiations are still underway. After this incident occurred, Yongmao's family was afraid that Yongmao's life would be in danger, so they secretly dared not report it to the authorities. On the 6th, the Xiamen police learned about it and sent detectives to summon Qi Tuo. Qi Tuo also worked at sea and did not dare to offend the Kang bandits and their contacts in Xiamen, and was afraid that Yongmao would be torn to pieces, so he was unwilling to reveal it. When the detectives came, he pretended to go inside to change clothes and escaped through the back door. The police are now conducting a rigorous investigation. It is noted that the Kang bandits are openly extorting ransom in Xiamen, and the Taiwanese are also responsible for managing the agency in Xiamen to contact the victim's family for ransom payments, so this case has attracted widespread attention, (April 9).

### Meningitis Epidemic in Jiangxi Province

Spreads to Sixteen Counties Including Nanchang - Anti-Epidemic Team Goes to Various Counties for Treatment

Nanchang Communication: Acute meningitis has recently occurred in this province. It first broke out in counties such as Xiushui, Xingan, Yongxiu, and Xingzi, and then in Shanggao, Fenyi, Wanzai, Xinyu, Poyang, Leping, Yudu, Qingjiang, Nanchang, Xiajiang, Yifeng, and Yujiang cities and counties, all of which have reported cases, and it is extremely rampant. Students from various middle schools in this city have died one after another, but the number of deaths is kept secret. Wu Shouren, a student at No. 1 Middle School, developed sore limbs at school on the afternoon of the 2nd, and became unconscious and lost consciousness. Although doctors treated him, he died at 7:00 PM. There are many other similar cases. The Health Department is paying close attention and is carrying out preventive vaccinations. At the same time, a temporary mobile anti-epidemic team has been organized, divided into three groups. The first group, including doctors Cao Youkun, has departed for Shanggao, Yichun, Yifeng, Pingxiang, and other counties. The second group has departed for Poyang, Duchang, and the northeast of Jiangxi. The third group has departed for Xiushui and the northwest of Jiangxi, to carry out prevention and control to curb the spread of the epidemic, (April 3).

### Guangdong Province Plans to Speed Up Road Construction

Provincial Highway Conference - Decides on Construction Steps - Focuses on Northwest Trunk Line

Luzhou Communication: Guangdong Province has recently been actively engaged in the opening of highways. Its main trunk lines are the Wengcongxin Highway, which connects the North River to the Jiangxi border, the Xiaobeijiang Highway, which connects the Hunan-Guangxi border, and the county roads of various counties in the West River. However, the opening of each highway is not solely the responsibility of the Construction Department, as it involves military engineering, the cost of attracting merchants to build culverts and bridges. Therefore, the Construction Department convened a provincial highway conference at the Construction Department at 5:00 AM on the 1st of this month. All relevant agencies sent representatives to participate. Those present on the day included Xu Lian, leader of the Third Group of the First Department of the Xizhou Headquarters, Shen Dejian, leader of the Fourth Group of the Second Department, Rong Gan, Section Chief of the Guangdong Sui靖Public Office, Chen Hongkai, Chief Technician of the Fourth Army Headquarters, He Shaoqiong, Section Chief of the First Department of the Provincial Government, and representatives from the Finance Department and Construction Department, the Commissioner of the East Road Highway Office, the Commissioner of the South District Highway Office, the Commissioner of the North District Highway Office, and the Commissioner of the Qiongyai Highway Office, totaling more than 20 people. Liu Weichi, Director of the Construction Department, presided over the meeting, announced the reasons for the meeting, and then presented various cases for discussion. Representatives from various parties expressed their opinions on the planning and construction of existing highways and new routes, the allocation of road construction funds, and the rectification of traffic management. As a result, it was resolved that the planning of new highways should be carried out by the Construction Department, in consultation with the Guangzhou Headquarters of the Military Commission, the Guangdong Sui靖Public Office, and the Fourth Army Headquarters. The existing routes should be planned and constructed by the Construction Department, and the road construction funds should be allocated by the Construction Department after the 26th year is approved. The adjustment of Xingdong will be discussed at another meeting to be scheduled. In addition, the opening of the trunk line focuses on connecting with the highways of neighboring provinces, such as connecting with the highways of the same province in the eastern district, connecting with the highways of Jiangxi Province in the northern district, and connecting with the highways of the Guangxi border in the southwestern district. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 AM on the same day. The highway plan for Guangdong Province in the 26th year was also formulated by the Construction Department, and its main points are as follows: The provincial roads in the northern district are the Wengyuan to Shaozhou and Wengyuan to Shixing lines. In Xiaobeijiang, there is the Yingde Jingzhi Guang to Lianshan line. Another line from Shanhua County via Fogang to Wengyuan. In addition to the Xiaobeijiang line, if the above lines are completed, Guangzhou to Shaozhou Shixing Nanxiong can still be directly connected in addition to the southern section of the Yuehan Railway. The trunk line is no less than an auxiliary line of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway. As for those belonging to the West River, it is planned to promote the Guangyun line, making Guangzhou to Sanshui, and then from Sanshui to Yunfu to reach Fengchuan, and connect with the Guangxi border. In the southern district, the Qin邕Line will be rushed to build. This highway runs from Qinxian, Guangdong to Nanning, Guangxi. Among them, the section from Nanbin to the Guangxi border has been built by Guangxi Province, but the section from Qinxian, Guangdong to Xiaodongxu on the Guangdong border has not yet been built. Therefore, the road opening in the 26th year will be allocated to complete it. As for the roads connecting counties and counties, the planned construction includes the Qingyuan Huaxian Fogang line, the Huaxian to Juntian line, the Qingyuan to Longtang line, the Sanshui to Huaxian line, the Congbei to Heyuan line, the Lianping to Longmen line, and the Hechong to Shankouxu line (March 2).

### Suzhou: Robbery Case, People and Goods Recovered

On the morning of the 8th, five robbers suddenly came to the home of Li Miantang at No. 85 Donghaidao, Chengtian Temple, Suzhou. Three of them robbed inside and two stood guard outside. Because it was not yet dawn, the robbers were able to search calmly for an hour before escaping with their loot. After the incident, it was checked that the loss was about 200 yuan worth of gold jewelry, legal tender, etc. The police station was immediately notified to investigate, and the detective team searched in all directions. Then, on the 5th, the officers captured the bandits Wu Ashui (Wu sent telegrams at the telegraph office and the original stolen gold ring silver corners, etc. were found in Wu's home), Mi Chaoquan, Qin Linqing, Yang Hongsheng, Xu Agun and nine other people at No. 1 Xidamen Front New Corner, No. 13 Nanyuan Muful Bridge, and No. 36 Wanhuo Lane outside the gate. All the stolen goods have been confirmed by the victim to be correct. The cause of this case was that the victim, Li, bought an adopted daughter, and the introducer, seeing the money, had the idea and gathered people to rob.

### Songjiang: President of Lawyers Association Takes Over

The election of staff members of the County Lawyers Association was completed last month. Yesterday, the newly appointed President Chen Qiushi, Zhang Yingkui, and former President Zhang Baopei handled the handover procedures together, and took over the job that day. It was also decided to convene an assessment meeting and take an oath of office again.

### Changshu: Antiquities Found in Rice Guild

The Tianchao Archway outside the south is said to be a relic of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but there is no evidence to verify it. Now the county party headquarters received a letter from its gentleman, saying that there is a stone tablet of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the Laiye Guild Hall. It was discovered by the famous novelist Yu Tianfen in the early years of the Republic of China, and it was built into the wall for preservation. Now the wall has collapsed and the stele has also fallen, and it is feared that it will disappear. The Party Department considered the matter to be related to revolutionary historical sites and sent personnel to investigate and send rubbings to the Central Party History Compilation Committee for reference.

### Wuxi Land Registration Concludes

The Wuxi Land Administration Bureau, acting under orders, has completed the land registration for all 345,675 districts. All supplementary registrations and provisional registrations will be closed on the 15th of this month. Those who fail to register after the deadline will be subject to provisional management with marked notices. However, the land registration in the first urban district was slightly delayed due to the reporting of land prices. Subsequently, upon receiving provincial orders to handle the registration together and exempt interest payments, businesses flocked to the office to register. Director Qi Pinlao, recognizing the hard work involved, has specifically stipulated that land registration in the urban area will be uniformly closed on the 28th of this month, with a five-day extension for supplementary registration, culminating in a final closure on May 3rd. Those who fail to register after the final closure will be subject to provisional sealed management in accordance with provincial orders. Public notices have already been issued to ensure widespread awareness.

Province Pursues Arrears in Land Tax

The county government, under orders to investigate malpractices in land tax, has formed a review committee to examine old accounts from the years of the Republic 16 to 24. The result was uncovering arrears of over 90,000 silver dollars. The matter has been reported to the provincial authorities. At the same time, the former director of land tax, Zhu Kaiguan, now an assistant at the Shanghai Fish Market, was notified to expedite settlement. Zhu immediately entrusted his confidant, a Mr. Yuan, to come to Wuxi to negotiate with various parties in the hope of making amends. Yesterday, the county government received an urgent telegram from the provincial government ordering a thorough investigation of the case and demanding that Zhu Kaiguan be held responsible for clearing the arrears.

Cotton Yarn Market Prices Fall Gradually

Recently, cotton yarn market prices have been falling gradually due to the weak sentiment among people. The price of Shanghai standard yarn has fallen to around ten dollars. Local yarn has also decreased by two or three dollars. The reason is that the previous frenzy of rising yarn prices was due to rumors that the government would increase unified taxes starting on April 1st. As a result, people rushed to purchase, and everyone was optimistic, so market prices were unstoppable. Now, the government, in view of the strong power of British and Japanese yarn factories in China, believes that increasing unified taxes will inevitably increase the burden on Chinese yarn factories, making it difficult for them to compete with foreign merchants. Therefore, it is believed that imposing taxes will be delayed, and market sentiment has changed again. Local yarn prices fell again yesterday, ranging from one to two dollars per piece.

Five-Year Injustice Redressed

Liu Baosheng, a villager from Pan Zhuang Village, Fu'an Township, Fourth District, disappeared on the 25th day of the fourth month of the 21st year of the Republic [1932]. On the 27th, an unidentified male corpse was found by the shore of Taihu Lake. On the 25th day of the sixth month, Liu Baosheng's wife, Liu Ya's, filed a petition with the local court for an inquest, identifying the corpse as that of Liu Baosheng. She alleged that Liu Zhenhan, a villager from the same area, had instructed Xie Qiaogen and his long-term worker Zhou Changsheng to strangle him and use Zhu Xingsheng's boat to dump the body in Taihu Lake. On the 9th day of the seventh month, Liu Zhenhan and Xie Qiaogen were arrested and detained by the court. After eight months of investigation, Liu Zhenhan was sentenced to death. Liu appealed to the High Court, which changed the sentence to life imprisonment. Liu appealed again, and the High Court sent the case back for retrial, still sentencing him to life imprisonment. Liu remained dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court again, which twice sent the case back for further retrial. On the 25th day of the second month of the following year, the judgment was delivered, acquitting Liu Zhenhan and Xie Qiaogen. The case had been tried back and forth for a total of four years and eight months before the injustice was finally redressed. Liu and Xie have now been released from prison and returned to Wuxi.

### Zhenjiang Labor Service Achievements

The labor service of civil servants in the provincial capital began work on March 15th. The provincial governor and heads of various departments have visited the construction site one after another to supervise. The project has progressed quite rapidly. However, due to rainy days and weekly holidays, work was suspended for several days, which resulted in the project not being completed as scheduled. Work has recently been stepped up, and the entire project can be completed on the 9th. The project covers a road length of 502 meters and 5,501 cubic meters of earthwork. More than 4,000 people participated in the service.

### Yangzhou Dredging Canal Unearths Ancient Tablet

On the morning of the 8th, the "Yunshun" dredging vessel of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau was dredging the section of the canal near the Xue Hongji Transport Company at the west end of Xu Ningmen when it suddenly dredged up a rectangular stone tablet about eight feet long and one foot wide, weighing over 700 pounds. Due to the passage of time, the inscription has been eroded and is difficult to recognize. Residents in the area say it is an antique from hundreds of years ago.

### Arnold and Chinese Directors Agree to Postpone Discussion of Increased Donations

Proposal to be Submitted to Special Board Meeting on Monday for Ratification. Spokesperson for Taxpayers' Association Talks About Facts Being Recognized

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, taxpayers in the Shanghai International Settlement have been paying extraordinary attention to the issue of increased donations by the Municipal Council. Since April 7th, the atmosphere has become even more tense due to the absence of the Chinese directors. Some say there has been a shift towards a more negative stance, some say it is still possible to strive for improvement, and some say there may be room for revision. To seek the truth, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited the spokesperson for the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the International Settlement, who replied, "The facts are indeed gradually being recognized." The reporter then had the following questions and answers with the spokesperson:

Reporter: (hereinafter referred to as "Reporter") Some say the Municipal Council plans to increase the total donation by 2%, while others say 14.29%. Which of these two figures is correct?

Spokesperson: (hereinafter referred to as "Spokesperson") Both are correct. However, the former refers to rent, while the latter refers to the current donation rate. Logically speaking, the latter statement is correct because 14% plus 2% is an increase of one-seventh, which is an increase of 14.29%, approximately an increase of one and a half tenths.

Reporter: Then why doesn't the Municipal Council explicitly state that it is increasing by 14.29%?

Spokesperson: Perhaps to prevent people from realizing how large the increase is.

Reporter: If the donation is increased, will the land tax also be increased?

Spokesperson: Of course, it will also be increased because the Yangjingbang Land Regulations stipulate that the land tax rate and the total donation rate must be in a ratio of 1:20.

Reporter: What is the attitude of taxpayers, especially Chinese taxpayers, towards the increase in donations?

Spokesperson: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the First Special District Citizens' Association, various native-place associations, various trade associations, and the Real Estate Association have all expressed their opposition. It can be said that they are almost unanimously opposed.

Reporter: It is rumored that all the Chinese directors and one Japanese director did not attend the last Municipal Council meeting on April 7th. Is this true? If so, what were the reasons?

Spokesperson: It is indeed true that all the Chinese directors did not attend, and it is also true that one Japanese director was absent. As for the reasons for their absence, the Japanese director attended a tea party. As for the reasons for the Chinese directors, unless it was to express a lack of confidence, it probably happened by chance.

Reporter: According to the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, the quorum for the Municipal Council is three. After the addition of the Chinese directors in the 17th year of the Republic [1928], specific rules of procedure were formulated stipulating a quorum of nine. According to the above, the number of attendees was only eight, which is legal according to the regulations but insufficient according to the rules. How could the Municipal Council formally hold the meeting?

Spokesperson: Mr. Faithfull, who drafted the rules of procedure for the Municipal Council, is now the Director-General, and Mr. Fessenden, the Secretary-General, are both legal experts. Furthermore, Director-General Arnold has a responsibility to explain the matter clearly to alleviate concerns.

Reporter: It is said that before the Municipal Council decided on the proposal to increase donations, the Japanese director proposed a postponement of the discussion, and a vote was taken. The Chinese and Japanese directors both voted in favor of postponement, totaling seven votes, while six voted against. When the opposing votes were cast, the chairman did not cast a first vote and immediately used a deciding vote. Is this legally sound?

Spokesperson: If that is indeed the case, then according to the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, it may not be recognized as valid in law.

The reporter then visited a certain Chinese director and asked about the Municipal Council's increase in donations. It was heard that Director-General Arnold has already agreed with the Chinese directors to postpone the discussion for six months until January 1st of next year. The director replied that this decision had indeed been made, but it still needs to be submitted to a special board meeting on Monday for ratification. Furthermore, the so-called postponement of discussion must depend on the economic situation of the city at that time and whether the Municipal Council's financial measures are reasonable and whether there are other remedial measures besides increasing donations. Otherwise, there is still no possibility of discussing increasing donations.

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post, Director-General Arnold and the five Chinese councilors have agreed on a compromise solution to postpone the 2% increase in municipal donations for six months until next year. This will be submitted to a special meeting of the councilors for approval on Monday. The increase in land donation from 7/10 of 1% to 8/10 of 1% will also be postponed for six months. After the two matters are approved by the Municipal Council, they will be announced on Wednesday.

### Zhang Qun Arrives in Shanghai for Talks

Expresses Hope for Unification and Improvement of Japanese Diplomacy. Zhang Plans to Travel to Europe and America. Will Visit Relatives in Sichuan Province Before Departure.

Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday. Yesterday, at his private residence on Avenue Albert, he met successively with Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, Zhou Jue, Director of the Diplomatic Affairs Office in Shanghai, and many others. Zhang plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days and then return to Nanjing. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhang at his private residence yesterday and had the following conversation:

Plans to Visit Various European and American Countries

According to Zhang, he has had the desire to visit Europe and America for over twenty years. In the third year of the Republic [1914], he went abroad but had only just arrived in Southeast Asia when the anti-Yuan campaign broke out and he was summoned back to China. Afterwards, the work he was responsible for in China was burdensome, leaving him no leisure time. As a result, his desire to travel to Europe and America has not been fulfilled. Having resigned as Foreign Minister, he has decided to take advantage of this time to travel abroad to replenish his knowledge and adjust his thinking. In the future, after returning to China, he hopes to contribute what he has gained from this trip to the country. He plans to visit various European countries first, then travel to the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan to observe their politics, economy, and international situations. He is currently preparing the procedures for going abroad, but because he has not yet received definite permission from the central government, the date of departure and the route he will take are currently uncertain. Before going abroad, he must return to Sichuan Province because he has been away from his hometown for over ten years. Therefore, he has decided to return to Sichuan before going abroad to visit his relatives. As for Minister He (Yingqin)'s entry into Sichuan, it has not yet been fully decided.

Successor for the Shanghai Mayoralty

"I have resided in Shanghai for over twenty years. During the first, second, and third revolutions, I worked in Shanghai. Afterwards, I served as Mayor of Shanghai for three years. Therefore, Shanghai is like my second hometown. I am willing to serve my hometown in any major or minor event. However, as I am currently planning to go abroad, I deeply hope that my desire to travel to Europe and America can be fulfilled. Fortunately, the position of Shanghai Mayor is currently being held concurrently by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun. Mr. Yu has served as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government for ten years, and his perseverance and learning are well known to the people of Shanghai. Even if he were formally appointed Mayor, he would certainly be able to handle the position with ease."

Sino-Japanese Negotiations Await Development

"Sino-Japanese negotiations have not had any new developments since the resolution of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents. Japan's understanding of China is now clearer than in the past, and it is currently re-examining its China policy. Therefore, the development of Sino-Japanese negotiations still awaits. The visit of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission to China has positive significance for recognizing China's unification and promoting friendship between the two peoples. I deeply hope that the unification of Japanese diplomacy will be further improved (the so-called 'unification and improvement' means that the government will be in charge of everything). As for China's foreign policy, it will still be based on the consistent policy already established by the central government, which Foreign Minister Wang has already stated very clearly."

Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers to Give Final Approval. It is reported that since the proposal to increase municipal donations was announced, Chinese in the settlement have strongly opposed it, creating a great potential for unrest. Therefore, Arnold invited the Chinese councilors to a tea party on Thursday to agree on a compromise solution.

Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday replied to a letter from the First Special District Citizens' United Association Branch, stating:

"Re: Your letter dated April 6th regarding the Municipal Council's proposal to increase donations in the Public Concession. We have received it. Before discussing the Municipal Council's proposal, experts were asked to thoroughly investigate the Municipal Council's income and expenditure, the current situation, and future trends. The conclusion was that income and expenditure have increased annually since the first year of the Republic [1912]. Before the 17th year of the Republic [1928], the rate of increase in income and expenditure was still proportional. However, since the 18th year of the Republic [1929], that is, since Mr. Arnold took office as Director-General, the rate of increase in expenditure has exceeded that of income, especially the exchange rate subsidies totaling 12 million yuan, the rapid expansion of police expenses, and the failure to abolish the band, which have led to a shortfall in income. The Chinese community believes that the Municipal Council has not exhausted all possible means of frugality and that it should not increase the burden on the public while the city is turning around economically, and should instead work together to overcome difficulties. Therefore, we express our opposition. As for the voting method on that day and the subsequent developments, legal experts are examining whether they pose legal problems in order to take action. We hereby reply to your letter and request that you examine it and provide guidance as needed."

### British Tramway Workers Petitioned Yesterday

Company Refused Five Demands. Party and Government Authorities to Investigate Today.

According to Dagong News Agency, ten workers from the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession previously staged two strikes to demand improved treatment. The strikes were temporarily resolved after party and government authorities sent personnel to mediate. However, the company refused to accept the five demands put forward by the workers, and the situation has become serious again. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, worker representatives Yang Zhaoyu and Yang Boqing from the Car Department, and Yan Yongqing from the Machinery Department, submitted a written petition to the Party Headquarters on Rue du Consulat. Yu Yaoqiu from the Mediation Section received them, inquired about the situation, and promised to coordinate with the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate the situation and advised the workers not to strike or go slow without the permission of the Party and government. The representatives agreed to be responsible for advising the workers. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, where Zhu Jinqing from the Third Section received them. Finally, they went to the General Labor Union to petition, where Committee Member Gong Yuting received them. All of them advised the workers to wait patiently for a resolution.

Five Demands

The worker representatives submitted a joint statement to the Party and government authorities yesterday, stating: "We are presenting this request because the company has refused our demands. We request that you approve the convocation of both parties for mediation in order to avoid disputes and alleviate the workers' difficulties. The undersigned have been working for the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession. Due to the difficulty of living, we previously made a request to the company to improve the terms of our employment. We were fortunate to have your organization dispatch personnel to make every effort to mediate, and the dispute was brought to a temporary end. However, workers from other departments were forced by circumstances to make further demands, such as the seven demands of the Machinery Department and the issue of salary increases for drivers. If this continues, it will be detrimental to both labor and capital, and if a dispute breaks out, it will have a major impact on society. Appreciating this, the undersigned sought the will of all colleagues and decided to find a proper solution. The following five demands were decided upon: (1) Any employee who has faithfully served the company for 15 years shall be allowed to resign from the company, and the severance pay shall be one month's salary for each year of service, with more to be added according to the formula. (2) Employees who are sick and have a doctor's certificate shall be paid their full wages. (3) Drivers who work 15 days a month shall receive a raise of two days ("including the previous four days"). Mechanics shall be paid their wages on Sundays. (4) Wages shall be paid in full for the period of the previous dispute. (5) Drivers who are certified by a doctor as unable to work shall be given appropriate positions and their original wages shall not be reduced. The above five demands are all reasonable. We submitted them to the company authorities on April 3rd and have requested a response several times. However, the company has ignored them, causing widespread indignation among all workers, and the situation is dire. Having no other choice, we have specially dispatched representatives to present this petition to your organization, requesting that you approve the convocation of both parties for mediation in order to avoid disputes and alleviate the workers' difficulties, etc."

Investigation Today

After receiving the petition for relief from the British tramway workers, the Party and government authorities attached great importance to the matter because trams are related to public transportation.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Executive Yuan and Ministries Requesting Exemption from Increased Yarn and Cloth Unified Tax

The National Chamber of Commerce Joint Association of this city yesterday telegraphed the various Executive Yuan and ministries of the National Government, Nanjing, stating: "Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Industry, and Ministry of Finance, esteemed sirs: We have just received a letter from the Chinese Yarn Factory Joint Association stating that we have heard that the central government is considering increasing the unified tax on yarn and cloth in order to increase tax revenue. This concerns national financial policy and should not be lightly discussed. However, clothing is a necessity of life for the people, and at this time when the rural economy is just beginning to turn around, it is impossible to suddenly increase the burden in order to hinder its prosperity. Furthermore, the textile industry has been struggling for more than ten years. Now that it is finally recovering slightly, it should be given care and protection so that it can become healthy. If taxes are suddenly increased, the cost of production will increase and affect sales, and the industry will move towards reducing work and shutting down. In terms of tax revenue, it will not only fail to increase but may also decrease. Therefore, we earnestly request that you forward this to the central government for consideration and advocate that the current state of the unified tax on yarn and cloth be maintained in order to reduce the burden on consumption and promote the recovery of the textile industry. Both the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit. We anxiously await your order, etc." In light of this, we should telegraph your esteemed Executive Yuan and ministries for verification and request approval to exempt the increase in the unified tax on yarn and cloth in order to maintain the current state of the textile industry. This is our most earnest plea. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Joint Association, respectfully submits his request."

### The Labor Dispute at the Xinyu Yarn Factories is Deadlocked

The Factory Claims that Workers Have Resumed Striking. The Labor Side Claims that the Factory Refuses to Allow Workers to Return to Work.

According to Dagong News Agency, a serious labor dispute broke out at the First and Second Yarn Factories of the Xinyu Textile Company over the dismissal of workers. After persuasion from the Party and government, both labor and management accepted the orders and simultaneously resumed work at 6:00 AM on the 6th. The situation was good. However, on the 7th, the Party and government convened to mediate the case of the dismissed workers, but there was no result due to differences of opinion between the two parties. The First Factory on West Suzhou Road was the first to erupt in a labor dispute, which has not yet been resolved. The First Factory on Route Robert had also been affected in the same way since the day before yesterday. According to the factory, the workers resumed striking because they were dissatisfied with the mediation. The labor side claimed that the factory hired thugs, refused to allow workers to return to work, and beat workers. The words of labor and management were contradictory, and no one knew what to believe. The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to investigate the reasons for the dismissal of the 56 workers in detail, and also investigated the cause of the renewed labor dispute. They have submitted a detailed report to the Executive Committee and the Director for instructions on how to handle the matter, and a decision will be made.

### Chamber of Commerce Continues to Telegraph the Executive Yuan and Ministries to Strive for Tax Exemption on Foreign Rice

Hunan Province Has More Than 13 Million Piculs of Surplus Grain; Guangdong Province Lacks Rice, but There Is Ample Room for Supplementation

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, concerned about the impact of tax exemption on foreign rice entering Guangdong on the national economy and people's livelihood, has repeatedly telegraphed to protest and resolved to continue its efforts through a standing committee meeting. Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance, stating that the case is currently under review by the two ministries. The telegram was addressed to Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, and Vice Ministers Zou and Xu of the Ministry of Finance:

"We received a joint letter on the 9th of this month from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association, the Coarse Grains, Oil Cakes Trade Association, the Coarse Grains Brokers Association, and the Jiangsu-Shanghai Municipal and County Rice Trade Association Joint Federation. They stated that the petition to prevent tax-exempt foreign rice from entering Guangdong was discussed at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 6th of this month and decided to be first submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for joint review by relevant authorities before being brought back to the Executive Yuan for discussion. It is believed that the ministries will uphold their consistent policy of complete tariffs and rural revitalization.

After joint review and thorough discussion, a fair resolution will surely be obtained. However, we believe that this matter is of great importance, and we cannot refrain from speaking out. Guangdong Province's request for tax exemption claims to prevent a grain shortage during the period between the exhaustion of old grain and the ripening of new grain. However, the new grain in that province will be harvested before the end of June, less than three months from now. This is evident from the Ministry of Finance's deletion of the customs duty telegram, which is by no means an empty statement. In these three months, with a daily consumption of 20,000 piculs of rice, the total amount would be no more than 2 million piculs. Previously, various provinces transported a total of 1.8 million piculs in January, February, and March, so there is no need for tax-exempt foreign rice to be imported. Furthermore, on February 27th, the Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to the Hankou Coarse Grains Association, stating that if foreign rice is imported into Guangdong, it should be handled in accordance with the Executive Yuan's proposal and that it was not tax-exempt. It also ordered rice merchants from various provinces to expedite transportation to provide relief. However, on March 15th, there was another deletion of the customs duty telegram, granting Guangdong Province's request to allow the import of 2 million dan each of tax-exempt foreign rice and grain. The two telegrams from the Ministry of Finance present

Conflicting Views

The Ministry of Finance may have compelling reasons for this, but merchants have already received orders to purchase and transport rice. If the aforementioned rice awaiting shipment is halted midway, this is something to be considered when the Executive Yuan reconsiders the matter. Some may argue that domestic rice is no longer in the hands of farmers, and the import of foreign rice will not harm the rural economy. This may have been the case several years ago, but the situation is now vastly different. Due to the good harvest last autumn, farmers have substantial reserves. Local farmers' banks or loan offices have warehouses where rice, regardless of quantity, can be mortgaged. The practice of storing grain for sale is widespread, and most of the rice is in the

Hands of Farmers

According to reports, the surplus grain in various provinces is still over 10 million piculs. If a comprehensive calculation is made, the actual amount is definitely more than this. Recently, due to the tax-exempt entry of foreign rice into Guangdong, domestic rice prices have already plummeted by one yuan and five or six jiao, indicating a surplus in supply. Therefore, the impact is by no means minor. Local financial institutions with mortgages and remittances have also suffered losses. This measure is not only a problem for a portion of rice merchants in various provinces but also has a significant impact on the overall national economy, people's livelihood, agriculture, commerce, and economy. This is another point to be considered when the Executive Yuan reconsiders the matter. During our two petitions to the capital, we have already personally presented the reasons to Acting Secretary-General He of the Executive Yuan and Vice Ministers Cheng and Zhou of the Ministry of Industry, and submitted them to Vice Minister Zou of the Ministry of Finance. However, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry and Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance were not in the capital, and we were unable to meet with Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, we are submitting our opinions again in writing. We earnestly request your association to promptly telegraph Acting President Wang, Minister Wu, and Vice Ministers Zou and Xu, urging them to preside over the matter and adopt our suggestions, providing

Maximum Relief

We await your command with utmost urgency." Upon arrival, the association noted that in its response to the association on the 4th of this month, the Ministry of Finance stated, "On the one hand, the Grain Transport and Sales Bureau, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, and the Guangdong Provincial Food Conservation Committee should coordinate with each other and separately purchase surplus rice from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces and transport it to Guangdong." This indicates that the Ministry of Finance has already recognized that Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have surplus rice to supply Guangdong Province. Furthermore, according to a telegram from representatives of over twenty rice-producing counties in Hunan Province to the Ministry, the entire province has a surplus of 13.2 million piculs of grain. This means that the current shortage of 2 million market dan of foreign rice and 2 million market dan of foreign grain in Guangdong Province can be entirely

Replaced and Supplemented

By the surplus grain in rice-producing provinces. This also shows that Guangdong Province only has this much rice shortage. Allowing the tax-exempt large-scale import of foreign rice and grain means that domestic rice will not be needed in that province. This not only completely contradicts the Ministry of Finance's telegram to the Hankou Coarse Grains Association, which stated that "foreign rice is not tax-exempt, and rice merchants should expedite transportation to provide relief," but also goes against the original intention of the Ministry's telegram to "continuously transport rice to Guangdong." Farmers and merchants are alarmed, and the market is uneasy. It is appropriate to continue submitting our appeal via telegram, hoping that you will review and approve our request and preside over the matter, so that the national economy and people's livelihood will not suffer. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."

### American Youth with Epilepsy Saved by Iron Lung – A Miracle

Unable to live more than a few minutes without the iron lung, he has been treated in Peiping for over a year with good progress.

The "North-China Daily News" reports that an American youth, Mr. Slater, aged 26, suffered from epilepsy. Thanks to his family's wealth and the assistance of modern medical science, he fought for his life at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. It is reported that he will be traveling from Peiping to Shanghai by train this summer, and on June 8th, he will take the President Coolidge steamer back to the United States to continue treatment at the Billings Hospital in Chicago. Although Mr. Slater is out of danger, he has not yet fully recovered. Mr. Slater has been lying in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital for more than a year,

Lying Supine All Day

in a mechanical respirator, also known as an "iron lung." Mr. Slater's life depends entirely on this "iron lung." Mr. Slater came to China on the Empress of Britain last year and suddenly contracted this disease en route from Shanghai. Fortunately, the only "iron lung" in the Orient happened to arrive at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital at this time, so Mr. Slater was placed inside. From the neck down, he was completely numb. In the

Hundredth Day

he couldn't speak a word. At that time, it was thought that his life could not be saved. After a hundred days, on July 26th of last year, he was able to say the words "God," but as soon as he uttered the two words, he was exhausted. As for whether he can go to Chicago from Peiping this summer, it will depend on the patient's condition at that time and the effectiveness of the mobile gasoline generator, which is being shipped from the United States. Doctors believe that Mr. Slater will be able to make this trip in June. The generator will be used along the way from the hospital to the

Shanghai Ship

to supply the 110 watts of electricity needed to operate the "iron lung." Mr. Slater cannot be separated from the "iron lung" for even a moment, and the "iron lung" cannot be without electricity for even a moment. Although the President Coolidge can supply electricity, electricity is still needed along the way from the Pacific coast to the Chicago hospital. Mr. Slater's condition has recently shown significant improvement, and he can talk casually and move his right leg slightly. During his illness,

His Mind is Very Clear

he has been in good spirits lately and constantly asks about his condition and treatment methods, and wants to know the details of the arrangements for returning to his country. The travel arrangements have been carefully planned. The current plan is to convert a freight car into a hospital car to transport him from Peiping to Shanghai. After arriving at the Peiping Railway Station, he will be transferred to a specially made car and transported to the Huangpu Bund, and then board the largest Shanghai small steamer to go to the President Coolidge. The mail ship will probably be moored at

Floating Docks in the River.

Three 89-pound generators have now been ordered to prevent damage to the generators, so that another one can be used as a replacement. Three mechanics will also be hired to manage the generators. When boarding the ship, a special track may need to be built. Those who take care of him, including doctors, nurses (eight people), mechanics, food preparers, and relatives and friends,

About Twenty People

so several first-class cabins must be reserved on the President Coolidge. The destination is tentatively set to send Mr. Slater to a hospital in Chicago, but a final decision will have to be made after seeing the patient's condition after arriving in the United States. Mr. Slater's family lives in Florida. If his condition continues to improve at that time, it is possible that he will return home directly. Two American nurses are scheduled to

Sail to China by Ship

on April 24th. Also, when the President Coolidge sails from the United States to Shanghai on May 10th, it will carry a new "iron lung." Mr. Slater is currently in Peiping in the latest "iron lung," only his head is exposed outside the device. The new device is larger than the old one used for the first time. This device has holes on both sides, and a hole on the top allows the head to be exposed around the neck, and soft rubber like cotton is placed around it to prevent air from escaping, in order to reduce

pressure inside the device. Nurses can reach into the device and massage the patient's arms. Above Mr. Slater's head is a small glass table. Any books, magazines, and newspapers that he wants to read are placed on the table so that he can see them. Mr. Slater is very concerned about world affairs and American sports news. He can now play chess with his father through a mirror for amusement. Mr. Slater only started

Learning Chess

a few months ago. He can also play card games. Another person holds the cards, and he sees them in the mirror and gives instructions on tactics. Mr. Slater cannot live for more than a few minutes without the "iron lung," and it is difficult and very tiring to speak. Now, thanks to the "iron lung," he can breathe fifteen times per minute. The pressure in the "iron lung" can expel the air in his lungs, and then, through a partial vacuum, create air and input it into his lungs. The device is manufactured in Boston, Massachusetts, under the name "Drinker Respirator."

### Careless Tram Causes Passenger Injuries

Yesterday afternoon at about 3:30, near the Shanghai General Station of the Hu-Min-Nan-Zhe Long-Distance Bus Company on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district, Tram No. 19 of the Huashang Erlu Yuanlu Line was passing by when it suddenly caught fire due to a short circuit. The fire burned until the tram reached the entrance of the Xin Puyu Tang Advanced Middle School. The driver then noticed the fire and quickly shut off the power, but it was too late to contain the fire, which was already shooting upwards. Passengers on the tram jumped out of the windows in a panic, causing chaos and blocking traffic. Trams coming from behind were connected one after another. Fire trucks arrived after hearing the alarm and bravely put out the fire. A middle-aged woman, a passenger, was holding a child in her arms. She was unable to dodge in time and jumped out of the window. Due to unstable footing, she fell to the ground, breaking her head and causing profuse bleeding. Fortunately, the child was unharmed. Pedestrians helped the woman up, and she called for a car to take her to a nearby hospital for treatment.

### Hoodlums Harass Female Students

Police Should Increase Protection

In the Xuhui and Nanshi areas of Shanghai, there are many schools, especially girls' schools outside Ximen. Most female students hire rickshaws to go to and from school every day. Recently, some hoodlums have been riding bicycles back and forth, shouting obscene words. When the female students ignore them, these people hold sharp foreign knives and slash the faces of the female students, causing them to bleed, before speeding away. The female students have reported these thugs to the school authorities, and a letter has been sent to the police station requesting that they investigate and strictly prevent such incidents.

### National Goods Manufacturers Should Pay Attention to National Goods Shipped to Nanyang

If the raw materials used include foreign products, the words "Made in [Country]" must be removed.

The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry received an instruction from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that: "According to the report from the Consul General in Hanoi, 1. The industry in our country is not yet developed, and sometimes we have to use foreign raw materials that are not available in our country for goods made in our country. However, because the raw materials are printed with the words "Made in [Country]," the Vietnamese customs often have trouble with this. For example, the self-made organ shipped to Yunnan by the Shanghai Commercial Press last year was not allowed to be treated as Chinese goods because the steel spring had the words "Made in Germany." The customs insisted that it be taxed as foreign goods. Similarly, the Yunnan merchant Zhang Shaohui previously purchased three high-pressure diesel engines from the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant and transported them to Yunnan. Some of the small parts were purchased from Germany, and the marks were not removed. The Vietnamese customs also required that the entire shipment be taxed as foreign goods. Even with the certification of the French consul, it was difficult to make it effective. 2. For the various new cosmetics produced in our country, such as baby face cream and cologne, although the raw materials used are entirely produced in our country, merchants imitate foreign goods in all decorations and titles in order to cater to the psychology of customers. Even if the Chinese and foreign characters for "Made in China" are not written, the Vietnamese customs do not know the details and tax them all as foreign goods. 3. As for goods entirely produced in foreign countries, which are decorated and packaged to pass as Chinese goods to Vietnam, the Vietnamese customs will still tax them as foreign goods. For example, the cod liver oil produced by the Wuzhou Huafang is produced in Norway. Not only is it not available in our country, but it is also not produced in France. Disputes with the customs over this situation are endless. We hope that merchants in our country will pay attention to this and voluntarily make changes. For our country's goods shipped to Nanyang, especially Vietnam, if a portion of the raw materials used must be produced in foreign countries, we must find a way to inform the original manufacturers not to print the words "Made in [Country]" and cosmetics shipped to Yunnan, if they do not indicate "Made in China" or the titles and instructions are in foreign languages, they should indicate "Made in China" so that the customs can easily identify them, and disputes can be reduced. As for foreign goods that are disguised, such as cod liver oil, because our country does not produce this item, it is difficult to accuse people of taxing them as national goods." Therefore, the Ministry requested that your bureau investigate and instruct the manufacturers to pay attention and correct them. This order."

### Yu Bancheng's Family Property Division Lawsuit

Unable to Mediate - Officially Filed

Yu Huipeng and Yu Maopeng, the direct descendants of Yu Bancheng, the wealthiest man in our county, recently engaged Shao Shengzu, a lawyer, to apply to the local court for mediation on the division of property. The main point was that their ancestor Xuemei gave birth to sons Xi Shun, Xi Lian, and Xi Qian. The petitioners are descendants of the third branch, and the respondents are descendants of the second branch. The ancestor left behind real estate, which includes city houses from No. 176 to No. 184 Yishengfang, Qiaojia Road, Dongan Su Tang, as well as housing at No. 26 and 27 Tu Zi Wei, in the South Shanghai District, measuring 1.676 acres of land, and a cemetery in Caohejing of about 3 acres. The petitioners should inherit one-half of the property, but it has been seized and not divided, and the income over the years (more than 1,500 yuan per year) has been appropriated for their own use, and they are now planning to sell it, etc. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, Zhang Weishi summoned both parties, but neither arrived, only the plaintiff's lawyer appeared in court. The court ruled that because both parties were absent, mediation was not possible, and they should file a formal lawsuit.

### Veteran Clerk Commits Suicide Due to Illness

Li Guangyi from Shandong, aged 26, worked as a veteran clerk at Wang Yiting's roasted goods store at No. 172 Kenenghai Road. Recently, he suffered from severe pulmonary tuberculosis. Unable to afford treatment, his condition worsened day by day. Li was in great pain and, yesterday morning, he became extremely depressed and conceived the idea of ​​ending his life. He secretly went to his sleeping quarters in the attic and committed suicide by hanging himself. The store owner discovered him and tried to take him down, but he was already barely breathing. He reported the incident to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. They summoned an ambulance to the scene and rushed Li to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Morgue. At about 10:00, Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After questioning Wang Yiting, he was informed of the previous situation. Wang also stated that he was unable to pay for the body to be collected because his business had been poor recently and that his family had not yet been found. Tang then ruled that the deceased Li Guangyi, male, died by hanging himself before death. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffin storage.

### Fire in the Caishi Road - Pregnant Woman Dies in the Flames

The Fetus Also Exploded Out of the Abdomen – A Tragic Sight

Jiang Zhang, a woman from Jiangbei (40 years old) lived in the back building of the third floor of No. 191 Renshou Lane, 125 Caishi Road, in the French Concession. The back building was rented to Bao Yinzhi and his wife, also from Jiangbei, who sold tickets for the French Tram Company, and their children. Zhou Ma, a woman from Changzhou (32 years old), the mistress of Zhang Xiuzhen, a watchman from Guanhua Lane, Lafayette Road, was renting a room on the second floor behind Jiang Zhang's house to wait for childbirth. Yesterday morning at 10:00, Bao Yinzhi was sleeping at home. His wife, Pan (32 years old, from Jiangbei), went out to get her hair done, leaving the child at home to play with fire, causing a fire that spread to the house and endangered the people living there. Fortunately, they all escaped immediately, but Zhou Ma, who was pregnant with a full-term baby and living in the room behind the second floor, was too heavy to escape and died in the fire. After the fire department arrived and extinguished the fire, the body was pulled out. The head was charred, the limbs were broken, the abdomen was ruptured, and the fetus also exploded out of the abdomen, which was a tragic sight. The police ordered that the two bodies, large and small, be sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue for examination. The fire starter, Bao Yinzhi and his wife, were summoned to the police station to await investigation.

### Lawsuit over the Election of the French Concession Real Estate Committee

The "Wailun She" translated a French article from the Shanghai Daily News which said that the Shanghai French Consulate Court recently received an unusual lawsuit, which was quite interesting. During the election of the Real Estate Committee of the French Concession Public Works Bureau in March of this year, Dr. Riché, a doctor from the Guangci Hospital, volunteered as a candidate. Later, the number of candidates matched the number of committee members to be elected. Therefore, after the election period, Dr. Riché and another candidate, Engineer Shao Lu, were simultaneously declared elected in accordance with the regulations. The election of the directors of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession this year also had a similar situation, and all the directors took office without being deemed illegal. Therefore, Baudouin, the French Consul General in Shanghai, issued an order appointing Riché as a member of the Real Estate Committee of the Public Works Bureau. However, after receiving the appointment order, Dr. Riché immediately resigned. According to Dr. Riché, the announcement of his candidacy was not posted on time as required by the regulations, which was a violation of the law. Therefore, in addition to resigning, Riché also filed a lawsuit with the French Consulate Court seeking compensation for damages, with the amount of compensation requested being one yuan in Chinese currency to compensate for the loss of his reputation. The organization of the Shanghai French Consulate Court is composed of a judge appointed by the Ministry of Justice in Paris as the president of the court (the current president is Mr. Guofu), and two jurors assist him. These two jurors are the managers of the French business Bailai Foreign Company and the French expatriate Li Shigu Ie Scom. According to the complaint filed by Dr. Riché, the announcement of his candidacy was not posted on time as required by the regulations, but he was appointed anyway, which damaged his reputation. Therefore, Riché requested the court to award him one yuan in compensation to restore his lost reputation, because there was a suspicion of jointly obtaining the election through improper means during this election. According to Riché's own statement, his protest was actually to take care of the interests of all taxpayers in the French Concession, and it was not only for his personal grievance. As for the French Consul General, the Deputy Consul and Director of the Legal Advisory Office of the French Concession, Jiatang, appeared as a lawyer to defend him. According to lawyer Jiatang's counterclaim, although there was an error in the calculation of the posting time of the candidacy announcement, it could not damage the reputation of Dr. Riché. As for the opinion of Court President Guofu, it was necessary to investigate the basic cause of this case, so it was decided to postpone the case to April 21 for retrial.

### Woman Sues Her Husband's Misdeeds, Saying They Could Be Compiled into a Novel

Family Dispute of Economic Doctor Qiu Chengqiu - His Wife Shi Qizheng Sues for Divorce in Court

Qiu Chengqiu (also known as Qiu Peilan) from Wuxing, who resides in Dachong Lane, Tongfu Road, Xuhui, is 45 years old. He studied economics in the United States and obtained a doctorate in economics. After returning to China, he served under Qin Yue at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on Hankou Road for many years due to the recommendation of his wife Shi Qizheng's father. Shi is five years older than him and is now almost fifty years old. Since marrying Qiu, they have had a son and a daughter. The son, Guo Xiang, is seventeen years old, and the daughter is of

Blooming Age. But this middle-aged couple suddenly turned against each other. Mr. Qiu took his children and moved to No. 2 Furu Lane, 61 Maithes Road, and hired lawyer Cai Rudong to file a divorce lawsuit against Qiu Chengqiu in the First Special District Court, vowing not to grow old together. The reasons for seeking a divorce are roughly that since their marriage more than 20 years ago, the defendant has

been addicted to wandering and neglects his duties. Repeated persuasion has had no effect. His various misdeeds are too numerous to list. If they are exposed one by one, it would only increase the psychological hatred between them. But recently, the defendant rented the remaining house on the upper floor of the Sun Changji clothing store at No. 7 Dachong Lane, Tongfu Road with a certain woman to cohabitate, and the defendant also admitted to this in a letter. Seeing this situation, it is impossible to grow old together. The elderly parents-in-law from Nanxun, the original hometown far away, and the cohabitating children, and the relatives and clans in Shanghai all regard the defendant as

incurable. If there is no divorce, they will inevitably be dragged down, so she has no choice but to file this lawsuit. The minor son Guo Xiang should be under the guardianship of the plaintiff, and she requests that a ruling be made together. Yesterday morning, Judge Peng Shi opened the court for trial. The defendant Qiu Chengqiu did not arrive. Lawyer Lin Shenqing appeared in court on his behalf and applied for a postponement. But the plaintiff's lawyer objected. Judge Peng then summoned Qiu Shi Qizheng to court for interrogation. Although the plaintiff is middle-aged, she

loves to dress up. Her hair is still not tied up in a bun, but curled up on the back of her head. According to her statement, her husband has never held any other job except for serving at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Hankou. He specializes in prostitution and gambling. When he runs out of money, he forcibly demands it. His behavior is bad. If she tells everything in detail, it would be enough to compile a novel, but it would only damage each other's faces, so it is difficult to tell everything. The court stated that since the lawsuit has been filed, all the events and the

relevant facts should be fully disclosed without concealment. If there is concern that publicity will be detrimental, the public can be banned from listening to maintain secrecy. Therefore, he ordered all those listening in the courtroom to leave, and then continued to question Shi Qizheng for a long time before announcing the adjournment of the court. It is reported that the defendant Qiu Chengqiu will be summoned to court next time to continue the interrogation.

### Second Group Wedding of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association

After the ceremony was completed, photos were taken. It is reported that the number of spectators on that day reached more than 600, and they had a very good and deep impression on the promotion of marriage reform.

### Embezzlement Discovered After Liquidation of Futai Bank

Four Suspicious Points Found in the Account Review – Assistant Manager Zhang Buzhou and Others Are Accused

Futai Yuanji Bank, located at No. 15 Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road, had a capital of 300,000 yuan. Later, due to poor business, it announced liquidation in June of the 24th year [of the Republic] and formed a Futai Liquidation Office at No. 611 Continental Shopping Mall, Nanjing Road. Now, shareholder Liu Jingqing discovered discrepancies in the accounts and entrusted an accountant to review them. The review found that 1. Yan Xiude's mortgage of 84,243 yuan was initially not recorded in the accounts and was later

added in red ink.

2. Anping Company's mortgage of 100,000 yuan was similar to the above situation. 3. A piece of real estate on Pushi Road was sold by Futai Bank for 184,887 yuan in February of the 23rd year, and sold to the Bank of Communications for only 140,000 yuan in December of the 24th year, causing Futai to lose more than 40,000 yuan. 4. Real estate at Tongfu Lane, Tongfu Road was mortgaged to Futai for more than 51,483 yuan, but the interest rate was only 3%,

which was an exception.

Therefore, it was believed that the bank's assistant manager Zhang Buzhou from Suzhou had engaged in joint embezzlement. Liu then hired lawyers Qian Zheng and Wu Linkun to report to the General Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Zhang Mingde and Detective Kang Zengxiang, they requested the First Special Court to issue a summons. Yesterday morning, Criminal Judge Qian Hongye opened Criminal Court One for trial. Defendant Zhang Buzhou hired lawyers Jiang Baoyue and Yan to

appear in court for defense.

First, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the previous situation and filed charges in accordance with Article 342 of the Criminal Law. Because the plaintiff had not yet clarified the accounts, he requested that the hearing be postponed. Then, Liu Zhongqing stated that after the bank announced liquidation, there was a mortgage of more than 80,000 yuan from Yan Xiude to Futai Bank in the red accounts, which meant that Yan actually owed Futai money. But then Yan suddenly accused Futai Bank of owing him tens of thousands of yuan,

which I found very strange.

When questioned, the defendants said that it was true that they owed Yan, but it was false that Yan owed them, which is why they filed the lawsuit. When questioned, Zhang Buzhou confessed that the real estate mortgaged by Yan Xiude was actually purchased by Futai Bank itself. Later, because they felt that the bank owning real estate would damage the credibility of creditors, they changed it to Yan Xiude's mortgage in order to

ease external concerns.

But his confession was very vague. After verifying the confessions, Judge Qian ruled that the case be postponed for retrial. Defendant Zhang Buzhou was released on bail of 10,000 yuan, and before finding a guarantor, he was temporarily placed in the custody of his defense lawyer Jiang Baoyue.

### The Case of Destroying the Police Station Was Not Concluded Yesterday

Because Three People Did Not Arrive - The Court Strictly Summoned Them to Surrender

Sun Qantai, the chief representative of the workers of the Shanghai Xifeng Tian Weaving Factory, was stabbed on the 19th of last month. After the workers themselves captured the perpetrator Shi Fulin, they petitioned the Caojiadu Branch Bureau to handle the case, gathered thousands of people, destroyed the branch bureau, and injured the branch chief Tan Baoshou. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's police force arrested 16 workers, including Shi Hongfa, Wang Asan, Zhang Asan Yu Haoda, Shi Chunqi, Qin Qiaosheng, Chen Chunsheng, Chen Chunguo, Zhou Lvchang, Hu Shouhou, Jiang Asi, Gan Songlin, Wu Jinsheng, Yang Yuantian, Zhang Wenyuan, Yang Aer, etc. After the Prosecutor's Office approved the defendants to be released on bail, they were prosecuted for obstructing official duties. After two trials, the case was not concluded because two of the defendants, Qu Hongfa and others, did not arrive. Yesterday, in the third trial, Qu Hongfa was originally an unemployed worker and worked as a tea boy in the Workers' Welfare Association on weekdays. After being released on bail, he was nowhere to be found. Qin Qiaosheng returned to his hometown due to family matters, and Yang Er had also stopped working and returned. The other thirteen people all arrived. After the judge ruled that the case could still not be concluded, the court ordered that they must all be present at the next hearing, otherwise they would be arrested. The case was postponed for retrial.

### Youth Dies Under Shanghai-Hangzhou Train, Body Horrifically Severed into Three Sections

Passport States Wang Jingyun, Internal Organs Devoured by Stray Dogs

At the 49-kilometer mark between the 07 and 08 telegraph poles east of the Meilong Railway Station on the Shanghai-West side, at eight o'clock the night before, the No. 803 freight train from Shanghai to Hangzhou suddenly ran over a young man lying prone on the tracks, killing him instantly. By the time the driver noticed and braked, it was too late. The deceased was cut into three sections, his flesh from chest to waist ground into mincemeat, his right hand severed at the wrist, and his internal organs scattered all over the ground, covered in blood. The scene was truly horrific. Upon receiving the news, Wang, the police chief of the Caojing District Meilong Police Station, rushed to investigate and found the deceased with a Western-style haircut, wearing a woolen long gown, a Western-style white shirt underneath, Western-style green woolen trousers, black socks, and yellow leather shoes, head facing north and feet facing south. The upper part of his body was on the tracks, and the lower part was beside the tracks. A passport dated January of the 26th year was found in his pocket, with a half-body photograph, stating Wang Jingyun, 27 years old, from Weixian, Shandong. There was also a letter of appointment stating "Company Commander of the Second Company, First Battalion, Sixth Regiment, Second Brigade." In his trouser pocket was a twenty-cent French currency coin and a diary with a page recording a telephone number. The police station called the number to inquire, but the person on the other end said they did not know him. The body was then moved to the roadside, covered with a reed mat. There were several patches of blood at the scene, and one or two stray dogs were devouring the remains. It is now known that after the railway administration took photographs of the body, Zhang Mingxiang, the local security officer of the 23rd Regiment, reported it to the court for examination. Around 4 PM, a court representative arrived to confirm the death and ordered the security officer to collect the body and bring the belongings to the court for safekeeping, pending identification by relatives. However, it is generally speculated that the deceased may have committed suicide due to financial hardship.

### Xin Hu's Landscape Paintings Exhibited at the Great New Company

Mr. Xin Hu of Lou has mastered the art of landscape painting in both the Northern and Southern schools. Yesterday, I went to the fourth floor of the Great New Company to view his works, and they were breathtaking. I will briefly note a few pieces to inform connoisseurs. For example, in the "Jade Field Crossing Distant Wind" axis, he imitates the vigor and robustness of Yushan, surpassing it. "Mountain Dwelling in Serene Openness" imitates the charm of Shig, with deep wrinkles and dyes capturing the interest of cultivating smoke. The two frames, "Business Bamboo Smoky Waves" and "Viewing Springs Under Pines," both imitate Liuru, with clear grandeur and elegance, taking one far away. "Autumn Trees on Two Mountains" imitates Tingyun, and the recluse searching falls between Shitian and Hengshan, with the brush and ink transforming. His specialty lies in the beauty and harmony of green and blue, such as in the "Spring Colors of Clear Creek" painting, where the swaying willow branches and the scattered mist and haze are vivid and realistic, worth pondering. As for his writing of Du Fu's poetry "Clouds Rise from Empty Walls," each stroke is outstanding and approaches the style of the Song and Yuan dynasties. I do not have time to view everything, but from this glimpse, one can already see a part.

### Jingwu Association Announces Third Membership Drive Results

### Recent News from Two Travel Groups

Yousheng Group: The Yousheng Travel Group of this city, which initiated a trip to the five southern provinces, has completed preparations. Today at 6 PM, the head of the group's travel department, Mr. Han Zhenjia, led twenty members on a special express train to Hangzhou and then to Jiangxi. Those who came to see them off included Liu Yuqi and Xu Yuanqing. It is said that many of the comrades participating in the group are from academic circles. In addition to viewing scenic spots and landscapes, they also emphasize investigative work. The team leader, Mr. Han, is also familiar with the situation in South China, so they complement each other well. When they return, they will surely have detailed reports to refresh the ears and eyes of the people of Shanghai.

Jingwu Association: The Jingwu Athletic Association Travel Group considers Tiantai and Yandang Mountains as the two major scenic spots in central Zhejiang. The magnificence and splendor of the mountains and rivers are enough to satisfy the eyes and broaden the mind. Last month, the association's spring break trip was divided into twelve routes. The Yandang Mountain route had limited slots, and many latecomers were disappointed. Therefore, the second Yandang Mountain travel group was organized, scheduled for April 17-24. Initially, it was planned to take a sea route to Wenzhou, but due to the time required for the round trip and the solitude on the boat, the route was changed to the Hangzhou-Wenzhou highway to see the scenery of Xiandu and Shimen Cave. The itinerary is as follows: On the first day, travel from Shanghai to Hangzhou; arrive in Jinhua early the next morning; arrive in Wenzhou on the second day and visit Jiangshan Temple; tour Yandang Mountain from the third to the sixth day; travel to Shaoxing via Linhai, Tiantai, and Xinchang on the seventh day; visit Lanting on the eighth day; and return to Shanghai that evening. A special tourist bus has been arranged with the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau to travel along the route and reduce the fatigue of long journeys. The fee is twelve yuan, including boat, bus, meals, and accommodation. The quota is twenty people. Those who wish to participate can register directly at the travel department of the association at the Continental Commercial Center.

### American Piano Master Madame Mary Passes Through Shanghai to Beijing

Invents a Harmonious Sound and Light Machine, Adding a Unique Touch to the Music World

"Special Report" Madame Mary, a renowned American piano virtuoso, is known for her mastery of phonetics. Her piano solos are famous in various countries, and her invention of the harmonious sound and light machine is especially appreciated by music lovers. At the beginning of this year, Madame Mary traveled around the world on the Franconia world tour ship, enjoying the scenery of the world. Madame Mary departed from the Americas and traveled through various countries in Europe and Africa, taking the opportunity to give public explanations of her invented harmonious sound and light machine, which was well received by people from various countries. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, and Madame Mary had to depart for Beijing that evening, so she only rested briefly at the Cathay Hotel. Upon hearing the news, the reporter rushed to the hotel and was granted an interview. According to her, this trip is purely for travel, to conduct a slight inspection of the arts of various countries, and to meet with famous musicians from various countries to explore each other. The reporter asked about the function of the harmonious sound and light machine, and Madame Mary said that music is pleasing to the ear, but if there is no pleasing color as an auxiliary, it is difficult to exert its true value. Harmonious music must be harmonious, and why not pleasing colors? Therefore, I devoted myself to research and invented this harmonious sound and light machine in 1920, which can make the six primary colors of red, yellow, blue, cyan, orange, and purple interact and match to form an infinite number of types of light. It is suitable for various tones of different music. In this way, the audience can appreciate the true value of music. Listening to a piece of music is like being in a fairyland, and the spirit can be integrated with the music. In addition to being used in concerts, this device can also be used in theaters, dance halls, and various public gatherings. Due to the haste of this trip around the world, I was unable to bring the equipment with me, so it is a pity that I cannot perform it in public. The reporter did not ask about her future whereabouts, but it is said that she will stay in Beiping for four days and then transfer to Japan to catch the original ship and return to the garden via the Philippines.

### Dongxin Bridge Jiang Wang Clan Robbery Case, Robbers Deny Masterminding

Character Hidden in Mouth and Spat Out the Window, Deny Supplying Guns, Claim There Was a Grudge

The home of Madam Jiang Wang, located at No. 4 Shoulu Lane, Dongxin Bridge Street, French Concession, was robbed of thousands of yuan worth of property on the afternoon of September 9th last year. After reporting the robbery to the police, the Public Concession Police arrested the robbers Tian Linchang, Wang Acai, and Yang Changgen. After they were handed over to the First Special Court and sentenced to imprisonment, the French Concession Police found that the Jiang Wang clan robbery case was committed by Tian and others. Therefore, they transferred Tian, Wang, and Yang, the three prisoners, from the First Special Court to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday, Judge Sun Peng, appointed by the court, presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the Police Department, explained the case and prosecuted them for robbery. Wang Acai confessed that Guo Hongqing (also known as Xiao Hong, from Jiaxing, the owner of the Shenchang Vegetable Shop) and Xu Chunde (who lived at No. 2, Lane 7, Baker Road) instigated him. He was called by Ma Pi, a fellow apprentice of Guo from Chongming Island, to go to Guo's place to discuss the robbery.

Guo said that No. 4 Shoulu Lane, which sold morphine, had four thousand yuan to rob. Then he went to Luochun Pavilion for tea. On September 9th, they met again at Luochun Pavilion, and Guo handed over a pistol. Because it was not enough, he and Guo, Xiao Kai, Chen Abao, Yang Changgen, and others went to Xu Chunde's house, where Xu also handed over a pistol. Immediately after the robbery, the stolen goods were still sent to Xu's house. I got a few pieces of clothes. Today, a patrol officer wearing a uniform

sent a note

to Guo, asking him to provide evidence that he went to Changshu on September 7th. After Guo took a look, he stuffed the note in his mouth, chewed it up, and threw it out the window. It can still be found now. The official ordered two bailiffs to take Wang to find the pieces of paper, which were torn into several pieces and presented to the court. Guo denied instigating the robbery, claiming that the note was written by Wang and others to harm him. He saw them writing it. I went to Changshu on September 7th last year and stayed at the

China Hotel

to pay the old quartermaster's wages. I said this to another prisoner in the prison. Wang and others heard it and framed me based on this. The confessions of Tian and Yang were the same as Wang's. Xu Chunde flatly denied supplying pistols. Guo Hongqing also said that he had a feud with Wu Xiangge due to smoking opium, and Wu and Wang were in the same party and are now framing me. He also hired lawyers Wang Shizong and others to defend him. As the victim had not arrived, the court ordered a postponement to April 16th for further questioning. The defendants were detained in the detention center.

### The Question of Tax Exemption for Guangdong's Foreign Rice and Grain

— Jian Ping

The question of tax exemption for Guangdong's foreign rice and grain can be said to be a huge wave following the rice shortage in Guangdong Province. Because of the rice shortage in Guangdong, those who advocate temporary solutions suggested that Guangdong should be allowed to exempt foreign rice and grain from import tax to provide relief. However, the problem that came with this approach was the opposition from rice merchants in the four provinces. Each side has its own reasoning and insights, and before a sufficient solution is found, I do not wish to participate with any opinions. Here, I will simply try to analyze this issue on its own merits.

The tax exemption for foreign rice and grain in Guangdong has already been decided and scheduled to be implemented on April 1st. However, due to the intense opposition, this matter still needs to be discussed by the Executive Yuan before a decision can be made. A Guangzhou telegram on the 9th still stated, "Guangdong's tax-exempt import of foreign rice has not been unloaded because there is no competent certifying agency. The city's Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the 8th, requesting that a certifying agency be designated as soon as possible to benefit the people's food supply." This shows that it is still "decided but not implemented." From this, the general public can probably dispel their doubts after seeing in Hong Kong newspapers that "Guangdong Province's customs offices have announced the approval of tax-exempt import of foreign rice and grain."

Since it has not been implemented, there is still room for discussion.

First, since tax exemption for foreign rice and grain is a temporary solution, then we would like to see if it can actually "treat the symptoms." Temporary measures are naturally used to alleviate emergencies. For example, during the rice shortage in Guangdong, people had no rice to eat, so to alleviate the emergency, it was advocated to speed up the import of rice. However, when the need for rice is extremely urgent, there will of course be many people who cannot afford the expensive rice, so it is necessary to lower the price of rice. To lower the price of rice, first, supply must exceed demand; and more passively, costs must be reduced. Thus, tax exemption becomes necessary. Therefore, under these circumstances, tax exemption for foreign rice and grain is a very reasonable thing.

However, the problem is not that simple. In the past, Guangdong Province needed millions of dan of foreign rice every year, which meant that the people of Guangdong were shedding millions of dan's worth of blood and sweat to foreign countries every year. Last year, things were a little better. The decrease in food imports was a good sign after a nationwide bumper harvest. But this year, after the half-tax accounting, there is another tax-free import. Since domestic rice is still abundant and the new crop is about to be harvested, why drink poison to quench thirst?

Secondly, according to a local newspaper in this city, before the tax exemption order was even issued, rice merchants in Hong Kong rushed to buy foreign rice, and it was quickly sold out. More than 400,000 bags of foreign rice have already been stored in Hong Kong waiting to be transported to Guangdong. This shows that the tax exemption is not for the sake of need, but for the sake of rice merchants. So how can we talk about relief? Furthermore, after the rice shortage in Guangdong, the People's Food Adjustment Committee immediately rushed to handle the national rice from the four provinces to cope with the situation, but it was unable to equalize the sale price, resulting in "rotten grain in the granaries and hungry people." At the same time, although rice boats were full on the White Goose Lake in Guangzhou, the people still suffered from a lack of rice. This shows that the rice shortage problem is not simply a matter of "scarcity." Therefore, even if foreign rice and grain are imported tax-free this time, if the adjustment is not done properly, will we not have another round of "rotten grain in the granaries and hungry faces"? In this case, not only will the "symptoms" not be treated, but even the "root" will be dug up.

Therefore, it seems that the rice shortage can only be solved by addressing the root cause. Of course, this is not to oppose treating the symptoms, as it is indeed necessary to treat the symptoms when they are urgently needed. However, when treating the symptoms, one should also consider whether the method is feasible. Otherwise, if one province has too much rice production, but another province suffers from a lack of rice, it will lead to river blockage and cause problems for both sides.

### Night Market in Singapore

— Nan Ou

When the black wings of night cover this only metropolis on the Malay Peninsula, although it is still subtropical, the climate gradually cools down. The wind at the bottom of the Strait of Malacca, carrying deep blue seawater, blows over the mysterious naval port, the huge General Post Office, Wheelock and Company, and everyone's heads, as if whispering gently: This is also the night of the Paris in the East!

Capitalists with big bellies and Nyonyas sit in cars and gallop around; Malay nobles are unaware of the demise of their race, living and dying in a drunken stupor in the embrace of the night. Coolies have the opportunity to be temporarily relieved, lying shirtless on the cement floor to cool off. Some shops have already put up their shutters, and the common people have freedom. So, some go shopping; some go to the movies; some go to chat with friends... Everyone goes their own way. I came to Singapore to travel and play, and the return date is not far away. I have been to many places, but I have not yet set foot in the night market—called "Basa m Alam" in Malay—of the New World and the Great World, which is a popular amusement park for overseas Chinese and Malays in Singapore. So, my friend who acted as my guide at night came, and I made a request to go to the night market; naturally, this request was immediately accepted.

After leaving the house, we got into a lorry, the most popular mode of transportation in Singapore's streets, and arrived at the New World at a speed of seventy kilometers per hour. Oh, this colorful world! As soon as I walked in, it was like entering a kaleidoscope, with all kinds of colors and noisy sounds appearing before my eyes. There were so many people, and Malays and overseas Chinese accounted for the majority of these people. There were also children sitting on windmills spinning in the air, or riding wooden horses in circles with the sound of tinkling music. There were lights everywhere; there was the fragrance of powder and the smell of sweat everywhere. And my guide and I walked through the crowd. He pointed out many things and asked if I wanted to see them. Among them were Hula dances from Honolulu; Malay "Romantic Plays"; Javanese Javanese operas, and some magic tricks, dwarfs, and various world-class rare and wonderful things, which could be enjoyed for just a dime or two.

In another corner, there was a dance floor playing jazz music. The dancers here included Eurasian women and Chinese girls who came all the way from Shanghai. However, no matter where they came from, it was an ironclad fact that they showed tearful smiles in the red light and green wine every night. After lingering there for about half an hour, I left.

Night markets exist in every metropolis, but Singapore's night market is full of exotic flavors. Here, there are Chinese Peking operas and Cantonese operas; there are also Malay big wind dances. Here, there is also American foxtrot music and passionate women from Honolulu... Singapore is an international metropolis, but its rulers extract its nourishment from the masses. The day after returning from the night market, I woke up from a chaotic dream and pushed open the window. The first thing I saw was the flag of the British Empire fluttering on top of the skyscraper, which was truly infinitely sentimental.

### Old Han

— Luo Yu

Old Han carried his own blue cloth luggage, poked his head into every room, greeted some familiar faces, and then stepped into the last room with his legs that were half-shambling outwards due to rheumatism and overwork.

He put the luggage on the small stool in front of the door, and he smelled the scent of smoked meat.

"Hard work."

A man in a top hat only nodded slightly on the bunk. He also spoke in a Tangshan accent, and glanced greedily at every nose; the most prominent one was undoubtedly of Russian descent, and there were two flat noses fanning back and forth under the light from the window.

Soon, he began chatting with the man in the top hat.

The tall Russian man was pulled out by a loud quarrel; the flat-nosed people quietly slipped away, it must be very familiar."

"Changchun is a lively place! Even if there is no one to manage the food, fighting with knives is still good! Speaking of Shenyang, closing your eyes, you can pretty much feel it eight times out of ten!"

"Haha—"

"May I ask, sir: is this contracting work, or—"

"Yes, yes, contracting work! No ambiguity, the wages are quite good; repairing a section of railway. Have you ever worked on a railway?"

"No; I worked in coal mines, at Liuhegou and Linxi, and I also worked in Fushun for a long time."

"So you haven't been to Tianjin for long?"

"No; it's been a full three years! Counting from (September 18th)."

"Tell me, how many men do you have?"

"That depends on the treatment; if they all agree, I have a word, about twenty."

The man in the top hat pondered for a long time, staring at him for a long time; glancing at the dilapidated gray ceiling, his yellow eyes circling on the walls adorned with bedbug blood.

After some haggling, the two were very agreeable. The man took out a new banknote and handed it over.

"Look, it's all this damn money! Foreign money has all flowed to beyond the pass. Friend! Have you heard those nonsense, about what Manchuria, what Six Continents Country."

"It's rare to have two, sir." Old Han calmly took the banknote and said. The two laughed very worldly-wise, and thus, the transaction was unexpectedly successful.

The man was obviously moved by this new transaction, put on a large coat, and walked out. He had the air of a grain merchant.

Old Han kept staring at him. When he walked to the cashier's side, the proprietress greeted him familiarly, but he was whispering in the Russian's ear, then smiling greedily. The proprietress also smiled inexplicably. When he walked out the door, the Russian curled his tongue and sang.

Old Han wanted to laugh loudly, then scold angrily. But he couldn't say the reason; everything was done very beautifully, others would not suspect his loyalty, nor would they imagine his recklessness; but what kind of ghost made him so sophisticated and hid his hammer? He couldn't figure it out. But there was a bright belief lurking in his mind, which would bring him victory and give him happiness, and now, it was warning him: "Take action!"

So he picked up the luggage again and walked into the long narrow courtyard. He broke into every room, strange! Those stupid things seemed to be shackled by some invisible shackles, crouching motionless on the bunks, looking at him suspiciously.

Those men (young or old), when you asked them, they would say: "This is for fighting with knives! Who still dreams of anything? If there is no chance to run away before getting on the ship, you will be taken beyond the pass to be a soldier, it's just another way to die!"

But now they were all bewitched, crouching and rolling their eyes at Old Han.

"What are you looking at? Don't you understand? Guys!" He shouted loudly several times. He had never shouted so loudly before.

The young men were the first to be struck by his words, jumping down as if struck by lightning, carrying their newly bought quilts. In no time, they wrapped around all the men, filling the small courtyard.

The Russian man scurried over, stamping his old long boots heavily on the brick surface, like a person practicing maneuvers. Then he glared with his drunken eyes.

"Who dares to run! Which Russian devil is it?" He stood akimbo with his hands, his boots spread apart, like a royal officer (it's just a pity that his jacket was faded), roaring:

"Get back in! Get back in! Get back in!"

Old Han took a step forward, and people only saw his large palm swipe at the fur ball's cheek, causing him to sway and take a step back; he stared with a thousand times more surprised eyes, and finally he fell forward suddenly.

Old Han carried him to the ground.

The young men laughed loudly, like a mountain spring gushing out of the small inn.

"Robbers! Go find the police!" the Russian man kept shouting with a curled tongue.

"Down with the traitors!" People heard this cry
