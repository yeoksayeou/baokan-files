### My Stance Towards Japan Is Neither Softening nor Hardening

Our diplomatic policy remains consistent; resistance will arise against any aggression; if political issues are left unresolved, other negotiations will not yield favorable outcomes; Foreign Minister Wang's words to the Japanese press corps

[Nanjing] According to reports, Foreign Minister Wang received a group of Japanese journalists stationed in Nanjing at the Foreign Ministry at 4:00 PM on the 18th of this month. The group included Mr. Hashimoto and Mr. Yamamoto from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Mr. Shimura from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Mr. Ureshino from the Yomiuri Shimbun, and Mr. Okumiya from the Domei News Agency. The journalists inquired about various aspects of Sino-Japanese relations, to which Minister Wang responded frankly. He stated that improving Sino-Japanese relations has always been his ambition. However, the restoration of amicable relations between the two countries relies on the joint efforts of both sides. He has high expectations for Ambassador Kawagoe. If the new instructions that Ambassador Kawagoe brings back are indeed based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, then the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations should be achievable in the short term. As for the steps of adjustment, it would be best to start with easier issues. The conversation lasted about thirty minutes, and the Japanese journalists expressed their satisfaction. The main points of the questions and answers during the conversation are summarized as follows: (Question) What are your impressions of the Konoe Cabinet? (Answer) As far as we know, Prime Minister Konoe is a leader with the support of the Japanese people. He is familiar with domestic and foreign affairs, and is deeply loved and respected by all sectors. His emergence to form a cabinet will certainly bring about excellent plans and strategies to satisfy the expectations of people at home and abroad. Prime Minister Konoe's statements, as reported in the newspapers, such as advocating that in order to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, it is necessary to first eliminate any suspicion, hostility, and misunderstanding between the Chinese and Japanese governments and people, and promoting sympathy and practical assistance for the Chinese people in building a new China, are all accurate and indisputable arguments. We sincerely hope that he will overcome all difficulties and earnestly implement these principles to fully restore normal Sino-Japanese relations, which is essential for the peace and prosperity of East Asia. (Question) What are your opinions on Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomacy towards China? (Answer) Mr. Hirota is a respected elder statesman who values diplomacy. His name is well known to the Chinese people. His diplomatic speech on January 23, 1935, advocating non-aggression, non-threat, and good neighborliness towards China, and seeking closer relations with China, is still fresh in our minds, and we deeply hope that it can be translated into reality soon. In the past year, the situation in East Asia has changed greatly. We especially hope that he can uphold the spirit of the new era and take equality and mutual benefit as the principles to open a new chapter in Sino-Japanese relations. (Question) Ambassador Kawagoe will soon return to his post in China. Is the Chinese side prepared to start negotiations to adjust Sino-Japanese relations after Ambassador Kawagoe returns to his post? If so, what is the fundamental policy of the Chinese side? (Answer) China's diplomatic policy has already been declared in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and when I took office. I am ready to exchange views with the Japanese side at any time. After Ambassador Kawagoe returns to his post, I am very willing to listen to his opinions. (Question) It is rumored that since the Sino-Japanese negotiations last year, the Chinese side's attitude towards Japan has hardened. What is the truth? (Answer) China's diplomatic policy is consistent, aiming at seeking self-preservation and coexistence. There is no such thing as softening or hardening. (Question) If the adjustment of political relations is impossible, will China consistently reject economic cooperation? (Answer) Regarding the opening of Sino-Japanese relations, our side does not specify which issue should be the prerequisite. However, in fact, all issues between China and Japan are related to political issues. If political issues are left unresolved, it will be difficult to achieve good results in other issues. This is a practical situation, not a theoretical issue. (Question) What is the policy of the National Government on political and economic issues in North China? If issues such as smuggling in Eastern Hebei are not resolved, is economic cooperation between China and Japan in North China impossible? If these issues are resolved, can we expect to resolve other outstanding issues and restore normal relations between the two countries? (Answer) If issues such as smuggling in Eastern Hebei are not resolved, the administration of political and economic affairs in North China cannot be complete.

### Konoe Consults Sugiyama on Relations with China

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe is paying close attention to the development of various situations in North China, Su (Soviet Union), and Manchukuo, as well as general foreign affairs issues, and is carefully considering ways to open up.

The Prime Minister also went to Hakone in the afternoon of the same day for a week's rest, staying at the Fujiya Hotel in Miyashita, and is scheduled to invite Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi on the 20th to listen to general diplomatic issues.

Army Minister Sugiyama told reporters after meeting with Prime Minister Konoe, "The Prime Minister said that he wanted to hear about the situation in Manchuria and North China because the time on the cabinet meeting was limited and it was inconvenient to explain in detail. Therefore, I was able to talk about the general situation today. Just the Manchuria issue alone took over an hour, and I was not able to explain the details." As for the meeting with General Minami, it was a discussion of the situation of governing Korea and other matters.

Since taking office, Foreign Minister Hirota has hoped to implement smooth diplomacy. Among them, regarding the policy towards China, he has established close contact with the Army and Navy authorities, and plans to convene a three-ministry meeting in the near future.

[Tokyo] The position of Japanese financial officer stationed in Shanghai has been suspended since the September 18 Incident (Mukden Incident). Now the Ministry of Finance has decided to restore this system from September this year. In the past five or six years, Japan only had one secretary stationed in Shanghai to collect materials. Last month, the Bank of Japan sent Munakata Hisataka, the director of the National Debt Bureau, to China for investigation. In his report, he strongly advocated that the Bank of Japan should also send personnel to station in Shanghai. This proposal has been adopted by the bank authorities, and the bank representative will be dispatched to China in September or October. It is reported that the adoption of this measure is due to the following reasons: the financial, economic, and monetary information obtained by Japan in China lacks uniformity, which easily leads to serious errors in Japan's understanding of China. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan have decided to send representatives to be stationed in Shanghai to eliminate this defect and obtain accurate information.

This kind of sentiment stirs up anti-Japanese feelings among the Chinese people, not only triggering inauspicious incidents everywhere but also greatly stimulating the Japanese people. This seems to contradict Minister Wang's aim of "harmonizing national sentiments." What is your view? (Answer) "Harmonizing national sentiments" is indeed important, but it requires simultaneous efforts from both countries and cannot be the sole responsibility of one side. To my knowledge, China has not recently been advocating anti-Japanese sentiment. However, if there is an aggressor, regardless of the country, our people will rise up and advocate resistance. (Question) Are Sino-British negotiations ongoing? What is the extent of these negotiations? (Answer) The current relationship between China and Britain remains the same as before, handling ordinary matters through normal diplomatic channels. (Question) What is China's attitude regarding Anglo-Japanese negotiations? (Answer) The scope of Anglo-Japanese negotiations is likely to be broad and not limited to Chinese issues. However, any understanding that involves China must first respect China's territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, and second, seek China's opinions and obtain China's consent. I firmly believe that the views of both parties involved in the negotiations are the same as ours. (Question) Are there plans to initiate negotiations with relevant countries in the near future regarding the abolition of consular jurisdiction? What is the truth? (Answer) The abolition of consular jurisdiction is a consistent policy of the Kuomintang, and the government is prepared to proceed at any time. We are currently still studying and preparing for it. (Question) Is the negotiation of the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty currently in progress? (Answer) The Sino-Russian commercial treaty is like China's commercial treaties with other foreign countries, and discussions can be conducted at any time. (Question) It is said that preparations for the centralization of North China are progressing steadily. Has sufficient consideration been given to the Japanese position in North China in this regard? (Answer) The northern provinces, like other provinces, are part of China's territory, and national laws should naturally be implemented in the northern provinces as well. This is a natural phenomenon in a modern unified country and is nothing to be surprised at. As for the legitimate rights and interests of all countries in China, they should naturally be respected. (Question) What are your expectations for Japan? (Answer) I hope that Japan will respect China's territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity and, based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit, adjust Sino-Japanese relations through diplomatic channels. (Question) Will the world situation trend towards peace or war? What is your opinion? (Answer) Currently, there are clearly two forces in the world. One force is dedicated to maintaining peace, while the other force can unconsciously promote future wars. The growth and decline of these two forces will determine the fate of world peace or war. The Chinese people have always loved peace, and for the sake of world culture and human happiness, we deeply hope that the forces of maintaining peace can overcome everything. (Question) For the cause of peace in the Far East, do you think it is necessary to convene a special conference? (Answer) If the relevant countries can participate in such a conference, cooperate sincerely, and discuss everything, it will indeed be beneficial to peace in the Far East. (Question) It is reported that the Australian Prime Minister proposed a Pacific non-aggression pact at the British Imperial Conference. What are your thoughts on this, Minister? (Answer) The Australian Prime Minister's proposal seems worthy of our study, but its content has not yet been read. (Question) The basis of Japan's policy towards China lies in the free and satisfactory trade of economic raw materials and manufactured goods. What are the strategies regarding this issue? (Answer) Due to geographical, cultural, and other factors, China is very willing to engage in mutually beneficial economic cooperation with Japan. As long as the current political obstacles are removed, such cooperation will not be difficult to achieve. (Question) According to recent reports from various places, the sharp antagonism in the feelings between the people of China and Japan (especially in North China) is intensifying. If this is allowed to continue, the result will be tantamount to waiting for a crisis. What do you think? (Answer) These reports may not be entirely accurate, but conflicts in emotions between the people of the two countries should indeed be avoided. I hope that both countries will work together, especially to remove the obstacles to restoring emotions. (Question) What are your aspirations for opening up Sino-Japanese relations? (Answer) Improving Sino-Japanese relations has always been my aspiration. Years ago, before I assumed any diplomatic responsibilities, I made efforts in this regard. Now that I am in charge of foreign affairs, I will naturally do my best to fulfill this aspiration. However, the adjustment of relations between the two countries still requires the joint efforts of both sides. (Question) According to the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session, the political problem of North China must be resolved in a short period of time. Regarding this matter, does your country have a positive intention to start negotiations with Japan, or will you wait for the time to be ripe and take a wait-and-see attitude? (Answer) The so-called political problem of North China can be easily resolved, no matter what method is used, as long as Japan has the determination to untie the knot. (Question) Ambassador Kawagoe will return to Nanjing from Japan around the end of June, carrying a new China policy based on equality and mutual benefit. What are your expectations and thoughts on this, Minister? (Answer) I have great expectations for Ambassador Kawagoe. If the new instructions brought back by Ambassador Kawagoe are indeed based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, then I firmly believe that the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations will be achieved in a short period of time. (Question) Is there a way to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations? If so, what kind of method will it be? Specifically, how can this deadlock be broken? (Answer) I believe that it is not difficult to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. As long as both sides respect each other's territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, and strictly maintain the spirit of equality and mutual benefit, negotiations can break through the difficulties. As for the steps, I think it is best to start with easier issues first, and then proceed to solve the more difficult issues. (Question) It is said that the Chinese side insists on the cancellation of East Hebei as an absolute condition for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Is this true? (Answer) Our side has not specified any issue as an absolute prerequisite for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, but the existence of the puppet organization in East Hebei is detrimental to China and does not benefit Japan. It is a very simple and easy problem to solve. If such a simple problem cannot be resolved satisfactorily, then other more complex problems will naturally be more difficult to address. This is a very obvious truth. (Question) No matter how much the tax police force is expanded and strengthened, the thorough elimination of smuggling is not only impossible before Sino-Japanese relations are normalized, but it will also risk causing unexpected incidents between China and Japan. Does the Chinese side intend to reduce tariffs? (Answer) Smuggling not only reduces China's tax revenue but also affects Chinese and foreign businesses. Even legitimate Japanese merchants are harmed by it. The Chinese government is taking appropriate measures to prevent smuggling, which is a matter of course. We cannot imagine that this will cause any unexpected incidents. As for import tariff rates, any country can consider the situation and adjust them automatically at any time. However, illegal merchants cannot use smuggling as a threat to demand tariff reductions. (Question) What do you hope from my (Japanese) people? (Answer) I hope that the general Japanese public can have a correct understanding of the new China, a correct understanding of the crux of the Sino-Japanese disputes over the years, and that the Japanese press will avoid stimulating emotional rhetoric and create a more friendly atmosphere. If so, the work of adjusting relations between the diplomatic authorities of the two countries will be greatly reduced in obstacles. (Central News Agency, 19th)

### Some Suggestions on Overseas Chinese Education

— Wu Junsheng

Recently, I had the opportunity to examine education in the United States and also visited and investigated many overseas Chinese schools established in the United States. At that time, I deeply felt the importance of overseas Chinese education and also discovered many areas that should be improved. Now, I suggest a few points for the reference of those who are concerned about overseas Chinese education.

The importance of overseas Chinese education is self-evident. The contributions of overseas Chinese to the motherland in the past are partly attributable to overseas Chinese education. In the future, to maintain the connection between overseas compatriots and the motherland, we must pay attention to overseas Chinese education. According to the laws of some countries (such as the United States), native-born children belong to the nationality of the country where they are located. This provision of status can easily cause native-born children to forget their motherland. However, until now, the national consciousness of the general overseas Chinese children is still very strong, and their patriotic sentiment is still very fervent. This cannot but be attributed to the overseas Chinese schools, because overseas Chinese schools teach the language, script, history, and geography of the motherland, so they have not forgotten their motherland to this day, and their patriotic expressions are sometimes more ardent than those of compatriots in the country. Judging from the many overseas Chinese schools I saw in the United States, they are generally satisfactory. The enthusiasm and perseverance of the people who run these schools are especially admirable. However, these schools inevitably have some difficulties and shortcomings in their facilities, which should be remedied.

Overseas Chinese schools in the United States have the same shortcomings as schools in China, that is, there are too few schools, and not all overseas Chinese children have the opportunity to enroll. San Francisco is the most developed place for overseas Chinese education. There are as many as nine Chinese schools established by overseas Chinese, seven of which also have secondary school classes. There are more than two thousand students in total. According to estimates by people in the schools, out of every ten overseas Chinese children who attend American schools, nine also attend Chinese schools. The fact that so many children receive Chinese education is very gratifying. However, the situation of overseas Chinese education in other cities besides San Francisco is not so gratifying. Taking large cities in the United States such as Chicago and New York, the number of Chinese expatriates is not small, but there are only one or two overseas Chinese schools. As for other small towns and villages where overseas Chinese reside, most of them have overseas Chinese schools. This situation is not very serious at present, because although some overseas Chinese children do not have the opportunity to attend Chinese schools and receive Chinese education, their grandparents or fathers are from China, have more or less received Chinese education, and still preserve the teachings of their home country. They can still provide education to their descendants at home, so that they will not forget their motherland. However, if this situation continues for several generations, then the consciousness of the motherland will inevitably gradually become blurred, and patriotic feelings will gradually cool down, and the overseas Chinese will lose the valuable connection with the motherland. This is a great loss to both the motherland and the overseas Chinese. In order to avoid this loss, we must try to remedy the lack of universal Chinese education for overseas Chinese children.

The second shortcoming of overseas Chinese schools in the United States is in the curriculum. These schools almost all compile their curricula according to the general standards of primary and secondary schools in China. Although the total number of subjects is slightly reduced, the content of each subject set is almost completely the same as in China. The textbooks used are also mostly those commonly used in primary and secondary schools in China. This approach, which tries to ensure that overseas Chinese children receive the same education as children in China, seems ideal. However, in fact, there are great difficulties. Originally, these children who enter overseas Chinese schools are still required by law to attend local American public schools. According to the currently popular method, in order to take care of both sides, they attend American schools during the day and receive the same education as American children; in the evening, they attend overseas Chinese schools and receive almost the same education as children in the motherland. In this way, a double burden is placed on the shoulders of these clever, lively, and lovely overseas Chinese children! This excessive burden naturally damages their health and learning efficiency, which is a very serious problem. Not only that, but some overseas Chinese schools, because of the demands of the students' parents, adopt classical Chinese textbooks for everything: in addition to ordinary subjects, they also add classes such as reading scriptures and writing poetry. This adds more pressure to their weak minds. These overseas parents in foreign countries, because they cherish their motherland, cannot find comfort in their hearts unless they pass on the essence of their motherland's past culture to their children. Their feelings are very worthy of sympathy and admiration. However, they do not know that adding such a burden to the already heavy shoulders of their children, a burden that even children in China cannot handle happily, will not only damage the health of their children, but also cause them to hate the culture of their motherland. In order to reduce the intellectual burden of overseas Chinese children, we must also try to alleviate this difficulty in terms of curriculum.

Regarding the two difficulties of the lack of universal overseas Chinese education and the excessive amount of curriculum, I suggest two remedies.

The biggest reason for the underdevelopment of overseas Chinese education is naturally the lack of funds and teachers. To expand overseas Chinese education, we naturally hope that local overseas Chinese will be more enthusiastic in donating funds. However, the domestic agencies in charge of overseas Chinese education should also provide assistance. These agencies also have ways to provide assistance funds. However, according to the principals of overseas Chinese schools, these assistance funds were originally very small, and the amount of money allocated to each school, when converted into US dollars, is really negligible. The existence or absence of these assistance funds is really insignificant. In the situation where compulsory education has not yet been universalized in China, we certainly cannot hope that the government will allocate large sums of money to subsidize overseas Chinese education. However, government assistance does not necessarily have to be in the economic field. The biggest expenditure of overseas Chinese schools is the salaries of teachers. Rather than providing insignificant amounts of money, China should supply the teachers that overseas Chinese schools need most. How should these teachers be supplied? According to a friend in the Chinese Consulate in Chicago, he once submitted a proposal to the government, asking the government to stipulate that all publicly funded students studying abroad have an obligation to educate overseas Chinese children locally. I think this method is very advisable. Students studying abroad have received preferential treatment from the government, and it is only right for them to spend a few hours a week in their spare time to serve their compatriots. Moreover, students studying abroad have a cultural mission. On the one hand, they accept foreign culture abroad, and on the other hand, they also sow some seeds of Chinese culture abroad, which is the most meaningful work of cultural communication. Currently, in the large and small cities in the United States where overseas Chinese gather, there are publicly funded students studying abroad. If the government has the above-mentioned regulations, then the problem of teachers for promoting overseas Chinese education everywhere can be completely solved, and the problem of funds can also be largely solved as a result. This easy way to promote overseas Chinese education is worth recommending to the country in earnest.

Regarding the curriculum of overseas Chinese schools, I suggest reorganizing it, and the reorganization should be based on the principle of simplification. The subjects and amount of curriculum in overseas Chinese schools should definitely not be the same as in primary and secondary schools in China. Both subjects and time should be reduced as much as possible. In the primary school section, there should be at most two subjects: Mandarin and society. The Mandarin subject should purely teach vernacular Chinese, so that students can speak Mandarin and can recognize and write Chinese characters. The social studies subject should mix Chinese history, geography, civics, and past valuable teachings, so that children can have a concise understanding of their motherland. The class time for these two subjects should not exceed one hour per day. The curriculum of the middle school section should also only be divided into two subjects: Mandarin and society. Mandarin should still focus on vernacular Chinese, and classical Chinese and simple and easy-to-understand ancient Chinese compositions with value can be added as appropriate. However, classical Chinese is used for ancient Chinese compositions, but it is hoped that students can understand and appreciate them, but they should not be ordered to write them. The social studies subject can be appropriately divided into three parts for study: Chinese history, Chinese geography, and Chinese civics, but it is still required to be continuous. The class time for Mandarin and social studies in middle school should also be limited to one hour per day. Special textbooks should be compiled for Mandarin and social studies in primary and secondary schools. The selection of materials should be as concise as possible, and it should also meet the needs of overseas Chinese. These textbooks should preferably be compiled and printed by the Ministry of Education. All overseas Chinese schools registered with the Ministry of Education can receive these textbooks free of charge. Giving them to students without compensation. If the problems of curriculum and textbooks can be solved in this way, I think that on the one hand, the burden on students can be reduced, and on the other hand, the efficiency of overseas Chinese education can be increased.

The above two suggestions are both simple and easy to implement. If the authorities adopt them for implementation, the future of overseas Chinese education will have infinite hope.

### Japanese Representative Demands Development of Other Countries' Raw Materials

South American Representatives Raise Questions, Believing It Harms Territorial Sovereignty

[Geneva] The Committee on Raw Materials Problems established by the League of Nations Administrative Council continued its meeting today. Japanese representative Shudo spoke first, arguing that countries that do not produce raw materials should have the right to develop raw materials hidden in undeveloped areas and cited the League of Nations' current mandate system as a basis for this. Brazilian representative Muniz questioned Shudo, saying that according to Shudo's meaning, are the United States or Brazil countries that contain raw materials but have not been developed? Shudo replied that he did not mean that. Argentine representative Anto Correa also said that he hoped Shudo did not mean any South American country. At this point, the committee formed a special working group composed of representatives from Japan, Brazil, Poland, and the United Kingdom to draft a report on the Japanese representative's proposal. Muniz later declared, "The principle proposed by Shudo can only be applied to colonies and cannot be applied to any country with complete territorial sovereignty. Therefore, Shudo should be asked to specify his general meaning in detail." British representative Sir Leith-Ross continued, "The Committee on Raw Materials Problems should only deal with the redistribution of raw materials and should not involve territorial issues." At this point, Muniz again said that some countries have too narrow a view of the raw materials problem, and this tendency may cause a serious reaction from Latin American countries.

### Weng Wenhao Gives Speech in Germany

Welcoming Foreign Capital and Talent

[Berlin] At the invitation of the Society for Sinology Studies, Weng Wenhao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan of China, gave a speech at the Dresdner Bank here yesterday on the development of Chinese industry and its relationship to the development of rich resources. The audience included countless officials from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economy, various departments, the National Bank, and the National Socialist Party. Weng declared that China's work on developing mines has just begun, and it is hoped that there will be significant progress within a few years. The method of "spheres of influence" in the past is no longer politically possible today. The current Chinese government's mining law has proven to be extremely successful from the perspective of both China and foreign countries and interests. Weng listed several examples to illustrate this, and then said that China now hopes to cooperate with foreign countries and welcomes the assistance of foreign capital and technical personnel and organizational personnel. In recent years, China has made amazing progress in technology, and domestic engineers are even more skilled than foreign engineers, but China still feels a lack of experience in modern engineering development and is willing to cooperate with friendly countries to promote progress. Weng pointed out that the basic condition for all cooperation is that foreign groups must respect China's sovereignty. China hopes to cooperate with any foreign country that accepts this condition.

### Three Soviet Aviators Fly Over the North Pole to the United States

Non-Stop Flight Progressing Smoothly, Preparing for Moscow-San Francisco Connection

[San Francisco] Three Soviet aviators, piloting a red-gray monoplane, are attempting a flight from Moscow to San Francisco via the North Pole (6,250 miles). They flew over the North Pole at 1:10 PM yesterday (Shanghai time) and are now approaching the northern border of Canada early this morning. According to the U.S. Army Department's announcement at 3:20 PM yesterday, the Soviet plane had already passed 550 miles beyond the North Pole. Officials at the Walker Rankin Air Harbor in San Francisco have begun preparations for a welcome. The Soviet plane's route, after passing the North Pole, is expected to proceed first to Prince Patrick Island, then via Canada's Simpson Fort, and into Seattle, Washington, USA. However, it must fly over the treacherous Rocky Mountains to reach San Francisco along the Pacific coast. (19th National Telegram)

[Moscow] Soviet authorities only announced 24 hours after a Soviet plane's departure from Moscow to San Francisco, stating that three famous sky heroes were undertaking this feat. After 18 and a half hours, they had flown over the North Pole. It is predicted that if the flight is successful, an observatory will be established at the North Pole, and an aviation base will be established on Prince Rupert Island. Within two years, a regular air route from Moscow to the United States via the North Pole can be established. (Central News Agency, 19th Reuters dispatch)

[San Francisco] At 10:20 AM this morning (Greenwich Mean Time), the Soviet plane had flown 400 miles into the Americas. It is reported that the weather conditions along the planned northern Canadian route are extremely good. (Central News Agency, 19th Reuters dispatch)

[San Francisco] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, quietly arrived here today, saying that Soviet aviator Chkalov, along with Belyakov and pilot Belyakov, flew from Moscow to the United States via the North Pole and are expected to arrive here directly on Sunday. The monoplane used this time is the same as the one used by Levanevsky two years ago when he tried the same route, but Levanevsky was forced to fly back due to a broken oil pipe. (18th National Telegram)

[Washington] According to Gilmore (who was ordered to inspect the various instruments on the Soviet plane when it arrives in San Francisco), the Soviet plane is expected to arrive in San Francisco at 2:00 PM tomorrow (Greenwich Mean Time). (Central News Agency, 18th Havas dispatch)

[Moscow] The non-stop long-distance aviation from Moscow via the North Pole to North America departed from here at 4:05 AM on the 18th. The aircraft used was the Ant-25, piloted by Soviet aviators Chkalov, Belyakov, and Belyakov. They volunteered for this test flight, which was approved by the government, and a special committee was formed to prepare for it. The committee members were Chairman of the Heavy Industry Committee, Rukimovich, Deputy Chairman Kaganovich, aircraft designer Tupolev, Deputy Minister of National Defense Yaknis, and Deputy Director of the Northern Sea Route Administration, Yansen. Before 65 degrees north latitude, the aircraft flew at an altitude of 1,150 meters to 1,430 meters. From 65 degrees to 68 degrees, it rose to 2,500 meters. At 12:32 noon, it crossed 68 degrees north. At 4:32 PM, it reached 72 degrees 7 minutes north, at an altitude of 2,600 meters, with heavy clouds covering the sea and the temperature reaching minus 10 degrees. Until then, the aircraft flew directly along 38 degrees east longitude. At 8:13 PM, when flying to 78 degrees 10 minutes north latitude and 91 degrees east longitude, it switched to complete blind flying, rising to 4,080 meters, and the aircraft slightly iced up. At 10:00 PM, it approached Franz Joseph Island, and the machinery was performing very well. (19th TASS dispatch)

### Soviet Purge Movement Continues Across Regions, Arresting People

Accusation Letters and Telegrams Arrive Like Snowflakes, Damaging Railways and Manipulating Bread

⊙ Riga According to news from Moscow, Stalin's purge movement is still ongoing, with more arrests recently. Telegrams from all over the Soviet Union denouncing Trotsky's conspiracy to destroy and divide are also arriving like snowflakes. It is also reported that among those recently arrested, there are seven suspects of damaging locomotives, two senior officials of the Archangel city, whose crime is being enemies of the people, and Gebeike, the former director of the Far East Timber Company in Boli, whose crime is engaging in counter-revolutionary activities and inciting popular dissatisfaction. Vasiliev and several of his subordinates were arrested for repeatedly neglecting their duties and failing to provide equipment for 5,000 overseas Chinese families. There were also eight people arrested in Rostov for purchasing large quantities of bread and engaging in speculation. In the same place, five officials and countless subordinates were arrested for the crime of sabotage and espionage. Many people have also been arrested at the Omsk Railway Works, and it is said that more people will continue to be arrested in the future. (Central News Agency, 18th Reuters dispatch)

### Belgian Prime Minister Arrives in New York

Will Visit Roosevelt

[New York] Belgian Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland and his wife arrived here today on the Berengaria liner. In a statement to the press, he said, "I am extremely pleased to revisit the United States and to meet and talk with President Roosevelt and his advisors. Compared with Europe, the economic recovery in the United States is very rapid, which is beyond the reach of European countries. However, the enthusiasm of Europeans to develop various businesses in the most realistic and generous way is increasing day by day. I dare to believe that this desire is completely in line with the views of the American people. The trend of countries coordinating their forces to seek the smooth development of the general situation has already emerged. It is not far off to take this trend further and concretize it. This coordinating trend is enough to improve the common living standards of mankind, and this is what everyone in the world thinks." When reporters asked whether his visit to the United States was due to the commission of the US and French governments to investigate the possibility of removing international trade barriers, Prime Minister Zeeland replied, "I was indeed commissioned by the British and French governments, but the commissioned task and my visit to the United States are two completely different things. They must not be confused." (Central News Agency, 18th Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Political Parties

The Seiyukai and Minseito Parties Engage in Reform

[Tokyo] The atmosphere of organizing a new party has now dissipated. The Konoe Cabinet has publicly stated that it has no intention of organizing a new party in order to gain the support of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties. Those who were engaged in organizing the party have also ceased their activities. However, due to Japan's active reform of its political and economic structure under the principle of control, the need for a new political party has not disappeared. At present, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, in view of the domestic and foreign situation, deeply feel that the so-called revival of political parties must start with their own reform. The Minseito party has begun this reform and decided to formulate several new policies under the slogan of building a new centralized state. The Minseito party is confident that it is neither a right-wing nor a left-wing party. Its position is considered to be neutral. Its new platform has been slightly changed to take liberalism, maintaining the status quo, and capitalism as guiding principles. The reform movement within the Seiyukai has also begun, and its trend is probably no different from that of the Minseito party. The forced reform of existing Japanese political parties to adapt to the environment and develop the future indicates a great impact on the current situation, and the continued right-wing trend of the parties is particularly noteworthy.

### Japanese Import Surplus Exceeds 40 Million Yen

Second Ten Days of This Month

[Tokyo] The Ministry of Finance announced the approximate figures for Japan's foreign trade in the middle ten days of June as follows (all figures are in units of 1,000 yen):

Exports 87,491

Imports 127,507

Total 215,000

Import Surplus 40,081

The total import surplus since January is 624,919 (19th Domei dispatch)

[Tokyo] Both exports and imports continued to decrease in the middle ten days of June. Exports decreased by 1,597,700 yen compared to the first ten days of the month, and imports also decreased by 7,786,000 yen. However, the total import surplus still reached 40 million yen, so the cumulative import surplus this year has reached 624 million yen, which is twice as much as the same period last year. It can be said to be an unprecedented record. Although exports since January have been very strong, there is still a huge import surplus, and it far exceeds the increase in exports. However, this is due to the active economy, especially the expansion of production, so the large import of materials and machinery is the reason, and it should not be a cause for any pessimism.

### French Government Given Full Powers on Financial Matters

Senate Committee Overturns It

[Paris] The Senate Finance Committee met today to review the Financial Full Powers Act and passed a new draft law, which actually completely overturned the Full Powers Act passed by the House of Representatives on the 16th of this month. Therefore, after the political turmoil has just subsided, it will be triggered again due to the attitude of the Senate. When the Senate Finance Committee met today, Prime Minister Blum and Finance Minister Auriol were not present. Only Auriol sent a letter to the rapporteur of the Senate Finance Committee, Garde, asking the committee to pay attention to the need to make a rapid decision, saying that in the current situation, the government should not only stop speculative manipulation, but also try to prevent French capital from escaping abroad. Over the past two years, no less than five to six million francs of French funds have flowed abroad. These outflowing capital are all evading their responsibility to the country, and it is imperative to make them flow back to the country again. The Finance Minister said in his letter that the government cannot propose to the Finance Committee any new bill that restricts the government's actions too strictly, so he hoped that the Finance Committee would quickly approve the law passed by the House of Representatives. However, after discussing the matter, the Finance Committee still insisted on drafting a new bill to replace the bill passed by the House of Representatives. This new bill was approved by a majority vote of the committee this afternoon and is ready to be submitted to the Senate for discussion. The new bill only allows the government to take various necessary measures for the following purposes: to prevent and punish any speculative manipulation that endangers savings funds and public credit. In addition, the new bill clearly stipulates that the government shall not take the following five measures: ㊀ Any measures to manage foreign exchange, or to restrict the circulation of foreign currencies and domestic and foreign securities, or to stipulate their prices; ㊁ Any measures to change the existing gold parity of the franc; ㊂ Any measures to nationalize industry and commerce that have not been stipulated by current laws; ㊃ Compulsory raising of national debt or compulsory exchange of public bonds; ㊄ Any measures to change the existing relationship between the Bank of France and the state. The government shall not take the above five items based on the Full Powers Act. (Central News Agency, 18th Havas dispatch)

### Philippine Sugar Dumped in Hong Kong

Netherlands Lodges Protest

[Manila] U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, reported to the U.S. State Department today that it is rumored that the Philippine sugar industry has reached the Anti-London Sugar Agreement, overproducing sugar and dumping it in Hong Kong, requesting a ruling. Javanese sugar merchants have also asked the Dutch authorities to protest to the U.S. government about this matter. According to a report from the Philippine Sugar Association to McNutt, after the signing of the London Sugar Agreement, a total of 4,000 tons of Philippine sugar was shipped to Hong Kong. McNutt asked officials from the Philippine Autonomous Government to assist in preventing this dumping, pending handling by the U.S. State Department. (18th National Telegram)

### Factional Movement Within British Labour Party

MPs Criticize Leaders

[London] Labour MP Weir criticized the party's parliamentary members and party leaders for their taciturn attitude when discussing important issues. He submitted a long article to the party's Executive Committee, attacking them. Regarding Prime Minister Chamberlain's abolition of the fixed annual salary (stipulated at £2,000 per year) of the leader of the parliamentary opposition party, Labour Party parliamentary leader Attlee failed to fight for it. Weir fiercely attacked this in the article, saying that this would cause the Labour Party to lose its true meaning as an opposition party in Parliament. It is generally believed that Weir's move is enough to prove that the factional movement within the party has become increasingly serious. The party will submit it for discussion at a meeting next Wednesday. (Central News Agency, 19th Havas dispatch)

### Lushan Summer Training

Administrative Personnel Summoned to Participate, Gathered in Batches in Lushan Starting in July

Nanchang Correspondence, Lushan has beautiful scenery and a cool climate in summer, making it a great place for summer recuperation. President Chiang conducted summer military training here in 1933 and 1934, and finally quelled the banditry. In order to implement this spirit, summer training will continue to be held in Lushan this summer. In advance, lecture halls were built in Huolianyuan to serve as residences for the trainees. The scale is quite large and has been completed. Those who are summoned for training include principals of middle schools, deans of discipline, scout instructors, commissioners of administrative districts, section chiefs of county governments, and directors of county education bureaus. They will be gathered in Lushan in batches from July 1st to August 30th for strict training. The main subjects are spiritual speeches, specialized lectures, and instructions from central leaders, so that the spirit of the top and bottom can be connected. At the moment, the Xunlu Road is crowded with officials, and the price of houses in various places in Guling is more than doubled compared to last year due to insufficient supply. (June 18th)

### Wuchang District Prosecutor's Office Appeals the Yang Assassination Case

Currently Reviewing Case Files and Supplementing Reasons for Appeal, Yang Family Independently Appeals Civil Portion

Hankou Correspondence, After the first instance verdict of the assassination case of the late Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Yang Yongtai, by the Wuchang District Court, the defendants, except for Li Qunjian, who was declared innocent, all seven of the remaining Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan appealed successively. The prosecutor Zhu Chengzuan, who handled the case in the District Court, also filed an appeal, stating only that he disagreed with part of the judgment in the case and declaring an appeal. It was not specified whether the appeal referred to the Liu Luyin part, the Li Qunjian part, or other parts, and the reasons for the appeal were also to be supplemented. In addition, the Yang Yongtai family believed that the District Court's sentence on Liu was too light. In addition to expressing disagreement and requesting the prosecutor to write the appeal on their behalf, an independent appeal was also filed for the incidental civil portion. The original text of the incidental civil appeal is as follows: The declarants Yang Li Wuzhen, Yang Yixi, Yang Xuanxi, Yang Qiuxi, Yang Yanxi, Yang Chenxi, Yang Lianxi, Yang Zhunxi, and Yang Tang Xueyong, the legal representative of the four people on the right, are dissatisfied with the judgment in the incidental civil lawsuit regarding the Liu Luyin et al. murder case. It is declared that according to the court's judgment, Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, and Cao Bingrong should jointly and severally compensate the plaintiffs for damages of 20,000 national currency and consolation money of 10,000 yuan, and the remaining claims are dismissed. However, the plaintiffs filed an incidental civil lawsuit in accordance with Article 192, Paragraph 2, Article 194 of the Civil Code, and Article 491, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, requesting compensation for support expenses of 118,560 yuan and consolation money of 100,000 yuan, which is based on the status of the victim and the living conditions of the victim's family, as well as the degree of mental suffering, and the status and financial resources of the perpetrator as standards. The victim, Yang Gong Yongtai, held important positions throughout his career, advocated integrity, and was known to all. Throughout his life, he was selfless and did not manage the family's production. All the family's education and support expenses depended on his salary income. The plaintiffs have a large family, some studying abroad, some studying at domestic universities, some just entering middle school, and some entering elementary school together. The huge expenses are self-evident. Now that Gong was suddenly assassinated, the children lost their father, and the whole family was helpless. Not only is the future bleak, but it is also not easy to support the current life. The mental suffering is even more difficult to describe. The original judgment said that the amount of compensation requested by the plaintiffs was not much, which was really insightful. However, because the defendants Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, and Cao Bingrong were all poor and had no property, and it was speculated that Liu Luyin was not wealthy, it was only ordered that the defendants jointly and severally compensate for support expenses of 20,000 yuan and consolation money of 10,000 yuan, and the remaining claims were dismissed, which was not enough to show convincingness. The financial situation of Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, etc., has not been investigated through their official powers, and it is difficult to determine whether they have the ability to compensate. As for Liu Luyin, as a Central Committee member, a standing committee member of the Mass Movement Committee, and appointed as the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department and the Deputy Dean of the Examination Yuan of the National Government, his position is not unimportant. He also organized the China Youth Special Service Team, with monthly expenses of thousands of yuan, and organized the Revolutionary Army Group, which was even larger in scale. The headquarters was equipped with secretarial, organization, propaganda, transportation, and finance departments, which can be seen. The defendant Liu Luyin is now the leader, and the group headquarters, brigades, companies, and platoons are all under his command. How could it be held without sufficient funds? The general chapter of the Revolutionary Army Group was approved by Liu Luyin in his capacity as the leader, and it was not pointed out who would be responsible for the expenses. It is even more proof that this huge amount of funds was provided by the defendant personally. As a counter-revolutionary leader who held a high position and possessed huge sums of money, the original judgment speculated that he was not wealthy, which was obviously inappropriate. It is not enough to provide relief without declaring an appeal. Liu Luyin et al. have already filed an appeal against the criminal judgment. It is requested that the appeal of this incidental civil lawsuit be sent to the second instance court for trial together to correct it, which is for the public benefit. It is reported that the District Court prosecutor still needs to review the case files and draft the reasons for the appeal, so it will be delayed until next week. The High Court must wait for the District Court to send all the case files and all the appellants' reasons for appeal before it can conduct research and decide on the trial date. According to the President of the High Court, Xi Jun, the court has three criminal courts, the first, second, and third, each with a president and two judges. Cases are handled on a rotating basis in a certain way. It is not yet known which court will hear the case and who will be responsible for it. (June 18th)

### Pinghan Railway Huahua Branch Line Officially Starts Construction

The Entire Line is 300 Kilometers Long, with Expenses of 25 Million

Hankou Correspondence, The Ministry of Railways ordered the Pinghan Railway Bureau to build the Huahua branch line. Planning began in January last year and is now ready. At 12:00 noon on the 17th, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at Huayuan Station. Chief of the Military Affairs Commission, He Chengjun, attended in person, and the Provincial Government sent Wu Tingyang, Director of the Construction Department, to participate as a representative. After all the ceremonies were held, more than 300 workers began work. The Huahua branch line is one of the branch lines of the Pinghan Railway. It starts from Huayuan Station and passes through Xiaogan, Anlu, Yingshan, Suixian, Zaoyang, and Xiangyang counties to Laokou in Guanghua County. All the areas along the way are densely populated and rich in products in northern Hubei. The total length is 104 kilometers. In the past, transportation was inconvenient, and product transportation was extremely difficult. Although a motor road was built later, connecting Hankou directly to Laokou and reaching Baihe via Junyun to reach Shaanxi, it was still not enough to respond. The Ministry of Railways believed that the road connects Qin and Long in the north and Bashu in the west. If the branch line is built, the northwest border can be closely linked with the Yangtze River basin, which will be beneficial to the military, political, social, people's livelihood, and the progress of the country's entire railway policy. Therefore, it was decided to build the Huahua branch line. The construction cost, including locomotives, vehicles, and all equipment, was originally 20 million national currency. Later, due to soaring material prices and steel mountain prices, it doubled, and the expense budget increased to 15 million yuan. The Ministry ordered that the entire line be completed within two years from the date of commencement of construction, and limited that the section from Huayuan to Lishan, which belongs to Suixian, 110 kilometers long, be completed within this year. It was also named the Huahua branch line by the Ministry, and the Huahua Branch Line Engineering Office was established, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau. According to the Bureau's forecast, the benefits of the completion of the branch line are extremely numerous. From the perspective of the Bureau's economy, on the day the line is completed and opened to traffic, there will be more than 300,000 tons of freight every year. This income is enough to bear the interest on the construction cost of the line with a surplus. The completion of the branch line can also increase the operating income of the main line by more than one million yuan per year, which is enough to cope with the repayment of the principal and interest of its construction capital. (June 17th)

### Construction of the Scenic Line in the Zao Lu Sage Area

Sun Tongxuan Builds Roads for Easy Sightseeing

Jinan Communications and Construction Department, Tai'an County, and Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 20th Division, have recently cooperated in a plan to renovate Qin Mountain. Sun Tongxuan also believes that Qufu and Zou County in Yanzhou are the hometowns of Confucius and Mencius and the birthplace of Chinese culture. Therefore, in recent years, he has also actively engaged in construction. The highway between Yanzhou and Qufu has long been completed, with lush trees lining the road. Every few miles, there is a pavilion for pedestrians to rest. The pavilions are engraved with maxims of Confucius and Mencius, so that people can hear the teachings of the sages even on their journey. Recently, Zou County has become the location of the Temple of Mencius and the Tomb of Mencius. Nishan in the county is the place where Confucius' mother prayed and gave birth to Confucius, and Fuzhuang is the hometown of Mencius. A highway is being built from Qufu, passing through Nishan to Fuzhuang in Zou County, about 180 miles long. A car can take you on a tour in two hours. Those traveling by Jinpu Railway can get off at Zou County, Qufu, or Yanzhou. It is also planned to build a motor road from Taian Station, passing through the west side of Mount Tai to Zhongtianmen, and then change to mountain sedan to climb the mountain. In the future, transportation to famous scenic spots in southern Shandong will be convenient. The area was once a sage's land and is now becoming a scenic line.

### Baoshan

Threatening the Chamber of Commerce with Explosives

The Chamber of Commerce of Luodian Town in the Fourth District of the county received threatening letters and a package of explosives on the 17th. It is said that the reason is roughly due to the increase in business tax, blaming the Chamber of Commerce for failing to strive for reduction or exemption. Regarding the tax increase issue, it is said that Chairman Xu Shenjian is seeking a solution.

The County Government Strictly Pursues Overdue Taxes

The county government has always been strict in pursuing the collection of old and new overdue taxes. As the spring harvest is approaching, an order was issued on the 18th to collect all overdue taxes from the first and second periods of the 25th year, as well as long-term arrears, and all must be cleared by the end of this month. Those who deliberately delay will be severely detained to emphasize taxation.

### Taicang

The Price of Mint Soars

In recent years, the rice harvest in this county has been poor, and farmers have mostly switched to planting mint. Therefore, the output has increased year by year. The county now has more than 4,000 acres, producing more than 20,000 catties of oil. As the first harvesting period is approaching, the factories have set the oil price at seven yuan and five jiao per market catty. This year, due to oversupply, the price has risen by three yuan compared to last year. Leaflets have also been distributed explaining the second harvesting method in detail to help farmers increase their income.

Appeal in Public Funds Embezzlement Case

Jin Mingshu, the director of the Tooth Tax Collection Office in this county, was accused by Wu Xiangfeng, a staff member of the office, of embezzling surtaxes for education and construction. After a happy trial, the county sentenced Jin Mingshu to six months of imprisonment for the crime of embezzlement and fined him 300 yuan. Jin refused to accept the sentence and applied to the High Court for appeal, which has been approved. He was summoned on the 19th.

### Wuxi

Strictly Prohibit Students from Perming Hair

The County Education Bureau believes that many female teachers and students in elementary and middle schools in the county are perming their hair and wearing revealing clothing, which is contrary to the true meaning of the New Life Movement. In order to rectify this, it has been decided to strictly prohibit it. Starting from the next academic year, teachers who still engage in the above-mentioned behavior will be suspended, and students will be ordered to withdraw from school.

Labor Riot Criminals Escorted to the Special Commissioner's Office

On the 6th of this month, a work stoppage occurred at the Lixin Textile Dyeing Company in this county. He Yuliang, the head of the police, was drowned on the spot, and many officers and police were beaten and injured. After suppression by the military and police and mediation by the party and government, work was resumed. More than 30 people who committed the crime and caused trouble, including Wang Tongkun and Ge Boquan, were arrested by the police station. Among them, 11 people, including Wang Tongkun, were considered important criminals and were transferred to the county government for interrogation. County Chief Long believed that the case was related to disturbing local public security, so on the 19th, he transferred them to the First District Security Command for review. In order to prevent labor unrest, the Special Commissioner's Office specially convened a meeting of representatives from the county government, the Party Department, the 88th Division of the garrison, the Chamber of Commerce, the Police Bureau, the Construction Bureau, and various yarn factories and silk factories. It was decided that the county government would gather representatives from relevant factories to form a committee to properly discuss methods to eliminate labor unrest.

Levying Business Tax on Wheat

The case of the temporary business tax on wheat was resolutely opposed by various grain merchants and remained unresolved for two years. In the spring of this year, the Finance Department specially sent a commissioner to Shanghai to repeatedly negotiate with representatives of various flour mills in Shanghai and Gu Xin, chairman of the Grain Association. Finally, an agreement was reached: 1. Each package of wheat, measured at 100 catties, will be subject to a temporary business tax of one fen and two kuai, plus an inspection fee of eight wen, totaling one fen per package. 2. The local business tax bureau will check the mills' wheat purchase books on a monthly basis, calculate the number of packages, and collect taxes based on the actual amount. The above methods will be implemented on July 1. However, the flour mills believe that the mills in the interior are different from those in Shanghai. The raw wheat purchased is all procured from various grain shops and not directly from grain merchants, so it is impossible to collect the tax on their behalf. The grain shops also face many difficulties. Therefore, after receiving the notice, they have asked the Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the practice of levying unified taxes without re-levying other surtaxes be followed, to help alleviate the merchants' difficulties.

### Suzhou

Transfer of Judge from Shanghai Court

The Jiangsu Higher Court, upon the order of the Judicial Administration Department, has reassigned Shao Qinzhi, a judge of the Shanghai District Court. Weng Zhenshu has been appointed to fill the vacancy, and Qiu Hongzao has been appointed as the chief clerk of the Shanghai District Court. President Zhu immediately issued an order to inform the Shanghai District Court.

### Changzhou

Strict Pursuit of Owed Silver

In the case of the Wu County Government organizing a review committee to investigate the early tickets over the years and discovering a shortage of more than 395,000 yuan, County Chief Hou has placed the two treasury officials in custody and required them to provide security for repayment. However, the individual amounts owed by each person have not yet been clearly verified by the persons in charge of the two treasuries. Therefore, an order has been issued to Wei Guojun and Mao Feiran, the director and deputy director of land tax, to clear the owed funds by the 18th of this month. Those who delay further will be dismissed from their posts. After receiving the order, the two directors checked overnight and verified the individual amounts owed by each person on the evening of the 18th. In addition to the more than 60,000 yuan previously paid, another 45,000 yuan was raised on the 19th. They also detailed the situation of the arrears over the years and requested that the remaining funds be paid in installments. The county government will submit this to the authorities for approval.

### Nantong

Over One Million in Land Tax Collected

The county government has collected over 700,000 yuan in overdue taxes from Nantong, and over 450,000 yuan in new taxes, totaling over 1.16 million yuan. This is an unprecedented amount. The arrears of various county and national agencies have been cleared.

### Mingguang

Reorganization and Expansion of the Electric Light Factory

The Daguangming Electric Light Factory in this port was originally sponsored by the Yarn and Cloth Industry Association. Due to the small size of the machinery, business could not develop. It is now being taken over by the Bengbu Yaohuai Power Plant. It is said that the plant has a large machine that can supply 5,000 lamp heads. The plant site has been determined and it is expected to start supplying electricity in October.

Resumption of Mingxu Road Bus Service

The Mingxu Road long-distance bus service was temporarily suspended due to the roadbed near Qingshui Dam being washed away by mountain floods. Construction is currently underway and should be completed in a few days. In order to prevent traffic interruption, the bus service will resume as usual, but passengers will have to change vehicles where passage is impossible.

### Gaoyou

Deadline for Eliminating Opium

Chairman's Speech

After the meeting began, following proper etiquette, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered an opening speech, stating that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has a long history. Today marks the fourth membership meeting since the unification. The work handled by the Chamber this year should be individually described and reviewed by the member representatives. However, since there is a separate report, he will not repeat it here. He would like to briefly discuss the general commercial situation of the past year and how to strive for progress in the future, to encourage all merchants. In the past year, due to the abundant harvests of agricultural products in the Yangtze River provinces, the stability of the legal tender, and the sufficient supply of chips, consumers' purchasing power increased, and prices gradually rose, resulting in a revival in some commercial sectors. This is something to be celebrated. However, the aftereffects of the commercial decline in some sectors, which showed signs of prosperity last year, have not easily changed the overall situation. This can be seen from the frequent cleaning advertisements in newspapers and the increasing number of bankruptcy cases announced by the courts. Moreover, the prosperity of domestic commerce in our country depends on the countryside. Last year, we were fortunate to have a good harvest, but this year, the drought has spread to a vast area of provinces, so whether consumers' purchasing power can maintain the same level as last year is questionable. Furthermore, the smuggling trend is spreading, and foreign merchants in the textile industry in North China already have a dominant position, and the light industry there is also gradually being monopolized through large-scale operations. In all these situations, the domestic market is shrinking day by day. Our country's tariffs were not even comparable to the so-called protection level of other countries, but recently even this foundation is being shaken. Starting with large-scale smuggling, and then openly demanding tax cuts, it is feared that the rough-scale national goods factories will be forced to the point of being unable to survive. Furthermore, countries are competing to implement quasi-wartime economies and controls, either restricting and managing the export of the raw materials they need, or bidding for them at high prices. The paper and pig iron industries alone have had a profound impact on both industry and commerce in our country. Our country has always relied on foreign merchants for trade. Foreign countries often want to directly purchase large quantities of our country's goods, or are willing to trade goods with our country, but our country does not have agencies that can supply large quantities, so it cannot meet their needs. For example, in the case of raw silk, because our country has no direct export agencies, this year's silk harvest in Japan is abundant, and the European and American markets can meet supply and demand. However, foreign merchants operating silk in China are still hesitating and watching, unwilling to take action. This year, the silk market will once again fall into who knows what state. Furthermore, the construction industry is on the verge of stagnation due to soaring raw material prices. Considering the above situations, we should know that the commercial competition at home and abroad has already entered the final five minutes of close combat. Without thorough awareness and a strong determination, we will inevitably face total defeat. We should not be complacent about the temporary prosperity of last year. However, from the perspective of our country's progress, there are several things that we can take pride in: 1. The financial sector can cooperate with the production sector. For example, the Tianjin textile factories were able to survive and the Hunan Second Textile Factory was able to finalize its plans, all thanks to the support of the banking syndicate. 2. The financial sector can penetrate into the countryside, provide loans, guide cooperation, and cultivate the purchasing power of the masses. 3. Industrialists can cooperate with specialized technicians, so in recent years, there have been several chemical industries in our country that can rival foreign products and stand on a firm and unshakable position. Tianyuan, Yongli, and Wuzhou are all well-known and need not be mentioned. 4. Officials and merchants can gradually cooperate with sincerity, eliminating the previous psychology of suspicion and discrimination. Therefore, there are often several industries and businesses that are supplemented by public administrative resources and the technical experts they attract, which makes operation easier and reduces many difficulties in the future. For example, vegetable oil factories, tea companies, the Shanghai Fish Market, and Wenxi Paper Mill are all the most obvious examples. Merchants in this city are on the front line of commercial warfare. At this time of increasing world changes, the progress that has already been made should be diligently maintained and developed, and the shortcomings should also be reflected upon and gradually eliminated. The Chamber of Commerce, as a group of merchants with shared interests, is willing to offer its experience gained over the years in the form of advice. It also hopes that all merchants in the city, as well as member representatives, will provide deep guidance on the future direction of the Chamber of Commerce.

Speeches from the Party and Government

1.  Wang Manyun, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, gave a brief speech: Since last year, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has made great achievements in various aspects, such as conducting research on income tax issues and assisting the government in cracking down on smuggling. We express our sincere admiration. The chairman just mentioned the social decline and rural bankruptcy in recent years, and the various situations do merit our attention. At present, the trend of smuggling continues unabated, and our country's industry and commerce are at risk of being hit by it anytime, anywhere. This makes us believe that it is a hidden worry. Therefore, at this eighth membership meeting, we should find ways to maintain social prosperity and break the bankruptcy of the countryside. This city, as the chairman just mentioned, is located on the front line and is extremely important. All of you are warriors on the front line. At this time of serious national crisis, we should prepare to consolidate this first line of defense, how to concentrate our strength, unite, and defend against foreign attacks, and how to promote the development of past construction and determine the direction of future progress. It is hoped that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will use the efforts of the representatives of various industries present today. 2. Wu Huanru, representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, said briefly that in the past year, officials and civilians in our country have been able to thoroughly realize and cooperate fully. This is what the ancients called "great difficulties revive the nation." The depth of the stimulation has been enough to produce the current phenomenon. We have seen the achievements of various construction projects, the awakening and progress of the industrial sector, and these are all gratifying phenomena. The issue of national goods, which has been advocated every year for more than 20 years, has now been resolved to a considerable extent. Consumers know how to buy national goods, and producers also know how to strive to improve and satisfy customers. Therefore, the national goods movement no longer needs to be promoted in the future. In recent years, the industrial and commercial sectors have indeed been completely renewed. Even in the heavy industry sector, such as nitric acid, acetic acid, and hydrochloric acid in the chemical sector, we can create our own without relying on foreigners. Other industries such as textiles, printing machinery, etc., have countless factories built by the Chinese themselves. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. The brothers were ordered to prepare an industrial exhibition. Judging from the many industrial products that have been solicited, there are certainly many that are not as good as foreign goods, but there are also many that can surpass foreign goods. From this, we can observe that producers have indeed cooperated with consumers and are advancing on the same front line. In the past year, more than half of the industrial and commercial sectors in this city have been able to obtain considerable profits. There are many reasons, such as the increase in rural purchasing power and the effectiveness of the legal tender policy. However, this year, the disasters in various provinces are severe, and everyone is certainly concerned that the gains in industry and commerce may not be as satisfactory as last year. However, the brothers believe that under a unified will, with our hard work and cooperation, we will do our best to overcome our environment and create our environment. The brothers believe that at the annual meeting held here on this day next year, the industrial and commercial sectors will certainly have better results. What cannot be done this year can certainly be done next year. I wish you all progress and health.

Discussion of Various Cases

After the speeches, Chairman Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiyin reported on the handling of Chamber of Commerce affairs over the past year, and Pei Yunxiang, director of the Finance Department, and Xu Xinliu, director of the San Cheng Public Debt Fund Management Committee, reported on finances. Then, the various cases were discussed and decided as follows: 1. The Chamber of Commerce's proposal to issue a declaration on safeguarding national industries (the declaration is below) was passed and issued. 2. Urge the government to promptly promulgate the new Chamber of Commerce Law and the new Industrial and Commercial Association Law. It was decided that the Executive Committee will select representatives to go to Beijing with the representatives selected by various industry associations to petition. 3. The Chamber of Commerce's final accounts for the 25th year and the budget for the 26th year were passed. 4. The lawsuit against Yongxing Qianzhuang for overdue deposits in the Chamber of Commerce's fund was decided to be withdrawn. 5. It was decided to pass Article 13 of the Executive Committee's charter, which stipulates that those who do not pay their annual membership fee will be suspended from attending the current meeting. 6. It was decided to pass a request to the government to maintain the original import tariffs and intensify the crackdown on smuggling. 7. Article 681 of the Civil Code stipulates that partnerships should bear joint and several liability, which is inconsistent with the inherent commercial practice of sharing burdens according to shares. It is proposed to appeal to the Legislative Yuan again to amend the article. It was decided to leave it to the Executive Committee to handle at its discretion. 8. It was decided to pass a request to the government to issue a clear order prohibiting the export of wheat to protect the people's food supply. 9. The new transit tax on cattle and sheep in the French Concession of this city's Public Concession Bureau is harmful to merchants and the people and damages national sovereignty. It has been repeatedly requested that the municipal government negotiate to no avail. The congress should request the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French ambassador to order a prompt cancellation, and to order the abolition of the compulsory pre-purchase of inspection tickets to maintain national sovereignty and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It was decided to pass. 10. It was decided to strictly enforce the central Party Department's regulations on sanctions for not joining industry associations as stipulated by the Civil Training Department. 11. It is proposed to instruct all industries with industry associations that if disputes arise between members in business, they should not immediately resort to litigation, but should first apply to the industry association for mediation.

Full Text of the Declaration

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration on safeguarding national industries, stating that since the completion of unification and the stability of the political situation, the central government has carefully considered the national situation and looked at neighboring countries, taking economic construction as the most important plan to support and stabilize the country. At the Third Plenary Session, it issued a declaration announcing to the people that "the reason why our country is poor is due to the enemy's bullying from the outside and the backwardness of production from the inside. If we incite class struggle within the nation, it will be enough to offset the strength of the entire nation and plunge the country into destruction. Internally, it will be enough to cause infighting among the various production elements and prevent the progress of production and construction." It hoped that labor and management would work together to engage in the road of production and construction and share the heavy responsibility of national rejuvenation. The words were sincere and earnest, and every member of the Republic of China, upon reading them, was not excited and eager to find ways to serve the country. The industrial and commercial sectors bear this mission, so even though they have been suffering from years of market decline, foreign goods dumping, and rampant smuggling, they have always maintained the spirit of fighting alone and have repeatedly pressed on. They are not seeking personal gain, but want to prevent the industrial ship from drifting and disappearing with the raging tide of world economic competition.

### Liu Ruiheng Returned to Shanghai to Discuss Eradicating Plague

Training Personnel to Go to Various Counties – Working Hard to Kill Rats and Prevent Plague – Medicine for Kala-Azar Can Be Made

The plague in Fujian this year has caused over a thousand deaths, a rare occurrence in the past thirty years. All parties are paying close attention to this. Liu Ruiheng, the head of the hygiene delegation, recently returned from an inspection in Fujian and has formulated a nine-year plan to eradicate the plague. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency interviewed him and learned the following details:

Meeting with Fellow Fujianese Today

After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Liu met with Xiao Bichuan, Huang Jianzhong, Wang Pingnan, and others, representatives of the Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Committee, at his residence at noon to discuss the eradication methods in detail. It was decided that at 2:00 PM today, at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge, a meeting will be convened with Fujianese residing in Shanghai and relevant parties. Liu will report on his proposed five-year plague eradication plan, and the Plague Prevention and Relief Committee will also submit a report, discussing the methods of implementation.

Liu Discusses Plague Eradication Plan

Liu told reporters yesterday that the plague in Fujian is indeed rampant. The eradication of plague is very difficult. For example, India has been preventing and controlling the plague for decades, but has not been able to completely eradicate it. Currently, this agency is paying close attention to this and has dispatched doctors, hygiene inspectors, and engineers to Fujian to carry out relief work, such as vaccinations. However, this is a passive measure. The active measure is to seek eradication. Because the plague is caused by rats, there is no way to eliminate the plague without reducing the number of rats. Therefore, to eradicate the plague, rats must first be exterminated. A plan has been formulated to train 160 staff members in the first phase, paying special attention to training rat extermination work. This will be completed by the end of the month and they will be sent to various counties as basic team members, provided with rat extermination equipment and medicines. After these hundred-odd basic personnel are sent to various counties, it is hoped that the county governments and local Baojia (community security system) will work together, and the basic personnel will teach them extermination methods to expand the work of killing, preventing, and catching rats. If this continues, it may be possible to eliminate the plague after five years.

Prevention and Control of Kala-Azar is Now Assured

Liu continued to talk about the prevention and control of Kala-Azar, saying that the treatment of this disease is more assured than the plague. This agency has sent staff in teams to work in the Qingjiangpu area. The treatment of Kala-Azar is absolutely assured. However, medicines are very expensive. Because Kala-Azar currently affects a wide area and there are hundreds of thousands of patients, the agency is organizing treatment teams and is researching and manufacturing its own medicines. It is still in the testing stage and will soon be successful. After the medicine is successful, because the price is low and it is domestically produced, the vast number of Kala-Azar patients will have no economic problems, and then the disease will not be difficult to eradicate. Liu concluded by saying that the current hygiene work is to select the most urgent and those that are related to the overall national health and implement them first.

### Long-Distance Telephone Call-Back Service

Effective July 1st

When placing a long-distance telephone call, the caller may request, "If the specified called party is not available and cannot be reached, the telephone company should notify the called party's subscriber to inform the called party that the caller wishes them to call back at a certain time within a certain time frame." After the originating exchange accepts this request, it should notify the terminating exchange to follow through. If the specified called party is not available when the terminating exchange attempts to connect the call, it should immediately inform the called party's subscriber of the caller's location and their name and address, or telephone number, and request that they notify the called party to follow the caller's instructions and call back at the specified time. At the same time, the originating exchange should be notified so that the caller can pay the fees and cancel the call. The method is currently only available on the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hankou, and Shanghai-Guangdong direct circuits. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate the public and promote business, has stipulated that this method will be implemented on all long-distance telephones nationwide starting on July 1st of this year and has ordered all bureaus to comply.

### Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to Hold a Gala Today

The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, because its 800-plus employees rarely have the opportunity to gather and greet each other due to their daily duties, holds a gala once a year, bringing employees and their families together. The gala, organized by the Telegraph Bureau Employees' Association, features Peking opera and various recreational activities to add to the festivities. This year's gala is scheduled to be held today (the 20th) starting at 1:00 PM at the Xu Garden on Connaught Road. The program includes martial arts, drama, magic, music, Peking opera, etc. In order to increase the interest of the guests, in addition to giving each person a ticket and a box of refreshments, prizes will be drawn by ticket.

The names of all companies, factories, and donated items will be announced separately by the Broadcasting Station to express gratitude, it is said.

### Land Administration Bureau's Request to Shorten Public Notice Period Approved

Land Registration Procedures are Complex – Shortened to Three Months to Facilitate Turnover

The Municipal Land Administration Bureau believes that Article 100 of the Land Law stipulates that the public notice period for land registration is six months. According to the actual situation in the city, this is too long. Because land prices in this city are relatively high, financial circulation often relies on real estate for turnover. Land ownership certificates are often used as collateral for mortgages by the public and are equivalent to securities in nature. If the public notice period is extended, it will affect the use of ownership certificates. For the convenience of citizens, the bureau has requested the municipal government to forward a request to the central government to shorten the public notice period to three months. It is reported that the case has been resolved by the Central Political Committee and is temporarily approved for filing before the amendment of the Land Law is promulgated. The National Government has approved it for implementation and ordered the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Interior to inform the Municipal Government for its information. The Municipal Government has ordered the Land Administration Bureau to comply, it is said.

### Land Properties with Certificates in South Shanghai Ordered to Complete Supplementary Registration

Six-Month Period for Supplementary Registration Starting in October

Land registration in the South Shanghai District of this city began on April 1st of this year. All land for which land certificates have not been exchanged must be registered within six months of the start of registration. Land for which certificates have been issued for more than one year and no disputes have arisen should be deemed to have been registered in accordance with Article 5 of the Land Registration Implementation Rules of this city. The Land Administration Bureau should exchange land title deeds within a certain period. It is learned that the land title deeds issued by the bureau previously only contained information on the land registration account name and area, but did not record the type of land to be registered, usage status, declared land price, existence of other rights, the existence and value of fixtures, and the age, origin, occupation, and address of the owner. If it is to be deemed as legally recorded in the register and land title deeds are exchanged in accordance with Article 26, Paragraph 2 of the Land Law Implementation Law, the various labeling sections in the register and deeds will not be fully prepared in accordance with the law. Therefore, land for which certificates have been issued for more than one year and no disputes have arisen can legally be deemed to have been registered, but in fact, owners should still be required to declare registration and complete supplementary procedures. It has been stipulated that a six-month period from October 1st of this year to March 31st, 1938, will be the period for completing supplementary registration procedures. The case has been submitted to the Municipal Government and forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for approval for filing. All landowners in the South Shanghai District who have been issued certificates for more than one year and no disputes have arisen should complete supplementary registration procedures with the bureau within the deadline in order to register in accordance with the law and exchange land title deeds, it is said.

According to a reliable source from the New News Agency, the Cotton Control Committee and the Silk Improvement Association have begun to prepare for closing and handover. In the future, after the Ministry of Industry takes over, it does not intend to make any changes to the organization and business of the two associations. Since the establishment of the Cotton Control Committee three years ago, Chairman Chen Guangfu, Standing Committee members Zou Bingwen, Li Shengbo, Ye Zhuotang, Tang Xinghai, and others have been leading figures in the cotton and financial circles. Therefore, over the years, it has successively established the Central Cotton Improvement Institute, branch institutes in the provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Hubei, Shanxi, and various cotton industry guidance centers, the Gansu Provincial Guidance Office, the Central and Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, Hunan, Shanxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces to prohibit cotton adulteration and mixing and cotton production and marketing offices, and jointly run the Cotton Textile Dyeing Laboratory with the Academia Sinica in Shanghai.

### Customs Inspection Office to Build Public Housing North of Site

Convenience for Travelers and Relatives Expected Completion Next Year

The Zi Lin Bao reports: It is understood that north of the Customs Inspection Office in the Bund area, a two-story public housing building will be constructed for the use of incoming and outgoing travelers and their welcoming relatives and friends. A preliminary plan has been drafted. If approved by the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council and the Municipal Council itself, construction will commence on the existing underwater foundation by the Public Works Department. The estimated cost is 200,000 yuan. The building will face Piers 9, 10, and 11, connecting to the Customs baggage inspection area. In addition to waiting rooms, it will feature an information desk and a tea room. The tea room will sell tea, refreshments, and other items, ensuring that those waiting for their new friends will not suffer from hunger or thirst. Furthermore, newly arrived travelers in Shanghai will not have to inquire about accommodation and other matters in a confused state, as before. Experienced clerks will provide information on things to know when traveling in Shanghai, offering a "feel at home" experience.

### Atlantic Shipping Industry to Increase Freight Rates on a Scheduled Basis

Increase of Ten Percent Starting July 1st, Due to Increased Expenses and Rising Prices

Shipping industry news: American companies, including Anchor, Baltimore Mail Line, Bristol City Line, White Star Line, Wilson Line, Furness Withy, Manchester Liners, United States Lines, and other British and American shipping companies operating between the United Kingdom and ports along the eastern coast of the United States and Canada, have announced a 10% increase in freight rates on the aforementioned routes, effective July 1st, due to rising labor costs and expenses. This increase in freight rates has long been anticipated by the New York shipping industry, as increased operating expenses, rising prices, and higher wages are the main reasons for the increase in freight rates. The recent maritime strikes in the United States are also significantly related to the increase in coastal freight rates in that country. Three shipping companies operating between the Atlantic and ports on the west coast of the United States are also expected to increase freight rates for lumber and general cargo between New York and California.

### Furnace Explosion on Fuyang Steamer Running Aground in Taiping Creek, Fuyang

Three Firemen Injured, Some Seriously; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ship Went to Rescue and Collided

The Fuyang, belonging to the Sanbei Steamship Company of this port, has a tonnage of 897 tons, a horsepower of 2,500, and a speed of 15 knots per hour. It is an excellent river vessel. On September 2nd of last year, the ship ran aground on a reef in the Taiping Creek area, 180 li upstream of Yichang, causing a hole in the bottom and damage to the keel. The company dispatched personnel to provide assistance, and the ship was salvaged by taking advantage of the low tide to beach it ashore. Cargo was transferred to Chongqing, and repairs were made to the hole. It was originally planned to tow it back to Shanghai immediately, but the river's water level was too low to allow passage downstream. After nine months, the damage to the bottom of the ship has been repaired, and it is ready to be towed back to Shanghai for repairs once the water level rises. Recently, the river's water level has risen significantly. While being towed out of the Meiren Tuo shoal in Taiping Creek on the 18th, one of the boilers in the engine room suddenly exploded. Two firemen working in the engine room were seriously injured, and one was slightly injured. Fortunately, the company's Fuhua steamer passed by and responded to the alarm, but during the rescue attempt, the Fuhua collided with the Fuyang, causing minor damage to the Fuhua's barge door. The Fuyang was barely towed to Yichang, but it was discovered that the stern and steering gear of the Fuyang were also damaged. The three injured firemen were sent to the hospital for treatment, and Shanghai was notified by telegram requesting another tug to tow the Fuyang to Shanghai for extensive repairs.

### Wu Yuanlong's Wife Commits Suicide by Poisoning; Corpse Still Requires Autopsy

Deceased Said in Letter to Qin That Economic Difficulties and Discord with Husband Led to Suicide

Wu Yuanlong married an English woman (Masy L. Wn) (Mei Xue'ai Yu Wu, age 29) on January 1st of last year. They lived together in Shanghai. Later, Wu Yuanlong's failed attempt to open a new dance hall resulted in numerous debts and lawsuits. Wu went to Sichuan to work, and Mei Xue subsequently resided at the home of Qin Defang, manager of the Yiyuan Road No. 860 Gongyi Yarn Factory, because Qin's wife is also an English woman. On the 17th of this month, at 11:30 PM, Mei Yun suddenly went alone to Room 111 of the New Asia Restaurant at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Tiantong Road. She did not pay the room fee at the time and immediately went to sleep. On the 18th, at 12:30 PM, the waiter Zhang Chunlin went to knock on the door to inquire whether the room was to be extended and to collect the room fee, but there was no response. He called the room by telephone, but there was still no answer. Realizing something was wrong, he forced the door open and found Mei lying in the bathtub, which was three-quarters full of water. She was already unconscious. He urgently reported to the Hongkou police station, who dispatched officers. Mei was transported to the Country Hospital for treatment, but she died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Police officers found a bottle of sleeping pills in Mei's suitcase in the room. The bottle should have contained 100 pills, but four were missing. It was also discovered that Mei's original name was (Nee Kathleen Neary), but the British Consulate was contacted, and it was found that she was not registered there, so they did not accept the case. The police then transported the body to the coroner's office on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, the Special First Court Prosecutor's Office was notified, and Prosecutor Song Genshan, along with forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, went to the office to examine the body. According to Qin Defang, he received a letter from the deceased at 3:00 PM yesterday, stating that she committed suicide because of economic difficulties and discord with Wu Yuanlong. However, he did not know that she intended to commit suicide. Wu Yuanlong's cousin, Xu Runjie, stated that Wu Yuanlong is currently in Sichuan, and his parents are all in Nanjing. He had previously asked the deceased to live with them in Nanjing, but she refused. Therefore, the Wu family provided her with a monthly living allowance of 200 yuan. The police believed that it was necessary to autopsy Mei Xue to determine whether she had definitely committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. Prosecutor Song ordered that the cause of death was unclear and should be determined after an autopsy by the court's forensic doctor. The body was released to Xu Runjie for burial.

### Shanghai's "March of Time" Has Been Approved

Inspectors Had Disagreements, Resulting in No Further Cuts

Regarding the report in yesterday's newspaper about the Public Concession's ban on the screening of the new "Shanghai March of Time" film, the film was shown twice on Friday morning and afternoon to film inspectors from the Public Concession and the French Concession police stations. At 3:15 PM, the inspectors finally decided to allow the film to be screened. Therefore, it will be presented to the audience at the Nanjing Grand Theater today. Only Deputy Superintendent Logan of the Public Concession and Deputy Superintendent Li Xie of the French Concession were present at the morning screening. The other two inspectors, Major Bourne, Deputy Superintendent of the Public Concession, and Lieutenant Blanc, Assistant Superintendent of the French Concession, did not attend. Logan and Li Xie still insisted that the scene of a Japanese warship anchored in the Huangpu River should be cut, but they had no objection to the scene of warships from other countries anchored in the Huangpu River. The two also said that one or two lines of dialogue contained anti-Japanese propaganda and should be deleted. Mr. Koske, an employee of the Peacock Film Company, which is distributing the film, said that the company had already complied with the two inspectors' requests and made cuts a month ago. If further cuts were made, the film's value would be damaged. The two sides argued fiercely and remained deadlocked at lunchtime, parting on unhappy terms. When the film was shown again in the afternoon, Major Bourne and Lieutenant Blanc were also present. After reviewing the film, the inspectors finally approved it without making any further cuts. It is said that if there had been further difficulties, the Peacock Film Company would have been willing to appeal to the Shanghai Film Inspection Office, because the film had already been approved by the National Government's Inspection Office.

### Masterminds of Bank Robbery at Jiangsu Branch Captured

Two Suspects Firmly Deny Involvement in Robbery; Court Orders Remand for Further Argument

The Jiangsu Bank branch at No. 339 Xinwen Road was preparing to load over 7,000 yuan of banknotes into a car to be transported to the head office at 5:00 PM on February 3rd of this year when a group of robbers suddenly appeared. They drew their guns and fired at the bank's guards, Shi Jinzhi (No. 194), Jiang Ziqin, and Gu Wenlin. Shi was killed, and Jiang and Gu, as well as a rickshaw puller named Chen Youru, were wounded. Jiang and others returned fire, wounding Zhang Shaoqing, one of the robbers. As a result, the robbers failed to steal the money and fled in a stolen Yunfei car. Detectives from the Public Concession and the French Concession arrested Chen Changfu, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Youren, Yang Yuchun, and other suspects. Several guns and a large quantity of ammunition were seized. The suspects were handed over to the Special First Court. Zhang Shaoqing and Zhao Jinrong were sentenced to death, Chen was sentenced to 12 years in prison, Zhao Youren was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison, and Yang was sentenced to two years and six months in prison. The masterminds of the case, Ren Shaoye (also known as Ren Wenhai, Zhang Yiqing, Ren Huanzhang, Xiao Ren), and the perpetrator, Wang Abing (also known as Liu Bingkun, Zhang Zhensheng), were still at large. Chief Detective You A'gen and Detective Lu Gengsheng of the police station arrested Ren and Wang in Anhui and other places and handed them over to the Special First Court. They both denied the charges, saying that they were working as drivers for highway bus companies in Anhui and Qingjiang at the time of the Jiangsu case. Therefore, they did not participate in the robbery. The court adjourned the case to investigate in those areas. After Zhang Shaoqing and the other nine appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, Presiding Judge Yu opened a hearing. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, argued that the original sentence was correct and should be upheld. The court appointed lawyer Yu Enliang to defend the defendants and ordered a judgment at a later date. The court's reports on the investigation of Ren and Wang have been returned, so Judge Feng Shide of the Special First Court reopened the hearing yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Ru Bao'yi, presented the case, and Feng read out the investigation report on Wang Abing, stating that the investigation showed that Wang's statements were not true. Ren and Wang continued to deny involvement in the robbery of the Jiangsu Bank and hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to defend them. The court reviewed the evidence and ordered that the defendants be remanded in custody for further argument.

### Mutual Lawsuits for Intimidation Due to Jealousy Among Peers

Court Orders Conclusion of Trial and Sets Date for Sentencing

Ding Quanbo, owner of the Quepai Store at No. 246 Fuyou Road, and Zhang Juchun, Ding Yuebo, Bao Nianfu, Zhao Chunhua, Li Binyao, Yu Xiaogao, and others have filed a public prosecution for intimidation with Prosecutor Li Fen of the Shanghai District Court, alleging that the defendants, knowing that Wang Shirong's Wang Desheng Quepai Store on Fuyou Road had been operating for decades and was successful, conspired to obtain his property through intimidation. At the beginning of last month, they jointly discussed changing the name of the World Quepai Factory, which the defendant Ding Quanbo and his brothers originally planned to open on Fuyou Road, to Wang Desheng Shunji Quepai Store. On the first of last month, Zhang Juchun wrote the name Wang Desheng Shunji Quepai Store on a signboard and posted it at No. 246 Fuyou Road. Meanwhile, the defendants Yu Xiaogao, Zhao Chunhua, Bao Nianfu, and others went to intimidate Wang Shirong's wife, Wang Linshi, saying that Ding Quanbo and others had guns and axes and demanded a large sum of money from Wang Linshi as a condition for canceling Wang Desheng Shunji. They also wrote two anonymous threatening letters urging her to comply. On the 10th of the same month, Bao Nianfu took Wang Linshi to lawyer Zhu Yongkang's office in the Zhonghui Building to negotiate a payment of 2,000 yuan, to be delivered on the 14th. Wang Linshi informed the manager, Gao Facai, who reported the matter, and the detectives made arrests.

Yesterday, Judge Wu presided over the trial. The defendants' defense lawyers, Huang Jiyuan, Fang Junjie, Xu Lin, He Shisu, and Zhang Zhirang, all stated that the case was a frame-up by Gao Facai. They argued that Gao was a member of Xu's gang, a hooligan, and that his appearance already resembled that of a hooligan. They also requested that his household registration be investigated, as he was not the manager of the plaintiff's store but was purely motivated by jealousy to design a frame-up. It was also pointed out that Gao Facai himself had recently committed a crime of writing threatening letters with the intention to defraud and had been arrested by the police. Because he was a fraudster, he should be punished under the regulations for punishing bandits and transferred by the court to the garrison headquarters for punishment. Therefore, the alleged intimidation was entirely fabricated by Gao himself, and they requested that the defendants be acquitted. The court ordered that the trial be concluded and the verdict be announced on the 26th.

### Wang Xinggao to Be Retried by High Court's Third Branch

Wang Xinggao, who was implicated in the murder of Tang Jiapeng by the murderer Zhao Guangfu, was detained by the French police and handed over to the Special Second Court. The initial trial sentenced Wang to life imprisonment. Wang appealed, and the Second Branch of the High Court overturned the original verdict and acquitted Wang. Subsequently, an appeal was filed in the third instance, and the French police submitted grounds for appeal to the Supreme Court for the third instance appeal. At this time, Wang was eager to be released and requested bail. A number of shopkeepers, including Ma, who runs a bathhouse, provided bail, and Wang Xinggao was released. The Supreme Court has now sent the case back for retrial, stating that the original verdict was inappropriate and raising many points of doubt. It is reported that the entire case file has been returned for retrial. The Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court will summon Wang Xinggao and others, who have been released on bail, to reopen the trial within days.

### Bei Xinglou, Bei Yikun, and Others Accused of Inciting Injury

Li Zhangshi Demands Compensation but is Obstructed; Servant Commits Assault; Asks Court to Order Compensation for Losses

Li Jinlong, a Shandong native employed as a bodyguard by the wealthy Suzhou merchant Bei Runsheng, who resides at No. 5, Lane 25, Ba'anfang, Beile Road, French Concession, had been promoted from the position of scribe. He had been loyal and dedicated for ten years and was highly regarded by his employers. However, in the spring of this year, he suddenly became mentally deranged and shot himself in the head with his service pistol in the Bei family garden at 11:00 AM on February 21st. The police station was notified and reported to the court, which sent personnel to investigate. The family collected the body for burial. Afterward, Bei Runsheng, mindful of Li's poverty-stricken family and young children, provided a pension. However, Li's wife, Zhangshi (age 45, from Jinan, resident of No. 38 Daodeli, Beile Road), wanted to demand more compensation from the Bei family. On May 20th, Zhangshi, accompanied by Li Yipeng, who had introduced Li Jinlong to the Bei family, went to the Bei Runsheng residence to speak with one of Bei's two sons, Bei Xinglou and Bei Yikun. The Bei family servant, Wang Shulu (also known as A'liu), obstructed them and refused to let them enter, leading to a conflict. As a result, Li Zhangshi was injured. She filed a petition with the Special Court requesting a medical examination. Subsequently, she hired lawyer Yao Junyu to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court, accusing Bei Xinglou, Bei Yikun, and the servant Wang Shulu of jointly inciting and committing assault, requesting an investigation and also demanding compensation of 1,567 yuan for damages. The court accepted the case, and Judge Zhu Chuzhe opened a hearing yesterday morning. The plaintiff, Li Zhangshi, was represented by her lawyer, who presented the case. The defendants arrived on time to await questioning and hired lawyers Xue Dubi, Cao Shoulun, and Hua Jun to defend them. The court noted that the plaintiff had not arrived and adjourned the hearing for another date.

### Printing Shop Owner with Violent Temper Arrested for Privately Beating Apprentice

Two Brothers Were Bound and Beaten; Police to Investigate Zou for Other Cases

Zou Jiarui, a native of Nanjing, runs the Dawuwei Printing Shop at No. 523 Kangnaot Road. He hired Bao Ziqiang (age 20) and Bao Zi'an (age 16), brothers from Zhenjiang, as apprentices for two years. However, Zou has a violent temper and often mistreated the Baos. He would resort to beatings at the slightest dissatisfaction. On the 14th of this month, Zou accused the Bao brothers of stealing his leather shoes and beat them severely. Bao's aunt learned of this and reported it to the police, only requesting that the police issue a warning and not wanting to investigate further. The police dispatched detectives to the Dawuwei Printing Shop on the afternoon of the 16th to warn Zou and order him not to abuse the apprentices again in the future. Although Zou agreed, he became angry with the Bao brothers after the detectives left, blaming them for reporting him to the police. That night, at 11:30 PM, he tied the Bao brothers' hands behind their backs in the shop and beat them severely with wooden sticks, causing injuries to their heads, shoulders, and legs. After being bound for two hours, they were untied and forced to write a statement declaring that the Baos had been misbehaving and that the shop owner Zou Jiarui had not abused them. Only then were they freed. Afterward, Bao Ziqiang reported the incident to the Gedeng Road police station, which dispatched detective Lu to arrest Zou and detain him. The two Baos were sent to Baolong Hospital for medical examination, which confirmed their injuries. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Division of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution for the crimes of obstruction of justice under Articles 302 and 304 of the Criminal Code and presented the case, stating that the police investigation had revealed that the defendant Zou Jiarui was a hooligan with considerable influence in the western part of Shanghai. He had been punished twice before for theft and gambling. Therefore, he requested an adjournment to investigate whether Zou was involved in extortion cases. Bao Ziqiang and Bao Zi'an testified that Zou had repeatedly abused them and that they had been bound, beaten, injured, and forced to write a statement, requesting punishment. The defendant only admitted to beating but did not admit to binding. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the evidence and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for a further hearing on the morning of the 24th of this month.

### Rejection of Marriage Proposal to Female Factory Worker Leads to Panic over Emotional Intimidation

Court Orders Closure of Trial; Judgment to Be Pronounced on the 21st

Wang Wumei, a 24-year-old local female worker at the Shenxin Yarn Factory, resides at No. 1760 Bailinan Road, West Shanghai. Although a worker, she possesses a beautiful appearance and dresses in a fashionable manner. Strolling through the foreign concessions, one would mistake her for a daughter of a wealthy family. A male worker, Lu Qingda, also 24 years old and from Changzhou, is a self-professed romantic. The two became romantically entangled and had an affair. As Lu Qingda's emotional and financial dependence on Wang Wumei deepened, he insisted on marrying her. Believing that their relationship was firmly established, he asked his elder sister, Wu Lushi (age 28, also a factory worker), to propose marriage to Wang Wumei on the 30th of last month. Unexpectedly, Wang Wumei believed that Lu Qingda was not qualified to be a lifelong partner and resolutely rejected the proposal, bringing their affair to an end. Lu, feeling resentful at being rejected, threatened to disfigure her face with acid in order to intimidate her into submission. Hearing this news, Wang Wumei, fearing harm and angered by his fickle nature, reported the incident to the authorities on the 6th of this month. The police detained Lu Qingda and his sister, Wu Lushi, and handed them over to the District Court, where they were investigated by Prosecutor Kong Xianglin. Lu Qingda and Wu Lushi admitted to proposing marriage to Wang Wumei but denied any intimidation. However, Wang Wumei insisted that intimidation had occurred. Therefore, a public prosecution was initiated based on the crime of intimidation under Article 305 of the Criminal Code. Judge Bai Dongling presided over the trial yesterday. The defendants hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to defend them, arguing that it was absurd to think that those in love would resort to intimidation, and that there were no witnesses. When Judge Bai questioned Lu Qingda, he admitted to having shared a room with Wang Wumei once but denied any intimidation. He said that Wang Wumei did not love him and was biting him out of spite and unkindness. Wu Lushi testified that she was Lu Qingda's sister and that because her brother was in love with Wang Wumei, she had been asked to act as a matchmaker. She had only gone to Wang's house once to arrange the marriage and had never intimidated her. The court asked Wang Wumei. Wang Wumei testified that she had shared a room with Lu Qingda once, but it was just a joke, saying she would marry him. He took it seriously and asked his sister, Wu Lushi, to come to her house often and insist that she marry Lu Qingda. When she refused, Lu threatened her with acid. She heard from others that he said that if she did not marry him, he would harm her with acid. Because she was a young woman, she was afraid and reported the incident to the police. She spoke frankly, showing no sign of shame. Lu seemed to regret his misdeeds and the humiliation of being rejected. The court ordered the trial to be closed and the verdict to be announced on the 21st.

### Covenant to Break Off, Seeking Again, Chongqing Girl Intends to Defraud - Once Feared Man Takes Xu as Concubine Due to Wife's Infertility - No Sign of Pregnancy at Time of Separation - Xu Xueqing Denies Being a Concubine, Demands Support

Zeng Weiren (also named Guangcai, 36 years old), a native of Xinghua, Hunan, residing at No. 70 Siming Lane, Xiafei Road, currently working at the Jianghai Customs, previously worked at the Chongqing Customs for over ten years. In the eleventh month of the twenty-third year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], while in Chongqing, he married Xu Xueqing (17 years old this year), a woman from Chongqing, with Chongqing Customs officer Tong Zhongxin and Chongqing China Bank employee Chen Yiliang acting as matchmakers. When Zeng was transferred to Shanghai, he left the woman in Chongqing, giving her 700 yuan for expenses. Later, Xu Xueqing, saying that after Zeng was transferred to Shanghai, there was no news of him, came to Shanghai in the eighth month of the previous year [i.e., 1935] to look for him, at which time she was already several months pregnant. As the due date approached, Zeng sent the woman to the Cihui Hospital at the intersection of Kaizi'ern Road and Pushi Road to await childbirth. After the birth, Xu Xueqing, feeling neglected by Zeng, and after unsuccessful negotiations, filed a lawsuit with the Special No. 2 Court a month ago, accusing Zeng of abandonment. Because the lawsuit stated that Xu Xueqing had married Zeng as a concubine, the court, after summoning and questioning, found it did not comply with the procedure and rejected the lawsuit. Now, Zeng Weiren, through his lawyer, has filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Xu Xueqing and her mother, Xu Wu's, (currently residing at the Datong Apartment on Beile Road) of false accusation and fraud, requesting a legal investigation. The court, based on the complaint, held a hearing yesterday presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian, summoning the plaintiff Zeng Weiren, accompanied by his lawyer, to appear in court. Zeng stated that because his wife was infertile, he took Xu Xueqing as a concubine in Chongqing. Because she was not accustomed to staying at home and often went out, Zeng had a lawyer draw up an agreement for her to abide by the family rules. Later, when he was transferred to Shanghai, she was unwilling to follow, so they separated, giving her 700 yuan. Last year, she suddenly came to Shanghai, saying she was pregnant, but at the time of separation, there was no sign of pregnancy. After arriving in Shanghai, she claimed to be pregnant, but he could not confirm that it was his own blood. Nevertheless, he still sent her to the hospital to give birth. The child died immediately after birth. Later, he bought a boat ticket, gave her expenses, and sent her back to Sichuan. Previously, a contract was drawn up at the lawyer's office, but she came to Shanghai again to make a scene, demanding that he support her for life. Zeng reported the matter to the police station. Later, they sued him, intending to defraud and falsely accuse him. He requested an investigation and submitted two copies of the contract as evidence. When questioned, Xu Xueqing denied marrying Zeng as a concubine, saying that it was initially said to be a deposit for a house. The court also questioned the woman's mother, Xu Wu's. Because the witnesses were not complete and the facts of the case needed to be investigated, the case was adjourned for further questioning.

### Wang Heying Accuses Zou Zhihao of Hope for Reconciliation

Wang accuses Zou of abandonment and includes civil suit - Wu countersues Wang for false accusation and defamation

Wu Zhihao, a native of Fenghua and former manager of the Ningbo Industrial Bank Shanghai National Goods Company, was previously sued by Wang Heying, a woman from the same town, along with Shi Yuanxin, in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 3 Court for abandonment, with an attached civil suit. After one court hearing, the case was adjourned. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Chief Judge Jian Jian continued the hearing. The defendant, Zou Zhihao, was ill in his hometown and appointed lawyer Wang Zuxun to appear on his behalf, presenting a defense and filing a countersuit accusing the plaintiff of false accusation and defamation. He also stated that the plaintiff was willing to go to Ningbo for reconciliation. When questioned, the plaintiff said that someone had contacted her and there was hope for reconciliation. The judge then told the defendant's lawyer that lawsuits ultimately lead to harm, and he hoped for reconciliation, preferably an early resolution. The defendant's lawyer also stated that the two had only lived together for one year and had separated with a written agreement signed by the plaintiff and published in Shanghai newspapers. However, according to the defendant, the child was not fathered by Zou, so the separation agreement did not mention the child. Last year, the plaintiff came to this lawyer's office seeking assistance, and the defendant gave her 300 yuan, etc. The plaintiff also stated that regarding the signing of the separation agreement, Wu Zhihao initially said, "You are very knowledgeable, sign it for me to see," which led to her signing it. She left in the ninth month of the twenty-third year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934]. Last year, Lawyer Wang temporarily provided her with 300 yuan for living expenses, etc. At this point, the court adjourned for three weeks, hoping the parties would reconcile.

### Wang Wenyao Murder Case

Two Fugitives Arrested

On the evening of March 21st of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic [i.e., 1935], Wang Wenyao, an Anhui native who ran a stove shop, was brutally attacked by multiple thugs with axes in front of his residence at No. 208 Longhua Road in South Shanghai due to jealousy from competitors, and died of his injuries on the spot. Later, last year, the police cracked the case and successively arrested the murderers Wang Zuoju, Fei Dekui, Wang Xiaoheshang, etc., and sent them to court for legal proceedings. Now, the deceased's wife, Mrs. Tu Yang, has learned that accomplices Xu Huaide (also known as Xu Dequan) and Wang Zhengiao (i.e., Wang Xiaoguanggun) are hiding at Nos. 4 and 5 Zhoufuli, Kangqu Road in South Shanghai, living freely. She secretly reported this to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Detective Division, which immediately dispatched team leader Liu Guangjun to lead detectives to arrest them all on the morning of the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, they were interrogated by the Third Section of the Bureau and sent to the local court for legal proceedings.

### Special No. 1 Court Accepts Bankruptcy Case of German Resident

Yibin Foreign Firm Requests - Debts Exceed Eighty Thousand Yuan

The Shanghai Special No. 1 District Court, in response to the request of the Yibin Foreign Firm, has specially ruled to declare the bankruptcy of the Maolai Foreign Firm, a German business. It has also set a date for a creditors' meeting. It is rare for Chinese courts to accept bankruptcy cases of foreign residents. The Maolai Foreign Firm is run by L.R. Moelle, a German resident in Shanghai. The accumulated debt amounts to a huge sum of eighty thousand yuan. After the cessation of business, the debt owed to the Yibin Bank is the largest, amounting to more than fifty thousand yuan. The bank immediately applied to the Special No. 1 Court for a declaration of bankruptcy for the German merchant, Maolai Foreign Firm, in accordance with Chinese bankruptcy law procedures. The Special No. 1 Court accepted the case, and yesterday ruled to declare the German resident L.E. Moeller bankrupt, effective from 10:00 AM on the tenth of this month. It also appointed lawyer Liu Shifang as the bankruptcy administrator, starting today to handle debt claims. The creditor's meeting is scheduled for 9:00 AM on July 10th at No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road. However, according to Liu's law firm, the German resident has already left Shanghai and returned to his country. The closed Maolai Foreign Firm also has no assets that can be seized. Therefore, the bankruptcy proceedings are quite difficult.

### Dispute Over Transporting Bricks Leads to Death of Injured Laborer

Near Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, old houses are currently being demolished. On the 17th of this month [June], around 5:00 AM, groups of laborers from Jiangbei and Shaoxing, each numbering seven or eight, started a dispute over transporting bricks, leading to a brawl. Subsequently, Zhu Zhengui (29 years old), a Jiangbei laborer, was injured, suffering a severe head injury. The General Patrol Police Station received a report and dispatched detectives to investigate, arresting three suspects, including Lu Donghai, and detaining them at the police station. They were sent to the Special No. 1 Court for detention. Zhu died at 10:45 AM the day before yesterday due to the severity of his injuries, despite efforts to save him. The body was sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Song Genshan from the First Special Court arrived at the office to examine the body, confirming that the deceased had died from a head injury caused by being beaten while alive. The body was allowed to be claimed by his cousin, Zhang Zhang's, after providing a written guarantee.

### Maid Threatens Employer After Rejection, Sentenced to Eight Months by Wu

Mrs. Zheng Cao, residing at No. 35 Beishanxi Road, hired a maid named Lou Aqiu. In the third month of this year, Aqiu suddenly became acquainted with Wu Deli, a Yangzhou native who worked as a barber at No. 31 Dianji. They frequently met in secret at the Taian Hotel on Beishanxi Road, about four or five times. On the tenth of this month, Wu again asked Lou to go out for a tryst, but Lou refused. Wu learned that Lou had another lover, a tailor, which made Wu resentful. He then had someone writing divination stalls on North Suzhou Road write a letter to Lou's employer, Mrs. Zheng Cao. The letter was unsigned and stated that the writer had a relationship with Lou Aqiu, but now she has transferred her affections to another, so he intends to confront her with a knife. He fears that this may harm both families, so he requests that Aqiu be dismissed, otherwise, her husband may be accidentally injured, etc. After receiving the letter, Mrs. Zheng immediately reported it to the patrol police station. After investigation, it was learned that Wu was responsible, so he was arrested. Yesterday, he was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Court, where police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for violating Article 305 of the Criminal Law, obstructing freedom. When questioned, Wu Deli admitted to having a relationship with Lou Aqiu, but denied writing the threatening letter. After Judge Feng Qizhi questioned him, he declared the verdict in court, sentencing Wu Deli to eight months imprisonment.

### Preparations Underway for North and South Municipal Forensic Examination Offices

Budget Requires Over Ten Thousand Yuan

The establishment of forensic examination offices in the north and south districts of this city, in order to collect and examine bodies at any time, has been under discussion by the Shanghai Local Court and the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Because the fundraising for this matter is not only difficult, but also requires joint implementation with other agencies in administrative procedures, it has been shelved since the spring of last year, lasting more than a year. Now, the court and bureau have again joined the Municipal Health Bureau, Land Bureau, and Zhenru Forensic Examination Office and other agencies to re-engage in preparations. The location of the forensic examination office has been determined, and the Land Bureau will select several acres of land in areas with convenient transportation in the north and south urban areas in the shortest possible time. The internal equipment, etc., will be the responsibility of the Health Bureau. All equipment for examining corpses will be purchased by the Forensic Examination Office. Once the entire budget is ready, it will be submitted to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Justice for review and allocation, and a portion will be raised from charitable organizations. In total, the North and South forensic examination offices will require more than ten thousand yuan.

Defendants numbered over one hundred and twenty - Official orders Zhu Wengong to bear half of the expenses

Xie Qiaosheng, a foreman at the Texaco oil depot dock in Gaoqiao, Pudong, originally led eighty workers. Recently, Zhu Wengong, a foreman from Jiangbei at the Texaco oil depot dock in Puxi, intended to seize control. Around 1:00 PM on May 31st, he led one hundred and eleven workers on a tugboat to the dock to forcibly take over and direct the workers, using tools and weapons to destroy four windows of the Texaco oil depot. They also injured the original workers Chen Shilin, Yang Heshang, Yu Lu, and Yao Genfu. They then attempted to flee by boat, but were pursued by the Gaoqiao branch of the land police and intercepted by the Shanghai Customs water patrol, resulting in the arrest of all of them. Five axes and five iron bars were seized and transferred to the local court. With the exception of the damage portion, Texaco manager Mike Cowley stated that he would not pursue the matter. For the injury portion, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu detained and prosecuted all one hundred and twelve individuals. The defendants included Zhu Wengong, Shan Yazhou, Yang Dechan, Gu Musheng, Dai Dafuzi, Zhou Sentao, Gu Guanzhang, Lin Gongkun, Feng Qijie, Deng Ximing, Qi Si, Xiao Shiying, Pei Erde, Shen Changyi, Zhu San, Xu Ren, Wei Zunbao, Yang Guisheng, Shen Gongxia, Gao Zhengxin, Zhou Asan, Chen Zhongyi, Sun Furui, Chen Asan, Wang Asi, Luo Xiaosi, Zhu Xiaozhu, Geng Fada, Wang Jinzhong, Jiang Dengshan, Li Afu, Yang Mingyi, Zhang Xiaoshan, Hu Aliu, Liu Xiaoerzi, Zhai Bugao, Zhang Afu, Liu Daxiazi, Ma Changgen, Liu Guochang, Chen Shushou, Wang Afu, Mai Baolin, Ding Longbao, Gao Derong, Sun Changgen, Liu Asi, Liu Boxiong, Chen Aer, Zhu Daluo, Shen Axiong, Cai Xiaolinzi, Jiang Xiaosizi, Teng Guoxiang, Guan Changgui, He Xiafu, Ouyang Zhao, Liu Chongyuan, Zhang Depeng, Yang Zhaoyu, Jiang Shuyin, Jia Youqing, Shen Jifu, Yang Yuefu, Lu Zhaoxiong, Yu Xiaoquan, Zhu Xianglian, Dai Yaohua, Li Agen, Peng Qisheng, Sun Chunfu, Yu Xiaowuzi, Cao Zhenyu, Tu Erqun, Shi Weigan, Yuan Zhengrong, Gao Xiaosanzi, Han Agen, Xu Xiangxiang, Pan Zhenglin, Zhu Wand, Yu Dasiyu, Huang Simaizi, Wang Agen, Wang Ru, Zhang Guangju, Zhu Sanmaizi, Wang Guangde, Niu Jinxiang, Ren Yuncai, Zhang Wenhui, Zhao Gui, Wang Yongen, Zhaoguangquan, Zhao Jinshan, Sun Fuxi, Lai Zhong, Wu A, Zhou Yinshan, Xu Wanzhao, Wang Dehong, Pan Buji, Hu Bigui, Tang Fenglou, Liu Shoucai, Zhu Yuecai, Yao Agen, Zhu Honglian, Liu Kerong, Wang Dehou, and Xiao Jisheng.

Yesterday afternoon, Chen Kangsun and Fu Zhuan presided over the first hearing. Because there were so many defendants (over one hundred and ten), it was an unprecedented record. The courtroom was packed, so police chief Zhang Shuping led four policemen to maintain order in the court. Judge Chen, a benevolent judge, saw this group of ignorant people and their families at home waiting to be fed, and that the plaintiff's injuries were healing, so he turned to the hundred and eleven obedient individuals aside from Zhu Wengong and said, "You are poor people, you can't live a day without working. Now the plaintiff's medical expenses are about 200 yuan. If you share it together, it will be less than two yuan per person. If you are willing, you can be released on bail." The defendants listened to the announcement and all expressed their willingness. The judge then asked the victims, who also agreed. So the judge brought Wengong to the stand and cautioned him, saying that the plaintiff could now withdraw the case, but the loss fee was 200 yuan. You are the main person responsible for half of it, amounting to 100 yuan. The other 100 yuan will be shared by the others. Because there are many people, there may be some injustices. Zhu Wengong agreed. So the plaintiff withdrew the case. The defendants who had lawyers, totaling fifty-two people, were led out by defense lawyers Zhang Jie, Xu Yinhan, Lu Songya, etc. As for the rest, they were ordered to provide bail at any time.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (29)

Q: Mr. Cao Guangbiao from Nanjing wrote, "I sent several pieces of clothing and several dozen landscape photos from Tianjin to Nanchong, Sichuan, dividing them into two packages and handing them over to the post office. However, the addressee has not yet received the items. I don't know why. This is not in line with the post office's original aim of being reliable and fast. If these items are lost, is the post office responsible? Can the sender be notified of the loss? If I want to inquire, should I inquire at the post office of origin or the post office of destination?"

A: Small parcel post is a method of sending scattered small items, delivered together with letters. Each item is limited to one kilogram in weight. See the Postal Knowledge Q&A in Issue 22 of this newspaper for details. Judging by the quantity of items you sent, it seems you were sending package post, not small parcel post. If it has not been delivered for a long time, it may be due to postal congestion, a stop in transit, or other reasons. You can open the following items: 1. Type of item sent, such as registered letter, express registered letter, ordinary letter, ordinary parcel, insured parcel, etc. 2. Post office number (referring to the number on the post office receipt, if you have one). 3. Date and place of posting. 4. Name and address of sender and recipient. Together with the post office receipt and an inquiry fee of 16 cents per item, write to the post office of origin to investigate. If you paid the registration return receipt fee at the time of posting (that is, an additional 8 cents in addition to the parcel postage, so that the post office at the destination can collect the post office's receipt from the recipient when delivering the parcel and send it to the sender for safekeeping, which the post office calls a return receipt), you do not need to pay a separate inquiry fee. Also, if the cause of the error is found in the future, and the post office is responsible, the post office will refund the inquiry fee in full.

After receiving the details of the above items, the post office of origin will draw up an inquiry form and send it to the relevant bureaus for investigation in turn. If it is found that the item has been delivered to the recipient on a certain date, the recipient will be asked to provide a return receipt (i.e., receipt of knowledge) and send it to you for inspection. If it is found to have been lost, the circumstances of the loss will be reported to you. If the cause of the loss is not due to one of the following circumstances: 1. Loss due to the nature or defect of the item sent. 2. Loss due to natural disasters or other force majeure. 3. Loss due to the item sent being contraband or violating postal regulations, you can write to the post office to claim compensation. The amount of compensation is no more than 5 yuan in national currency for each item weighing less than 10 kilograms, and no more than 10 yuan in national currency for each item weighing more than 10 kilograms. If the actual value of the item sent is less than the amount specified above, compensation shall be based on the actual value. The method of calculating the actual value is based on the market price of the item at the time of posting at the place of origin.

### New Invention of Nutritious Soymilk Powder Successfully Tested

Ministry of Industry Approves Five-Year Patent
