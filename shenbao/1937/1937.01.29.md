### Rampant Smuggling in North China

Foreign Merchants in Tianjin Collude with Ronin. The Number of Protected Smuggled Goods Increases Daily. British Consulate Inquires About Anti-Smuggling Affairs. Ge Dingyuan Visited Kong Yesterday to Report.

[Tianjin] Smuggling has been rampant in North China recently, even worse than during the spring. Merchants in Beiping and Tianjin are cooperating with smugglers. Dalian Port has a free trade zone, and European and American goods are shipped to the area without taxes. Smugglers then, under protection, transport those goods to China via the two ports in eastern Hebei, Dahe and Qinhuangdao. These goods are then linked by trains and trucks to smuggle into Tianjin. Therefore, the types of smuggled goods are now extensive. They are not limited to Japanese sugar and rayon. Valuable Western items are smuggled to evade taxes. The smuggler's organization is extensive with the backing of a military unit. The customs and road transport have reached the point of being helpless. Legitimate foreign merchants are greatly worried. (Special dispatch on the 28th)

The Tianjin-Tanggu route will coordinate with steamboats with unfixed frequency. Another automobile transportation will run between Xugezhuang and Guye in eastern Hebei, so the smuggled goods coming in through Beidaihe do not need to use the railways. The capital of 500,000 has already been raised, and many Beiping merchants are investing. The smuggled goods currently in the eastern districts are worth 50 million. The Customs estimates that, based on the current situation, it is enough to sell in North China for over six months. The Customs cracked down on the Yihecheng grocery store in Beiyingmen on the 27th and confiscated 160 bags of smuggled sugar purchased from the Tianhua Trading Company of Taiwanese in the Japanese Concession. The Customs then confiscated them. Xitian visited the Customs on the 28th to protest and demanded their return. (Special dispatch on the 28th)

Appeals to Political, Legislative, and Other Agencies

Weng instructed them to file with the Ministry of Finance for processing. They then went to the Legislative Yuan to meet with Secretary-General Liang. Finally, they petitioned the Ministry of Finance, where they were received by Gao Bingfang, the Director of the Income Tax Office. The representatives stated that the tax rates set for the first, second, and third categories, and stated that the income tax rate for the second category of salary compensation is the highest. Compared with the first and third categories, the second category is purely labor income, the income is the most difficult to obtain, and the tax is the heaviest, which is unfair. They requested for a revision. Secondly, the freedom of professional profit and loss varies greatly. If it is settled once every six months, it is still difficult to conform to the principle of paying taxes on a monthly average. It is proposed to calculate and pay on a 12-month average. The representative of the accountant also gave very detailed opinions on the collection aspects of the first category. Gao promised to report to the minister immediately for instructions. In general, the idea of calculating on a 12-month average can be adopted. Changing the tax rate requires legal procedures, which is considered difficult and temporarily unchangeable. Gao Bingfang and Liang Jingchong hosted all the representatives at the Queen's Hotel at noon to exchange views. (Special dispatch on the 28th)

The income tax preparation duties in Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, which were originally held concurrently by Weng Zhiyong, Zhang Jun, Zhang Miao, and others, have now been reassigned to dedicated personnel. Shi Shinai will be in charge of Anhui, Zhu Butang will be in charge of Henan, Chen Zhenhua will be in charge of Jiangxi, and Zhang Cui will be in charge of Fujian.

### Fierce Tiger in Hong Kong Mauls Person to Death

[Hong Kong] Yesterday, the corpse of a Chinese woman, mauled by wild animals, was discovered at the foot of Tai Mo Shan (transliteration). This shows that the fierce tiger that appeared near villages in Kowloon earlier is still appearing from time to time. The woman's body was almost entirely devoured, with only the head and limbs remaining. According to villagers, the tiger tracks found near the corpse confirm that the woman was eaten by a fierce tiger. It is heard that the soil near where the corpse was found was quite loose, indicating that the woman struggled vigorously when encountering the tiger. It is rumored that the woman was from Tai Wan Village (transliteration). A man from the village went missing previously and was probably also a victim of the tiger. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Madrid Under Fire (Continued)

— Translated by Bin Fu

We turned a corner; there was another deafening explosion, and the eaves, bricks, and wood, mixed with glass, collapsed from a massive apartment building onto our road, about three hundred feet above our heads. We slammed on the brakes and ran into the doorway. A bomb hissed as it landed on the ground. It chilled me to the bone. "Where will it hit?" I forced the door open, trying to find a safer place to hide, but a gust of wind slammed the door back, so I retreated. The bomb exploded from the house we were hiding in to the third house. At the same time, another bomb fell. From the light popping sound, I guessed it had landed on the stone street. Half a chunk of blackened granite bounced over the roof and landed in the narrow courtyard that connected to the doorway where I was standing. A woman opened the door and called us in. "Such savages!" she cried.

There were no bombs for a few minutes. We opened the door. There was no sound of planes turning. We went back to the street. A man armed with a motorcycle asked for my car to transport the wounded. He was requisitioning all the cars for ambulance use. Soon, they were carrying back people with missing limbs or half their faces blown off. At that moment, everyone hated with a permanent hatred.

From the courtyards of many destroyed houses, women, old people, and young children began to crawl out. Everything was white; white hair, white faces, white clothes—all covered in fragmented plaster dust. A thirteen-year-old girl comforted a canary in a cage. She carried a bottle of milk under her arm. A woman held a baby, both looking very miserable, the mother in black clothes, leading the child on top of the black cloth. A wrinkled old woman, wrapped in a blanket, every wrinkle on her face trembling involuntarily, stood blankly on the road, repeatedly asking, "Where do I go?"

I walked back. A stream of homeless people drifted through the streets, some carrying a coat, some carrying a bundle of clothes, some carrying a child's bedding. Women stood in groups, wringing their hands tightly, shifting their waists in disappointment. This situation has been going on for weeks. I ran from street to street, and not a single window was intact. Everything looked like a city after an earthquake. Yet the people continued to live there. "Where can they go?" The Spanish government's resources have been drained by the war. There are no transport trucks or cars, no sufficient food and money to move the citizens of Madrid away, and no outside help is coming. Where is the world that responded to Belgium's appeal? Where are the millions of charitable hearts who run to church every day to pray to God? Where are the millions of charitable hearts who call themselves idealists and are busy with their own affairs, fixing their hair, and going to the theater? A city's culture and beauty are about to be buried in the dust!

I later learned that the air raid was carried out by twenty-eight Junkers aircraft and two Capronis aircraft. Those brave pilots knew they were killing innocent women, children, and non-combatants. They have been doing this for weeks: they have been getting good practice. They are being ordered by Berlin and Rome. Their dictatorial masters worship terror. When Abyssinia was not conquered, poison gas was immediately released. The nation that produced Cervantes, Velasquez, Goya, and El Greco is suffering the same cruel treatment as the black warriors of Selassie. Western Europe will not have a better fate.

In Spain, the two great powers of the world are fighting. The fascists were the first to ship in planes and arms. Now they are also the first to send in troops. Their submarines and other warships are spying on the Spanish government's fleet in the eastern ports. Their shamelessness is unparalleled, because Britain and France have shown them in many places—Abyssinia, the Rhineland—that the bold can ultimately triumph. Democratic diplomacy is no match for arrogant fascism. If Franco wins, Europe will immediately turn black, or, once Hitler and Mussolini complete their preparations for war, Europe will plunge into war. Madrid may or may not fall. That is not the end. In Navarre, in Asturias, in Aragon, government troops have won important military victories. Government troops are also advancing towards the enemy's center, Talavera. Farmer strikes and worker resistance are shaking Franco's rear. According to captured prisoners, he is hiring untrained Moors because the reserves are exhausted and the Spanish do not want to fight for him.

The matter has not yet been decided. This matter may drag on longer than anyone imagines now. (The End)

### Central Political Council Approves Additional Budget for the 24th Year

National Government Orders the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to Handle in Accordance with Regulations

Current Commentary

### The Difficult Birth of the New Japanese Cabinet

— Fu

After the Hirota cabinet of Japan resigned due to the fierce attack from the parliament, the imperial household immediately appointed General Ugaki to organize a new cabinet. However, since Ugaki accepted the mandate to form a cabinet on the 24th, four days have passed, and the cabinet formation work not only has no progress but also seems to be aborting. The main reason for the difficult birth of the new cabinet is naturally the strong opposition from the military.

The reason for the military's opposition to Ugaki's cabinet is, on the surface, that several generals with qualifications to be Minister of the Army have refused to accept the position of Minister of the Army. But in fact, it is because they are dissatisfied with Ugaki's attitude, so they are unwilling to recommend a successor to the Minister of the Army, thus preventing the Ugaki cabinet from being formed. The reason they put forward that no one is succeeding is only a means of shirking responsibility. The military's dissatisfaction with Ugaki is because he holds relatively liberal ideas and has considerable relations with political parties. At the same time, he is responsible for the reduction of the Japanese army from 21 divisions to 17 divisions. Ugaki, with such a history, will naturally be opposed by the military, which firmly advocates actively developing outward and taking enriching national defense as the first priority. In the past few days, although Ugaki has used various methods to seek the military's understanding, the military's firm attitude has not changed in the slightest. Therefore, the difficulties Ugaki has encountered seem extremely difficult to overcome. The road ahead for Ugaki is either to retreat in the face of difficulty and resign, or to adopt extraordinary methods. The so-called extraordinary method is, on the one hand, for Ugaki to make private contacts with those qualified to be Minister of the Army and persuade them to accept the position of Minister of the Army. After obtaining their consent, the military will recommend them. On the other hand, he will petition the Emperor and use the power of the imperial household to order those qualified to assume the position of Minister of the Army. However, according to Ugaki's statement on the 27th, he does not intend to take this extraordinary method. Perhaps this 67-year-old general has another magic weapon to break through this difficulty. What the facts are, we can only look at the development of the situation in the next few days.

We will not discuss now whether the Ugaki new cabinet can be formed, but only briefly describe the future political trends in Japan. It is very obvious that after this cabinet crisis is resolved, the military's power in politics will greatly increase. In the early days, the military did not have much influence in politics. However, since the May 15 Incident, the phenomenon of military interference in politics has become increasingly common. Recently, the military's power has become even stronger. The Hirota cabinet was completely under the influence of the military. Even the new cabinet formed after this will necessarily be controlled by the military. Because a cabinet not approved by the military, or a cabinet not controlled by the military, will be opposed by the military at the beginning of its formation, and the military will not recommend a successor to the Minister of the Army, so that the cabinet cannot be produced. If this method continues to be used arbitrarily, it will inevitably make the cabinet a tool of the military, that is to say, all political power will be dominated by the military. In this way, there is probably no doubt that a fascist political system will appear in the Far East.

The rightward shift of Japanese politics is, of course, a great obstacle to the revival of our nation. Therefore, we very much hope that the result of this Japanese political crisis can maintain the usual path of constitutionalism. If not, then we can only further intensify the large-scale, sincere unity work to cope with the great evolution of the future Far East situation and strive for national independence and freedom.

### U.S. Flooding Becomes More Serious and Extends to the Mississippi Basin

Authorities Requisition 35,000 Trucks to Transport 500,000 Downstream Residents Out of the Area

[Washington] The Mississippi River basin is now at risk of a major flood similar to those in Ohio and Kentucky. Authorities today requisitioned 35,000 trucks to transport 500,000 residents of the basin out of the area. President Roosevelt is determined to prevent the panic caused by floods in those states from happening elsewhere. He has ordered senior army officers to draft an unprecedented plan to transport all residents within 100,000 square miles to other locations. This includes several of the world's richest cotton-producing areas. The flooded areas on both sides of the Mississippi River are each 50 miles wide, from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans, Louisiana. The river's raging waters are now flowing into its largest tributary, the Ohio River, which will likely flood even more severely. The flooded area in the Mississippi River basin has reached 2 million acres. Engineers expect that the river's waters will reach their peak within a week, at which point the floodgates will be ineffective, but they still hope that it will not be necessary to relocate all residents. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

[New York] The floods in the mid-eastern states of the United States are becoming increasingly serious and threaten to become a major disaster. The total material damage has reached 500 million U.S. dollars, and there are one million homeless people. The number of deaths is 261. In addition, there are more than 250 deaths in the hospitals of Louisville, Kentucky. Fearing the outbreak of epidemics, the authorities buried them without identifying them. The Mississippi River area, from Cairo, Illinois in the north to New Orleans, Louisiana in the south, is also at risk of flooding. The authorities have decided on all measures so that residents there can quickly evacuate upon receiving a warning. Although the Ohio River's water level has begun to recede, there is a shortage of drinking water, the climate is harsh, and there are places where epidemics may break out. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Cairo The Ohio River's water level is still five feet below the dikes here today, so the military commander still hopes that the city will be safe. However, there is a dike break north of Cairo, which has affected the town of Monte. (National News dispatch, 27th)

### Europe's Coasts Hit by Wind and Snow

British Naval Exercises Temporarily Canceled

[Paris] Storms, floods, and ice have struck the coasts of Europe today. The storms are particularly severe on the coast of Portugal. Traffic has been disrupted in most towns in Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. British naval exercises in the Mediterranean have also been temporarily canceled. (National News dispatch, 28th)

[London] Floods and storms are wreaking havoc across Europe today, and temperatures have fallen below freezing. The Thames River has flooded its banks, reaching heights of nine feet in some areas. A storm has passed through the Shetland Islands. Eastern Europe and the area around Austria and the Black Sea are experiencing wind and snow, and traffic has been disrupted. Portugal is also experiencing floods. The British cruisers "Orion" and "Neptune" were damaged in the Strait of Gibraltar. In Poland, the flu is rampant due to the climate. (National News dispatch, 27th)

Gibraltar The weather here is terrible, with gale-force winds reaching 97 miles per hour, causing great damage to the town and shipping. The British Steamship Company has prepared lodging for 160 passengers tonight because the hotels in Gibraltar are full. Even the lounges and reading rooms have been converted into bedrooms.

### French Chamber of Deputies Continues Debate on National Defense Issues

Actively Promote Highway Construction; Border Defense is Already Fearless

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies continued its debate on national defense this morning. Presiding over the session were Vice-Speaker and Communist Party member Duguello. Representing the government were Minister of National Defense Daladier, Minister of Aviation Guy La Chambre, and Minister of the Navy Gascni du Park. Deputy Pogiede from the Eastern region, speaking on behalf of the border residents, requested the government to undertake two tasks simultaneously: first, the mechanization of the army, and second, the construction of a vast highway network. He pointed out that Germany had already built 25,000 kilometers of highways and planned to build 7,000 kilometers of motorways, all with a width of 20 to 30 meters, at a cost of between 22 and 30 billion francs. In contrast, French highway policy adheres to outdated methods, with a width of only 15 meters, and the annual budget is a mere 300 million francs, which pales in comparison to Germany. Right-wing Democratic Party member Shapdelan then spoke, stating that France had spent a total of 57 billion francs on national defense in recent years, while Germany had spent 150 billion francs. Moreover, the Soviet Union's national defense budget for the current year has reached as much as 95 billion francs. Given this situation, the 40-hour work week should not be applied to the defense industry to accelerate the manufacturing of military equipment. The deputy then expressed concern about the strength of border defenses. Minister of National Defense Daladier replied, "Border defense fortifications are complete. Even if the enemy launches a surprise attack on a holiday, we have nothing to fear." At this point, Radical Party member Bodou rose to speak, advocating for a more rapid mobilization of troops and praising Minister of National Defense Daladier's contributions to modernizing the army, comparing him to his predecessors. The deputies applauded in agreement. Subsequently, Left-wing Democratic Party member Gokiro questioned the government, stating that it takes six years to build an armored battleship in France, while Germany only needs two to three years, a significant difference. National Republican Union Party member Weideman demanded the strengthening of air defense facilities. The Chamber then adjourned until 3:30 PM. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

### Belgian Cabinet Crisis

Vandervelde Resigns

Brussels – A cabinet crisis occurred in Belgium today. The renowned socialist veteran and giant of public health, Vandervelde, was instructed by the Labor Party Executive Committee to withdraw from the cabinet because Vandervelde had disagreements with other cabinet members, especially Foreign Minister Spaak (also a socialist), regarding Spanish affairs. After the Belgian diplomat Pocheglav was killed in Madrid, the Belgian government took a very stern stance towards Spain, which Vandervelde strongly opposed. Although no other Labor Party cabinet members are willing to follow Vandervelde's example, Vandervelde's resignation suggests that the coalition government of the Belgian Catholic Party, Socialist Party, and Liberal Party may disintegrate as a result. However, it is generally believed that the government's fate can still be preserved for now. The current cabinet was formed by the Catholic Party's Janson on June 12, 1936. (Reuters, 27th)

### Ugaki's Cabinet Formation Reaches a Delicate Stage

Failed to Meet with the Three Army Chiefs; Still Says He Intends to Make a Final Effort

[Tokyo] Ugaki's confidant, Kiyotake Imaida, visited Terauchi this morning. Terauchi told him that the Army's attitude had not changed and that it would be of little use for Ugaki to meet with the three Army chiefs. However, Ugaki, disregarding everything, was still planning the best strategy this afternoon in hopes of breaking the current deadlock. However, no one can determine whether there will be any success. It is now widely believed that Ugaki has no other option but to resign from his mission to form a cabinet. The Army's strong attitude was unexpected by most people, and Ugaki's unwillingness to easily abandon his cabinet plan is also surprising. Since receiving the mandate to form a cabinet, Ugaki has not left his house for four days, except for visiting Terauchi, Nagano, and Yuasa. His relaxed attitude is extremely rare. Furthermore, although the political situation is unstable, senior officials are consulting, and political parties are keeping silent, intending to avoid aggravating political disputes and difficulties in order to resolve the current cabinet crisis. This is also a phenomenon that has not occurred in any previous political changes in Japan. (Central News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] People generally fear that there is no room for the situation to improve. The Army believes that Ugaki's cabinet formation will inevitably fail. Army Vice-Minister Umezu told the press that he believes that if Ugaki is indeed a great politician, he should resign from his mission to form a cabinet. He also said that the entire Army opposes Ugaki personally, so there is no need to listen to Ugaki's policies. (Central News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] According to the Army, the military has repeatedly explained the internal situation to General Ugaki. Although General Ugaki requested a meeting with the three chiefs, the Army's attitude will not change in any way. The Army's work of streamlining the military is now complete. If there is any infighting within the department, it will be detrimental to both sides. General Ugaki should be aware of this situation and resign from his mandate as the best course of action. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] Grand Chamberlain Hyakutake, Chief Aide-de-Camp Minami, and Interior Minister Yuasa entered the palace successively between 8:00 and 9:00 AM this morning. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] At 7:50 PM on the 28th, General Ugaki told people at the cabinet formation headquarters that the situation has now reached a critical juncture. Since starting the formation of the cabinet, a considerable amount of time has passed. However, having worked so hard to find a way out, he will naturally strive to fulfill his duty to the end. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

### Considering Two or Three Methods

Unwilling to Delay Further; Not Waiting for the Military's Reply

[Tokyo] Kiyotake Imaida stated at the cabinet formation headquarters at 2:30 PM on the 28th that it is unlikely that General Ugaki will meet with Army authorities at this time. Also, there is no decision on whether he will enter the palace today. He has no plans to visit anywhere as General Ugaki's envoy or to invite anyone from the outside. The matter of indefinite delay is being carefully considered, and he sincerely hopes to avoid further delays. They are still considering everything as before, but cannot express anything specific. Although there have been no external changes since Minister Terauchi's meeting with him, two or three methods among the various methods that have been considered have emerged as a result of the meeting with Minister Terauchi. Regarding whether they will further engage with Army authorities and whether General Ugaki's state of mind is the same as before his meeting with Minister Terauchi, or has changed, and whether the situation will continue as such if they no longer engage with Army authorities, all these points are in a very delicate state and cannot be expressed. However, he can report that they are not waiting for a reply from the military authorities. He also cannot report whether there is hope of obtaining the position of Minister of War. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] Kiyotake Imaida visited Minister Terauchi at his residence at 10:00 AM on the 28th, stating that General Ugaki still hopes to meet with the three chiefs. Minister Terauchi replied that the results of the meeting of the three chiefs on the 26th had been answered, and the situation has not changed even today. Even if the three chiefs met with General Ugaki, he believes it would be difficult to meet his expectations, as the Army's attitude remains strong, and even a meeting would be ineffective. After speaking, Imaida returned to the cabinet formation headquarters and stated that he had visited Minister Terauchi on General Ugaki's orders, but the content cannot be reported at this time. Whether General Ugaki can meet with Minister Terauchi again has not been decided. Regarding the relationship with the Army, it cannot be said that there has been any special change from yesterday's situation, and there is nothing to wait for in the future. He only went as an envoy, and whether there were any results cannot be clearly reported. Minister Terauchi is unlikely to have a reply. He has no plans to visit anyone else in the Army's leadership besides the Minister of War. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] The following is the situation of the questions and answers between General Ugaki's Chief of Staff for Cabinet Formation, Kiyotake Imaida, and the press corps at the cabinet formation headquarters at 8:00 PM on the 28th:

Q: Has the overall situation turned in the direction of resignation?

A: It is not appropriate to answer other than to state General Ugaki's state of mind.

Q: Is there still hope for breaking the deadlock in the situation?

A: This matter is being carefully considered, but it is unlikely that we will ask for more time.

Q: Are you planning to go out tonight?

A: Neither General Ugaki nor I are planning to go out, and no one from the outside is invited to come here.

Q: Have you not taken extraordinary measures yet?

A: We are trying to solve the problem in a fair and aboveboard manner as much as possible and do not want to take extraordinary measures.

Q: If the cabinet formation fails, will it not be possible to resolve the situation, have you considered this?

A: Although I have not thought about it that way, because the situation is extremely serious, success in forming the cabinet should be considered the final service. In any case, we must strive to maintain coordination in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome.

Q: The so-called coordination methods have largely come to naught, what is to be done?

A: That is largely the case, but some means of coordination still remain. We will exert our last efforts until they are exhausted, and we should consider this to be General Ugaki's responsibility.

Q: Has the negotiation with the Army ended?

A: I am afraid that we will no longer consult with the Army. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

### Legal Resolution

Difficult to Implement in Practice

[Tokyo] After General Ugaki met with the Yuasa government on the 27th and reported the difficulties in forming a cabinet, he discussed the aftermath with Kiyotake Imaida. In view of the serious situation, he decided to complete the cabinet formation, believing that this was the most appropriate measure. Regarding the policy of completing the cabinet formation, obtaining a candidate to succeed the Minister of War was a prerequisite. Therefore, Ugaki decided to meet with former Minister of War Terauchi and Inspector General Sugiyama today, or at a joint meeting of the three chiefs, to earnestly request the recommendation of a candidate for Minister of War and to cooperate with the Army in a cooperative attitude to overcome the difficulties. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] Because the Army's attitude remained consistently strong, making implementation impossible, the cabinet formation headquarters invited the Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, Daisaburo Tsugita, on the 26th and 27th to discuss legal solutions. On the morning of the 28th, Director-General Tsugita was again invited for a legal study on the selection of the Minister of War, attracting general attention. The results will be explained legally as follows:

㊀ According to Article 9 of the Cabinet Ordinance, if a minister of a department has a problem, the minister of another department may temporarily hold the position or be ordered to manage the affairs. According to this interpretation, it is not illegal to order the minister of another department to manage the affairs of the Minister of War at the time of cabinet formation.

㊁ Since the three Army chiefs have notified that it is impossible to recommend a successor to the Minister of War, it is legally possible for General Ugaki to negotiate directly with his intended person and appoint him as the Minister of War without the recommendation of the three chiefs.

Although the first method is not illegal, it cannot be applied in practice because it concerns the military. Although the second theory has possibilities, in terms of practical problems, if there is no understanding from the military, it will be difficult to maintain control within the department when appointing the Minister of War. Therefore, Ugaki seems to still be negotiating with the military to find a solution. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

[Tokyo] Based on the decision of the meeting of the three Army chiefs, the Army authorities issued a formal reply to General Ugaki. Former Minister of War Terauchi believes that the negotiation between the Army and General Ugaki to form a cabinet has ended with this final means, and he does not place any expectations on future developments. He also believes that the issue to be resolved in the future is how to satisfactorily resolve the difficult situation that will arise after General Ugaki resigns from his mandate, and he regards the abortion of the Ugaki cabinet as merely a matter of time. General Ugaki has lost the Army's cooperation. How will he proceed with the current cabinet? According to some sources, his methods are as follows:

㊀ He will seek a person from among the generals or lieutenant generals other than the candidates recommended by the three Army chiefs and request him to join the cabinet.

㊁ He will revise the current ordinance so that generals or lieutenant generals of the reserve and retired armies can also serve as Minister of War.

㊂ He will specially order the generals or lieutenant generals of the reserve and retired armies to return to active duty in order to allow them to join the cabinet.

㊃ When an imperial edict is issued to the military minister, Minister Terauchi will remain in office.

However, it is actually difficult to implement these methods. If General Ugaki forcibly implements these methods, it is not known whether a particularly worrying situation will occur. There is also a saying that a civilian official will act as the Minister of War and manage military affairs, but this measure is extremely dangerous for Ugaki. According to the Army, General Ugaki will never consider such measures for the sake of his reputation. Thus, General Ugaki's work of forming a cabinet has encountered a fatal obstacle due to the strong opposition of the military, so its abortion is inevitable. (Domei News Agency, 28th)

### Germany and Austria Establish Economic Agreement

Large Increase in Trade Volume

[Vienna] Foreign Minister Schmidt recently signed an economic agreement between Germany and Austria with German Ambassador Papen. The main points of the agreement stipulate that: ㊀ The quantity of Austrian agricultural products, especially livestock, butter, milk, timber, and equipment required for the metallurgical industry, exported to Germany should be increased. ㊁ Germany and Austria will encourage people to travel and visit each other. ㊂ The quantity of coal and industrial manufactured goods produced in Germany exported to Austria should be increased. Regarding this matter, an official announcement stated that the volume of trade between Germany and Austria will greatly increase in accordance with this agreement. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

[Vienna] After the signing of the German-Austrian economic agreement, it was rumored that Germany intends to supply Austria with aviation machinery for offsetting debts. Political figures here recently declared that even if this statement is true, the aviation machinery that Germany can supply must be limited, as the German-Austrian economic agreement has a certain limit on the offsetting debt methods of both parties, and the amount is not huge. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

### General Ugaki Is Well-Prepared and Calm

[Tokyo] General Ugaki, who has tasted deep suffering and is confined to the upper floor of the cabinet formation headquarters, came downstairs after breakfast and took a walk in the inner garden. Seeing the plum blossoms in full bloom, he felt a sense of leisure. He was immediately surrounded by newspaper reporters and asked, "How is the situation?" He replied, "I enjoy taking walks in the morning and evening. Since forming the cabinet, I have been confined to the upper floor and have not exercised, so I feel full in the abdomen, have a poor appetite, and my head also feels heavy. Although it is difficult for me to come up with a good plan, my ambition to form a cabinet has not weakened at all. Since the situation is already like this, my persistence may be helpful." Then, he changed the subject, saying, "I have another grandson." From forming the cabinet, he thought of his second daughter, Hideko, who had given birth to a healthy boy, and his worried expression seemed to lessen slightly. The general continued, "Naming the grandson is very difficult. Should I take the two characters 'cabinet formation'?" He then said that this was a joke, and if he did, he would surely be resented by his daughter. After speaking, he laughed non-stop and then toured the country before going upstairs.

### League of Nations Closes; French-Turkish Agreement Concluded

[Geneva] The 96th regular session of the League of Nations Council held its last public meeting at 8:00 PM tonight to conclude various issues. The President of the Council, Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, announced the formal closure of this session at 8:40 PM. As for the cases discussed at this session, in addition to the issue of the Turkish minority in the Sanjak region within Syria being resolved, the Council also decided today on the issue of the successor to the High Commissioner of the Free City of Danzig and the withdrawal of refugees sheltered in the embassies of various countries in the Spanish capital. Regarding the first issue, the Council held a closed meeting in the afternoon, during which British Foreign Secretary Eden presented a report, advocating that the committee composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Sweden should continue to monitor the development of the situation in the Free City of Danzig and proposing that former Dutch Chief of Naval Staff Vice-Admiral de Graaf be appointed as the League of Nations High Commissioner to the Free City of Danzig to succeed the former High Commissioner Lester. If Vice-Admiral de Graaf is unwilling to take office, the three-nation committee will jointly appoint another person with the President of the Council and the Polish representative. This report was approved by the public meeting of the Council. Regarding the second issue, a compromise was reached between the representatives of Spain and Chile at the closed meeting of the Council this afternoon. Subsequently, the issue of the withdrawal of refugees sheltered in the embassies of South American countries in Madrid will be resolved through direct negotiations in London between the Spanish Ambassador to Britain Azcarraga and the ambassadors and ministers of South American countries to Britain. This decision was also filed by the public meeting of the Council. At this point, the work of the Council was completely completed, and the representatives of various countries left Geneva one after another. French Foreign Minister Delbos also departed for Paris tonight. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

[Geneva] The issue of the Turkish minority in the two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch within Syria, the so-called Sanjak region, has been resolved by France and Turkey concluding an agreement, and Rapporteur Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler drafted a report and submitted it to the League of Nations Council for review. At the Council meeting this afternoon, the report was submitted for a vote and passed unanimously. The solution is summarized as follows:

㊀ The two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch, the so-called Sanjak region, enjoy complete autonomy in internal affairs, but foreign affairs are handled by the Syrian state. Furthermore, the currency system and tariff system of the region should also be the same as those of Syria.

㊁ Turkish should be the official language in the Sanjak region. As for the conditions under which other languages can be used, it will be decided by the League of Nations Council at a later date.

㊂ Any steps taken by the Syrian state in international affairs that are related to the internal autonomy of the Sanjak region must first be clearly approved by the League of Nations Council.

㊃ Syria and the Sanjak region will be contacted by special commissioners.

㊄ The League of Nations Council will appoint a French representative to ensure the implementation of the administrative system of the Sanjak region. The representative has the right to decide to suspend the implementation of the resolutions of the Sanjak legislative body, but only for a period of four months.

㊅ No troops will be stationed in the Sanjak region, and the implementation of compulsory military service and the construction of military projects in the region are prohibited.

㊅ France and Turkey should conclude a treaty in the future to jointly guarantee the territorial integrity of the Sanjak region and the inviolability of the existing borders of Syria.

㊇ Special clauses should be established stipulating that Turkey should enjoy preferential rights in the port of Alexandretta.

㊈ The administrative system of the Sanjak region will take effect immediately after being passed by a two-thirds majority of the League of Nations Council. France guarantees the implementation of this system until the end of its mandate for the Syrian mandate.

At the Council meeting today to review the above report, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüşdü and French Foreign Minister Delbos both stated that this new agreement will further strengthen the friendship between France and Turkey. Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov also spoke in succession, expressing their delight at the conclusion of the agreement between France and Turkey.

### Radek's Confession: Trotsky Conspired with Germany to Incite the Russo-Japanese War

Claiming an outbreak is possible this year. The Russian reactionary case's trial concludes. Trotsky's second son arrested in Russia.

[Moscow] During the ongoing trial of the renowned Soviet Russian journalist Radek and sixteen other former high-ranking Soviet officials today, Radek predicted that war would break out between Japan and Russia within the year. According to Radek's confession, he received a phone call from the former Deputy People's Commissar of Heavy Industry, Pyatakov, stating that Trotsky had conspired with Germany to incite this war, with the approximate intended time being within 1937. Radek continued, stating that according to Pyatakov, the German side needed a year for diplomatic preparations, but their military preparations were already complete. The German side desired Britain to remain neutral and demanded complete freedom of action in the Danube region and the Balkans. The former head of the Soviet Russian Railway Bureau, Kniazev, also testified regarding the matter, stating that the Japanese views were quite consistent with those mentioned in Radek's confession.

[Moscow] Regarding the counter-revolutionary "Parallel Center" case, the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court yesterday questioned the defendant Kniazev. He confessed, "I organized a Trotskyist counter-revolutionary organization and sabotaged railways in the southern Ural province, causing 1,500 accidents in 1934 and 2,000 accidents in 1935. I also worked for the Japanese intelligence agency in 1934, providing them with secret information given to me by another defendant, Livshits (former director of the Southern Railway Bureau and Deputy People's Commissar of Transportation). In 1936, a Japanese spy moved to Moscow and ordered me to hide poisonous bacteria in the army's food depot, for which I was paid 15,000 rubles." Another defendant, Radek, confessed that he was ordered by the defendant Pyatakov to blow up several chemical plants and maintain contact with the German intelligence agency. With the interrogation of the seventeen defendants completed, the court immediately prohibited public attendance and ordered experts to submit reports. It is claimed that the damage to the railway locomotives and the explosions in the factories were very minor, due to the defendants' perfunctory performance of the sabotage work. (Havas Dispatch, 28th)

[Moscow] It is rumored that Trotsky's second son, Sedov, a Bolshevik leader in Soviet Russia who is currently working as an engineer at the Krasnoyarsk factory, has been arrested today on charges of plotting to poison the factory workers. There has been no official announcement regarding this action by the government, but the resolution passed by the workers of the Krasnoyarsk factory can be considered factual evidence. The resolution stated, "The Fascist henchman Trotsky's son Sedov attempted to use poisonous gas to annihilate the last group of workers. We have applied to the Supreme Court to exterminate these specially sent vermin." (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)

Mexico. Trotsky stated today regarding the arrest of his second son, Sedov, in Russia that this was an act of revenge. After imprisonment, he will likely be subjected to unbearable torture. This kind of action is truly in Stalin's nature; my two daughters have already died at his hands. Trotsky also published an article in the newspaper, declaring that the confessions made by the seventeen former high-ranking Soviet officials in the Moscow public trial were entirely fabricated and inconsistent with space and time. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)

### Situation of Germans in Morocco

Melilla Airport - No Outsiders Allowed

[London] The captain of the British warship "Veronica" was recently invited by Colonel Bebade, the Spanish High Commissioner of Morocco, to visit the ports of Ceuta and Melilla in Spanish Morocco to investigate any German activity. Regarding this matter, Liberal Member of Parliament, Mandell, recently raised a question to the government, which was answered by Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, stating that the captain of the "Veronica" had visited the ports of Ceuta and Melilla accompanied by the British Consul in Tetouan. No evidence was obtained regarding the stationing of German troops in the Ceuta and Tetouan port areas. The Spanish High Commissioner of Morocco also declared that, apart from a small number of Germans in the Spanish foreign legion, the German expatriates in Tetouan were all members of commercial organizations and were studying trade issues between Spanish Morocco and Germany. In addition, no evidence was obtained regarding the construction of barracks in the port of Ceuta to house German troops; only recently built workers' residences were seen in the area. Furthermore, the commander of the Spanish fortress in the port of Melilla declared to the British captain that the port and its hinterland were not prepared to receive German troops. All the Germans at the airfield there were engaged in aviation affairs, and their numbers changed daily, making it impossible to determine. Generally, there were a total of 150 Germans, but the Melilla port authorities did not allow the British captain to visit the airfield and did not explain the reason. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)

### Japanese Side Convenes North China Economic Development Conference in Tianjin

Military, South Manchuria Railway, and Consulate Personnel Participate. Decide on New Budget, Organize Tanggu Port Construction, etc.

Tianjin Correspondence: The North China Economic Development Conference, convened in Tianjin by the Japanese Garrison in North China, the Tianjin Consulate General, the Tianjin branch of the Xingzhong Corporation, and the Industry Department of the South Manchuria Railway Company, opened on January 25th at the Japanese military headquarters in Haiguang Temple. Attending were South Manchuria Railway Company Director and Industry Department Head Sakatani, along with Deputy Director Okumura, Seira, General Affairs Section Chief Oshikawa, Commerce and Industry Director Momma, East Asia Section Chief Miyamoto, Secretary Nakajima, Participating Official Tadokoro, and over 20 investigators. South Manchuria Railway's Beijing Office Representative Aruga Renkichi also rushed to attend. At 9:00 AM that morning, they gathered at the Japanese military headquarters in Haiguang Temple to hold a meeting. The military participants included Chief of Staff Hashimoto, Senior Staff Officer and First Section Chief Iida, Second/Third Section Chiefs Wachi and Ikeda, Economic Advisor Department Head Lieutenant Colonel Nagamine, Staff Officers Tsukada and Asai, and over ten related military personnel. The consulate participants included Commercial Consul Hagiwara and Vice Consul Nagai. South Manchuria Railway's Tianjin and Beijing Office Representatives Aruga and Nonaka, and Xingzhong Corporation Representatives Hirayama and Kiyono, attended, totaling over 40 attendees. Presided over by Hashimoto, the conference discussed the North China economic development plan created last year, broadly divided into: 1. The current situation of the Chinese political situation after the Xi'an Incident and its economic impact; 2. Recent trends in the Hebei-Chahar Political Council; 3. The current status of North China's economic development; 4. The South Manchuria Railway's five-year industrial development plan; 5. Trends in rural cooperative enterprises; 6. Methods for implementing coal chemical liquefaction; 7. Issues concerning North China's railway, mining, and water conservancy development; 8. Exploration of cotton cultivation and raw cotton export. During the meeting, each participant expressed their opinions as much as possible on behalf of their respective organizations. The meeting broke for lunch at noon and resumed at 2:00 PM, adjourning at 8:00 PM. Tashiro then hosted a banquet at his official residence. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, the meeting continued at the same location, focusing on practical current work issues, thoroughly discussing them based on the results of the 25th meeting, and adjourning at noon. This meeting is extremely important in relation to North China's economic development. Since the military and Xingzhong Corporation had disagreements, refusing Xingzhong's direct investment in North China, and the South Manchuria Railway, which is closely linked to Xingzhong, insisted on opposing the military at all times, discussions about North China's economic problems have suddenly cooled since last October. The reason for this is that the domestic military has recently become more active in its policy on economic development in North China, and has made every effort to resolve the opinions between the Tianjin military and the South Manchuria Railway and reconcile them. Therefore, after both sides discussed via letters and telegrams, exchanged opinions, and reached a consensus, this gathering was held in Tianjin. After this round of discussions, North China's economic development issues will shift from silence to noise, and the implementation of various current matters is likely to begin. According to Nonaka Tokio, the Investigation Section Chief of the South Manchuria Railway's Tianjin office, the content of the two-day meeting was due to the fact that both China and Japan had previously created a plan for developing North China's economy last year. Subsequently, due to disagreements, the budget was too large, making it difficult to implement practically. Furthermore, although the Hebei-Chahar authorities provided assistance, there were many difficulties, making it impossible to fully implement. Currently, the military, consulate, and South Manchuria Railway believe that it is necessary to reconvene to discuss various matters to be organized. Therefore, a meeting was convened to discuss and revise the budget for matters such as: 1. Tanggu port construction; 2. Construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway; 3. Opening of the Longyan Iron Mine. They will try to reduce the budget and re-evaluate separately. Once the funds are concentrated, they will be handled sequentially. In addition, the major gain is that the military and the South Manchuria Railway have reached a consensus.

At 3:00 PM on the 26th, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beijing-Liaoning Railway Bureau, visited Commander Tashiro at his official residence in Zhangyuan. During the talks, they discussed the current situation, diplomacy, and economic cooperation. The restoration of the Longyan Iron Mine, the commencement of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway, the export of raw cotton, and cotton production improvements were all discussed. Tashiro expressed the intent of this Tianjin meeting to Song, stating that the authorities have decided to carry out cooperation based on the principle of mutual benefit for existing projects.

The situation has been reported in detail. As of the 24th, a total of 284 bodies of passengers who died in the accident had been recovered. The deceased were trapped inside the ship's cabins for two days and nights, so when they were retrieved, all the bodies were swollen and deformed, and some had seven orifices bleeding. A crane was used to lift the sunken ship, and after a day, half of the ship's body was pulled out of the water on the 22nd. Sixty-seven bodies were found on the top floor. On the 23rd, the entire ship was floated to the surface, and a total of 268 bodies were found in the public cabins and dining rooms, including 135 male bodies and 133 female bodies. Most of the deceased were from the Siyi region. Those with relatives in the county and rural areas were transported to Jiangmen to facilitate identification by relatives nearby. Therefore, on the 24th, 151 bodies were first transported to Jiangmen, and several dozen were taken by the families of the deceased near Ganzhutan. The remaining 110 bodies were transported back to Guangzhou by boat on the 24th, arriving at the provincial river around 10:00 PM. They were docked in front of the Haitong Temple pier in Henan, and then transported to the Yuxi Fangbian Hospital Gaogang for placement by freight trucks. When the bodies were brought ashore, dozens of relatives of the deceased were waiting. Six bodies were immediately taken away, and the remaining 107 bodies were sent to the open space in Gaogang, numbered for identification. On the 25th, hundreds of relatives of the deceased arrived at Gaogang in front of Fangbian Hospital, searching for bodies with tears in their eyes. Those who had been identified were prepared for burial by their families. On that day, a total of seven male bodies and thirteen female bodies were claimed, with more than ninety bodies remaining to be identified. If the deadline of the 26th is exceeded, the bodies will be hastily buried by Fangbian Hospital in the Julonggang cemetery. This ship suffered a tragic sinking, drowning over 280 passengers. The disaster was serious, and the Navigation Administration and the Provincial Party Department both sent personnel to investigate the situation and the incident. Local people are painfully determined to advocate for the bombing of the shoal rocks to ensure a permanent solution and to seek welfare for navigation. Yesterday, the Xinhui County Chamber of Commerce representative Mr. Lu, the citizen representative Mr. Zhao, and more than ten organizations such as the Xinhui County Party Department and the County Farmers' Association sent a telegram to the authorities requesting the bombing of the shoal to benefit navigation. After receiving the telegram, the Water Conservancy Bureau plans to first send a surveying team of Chinese and Western engineers to conduct an on-site survey of Ganzhutan, formulate a plan to bomb the shoal rocks, and submit it to the Central Hydraulic Engineering Testing Institute to send personnel for re-measurement. The estimated labor cost is 100,000 yuan. This unprecedented tragedy has left many relatives of the victims without support, affecting their lives. It is reported that they have united to appeal to the authorities to provide generous compensation to comfort the wronged souls and resettle the orphans and widows of the victims. (January 26th)

### Apprentice at Jiading Hardware Factory Dies Tragically

The Southwest City Hardware Cooperative Factory, opened by the Xueyuan owner Hu Quewen brothers, had a flywheel belt fall off on the 27th afternoon. Apprentice Zhou Yunsheng went up the ladder to install it, and his clothes were caught by a screw, causing him to be pulled into the machine. Instantly, both feet were crushed, and his back of the head split open. He screamed in pain, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. He died instantly, a tragic sight. The deceased was a Jiancheng resident and had been studying at the factory for more than a year. After his death, the county government was notified for an inquest. The factory provided a coffin for burial and gave condolences to the family.

### Wuxi Police District Officially Established

Wuxi County Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Da was ordered to handle the police district system and has been working on it for more than five months. After hard work, various plans have been gradually realized, and the branch chiefs of the urban area have separately delineated the police districts within their respective jurisdictions, totaling more than 210 locations. Student police were assigned to be responsible for investigating the population of Jincheng. Bureau Chief Zhang has also summoned the branch chiefs to conduct detailed investigations and personally inspect the police districts of each bureau, making appropriate additions and deletions. It was decided to officially establish them at the beginning of next month. However, due to the insufficient allocation of student police in each district, the branch bureaus have also been ordered to select special police officers and police sergeants with excellent academics to send to the bureau today for examination, selecting the best to be promoted as student police in the police district.

Investigate Laborers' Lives

The Ministry of Industry believes that the hardships of laborers' lives are greatly related to national health and work efficiency. The labor disputes that arise are especially sufficient to affect social peace and enterprise development. Therefore, it has long taken the improvement of workers' lives and the promotion of labor-management coordination as key policy guidelines. Recently, in order to achieve these two tasks, it has specially dispatched personnel to conduct on-site investigations of laborers' wages, actual income, and living conditions in cities and counties with developed industries. It has now decided to start investigations in seven locations, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuxi. The provincial government was consulted to instruct the county to conduct the investigations. After receiving the order, Wuxi County Magistrate Long ordered the Construction and Investigation Bureau to fill out the worker wage registration forms and worker wage tables and submit statistics. The bureau has already selected eight factories that comply with the Factory Law among the various factories, including Shenxin Textile Factory, Lixin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Gengyu Cloth Factory, Maoxin Flour Factory, Hengde Oil Factory, Zhonghua Socks Factory, Huaxin Silk Factory, and Gongyi Machinery Factory, to investigate and fill out the forms completely from January and submit them to the bureau for reporting.

### Nanhui Arrests Suspected Thieves

The Nanhui County Public Security Bureau Detective Team recently received a secret report stating that Fu Yansheng and others from the Fu Family Residence in Liuzhao East were suspected of being involved in the cotton robbery case of the Shi Genbao ship at the Guandi Temple in Situan Cangbei last month. Team Leader Wu Jiafu ordered all detectives and police officers to rush to the location late in the night two days ago and immediately arrested Fu Yansheng, Fu Jinming, Fu Yinmei, and Zhu Miaosheng. They also took away multiple pieces of clothing and cloth from Fu Yinmei's home and escorted them to the county for interrogation. It is heard that Zhu Miaosheng is a migrant, and Fu Yansheng and others are all long-term residents who are usually quite peaceful. Fu Yinmei is especially known as an ignorant rural woman. The sudden arrest has surprised all the villagers, who have jointly submitted a statement to prove their innocence and avoid false accusations.

### Changzhou County Chamber of Commerce Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting

The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the afternoon of the 17th. After Chairman Jiang Weixian reported, then, Diao Chabingchu and Yang Zhiyou reported on their experience of attending the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Income Tax Research Association in Shanghai. Next, various cases were discussed. ㊀ A letter from the Jiangsu Income Tax Office requested that it be ordered to comply with the implementation details of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations promulgated by the Ministry, which was submitted for discussion. It was resolved to extract the provisions and notify each industry on one hand, and on the other hand, according to Article 47 of the implementation details, to request the office to issue various forms, books, records, and receipt formats for compliance. ㊁ The Ministry of Finance ordered that the names and addresses of businesses that do not have banks and money shops but also accept deposits be investigated in detail and reported. It was resolved to notify each business to report within the time limit for verification and transmission. ㊂ The Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce requested assistance in establishing a local grain storage program and revising the business tax ratio.

### Wealthy Household in Changshu Liantang Suffers Robbery

The Yao Zugen family in Yaojiazhai, bordering Wengjiazhuang in Liantang County, is quite wealthy. On the night before yesterday, four robbers suddenly arrived, using iron chisels to pry open the gate, holding fake guns and kitchen knives. Speaking in a local dialect, they entered the house, immediately dragged out the homeowner, tied him up, and then robbed him. They left after about half an hour. Upon inspection, it was estimated that the loss was 990 yuan in legal tender and clothes. The next day, the police were asked to investigate.

### Danyang Soldiers Attempt Robbery, Arrested

Wang Kaidong and Chen Deming from Shandong served in the army in their early years. Now, because they had deserted, Wang and others carried a pistol with eight bullets the day before yesterday. They traveled from Liyang along the automobile road to Jintan, where they met Chen Er, a native of Huangtang Township. They stayed overnight in a dilapidated house next to the Zhongzheng Bridge in Jintan. The next morning, they went to Huangtang Town together, and Chen Er instructed them, agreeing to rob the Shuang Fuzi family nearby late at night. In the evening, they temporarily slept in the nearby reeds. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by a passerby, who found their actions suspicious and gathered many people to arrest them together. The pistol and bullets were handed over to the township security regiment. The town chief prepared a document and escorted them to the county government for legal action. After Liu Cheng, the judge, opened the court, the criminals confessed directly and were ordered to be detained pending review.

### The Eastern Wind and Rain…The Northern Clouds and Mountains (Part Two)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Mingxin

Having completed our journey to Luoyang and with matters requiring a northern expedition, and wishing to avoid Zhengzhou again, we crossed from Tongguan at Fenglingdu into Shanxi Province. What was spoken of above concerns the wind and rain of the two mausoleums; what is recorded below concerns the clouds and mountains of the three Jin states. Leaving behind the chaos of war in Luoyang, we entered the peaceful and prosperous land of Shanxi. A single crossing of the Yellow River brought about a change in scenery, and our feelings were stirred.

Fenglingdu is located at the west gate of Tongguan, with the border of Shanxi on the opposite bank. It is also the endpoint of the Datong-Puzhou Railway. There are boats at the ferry that can carry heavy loads several times a day. The reporter crossed the river at 4 p.m. The river is not wide, but there are breaks in the water, making the boat journey circuitous and time-consuming. The north bank was also a rising tide flat, requiring us to wade. A single ox cart reached the shore from the boat, making travel through the muddy ground particularly inconvenient. Fortunately, the foundation for the railway bridge is already laid, and in a few months, the bridge will be passable, eliminating the need for boats. The Datong-Puzhou Railway is a narrow-gauge railway built by Shanxi Province itself, costing the least amount of money and achieving the most significant success. The engineering is extremely simple, but in these times of impoverished people and depleted resources, the convenience of transportation is sufficient. There is no need to pursue further extravagance. Passenger cars are all third class. From the ferry to Taiyuan, it is over 500 kilometers, a journey of 24 hours, with a fare of only 8.75 yuan. The car is exceptionally clean, and the attendants are also well-trained. However, the long journey makes it difficult to sleep, and one feels the weariness of the journey. The train departs at 7 p.m., climbing up the mountain with back-and-forth pulling and pushing, similar to the old system on the Ping-Sui Railway's Nankou section. Along the way, from southern Shanxi to the heartland, there are many famous cities and prosperous areas. Places passed such as Jiexiu and Taigu are where ticket shops and merchants are concentrated. The city walls are also grand and beautiful. The Lingishi area is rich in coal deposits. Hongdong is the former site of Yu Tangchun (a famous Chinese opera character), well-known to those who love theater, and sufficient to inspire fine sentiment. The land in southern Shanxi is fertile, and every family is well-provided for. Having not experienced war for a hundred years, they have been able to fully cultivate and prosper. With joyous and contented faces, the elderly and children alike enjoy the pleasure of being full and satisfied. Many of the passengers on the train are local merchants traveling. People from other provinces coming to the provincial capital mostly take the Zhengtai Railway, rarely traveling north from the ferry. The education and political figures encountered in the train are mostly those receiving training in the provincial capital. They all appear energetic and talk about border affairs, sometimes with passionate outbursts. They also know that government affairs in various places are extremely well-organized. Yan Xishan's governance of Shanxi encourages diligence, prudence, loyalty, and responsibility. He not only promotes government affairs but also focuses on the training of the people of the province. The train arrives at the provincial capital at 7 a.m. the next day. From afar, one can see the large building of the provincial cigarette company. Northern Shanxi produces wild tobacco leaves, and even cigarettes made from them are quite fragrant. Shanxi prioritizes using products from the province, and many supplies are manufactured within the province. This is in the category of consumption, and it is appropriate that they are self-sufficient. The Zhengtai Railway station is at the south gate, while the Datong-Puzhou Railway is at the east gate. There are police officers asking questions, but they are very polite and do not cause any trouble. I took a rickshaw into the city and checked into a hotel. The newly built Datong-Puzhou Railway Hotel is still under construction and will soon be completed, demonstrating the progress of the railway's management. After arriving at the hotel and washing away some of the dust from the journey, I heard the air raid drill siren. A city-wide blackout was implemented, and all security forces were mobilized. In the silence, I spoke privately with the attendant (speaking loudly was prohibited, also one of the drill's rules) and asked for his thoughts. The attendant said that the drills have been conducted more than once, and the people understand them. Although it is a test, everyone gains knowledge to prepare for any eventuality, which is a good thing. Soon after, I saw enemy planes approaching in the sky, circling overhead. The airport outside the north gate is equipped with searchlights, and anti-aircraft defense efforts were also mobilized. I also learned that during the drills, one-tenth of the personnel from the pacification headquarters and various departments remained on duty, three-tenths of the young staff went to temporary offices outside the city, and five-tenths were responsible for fire prevention and rescue. The entire process took about half an hour and was well-ordered. Yan Xishan even specially invited representatives from various counties and sectors to the province to observe, in preparation for similar exercises in various places.

The same day was the opening day for the training of county and district chiefs. Yan Xishan and Zhao Dai also attended and delivered speeches, emphasizing the need for a total mobilization of the people in the extraordinary period of national defense. District and county chiefs are the closest to the people and should first seek to facilitate the implementation of policies to achieve the effectiveness of total mobilization. The next day (the 21st) was designated as Public Servants' Responsibility Day. Yan Xishan and Zhao Dai convened a large meeting with parades and speeches. Yan Xishan has specific regulations for the evaluation of civil servants, with the "Shanxi-Suiyuan Civil Servants' Misconduct Law" having been approved by the central government last year on this day. This meeting was held on its anniversary to encourage self-reflection and promote awareness. The main tenets included: "Truly take responsibility for oneself and be a modern person" and "Absolutely do not allow people to avoid responsibility, take responsibility for oneself and be a good subordinate; force people to take responsibility and be a good superior." At the same time, citizens were required to raise the national flag in the morning. Citizens were divided into groups, and in the early morning, gongs were sounded on each street to summon them to assembly points for ceremonies and instructions. Yan Xishan has governed Shanxi for twenty-five years, setting a national example for integrity in internal affairs. With the current national crisis, the integrity of officials is even more important, so he spares no words to achieve results. For example, among the personnel appointments and removals by the provincial government, a technician from Qin County was suspended for one year due to the excessive death of sheep at the Construction Bureau, and the county magistrate of Taigu County was suspended for two years for falsely reporting tree planting. All these trivial matters were punished, and the speed and thoroughness of enforcement can be imagined. As for the cleanliness of the streets, the dedication of the police, the diligence of the people, and other virtues, all can be seen at a glance, without the need for interviews.

The provincial capital of Taiyuan occupies a vast area, and the city is very prosperous. The six or seven main streets are lined with shops. The northeast part of the city is mostly the private residences of local officials and gentry. The walls are thick and strong, and the pavilions are magnificent. Everything is set up to instill morals into the residents. As such, people are encouraged to go to bed early and rise early. After 10 p.m., there are few pedestrians on the main streets, and around 8 a.m., most shops open their doors. Military personnel and students are constantly training, and Yan Xishan pays particular attention to finance and economics, which are the foundation of modern nation-building. The promoted "local product exchange vouchers" have been implemented throughout the markets. Yan Xishan has a unique perspective on economic policy, believing that bartering goods and not recognizing the intrinsic value of gold and silver can promote production, increase national power, avoid financial crises, and break down the inequality between rich and poor. He has written extensively on this subject, with comprehensive references. As a result, local product exchange vouchers were issued. His original intention was only to use them as a price marker for goods, not to give the medium itself any value. In other words, it was to make it a receipt for bartering goods. However, as a result, although the province promotes provincial products, it cannot do without the import of foreign goods. Also, it is difficult to pay for labor with goods. Therefore, this receipt, in effect, is the same as the inconvertible paper money issued by the provincial treasury (the vouchers are backed by the provincial material reserves, and many of Shanxi's current industries are publicly owned, with products going to the provincial treasury, effectively implementing a control system to promote production). When the province is financially strong, issuing another type of paper money is not a problem. Moreover, within the province, it can reduce outflows, which is also a way to store wealth. However, considering the overall national economy and whether the export of provincial goods to the import of foreign goods results in a trade surplus or deficit, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of this policy without longer-term testing.

The most eye-catching event in this week's football is the second trial match of the Interport Western League.

### First Match of Xiqing General Division Championship: Muir Defeats Yuezhong

Yuezhong Dominated in the First Half, But Muir Came Back to Win. Score: 27 to 23. Second Match Tomorrow Night.

Muir and Yuezhong, the champions of the A and B divisions of the Xiqing General Division, met yesterday in the first match of the General Championship Week. Both teams were evenly matched, but their caution led to missed opportunities. After the jump ball, Muir's Shen Hanjun scored first, taking less than three seconds, showing great momentum. However, excessive caution led to inaccurate shots, while Yuezhong's Zhou Wenrong scored after Liu Zihui and Zhou Yaokang followed up, taking a 6-2 lead. From then on, they went with the flow and maintained the lead. Soon, Muir's Hua Yulin scored, and Yuezhong's Shen Jian continued with a free throw. Muir's Dong Yangfeng scored, closing the gap to 6-7. But soon, Yuezhong's Zhou Wenrong scored again, ending the first quarter with Yuezhong leading. The second quarter was very even, but both sides committed many fouls due to overexcitement. Yuezhong's Liu Zihui shot from afar, and Zhou Yaokang scored on a free throw, making the score 12-6, with Muir lagging behind by half. Muir's Huang Cunhou and Shen Hanjun scored twice, making the score 10-12, closing the gap again. Afterwards, the difference was only one point from 12-14, 13-15, to 15-17, with Yuezhong still leading. Then Yuezhong's Zhou Yaokang scored another free throw, ending the first half with 18-15, with Yuezhong still leading by three points. After the break, Muir's momentum increased. Hua Yulin and Dong Yangfeng took advantage of opportunities from both sides, increasing their score by seven points in one go, while Yuezhong missed several shots. By the end of this quarter, Yuezhong had scored nothing, while Muir had taken the lead 22-18. From then on, Muir led the way to the end of the match. In the final quarter, Muir's Dong Yangfeng scored first, while Yuezhong's Zhou Wenrong assisted under the basket. Then, after Muir's Hua Yulin scored on a free throw, Yuezhong's Shen Ji scored one move and one free throw, making the score 23-25, increasing the tension. But Muir's defense was tight, making it difficult for Yuezhong's players to get close to the basket. Yuezhong was also eager to win, and Shen Ji was penalized four times in a row and was sent off, becoming even more dejected. Zhou Yaokang had a rare opportunity under the basket, but missed slightly, further decreasing morale. After Yuezhong substituted Zhou Wenrui, there was little improvement. Muir's Dong Yangfeng scored again, and the final whistle blew, with Muir winning 27-23. The second match is scheduled for tomorrow night (Saturday). Muir only needs to win once more to win the championship, while Yuezhong needs to win twice to claim the title. The match time has been changed to 8:15 p.m. (originally scheduled for 6 p.m.).

### Ministry of Education Cables Qin Dechun to Punish Northeast University Severely

Suspends Funding to the School... Orders Zang Qifang to Return to Nanjing

(Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education, due to the fact that reactionary elements control Northeast University and refuse to accept reorganization, has not only cabled Zang Qifang to return to Nanjing, but also cabled Qin Dechun, Mayor of Beiping, stating: Mayor Qin, please note: Northeast University is manipulated by reactionary elements. The Ministry, out of concern for the youth of the Northeast, sent Zang Qifang and Lei Fa to reorganize the university, but Zhou Jingwen and others refused to accept the reorganization and led reactionary elements in expelling more than a hundred good students. These illegal and violent acts are truly regrettable. The Ministry has been extremely patient, hoping that they would deeply reflect on their actions and achieve a peaceful resolution, avoiding further complications. Now that the reorganization is difficult, the Ministry cannot but impose necessary sanctions on the school's deplorable situation. The Ministry has decided to suspend funding to the school and reject its illegal administration. It will separately seek appropriate relief for the teaching of the school's honest teachers and the studies of its good students. Besides informing Acting Principal Zang Qifang and instructing him to return to Nanjing to handle relief efforts, please inform Chairman Song and instruct Director Lei to assist. Ministry of Education.

### Japanese Army Military Academy Changes Teaching Methods for Chinese Students

(Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency) According to reports from a certain military agency, the attitude of the Japanese Army Military Academy towards Chinese students has worsened since the January 28th Incident. Before the January 28th Incident, all students entering the academy had to undergo a four-month internship in local regiments. This four-month practical experience had a great impact on Chinese students, and they could gain a general understanding of the military situation. After the January 28th Incident, the regiment internship was discontinued. Recently, Chinese students were all moved to the old site of the Army Ordnance School, completely separated from the Military Academy. This is nothing more than a lack of sincerity on the part of the Japanese authorities in educating Chinese students. Students studying at the Military Academy will no longer gain anything in the future.

The Palace Museum has already started the selection process, and Mr. Ma Heng is also in contact with the Exhibition Hall and has gone to Beiping. As for individual exhibits, it was originally scheduled that educational departments in various provinces and cities would collect them and send them to the committee by the end of February. The second meeting of the Standing Committee, in order to be thorough, has sent letters to the local preparatory committees to assist the local educational departments in the collection. It is expected that more people will respond enthusiastically. As for the method of specially invited works, this year it will not be adopted, as decided by the preparatory committee. Regarding the aspect of exhibits, at the national art exhibitions held in England and France, having a work exhibited is the highest honor. The situation in our country is the same. We sincerely hope that domestic artists will contribute their best works and participate enthusiastically in this grand event.

### Educational Film Association to Continue Educational Film Teaching in Spring

Fee of Ten Yuan Collected from Each School

To promote educational film teaching, the Chinese Educational Film Association has specially selected teaching films in biology, physics, and chemistry suitable for middle school students to watch. In the spring and autumn of the 25th year, these films will be shown in middle schools along the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Beijing-Jiaozuo-Huainan lines in stages. Each school only needs to pay a fee of ten yuan per season. Schools are enthusiastically adopting this program. A total of thirty-two schools in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Hefei, and other places are participating. The results of the screenings have been well-received by the schools. It is reported that the association's expenses for promoting educational films, including the salaries and travel expenses of the screening personnel, as well as the repair of machinery, the replacement of light bulbs, and film rental fees, exceed ten yuan. The income from the screening fees is limited, resulting in significant losses. The association continues to work hard to promote educational film teaching. As the spring semester begins, it is continuing to organize screenings and has sent letters to various schools for consultation. The following are the points to note for schools that adopt the association's spring educational film program:

㊀ Educational films are divided into three subjects: biology, physics, and chemistry.

Each student should not watch films from all three subjects continuously. Students studying biology this semester should watch biology films when they are shown, and the same applies to chemistry and physics films. ㊂ The association will send the instruction manuals for each subject's films to the schools in advance. Teachers from each school will be responsible for explaining the films along with the screening. If necessary, the association's screening personnel can also assist in the explanation. ㊃ The fee for spring educational films is ten yuan per school. ㊄ The screening schedule for each school will be pre-arranged by the association and notified in advance. Schools must not make any changes to avoid delaying the screening period for other schools. ㊅ Schools must provide black cloth curtains for the screening venue. The association will provide the screen, projector, and other equipment.

### First-Class Pistol Shooting Situation Tense, Zhang Yingda Wins the Final

Yesterday, he defeated Qu Shimu with 1,000 points to 793. Today, Zhu Qiliang and Wu Chengxiang Will Compete for the Final Spot.

Zhang Yingda, a giant in Chinese pistol shooting, defeated Qu Shimu with a total of 1,000 points to 793 in two matches yesterday, winning the right to the finals of the Shanghai Amateur First-Class Pistol Shooting Championship. Today at 5:30 PM and 9:00 PM, Zhu Qiliang and left-handed general Wu Chengxiang will compete for the final spot in the Amateur Association at No. 88 Nanjing Road. From now on, this year's first-class championship has been grasped by the Chinese.

Zhang Yingda's skills are known for their fluency. Every shot he fires is a masterpiece. His performance in the first match yesterday was particularly good. The highest shot of 66 points that day was made at that time. In the middle of the second match, he was once hindered from advancing. Fortunately, the winning score was more than 200 points. Although it was slightly reduced, it still did not affect his future, and he finally won the final spot and returned. Qu Shimu is one of the best players in the British pistol shooting world. Judging from his steady progress in the second match, he is also a dangerous figure. Unfortunately, he had too many setbacks in the first match. Although he had the ambition to reverse his misfortune, he was ultimately unable to do so. In addition to Zhang's full performance of his all-around skills, the precision of several shots was indeed beyond the reach of ordinary people. Li Gongying is not in Shanghai, and Medina has been eliminated. In the first-class competition in the future, there will be few who can match him.

Zhang's record was excellent in the first match, exceeding 20 points eight times, while Qu Shimu only had two times. The situation can be imagined. At the end of the first match, Qu Shimu had 232, and Zhang had 480 at the last shot. At the beginning of the second match, Zhang still maintained a superior position. The largest distance was more than 240 points. Qu Shimu made several large numbers, and the difference was slightly closer. In the end, both of them had good performances. As a result, Zhang won by 207 points, with a score of 1,000 points to 793. Zhang Yingda (first match) 24•66•25•24•33•34•33•27• (second match) 36•48•21•20•35•34•55•31•34•

Qu Shimu (first match) 24•21•32•20•56•20•27•52•34•20•41•

### Yarn and Cotton

Cotton Yarn Surge Re-ignites

Indian Merchants Continue to Pull Up, Three Products Also Rise High Many Parties See Excitement, February Up Two Yuan and Six

The yarn market is trending strong, and the surge has re-ignited. Moreover, the February rise is even stronger, because Indian merchants are pulling up the market and are not willing to let go. At the same time, three kinds of yarn and cotton have turned to higher prices, and market sentiment is even more excited. However, the current yarn business has not developed. Sellers among the industry have not stopped dumping. Also, because the settlement procedures for this month will be handled the next day, the market is closed for one day. Speculators, seeing the poor environment, painfully close out their positions, and the market is moving further.

Spot Yarn Retailers Are Also Eager to Cover Short Positions In the spot yarn pre-market, all months rose uniformly, because the overseas yarn and cotton markets rose together, and people's hearts are particularly firm. In addition, Indian merchants are waiting for the February period to squeeze the market, so the momentum is even stronger. However, spot yarn trading is not strong, and the industry's thinking is inclined to selling. As a result, spot yarn prices for each month rose by 6.8 cents to 1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon pre-market, the February market suddenly became tense, and the rising power was strong, because the big players waited and did not move on the next day's settlement suspension of the market for this month, and retailers were eager to cover short positions, so the market moved forward. As a result, February rose by 1 yuan and 6 cents compared with the closing price in the morning, and the far month rose by 9 cents to 1 yuan and 1 cent. It was found that 1,000 bales of Yuda were sold, 800 bales of Dafeng, 2,050 bales of Mingde, 600 bales of Changyu, 3,450 bales of Changfeng, 1,700 bales of Ruida, 750 bales of Taichang, 1,100 bales of Dachang, 850 bales of Jinchang were bought, 700 bales of Zhenda, 700 bales of Shenji, 2,250 bales of Renfeng, 700 bales of Taichang, 1,500 bales of Runkang, 400 bales of Yuda, 400 bales of Juxing, 450 bales of Yichang.

The Cotton Futures Market Changed Very Little

The Impact of the Flood on American Cotton Was Slightly Stimulated

The cotton market is also firm, and the rising wind has slightly risen. Because American cotton has been severely affected by the flood, and the cotton fields in the Mississippi River are at risk, the market price has an upward trend. Therefore, people's hearts have been stimulated by it. However, spot cotton consumption is stagnant.

Market Transactions are Very Few In the spot cotton pre-market, each month rose slightly. Because American cotton and Indian cotton have risen together, and Osaka Three Products also rose by 7.8 cents, people's hearts have been slightly shaken. However, market transactions are very few, and market prices have not changed significantly. As a result, spot cotton prices for each month rose by 5 cents to 1.5 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon pre-market, the market was slightly flat, because the yarn market continued to be good, and there was bullish news about American cotton, but buying interest was still scattered. As a result, February was the same as the closing price in the morning, and the rest rose by 5 cents. It was found that 2,000 dan of Dafu were sold, 1,500 dan of Changfeng, 5,500 dan of Dachang, 900 dan of Dachangcheng, 900 dan of Senkang, 800 dan of Tongji were bought, 800 dan of Jinchang, 700 dan of Wang Taixing, 800 dan of Changhe, 1,700 dan of Hexing, and 1,100 dan of Renfeng.

Trade in cash within one week. Because of the Lunar New Year, it is customary to open up for six weeks of cash delivery. Among the industry, because the market in the coming spring is ordinary, although the asking price for this period is extended, it is still mostly suppressed and rarely raised.

The asking price of Taixi Satin per yard was flat with the previous adjustment.

Wool Fabric Transactions are Only Sporadic

Yesterday, wool fabric transactions were only slight on this street. Clothing shops, after customers specified, still made sporadic embellishments. Although the Chuansha gang has recently moved, it is because the limit price is too harsh, and the attitude of the holders is firm, so very few people actually装办装办. Women's colored woolen cloth is less than men's colored woolen cloth, and actual sales are even more stagnant, so the market has greatly reduced. Although the sales of raincoat cloth are钟钟, but there is a lack of inventory, so the standard is still firm. 4026 is sold at 6 yuan per plate. National Product Zhanghua Dalong Plain Serge, yesterday all increased in price. The Zhanghua 918, which was sold for 1 yuan and 8 and a half corners in the past, is now sold for 1 yuan and 2 corners.

Good Results for January Public Bond Futures

This was an increase compared to previous months. On the receiving side, banks and retail arbitrageurs accounted for the majority. The largest delivery volume came from No. 47. The market conditions began on November 26th, when trading opened strongly and the upward trend was strong. Later, due to the deteriorating situation in Suiyuan, major investors started to sell off, leading to a sharp decline. No. 47 and No. 43, on behalf of a certain financial institution, vigorously sold off, creating a weak trend. However, market sentiment remained firm. On December 14th, the Xi'an Incident caused a great disturbance. All unified bonds fell sharply and trading was suspended, with black market prices falling by one or two yuan. Later, with the efforts of the banking community, the market gradually recovered. On the 26th, news of General Chiang's safe return to Luoyang was received, greatly reassuring the public and the market price rebounded sharply, restoring the bond market to normal. After the New Year holiday in 1937, buyers and sellers maintained their positions, causing market fluctuations. Although the Xi'an Incident still had lingering effects, it was no longer significant. On the 24th, the last day, due to strong market sentiment, the demand for deliveries was strong, leading to a severe short squeeze. With the exception of Class A bonds, all bonds reached new highs. The high-low difference during the process was about seven or eight yuan. For future public debt repayments, due to the upcoming Spring Festival holiday and the high market price, there may be a period of fluctuation. The total transaction volume was 24,082,500 yuan. The settlement and composition figures are listed in the table below (unit: 100 yuan).

### Dried and Fresh Goods

Xiamen Tangerine Peel Drops Another Five Cents

Since the new crop of Xiamen tangerine peel came out, the amount of goods arriving has been small, but demand has been very weak. Only scattered transactions have occurred in the northern route, so the trend has been difficult to revive. Yesterday, it was heard that the dealers were starting to sell off some goods, which were still red, bright, soft, and glutinous, at a price five cents lower than before. It is unlikely that the market price will change again before the large-scale settlement.

### Silk and Tea

Since last month, the rapid progress of English steel plates has been surprising. Prices have risen from ten yuan to as high as eighteen yuan. Later, due to the high prices, the Qingdao group suspended sales again, and other groups also reduced orders. However, the small number of goods arriving allowed the standard to hold its ground. According to industry sources, overseas prices are already between thirteen and sixteen pounds.

### Grains

Tianjin Group's Absorption of Spot Flour Leads to Sudden Price Increase

After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the prices for each month initially fell, then rebounded. According to the price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by four, six, and seven points, Canada fell by seven and eight points, and Liverpool fell by one penny. Therefore, at the opening, sentiment for each month was depressed. The current month fell as low as 8.88 yuan, and April also fell by one or two points. However, after that, market sentiment rebounded, because the bulls did not sell off and the Tianjin group had some spot business, so buying interest was stronger. The near-term rose by two or three points, and the distant-term remained stable. When the afternoon market opened, the current month was boosted by customer demand, and March and April were boosted by dealers covering short positions, so market sentiment was quite good. However, with the settlement date approaching, trading was limited. This kind of abnormal development may not last long.

Highest, Lowest, Yesterday's Closing Price Compared: February 3.9375, 3.8800, 3.9375, up 0.0003; March 3.9975, 3.9600, 3.9975, up 0.0005; April 4.0175, 3.9900, 4.075, up 0.0075.

Old Wheat Prices Rise After Settlement

Yesterday's futures wheat market showed an initial flat, then rising trend in the morning. When prices opened, they were flat, similar to the previous day, because the price of foreign wheat fell by six, seven, and eight points, and one penny. However, at the second session, because the flour market rebounded and the Japanese month was settled, it was heard that more than 100 cars of wheat were received, half of which were received by Tianjin factories and half of which were said to be sold to local factories. Because the cost of transporting southern wheat to the north was quite high, and after arriving at the destination, it cost an additional 0.3 yuan per yuan to transport it to the receiving factory, which was not cost-effective. However, the large number of settlements did not strengthen market sentiment, so it remained stable and then rose. When the afternoon market opened, the old wheat market remained stable, and the June prices remained flat. As a result, the near-term rose by seven cents to one dime, and the new wheat rose by one cent. As for the spot wheat market, because factories did not want it and the spot wheat price was displayed as standard, most of it was sold on the exchange. Only scattered transactions were made in the market.

Highest, Lowest, Yesterday's Closing Price Compared: February 6.40, 6.32, 6.43, up 0.09; April 6.58, 6.47, 6.57, up 0.10; June 6.59, 6.50, 6.58, up 0.07; June 5.30, 5.27, 5.30, up 0.01.

River Rice Market Continues to Show Improvement

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 shipments from various groups, totaling more than 9,000 piculs. Thin rice accounted for nearly 20 shipments. Sales on this street were still active. The Qingdao, Yantai, and other groups also handled 3,400-3,500 packages of thin rice, so the market continued to improve. The price of thin rice increased by 10 cents, and the price of thick japonica increased by 15 cents. The Du Yang pointed rice was tight and fluctuated. The price of Yin Bian Yuan remained flat.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived from various ports along the river. Sales of various types of rice in the market were average. The price of white japonica rice increased by a few cents to one dime, early rice closely followed, up seven or eight cents, thin rice was expensive, up three to five cents, the price of white yuan rice increased by about 10 cents, and the price of Yang Du pointed rice was tight by a few cents. The Rong tip also showed a tight trend. The prices of all other goods were stable.

Guest Xian Rice Stores Arrive in Large Quantities

Yesterday, the shipments of Guest Xian rice continued to arrive from various ports along the Yangtze River, but sales in Guangdong remained sluggish. Yesterday, only about 1,000 packages were sold. Other groups such as Fuzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen had new inquiries. This street also made some embellishments, but all were only small amounts of socializing and general wholesale shipments. Stores arrived in large quantities, and most of the cargo owners were eager to sell. Therefore, while the River Rice market was rising, the price of Guest Rice instead slightly decreased by three to five cents. The total transaction volume for the day was less than 10,000 packages, including 6,840 packages of Jiangxi rice, 1,116 packages of Han rough rice, 200 packages of Hunan rice, and 1,230 packages of Han Yong rice.

The City Party Headquarters and the Local Association, in conjunction with various groups, are holding this public memorial. Although the ceremony is simple, its significance is profound. Five years ago today, a powerful neighbor massacred our soldiers and civilians in Shanghai. Fortunately, our soldiers and people fought bravely, demonstrating the great spirit of our nation. The national crisis is becoming more severe every day. All of us Chinese people should inherit the spirit of our martyrs and strive for our future survival." Du's speech briefly stated, "I think everyone can still remember the situation during the January 28th Incident. Although our soldiers and civilians suffered great sacrifices in resisting the invasion, they made the enemy afraid. The current national situation is still serious. We should unite in spirit and face the outside world together."

### Philippine President Quezon Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Vice President Kong, Mayor Wu, and others host tea party to welcome him, will return to the Philippines via Shanghai on original ship after trip to the US this morning

Philippine President Quezon and five others are detained. Details of each case are noted below. Traveling to the United States on official business, they took the Canadian Empress, a ship of the Changxing Shipping Company, and arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM yesterday. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Many Chinese and American figures arrived to welcome them. Vice President Kong, Mayor Wu, and US Ambassador Wang Zhengting held grand welcoming events yesterday. Quezon will take the original ship to the United States this morning. He will visit again briefly when he passes through the port on his way back to the Philippines.

Warm Welcome Those who arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf to welcome Quezon yesterday included Tang Liangli, representing Chairman Wang of the Political Council; Chen Bingzhang, representing Vice President Kong of the Executive Yuan; Liu Yunfang, representing US Ambassador Wang Zhengting; Mayor Wu Tiecheng; Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu; Zhou Jue and Zhao Tiezhang, Director and Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Ministry's Shanghai Office; Jianghai Customs Superintendent Zhu Changnian; Central Committee Member Liu Jiwen; Legislative Yuan Member Lin Bosheng; Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Member Xie Zhongfu; Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Finance Ministry; US Consul General Gosh; US military representative Peng; and representatives of the Philippine community.

Disembarkation After the ship docked, the welcoming staff boarded to extend their greetings. Quezon shook hands and thanked them one by one, then disembarked and boarded the specially prepared Chinese ship Jinghui, which was moored near the large ship. The ship sailed to Wharf No. 5 in the South City to disembark. The City Security Office sent two squads of honor guards and a military band from the City Police Department to welcome him at the wharf. The area around Wharf No. 5 in the South City was heavily guarded, and vehicles and pedestrians were prohibited from passing through. After Quezon passed, the area returned to normal. Quezon then rode in a car with Mayor Wu and Commander Yang to a specially prepared reception area to rest.

Quezon's Speech Quezon told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that he planned to arrive in Washington on February 18. After arriving in the United States, he would successively meet with US President Roosevelt and the ministers of the US Department of State and the Department of Defense to discuss national defense plans and economic cooperation. Filipinos now express dissatisfaction with the current US-Philippine tariff and economic situation and hope to improve it. Quezon continued, "In addition to this task, the purpose and timing of the upcoming US-Philippine business and economic conference will be explored." Quezon also admitted that Mr. McShu, who traveled with him, was a private consultant for this trip. The task of Philippine Justice Minister Yu Li is to guide constitutional reform. The specific methods have not yet been determined. After Yu completes his mission in the United States, he plans to go to England to attend the coronation ceremony of the British King. Quezon must also continue to participate. Quezon denied external rumors that his departure from the Philippines was because he did not want to attend the Catholic Eucharist Congress held in Manila on February 3. He said that he was a Catholic and that his wife would represent him in hosting representatives attending the congress. Quezon expressed his deep gratitude to all circles in China for their warm welcome.

Quezon wore a gray tweed casual suit with a black gabardine overcoat, and he was full of energy. He met with the New Voice News Agency reporter at the Cathay Hotel and said that he would have talks with Washington officials about US-Philippine trade and other matters during this visit to the United States and would return to the Philippines in about two or three months. His last visit to Guangzhou gave him an excellent impression. He deeply felt that your country has been completely renewed and is full of vitality. He especially admired President Chiang's advocacy of the New Life Movement and the preservation of inherent dignity. China and the Philippines are close neighbors, and he should devote himself to promoting the friendship between the two countries and increasing it day by day.

Banquets Quezon, accompanied by Justice Minister Yu Li and former US Chief of Staff McShu, went to Mayor Wu's private residence in Haig Road at 4:30 PM yesterday to attend a joint tea party hosted by Vice President Kong and Mayor Wu. Kong apologized for staying in Nanjing for official business and invited various Chinese and foreign figures to accompany him. The party adjourned at 6:00 PM. Quezon then went to Anhe Temple Road to attend the tea party of the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gosh. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting hosted a banquet at the International Hotel at 8:30 PM yesterday, and invited Mayor Wu and Minister to Mexico Tan Shaohua to accompany him. The party ended with great joy at about 10:00 PM.

Departure from Shanghai This Morning Quezon had been to Shanghai twice before, and this was his third visit, but it was his first visit to Shanghai after taking office as President. Quezon was eager to go to the United States and did not intend to stay in Shanghai for long. He returned to the original ship at 11:00 PM that night and was scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States at 9:00 AM this morning. As for the group of Philippine journalists such as Luo Moluo, who were on the same ship to Shanghai and the United States, they were a visiting group and were not accompanied by Quezon. They happened to be traveling together.

### Finalizing 1936 Fiscal Year Accounts Across Industries

Money Shops Have Already Issued Lists to Clients; Banks Provide Loans to Help Industries Repay Money Shops

February 10th is the deadline for Shanghai's industries to finalize their accounts for the 1936 fiscal year. In addition to scheduling a members' meeting on the 2nd to report on the decision of member money shops to increase capital and the discount rate for January, the Money Trade Association has also decided to extend the hours for accepting and returning checks from the 6th and to discontinue interest on deposits but continue charging interest on overdue payments from the 8th. As the deadline for finalizing accounts approaches, internal office hours have been extended to handle the busy collection and settlement process. The money market remains stable, with the daily published overnight interbank rate consistently at 0.8%, a rate that will continue until February 9th. Member banks of the Bankers Association have already finalized their accounts at the end of the Gregorian calendar year, so they will not be finalizing accounts again during the industrial account finalization period. However, due to the busy collection and settlement process, they will extend their hours as they do annually, depending on the specific business of each bank. Money shops have already issued lists to their respective clients, as usual, requesting that outstanding debts be fully repaid by New Year's Eve. Since the bank account finalization period has passed, banks are processing new loan applications to allow businesses to borrow from banks and repay long-standing debts to money shops. The Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank will continue their past practice of supporting various industries by providing as many loans as possible.

Then, the research commenced and continued until 7:30 PM. A reporter from the Xin Sheng She learned that the joint meeting focused on various withholding issues related to income tax, such as: (1) whether net profits used to offset losses should be exempt from taxation; (2) what the tax-exempt boundaries should be for non-profit legal entities; (3) how lump-sum deposits and installment payments should be taxed; and (4) how overseas branches, such as those in Hong Kong, should be taxed.

### Various Organizations in This City to Hold Joint Meeting Tomorrow

Discussing Measures to Deal with Water Rate Increase; Citizens' Association Sends Letter to Company Requesting Cancellation of Agreed-Upon Rate

Since the Shanghai Waterworks Company of the International Settlement announced a rate increase, all sectors have expressed their opposition. The First Special District Citizens' United Association of this city has invited various organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Taxpayers' Association, Real Estate Association, General Labor Union, Municipal Farmers' Association, Education Association, and Women's Association, to hold a joint meeting at 2:00 PM on the 30th to discuss countermeasures. The Municipal United Association also sent a letter to the company yesterday morning, requesting the cancellation of the agreed-upon rate increase to ensure the stability of people's livelihoods. The original letter is transcribed below: "This city suffered losses in the January 28th Incident, and its vitality has not yet recovered. Industry and commerce are declining, and the market is depressed. The economic situation of the citizens has plummeted. Although the inland areas have reported a bumper harvest this year, the shocks of the international political situation make it difficult to expect industry and commerce to recover and the market to prosper. Unexpectedly, at this difficult time, your company suddenly proposes to increase rates, further burdening users. It is deeply shocking. Tap water is a public utility, and profits should not be excessive. In recent years, the company's business has been quite good. The sudden rate increase will harm the market and violate the company's mission to serve society. If this matter is insisted upon, your company can, of course, use the cessation of water supply as a means to implement the rate increase, but is the livelihood of the masses and social order not worth considering? This association cannot bear to cause disputes, so it sends this letter, urging you to consider the difficult times, promptly cancel the agreed-upon rate increase, conform to the situation, and stabilize people's livelihoods. We eagerly await your response."

### Capital Increase of Three Banks to Be Decided Soon

Ministry of Finance Agrees to Allocate 10 Million Yuan in Government Bonds

Central News Agency: The China Commercial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and the Ningpo Commercial & Savings Bank underwent rectification some time ago during the financial turmoil to stabilize their operations. Now, for the sake of business development, they have each convened extraordinary shareholders' meetings to discuss increasing capital. Although all meetings were adjourned due to insufficient attendance, the capital increase proposals were approved as provisional resolutions when they were discussed. A second meeting will be convened in early and mid-February to formally pass the resolutions for implementation. The three banks have solicited additional subscriptions from existing shareholders, but the amount is small. Therefore, they requested the Ministry of Finance to allocate government shares, and the Ministry has agreed to allocate 10 million yuan in government bonds for this purpose. The amount to be allocated has not yet been decided. The ratio of converting old shares into new shares is also under negotiation. According to a reporter's investigation, the discount is only about 10%, so some shareholders are dissatisfied and hope that the difficulties of old shareholders will be considered and the discount will be appropriately increased.

### Advantages of the Revised Draft of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law

China National Products Sales Association, etc., Yesterday Petitioned the Government to Promulgate It Soon

Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, in view of the dispersed and unsystematic organization of industrial and commercial sectors nationwide, which resulted in a lack of internal and external strength, decided to actively rectify the situation by revising the old Industrial and Commercial Associations Law.

To divide industries, commerce, and exports separately and establish associations. The Chamber of Commerce Law will also be revised. The full text of the draft of each industry association law has been published by various newspapers. It is now reported that the draft has been submitted by the Ministry of Industry to the Central Political Council for review and has not yet been forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for discussion. Industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai are extremely excited about the Ministry of Industry's active reforms and efforts to strengthen the organization of associations. It is learned that the China National Products Sales Association, the China General Federation of Industry, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Federation, etc., in this city have repeatedly held meetings to discuss the new draft of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law, believing that it is extremely suitable for the current needs of society. Yesterday, these associations expressed their support to the Central Political Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry,

Unanimously supporting it, requesting that it be promulgated soon. The opinions expressed by the associations are extracted below: "The promulgation of laws and regulations by the state is often due to the results of social evolution and the different trends of the times, and there are changes from time to time. Although the national conditions of various countries in the world are not the same, and their political systems are not entirely the same, the implementation of laws and regulations must be suitable for their own national conditions and the current needs of society, which is an undeniable principle. Since the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law of our country was promulgated in August of the 18th year of the Republic of China, it has been revised twice in August of the 19th year and September of the 21st year. In practice, due to the legislative spirit of adopting liberalism, the association itself lacks the real power to govern the industry, resulting in self-aggression and mutual growth and decline among various industries. The erosion of the entire economic power of the country is difficult to calculate. In recent years, based on the pain experience of industrial and commercial sectors themselves, it is deeply felt that thorough reforms can no longer be delayed. Recently, reading the draft of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law formulated by the Ministry of Industry, it is felt that its legislative spirit has changed to management policy, and it strives to strengthen the powers and functions of the association itself. It is the best regulation to suit the needs of society and follow the trend of the times. We, from the standpoint of industry and commerce, are deeply grateful for the Ministry of Industry's decisive and courageous decision and vow to support it wholeheartedly.

Promote its realization. The advantages of the new draft law are briefly listed on the left: (1) Industries, commerce, and export sectors are organized separately. In the future, the implementation of laws and regulations will be more practical and convenient. This is one of the advantages of the new draft law. (2) Stipulating the tasks of each industry association. The old Industrial and Commercial Associations Law only stipulated the purpose of establishing an association and did not have specific tasks, so each industry association had little active action other than routine meetings. This is also a reason why it failed to arouse the interest of the industry to participate. The new draft law has separately stipulated the work of the association, such as the inspection and control of raw materials and products, the control of business operations, and the common equipment in business, so that the tasks of the association have suddenly increased and become heavy, and joining the association can enjoy common benefits, which is enough to correct the disadvantages of the past. This is the second advantage of the new draft law. (3) The voting rights of members of the Industrial Associations are calculated according to the unit amount of membership dues paid. The old Industrial and Commercial Associations Law took the number of attendees as the calculation standard for meeting voting rights, and at the same time stipulated that the number of representatives sent by each manufacturer should not exceed two. The new draft law increases the maximum limit for the number of representatives of commercial and transportation associations to seven, while the voting rights of industrial associations are proportional to the amount of membership dues paid. This is very suitable for the current industrial and commercial situation. This is the third advantage of the new draft law. (4) Designating the classification names in each industry. The old law did not specify the classification of industries and commerce, so there were often the same industry that established several associations to confront each other, and disputes arose frequently, and the主管government departments could not restrict it. The new draft law designates the species of important industries by the department, based on factual needs, to avoid the disadvantages of stacking beds and building houses. This is the fourth advantage of the new draft law. (5) Clearly defining the methods of handling violations. The old law did not have sanctions for members who violated the regulations, so there was no binding force, which was the biggest flaw. The new law stipulates penalties, fines, and suspension of business for those who do not join the association in accordance with the law or violate the regulations and resolutions. It is the primary matter for consolidating the association organization and increasing the power of the association. This is the fifth advantage of the new draft law. The newly revised draft law of the Trade Association has these five major advantages, which are enough to adapt to the times and put industries and commerce on the right track of development. We hope that people from all walks of life will pay attention to studying and expressing sympathy, and if there are any opinions on the content and provisions, they should also contribute sincerely, and it is fortunate to be promulgated soon.

### Shanghai Rice Transported to Guangdong

Approximately 40,000 Bags Per Day; Wuhu Rice to Begin Shipping Soon

The Central Government has repeatedly received reports from the Guangdong provincial authorities that the province is experiencing a shortage of food and panic, requesting relief. The relevant authorities have been instructed to transport rice from various rice-producing areas to provide assistance and have approved the temporary accounting of half of the import tax on foreign rice to provide relief. This city is the transportation hub where grain merchants from all over the country gather. Recently, officials and merchants have been actively preparing to provide relief to the food shortage panic in Guangdong Province. The following is a report by a Central News Agency reporter on the situation:

Large Quantities of Ke Xian Rice Shipped to Guangdong Daily: According to news from grain merchants, since Guangdong Province levied an import tax on foreign rice, the amount of foreign rice shipped to Guangdong has become increasingly scarce, and the province's needs cannot be met. Therefore, rice from various provinces is being transported to the market. Due to the convenience of transportation in this city, rice merchants from all over the country have come to sell rice. In addition, the autumn harvest last year was very abundant, and the goods arriving were very crowded. Guangdong Province originally regarded Ke Xian rice as the main product for sale, so recently about 40,000 bags of Ke Xian rice are transported from Shanghai to Guangdong Province every day.

Wuhu Rice Transport to Guangdong to Begin Soon: The Central Government has ordered the Central Trust Bureau and the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to find ways to provide assistance as soon as possible for the Guangdong Province's food shortage panic. The Central Trust Bureau has sent personnel to Wuhu and Changsha to purchase rice. The Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau is also negotiating transportation issues with transportation agencies. Now, Xiang rice is decided to be transported by land. The Yuehan Road authorities have prepared special cars for transportation. Wuhu's rice is transported by water. However, as the end of the lunar year is approaching, the passenger and freight transportation of various shipping companies is extremely busy. It was originally intended to designate a special rice transporter by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but in order to solve the actual difficulties, it will be cooperated by various shipping companies. It will probably start transporting within days.

### Lin Kanghou Discusses the Guarantee System

Sends Letters to Industry Colleagues Everywhere for Study; Plans Will Be Decided After Collection

Xin Sheng News Agency: Recently, various newspapers have reported that the Bankers Association announced the abolition of the current guarantee system and suggested a special cash guarantee. Therefore, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Association, to inquire about the details of the matter. According to Mr. Lin, the current guarantor system in the business community has been a long-standing custom. In the past, in the era of credit, both sides were able to strictly abide by the rules. In modern times, personnel are complex, and incidents of fraud and embezzlement are heard every day. If there is a good system, it is urgent to remedy it, and no one will fail to agree. That is, the Association has also gathered to discuss this in the past. Recently, Wang Weiyin said that he has been engaged in research and reform on this issue, exploring the root cause, and drafted an opinion. The method is to replace credit guarantees with cash guarantees. In principle, the theory is appropriate and there is value in discussion. The Association believes that this matter is more deeply related to banks, so it took Mr. Wang's opinion and studied it first. However, one thing is done, and it is always in the interest of implementation. Moreover, it involves reforming social habits, and it is even more valuable to gather ideas and benefit from wisdom. This is why the Association, not only solicits the opinions of colleagues throughout the city, but also sends letters to bank associations everywhere for the same study, which is very serious. After each party replies, the case will be carefully deliberated. Once a complete plan is decided, many adopters will definitely benefit from the effect of success. As for the pieces disclosed in the newspaper recently, they are not released by the Association. During the research period, it can only be used as a reference for people from all walks of life.

### Comrades of the Xinhai Revolution Merchant Corps Plan to Solicit Deeds of Martyrs

For the sake of commemorating the revolutionary deeds of the past, the Shanghai Merchant Corps comrades of the Xinhai Revolution decided to visit the old comrades in Shanghai to hold registration. It has been scheduled to hold a dinner party at the Hushi on February　day to discuss the method of soliciting the deeds of the martyrs, and decided㊀ to list items from Kang Yuan Canning Factory, Guangdong Road,㊁ Liu Changkang of Shentai Woodware Store, Beijing Road, and㊂ Ding Guanlan of Yansheng Industrial Co., Ltd., Dajilu Yongqingli as three registration offices. The association's origin is recorded as follows: "At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the advanced people at sea saw that foreign aggression was increasing day by day and the national situation was deteriorating. Therefore, the National Merchant Corps Federation was established, and then the Shanghai Commercial and Academic Tutoring Association, the Shanghai Society, the Business and Commerce Association, and other five organizations were established. Talents gathered and the scale was magnificent. Following the establishment of the Shanghai Merchant Corps Basic Team by the Merchant Corps Association, various industries organized district teams, gathering thousands of comrades. Many of the people in charge were devoted to the revolution. The pioneer Chen Gong, a martyr, attacked the Manufacturing Bureau in the battle, and Shanghai was recovered in one battle. Our comrades bravely led the way, and many of them died in battle. Their loyal souls will shine for thousands of years. Since Hong Xian usurped the country, the Merchant Corps was forced to disband. Because of repeated attempts to restore it, it has not been successful. To this day, there are not many people in the county who can talk about the situation at that time. Occasionally, I checked the Shanghai Nanhui Zhuxian Chronicle, and there was no mention of the merchant corps' achievements during the recovery, which is very regrettable. Our comrades were personally led by the advanced people and shared the robes with the martyrs for a long time. All the happy words and virtues are more knowledgeable. On its great deeds, it is especially moved, and it is unbearable to make it submerged. It is our duty to honor virtue and reward merit. Remembering the past, there is understanding and sympathy. The government is now engaged in investigating the deeds of the martyrs, and it is appropriate to make contributions at this time. As for how to collect and compile, how to supplement historical records, how to apply for praise, and how to establish a memorial, we must gather ideas and work together to proceed, so that we can comfort the heroic spirits in the underground and show the example to the future."

### Second Special Municipal United Association's Illegal Interruption of Water and Electricity by the French Authorities

Submit to the National Government to Order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Make Serious Representations

National News Agency: The Second Special District Citizens' United Association of this city submitted to the National Government yesterday: "Check this time, when the French Concession Municipal Authorities promoted the new donation of Chinese medicine industry, they even cut off water and electricity, blocked the door, and forced to recognize the bad donations and taxes, which is an unprecedented bad example. As for whether the donation and tax should be held, and whether it exceeds the affordability of the citizens, the seriousness of the problem is secondary. The most alarming and painful thing is the method adopted by the authorities to promote the new tax, which is to cut off water and electricity and block the door as a shortcut to force the citizens to recognize the new tax. Once this bad example is opened, then in the future, the municipal authorities intend to hold any new tax, can not ask whether the amount of donation and tax exceeds the ability of the citizens to bear, assuming that the citizens have a little delay or hesitation, or have a legitimate protest, they will have the same danger of being cut off from water and electricity. The degree of autocracy and tyranny is beyond addition. This harsh government has been repeatedly opposed by all the citizens of the French Concession. The crowd is angry and the public is in an uproar. For the sake of the vital interests of the citizens, this association, in view of the deep and great suffering suffered by the Chinese medicine industry this time, although the matter itself has come to an end, but looking forward to the future, it has to make the following suggestions: ㊀ The French Commercial Water and Electricity Company of this city should maintain its commercial independence as a principle. If the citizens pay fees in accordance with the regulations, the authorities shall not use political pressure to force the company to use the supply of water and electricity to promote new taxes. ㊁ Blocking doors or cutting off water and electricity must be executed through court procedures. The municipal authorities shall not enforce administrative orders. ㊂ During the period when the new tax is being promoted and has not yet been implemented, if the citizens are unable to afford it, or because they have not understood the content of the new tax, they have a little doubt, hesitation, or delay in payment, the authorities should adopt peaceful methods to persuade and explain, and shall not use high-pressure methods, such as (cutting off the supply of water and electricity and blocking the door), moreover, the promotion of new taxes and the outstanding old donations have different natures. ㊃ If similar means are used to deal with the citizens in the future, the French Public Works Bureau shall compensate for the corresponding losses. The reasons are listed below: Cutting off water and electricity is not in line with human feelings and legal principles. Water and electricity are necessary for daily life. Cutting off water and electricity is tantamount to starving people. In other words, it is tantamount to killing people. The water and electricity contract is directly signed by the French Commercial Water and Electricity Company and the citizens. There is no express provision in this unreasonable method of cutting off water and electricity. How can a third party interfere and force the suspension of supply, and threaten to cut off water and electricity to the detriment of civilization? It has reached the extreme. Moreover, the municipal authorities of various countries in the world formulate regulations with the interests of the citizens as the most important, so their powers are strictly limited. Cutting off water and electricity has exceeded the authority of the court. The spirit of legislation should be to help the weak, and this method has always been painfully opposed by the citizens of Shanghai. Now it is becoming more and more intense, and it is even further blocked with iron wire, which is a means of collecting donations. The unheard-of violent act since the opening of the Concession is even more criticized by the rule of law. Moreover, it is clearly different to not pay because of not recognizing the new donation and delaying the anti-donation. Why should it be considered a violation of the regulations? If you do not pay any donation, you can only use legal procedures to sue the court. The regulations of the Public Works Bureau cannot replace the law after all. The jurisdiction of the court is still limited, so there are distinctions between judicial power, the right of appeal, and the right of execution. However, the French Public Works Bureau treats those who oppose the increase of donations as criminals, who can be cut off from water and electricity at will, and can arbitrarily sell citizens' business premises and residences. Cutting off water and electricity is tantamount to starving people, and sealing the door is to obstruct freedom. If unfortunately encountered a fire, wouldn't it be that the residents would perish together? It is too much to do things backwards. The power of the French Public Works Bureau is greater than that of the courts of various countries, which is not a joke. No wonder the public has risen up to attack it. What is not seen in the savage countries can be seen in the French Concession of Shanghai. Disregarding public opinion, disregarding humanity, and also greatly violating the morals of various religions, therefore, the item of stopping water and electricity supply stipulated in the Public Works Bureau's regulations must be deleted. It should be requested that His Excellency instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations to the French Ambassador quickly to protect the people's lives. At the same time, he requested the French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association to translate the above-mentioned reasons into French and send them to the French Ambassador, the French Consul, the French Commercial Water and Electricity Company, and all the directors of the French Public Works Bureau. He also requested the Public Works Bureau to submit a reconsideration at the next board meeting to cancel the terms of stopping the supply of water and electricity. In addition to seriously questioning each Chinese director and seeking relief measures, he also sent a letter to the French Commercial Water and Electricity Company to stop the violation of the contract and warned that citizens who do not owe water and electricity fees cannot stop the supply of water and electricity, otherwise, they will be liable for all losses.

### Road Workers Mutual Aid Society Sends Letter to the Public Works Department

Requesting Withdrawal of Dismissal Order

The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Concession Road Workers Mutual Aid Society sent a letter yesterday to the Public Works Department, requesting that it order the withdrawal of the dismissal of road workers to maintain the people's livelihood. The original letter stated: "To the esteemed Public Works Department, at this time of economic downturn and financial contraction, everyone sympathizes with the need to economize and reduce spending. However, municipal construction and public safety cannot be allowed to regress. The Public Works Department has issued a notice implementing personnel reductions, dismissing over one thousand two hundred of our road workers. Although a hundred or so have been re-hired, this means that nine-tenths have been dismissed. How can anyone willingly accept such harsh measures? Therefore, on the afternoon of the 27th of this month at 7:00 PM, a meeting of representatives of all road workers was convened, and the Mutual Aid Society was organized. It was resolved to list seven reasons, respectfully requesting your consideration: ㊀ Personnel reductions should target high-level officials with monthly salaries of thousands or hundreds of yuan. ㊁ The cause of the social economic downturn is the increase in unemployment. ㊂ Recently, road length has increased, road surfaces have widened, and workload has increased. ㊃ The number of vehicles has increased daily, road surfaces are easily damaged, and repairs are more frequent. ㊄ Original workers braved wind and rain, gunfire during the January 28th Incident, constructed defense works, and survived. Their contributions are not insignificant. ㊅ Wages in various industries have increased recently, but our road workers have not requested wage increases. ㊆ Temporary hiring is prone to corruption and difficult to assemble quickly. Based on the above seven reasons, in terms of human sentiment, legal principles, and factual circumstances, not only should there be no dismissals, but there is a need to hire more road workers. We specifically request that your esteemed Bureau, regarding personnel reductions, should start with upper-level officials, and should show consideration for the road workers who depend on their livelihoods, and instruct the Public Works Department to withdraw the dismissal order to ensure livelihoods and prevent disputes. This is our sincere hope. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Concession Public Works Department."

### Travel Agency Organizes Yandang Mountain Spring Tour Group

### Special Cash Guarantee Measures (Continued)

Full Text Released by the Bankers Association

Article 7: Employees should pay a Class B guarantee deposit of 2% of their salary on a daily basis, which will be deducted from their monthly salary.

(Explanation) Since employees have no guarantors, and part of the Class A guarantee deposit and interest must be returned, the Class B guarantee deposit stipulated in this article is essentially a premium for credit insurance. All employees have an obligation to pay it. The rate of 2% is also extremely low. If no malpractice occurs in the future, the principal can be returned in full (see Article 18). This guarantee also implies savings. Assuming that the total annual salary is 1.6 million yuan, this guarantee deposit is estimated to yield more than 31,000 yuan per year.

The original intention was to stipulate that this guarantee deposit should be collected on a progressive scale according to the employee's salary level. However, in order to achieve uniformity, a proportional system was adopted, stipulating a uniform rate of 2%. Banks that have already implemented employee savings plans can allocate a portion of these savings to this purpose.

Article 8: The Class B guarantee deposit deducted monthly should be listed in detail by the service location, filled out in an employee Class B guarantee deposit list, and submitted to the head office along with the funds. The head office will store it in a special account, and interest will be calculated at an annual rate of 12 per mille, compounded semi-annually, and allocated to the employee guarantee reserve fund.

(Explanation) This article stipulates that the Class B guarantee deposit deducted from each employee should be listed separately for easy calculation and for centralized management, and it is stipulated that it must be submitted to the head office to prevent abuses. The interest rate is also specially increased to 12 per mille to enrich the guarantee reserve fund.

Article 9: The head office should establish separate employee Class B guarantee deposit sub-accounts for each employee's Class B guarantee deposit, compile them once at the end of each year, and issue Class B guarantee deposit notices to each account, without issuing separate passbooks.

(Explanation) The principal or balance of the Class B guarantee deposit is intended to be returned in the future, so separate accounts should be established to facilitate calculation and the issuance of notices at the end of the year. It is difficult to handle the procedures, but it can also remind employees to pay attention to the benefits of the Class B guarantee deposit and achieve the effect of mutual supervision to eliminate malpractice.

Article 10: The bank will allocate several tens of thousands of yuan of Class C guarantee deposit to employees each year. The amount will be determined by the bank and stored in a special account with interest calculated at an annual rate of 12 per mille, compounded semi-annually.

(Explanation) It is inevitable that the bank will suffer losses due to employee malpractice. In the case of this bank, the losses suffered over the years are not small. If there is no sufficient preparation, it is inevitable that we will be impoverished in response, and the bank also has some responsibility for employee malpractice. Therefore, it is stipulated that several tens of thousands of yuan should be allocated each year as a Class C guarantee deposit. This is within the bank's administrative authority, so it is determined by the bank to show cooperation with employees and share weal and woe.

Article 11: The head office should establish an employee guarantee deposit account, and at the end of each year, the following three payments will be credited to this account for storage and used as an employee guarantee reserve fund:

㊀ Half of the interest on the employee Class A guarantee deposit.

㊁ The principal and interest of the employee Class B guarantee deposit.

㊂ The principal and interest of the employee Class C guarantee deposit.

(Explanation) In order to concentrate the guarantee strength, the three guarantee deposits are combined for storage. Assuming that the total annual salary is 1.6 million yuan, it is estimated that more than 110,000 yuan can be obtained annually, which is sufficient to cope with cases of malpractice.

Articles 1 and 2 of this article stipulate that half of the interest on all employees' Class A guarantee deposits and the principal and interest of the Class B guarantee deposits should be used to replenish the guarantee reserve fund. If a case of malpractice occurs, in addition to handling it in accordance with the provisions of Article 12, if it is insufficient, it will be compensated for losses in accordance with the provisions of Article 13. On the surface, it seems that the guarantee deposits of non-malpracticing employees are used to compensate for the losses of malpracticing employees. In fact, this is a "risk sharing". The original intended use is similar to the premium for credit insurance. However, regardless of whether there is malpractice or not, the insurance premium must be paid and will not be returned. This guarantee reserve fund, if there is no malpractice, or if there is a surplus after compensating for malpractice losses, can still be returned, which is even better than the former.

Article 12: When an employee is liable for compensation, in addition to the criminal part, the service location should handle it carefully, without the need to ask for instructions, and must not be lenient. The illegal employee should be immediately sent to the court nearby for handling according to law, and reported to the head office at the same time. The amount of compensation should be paid from the following payments:

1.  The principal and interest of the employee's Class A guarantee deposit.
2.  The principal and interest of the employee's Class B guarantee deposit.
3.  The principal and interest of the employee's savings.
4.  The employee's other benefits due in office.
5.  All of the employee's assets.

(Explanation) The first half of this article stipulates that the service location should severely punish the malpracticing employee according to law. In order to prevent him from escaping, each service location should immediately send the illegal employee to the court nearby for handling according to law without the need to ask for instructions, and must not be lenient. The head office should be notified at the same time. As for the payments sufficient to cover the compensation, there are as many as five types, which can be used to make up for the losses, which are expected to be sufficient.

Article 13: If an employee is liable for compensation and the payments stipulated in the previous article are insufficient to cover the compensation, the shortfall will be compensated from the three types of guarantee reserve funds of all employees stipulated in Article 11 of these rules, calculated proportionally.

(Explanation) Because the collection of Class B guarantee deposits is equivalent to the premium for credit insurance (see the explanation of Article 18), it was originally intended to compensate for the losses of malpractice by the employee himself or other colleagues. If there is a surplus, it will be returned in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of these rules. However, in order to share the burden equally, when using the three types of guarantee reserve funds in Article 11, it is stipulated that they should be allocated proportionally to show fairness. The so-called proportional allocation is illustrated by the following example:

Assuming that the guarantee reserve fund that can be used each year is as follows:

Percentage of Total Kind Amount (Yuan)

Half of Class A Interest 24,000 3/100

Class B Principal and Interest 32,000 29/100

Class C Principal and Interest 56,000 50/100

Total 113,000 100

If a malpractice case occurs with a loss amount equal to 10% of the guarantee reserve fund, then each of the Class A, B, and C reserve funds will contribute 10% to compensate, i.e., 2,400 yuan from Class A, 3,200 yuan from Class B, and 5,600 yuan from Class C, totaling 11,200 yuan. Analyzing the source of this 11,200 yuan, half of it comes from the bank, which can be said to be a manifestation of the bank's determination to promote the new system. The care for the employees is not inconsiderable. (To be continued)

### State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Decides to Open Xiamen-Philippines Route

Developing Ocean Shipping; Anticipating Expectations; To Be Realized in Mid-Next Month, Temporarily Focusing on Passenger Transport

The Ministry of Transportation previously stated that our country had no dedicated ships operating on international routes, which were almost entirely controlled by foreign merchants. This caused great inconvenience for the promotion of domestic products and the travel of overseas Chinese. In order to develop shipping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping agencies were ordered to plan and implement it. After receiving the order, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company repeatedly convened meetings with various shipping agencies in Shanghai. At that time, the consensus was that the planning and capital required to open international routes were beyond the capabilities of our country's shipping merchants, so it was temporarily suspended. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did not cease planning for this matter. Later, it was heard that the company had decided to independently implement it in phases and had even planned to charter a sea-going ship to start the Xiamen-Philippines route (i.e., from Xiamen directly to and from Manila), but the issue of chartering a ship could not be resolved, and chartering a ship was not very cost-effective, so this proposal was suspended again. Until recently, it was heard again that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had decided to allocate one of the

Four New Sea-Going Ships Built with Boxer Indemnity Funds, the Haiheng, to trial operation between Xiamen and the Philippines, as a preliminary step in developing ocean shipping, anticipating the expectations of all parties and comforting overseas Chinese, but focusing on passenger transport. The above plan has recently been approved by the Ministry of Transportation. The company is currently actively preparing, and it is expected to be realized in mid-next month. The company previously planned to send the Haiyuan to operate on this route, but now it has changed to sending the Haiheng. The two ships are both new and there is no difference, but because of

Dispatching Reasons, one is replacing the other. The Xiamen agency is located at Bingji Shipping Company in Liaozihou, Xiamen. The Philippine agency is Manila Steamship Co., Manila. The ship is approximately 340 to 50 feet long, approximately 47 feet wide, 75 feet high to the upper deck, and approximately 17 feet high to the clear deck, with a displacement of more than 3,200 tons. The engine has 2,500 horsepower, and the speed is 13 nautical miles per hour.

### Young Woman Knocks on Door; Robbers Commit Robbery

You De'an Loses Over a Thousand Yuan

No. 25 Hengqing Lane, Baylor Road, French Concession, is the residence of You De'an from Sichuan, who runs a fur export business. His family is well-off, which led to him being targeted by robbers. Yesterday evening around 8:00 PM, a young woman went to knock on the door. When You ordered the maid to open the door, four robbers suddenly rushed in, displayed handguns, and confined all the men, women, masters, and servants in the house to the back kitchen, assigning one robber to stand guard with a gun. The remaining robbers went upstairs and searched at will. After twenty minutes, they carried away the stolen goods and fled. Afterwards, the victim estimated that he had been robbed of more than 400 yuan in legal tender, two gold watches, a gold bracelet, and four precious fur coats, totaling over 1,000 yuan. He issued a loss report and reported it to the Lujiawan General Patrol Room for investigation.

### Pawnshop Charges High Interest; Four Per Mille Per Month

Zhitai Pawnshop Accused; Hearing Concluded Yesterday; Awaiting Sentencing

Yu Jingyu, chairman of the Haiqi (Haimen Qidong) Victims' Aid Association, accused the Zhitai Pawnshop at No. 98 Laobaidu Street, Sixteenth Pier, of repeatedly seizing Huang Ajin's two gold rings, Zhang's watch, and one pair of line spring white cloth pants that he borrowed from a friend last summer. He took eight dime silver coins and made more than 27 copper coins in interest in less than three months. The complainant alleged the pawnshop had committed encroachment, charged excessive interest, and engaged in exploitation. Inspection Officer Tang Ruxiu investigated and prosecuted Zheng Banghui, the manager of the pawn shop, and shop assistant Guo Jingming. The hearing was held yesterday by Criminal Judge Li Dingcheng. The defendant Zheng Banghui did not attend, and Guo Jingming hired lawyer Zhu Yazou for defense. Yu Jingyu detailed the previous circumstances, stating that the pawnshop charged an excessive interest of more than 4 per mille per month. He also claimed that the defendant Guo Jingming admitted to the inspection officer that he charged 25 copper coins in interest. According to Article 11 of the Shanghai Pawnshop Business Rules, which were temporarily set at 18 per mille per month for interest on pawned items, 2 per mille for storage rent, and pawned items with a debt of less than 2 yuan that are not accepted by pawnshops may temporarily increase storage rent and handling fees, but not more than 1 per mille per month, and which were revised by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, his pawned capital was originally eight silver dimes, which should be converted to more than 6 dimes 6 cents according to Article 9 of the previous rules. Even if the interest is calculated at 3%, and the period is less than 3 months, the interest should be around 6 cents, but they actually charged 9 cents, which is an obvious exploitation of people's urgency and acquiring of money, and obtaining excessive interest that is not commensurate with the principal. Guo Jingming claimed that he was a shop assistant and denied the facts. The court adjourned the debate and will pronounce the sentence on the afternoon of the 20th.

### Truck Runs Over and Kills Person; Driver Flees; Driver Accused of Murder

Arrested After Extensive Investigation; Deceased's Family Requests Court to Grant Justice

Xiao Fengying, a 19-year-old woman from Taizhou, lived at No. 127 Haizhou Road and worked at the Dakang Cotton Mill. Around 6:00 AM on the 14th of this month, she was returning home from the factory when she was hit by a truck near Garland Road on Yangshupu Road, suffering fatal injuries. The truck sped away without a trace. Xiao's body was sent to Fielin Road for an autopsy, as reported in this newspaper. Afterwards, the Yangshupu Police Station sent Chinese detectives Zhang Yunjian and Zhang Guanying to investigate. At noon the day before yesterday, they learned that the truck number was 17095, which belonged to the Huafu Company at No. 19-21 Huade Road. The driver was Zhang Zhongyin from Zhenjiang. They secretly went to the address and arrested him, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Public Works Department lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and stated that after the defendant caused the accident, according to what he said at the police station, someone told him that he had hit a person at the intersection of Garland Road and Yangshupu Road and had been taken to the hospital. He went to that place at 7:00 PM that afternoon and saw a pool of blood on the ground, but still did not report to the police station. At the time of the accident, he also felt something falling to the ground and deliberately fled. He is now being prosecuted for murder under Article 276, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Ding Zixiao, a female worker from the same cotton mill, testified that the defendant was driving quite fast at the time and did not honk the horn, which caused the accident. Xiao Zhu, the mother of the deceased, also stated that Fengying was her biological daughter and recently learned of the incident in her hometown. She came to Shanghai overnight to request justice. Zhang Zhongyin's confession was vague. Judge Xiao Xie'fen ordered him to be detained again and the hearing rescheduled.

### Sun Wenming's Bomb Case Still Under Investigation

Postponed for Continued Trial Next Month

Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the "January 28th" Shanghai War. To maintain the peace of the Public Concession, the Police Department of the Public Concession specially instructed all police stations to select detectives for strict patrols at key points to prevent petty criminals from hiding and disrupting public order. At 8:10 PM the day before yesterday, Sun Wenming (21 years old), from Changzhou, was found carrying two hand grenades while passing the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Chengdu Road by Chinese Detective Chief Mao Yiwen, Detective Ma Zhongrong, and Detective Wang Shidong of the Xin Zha Police Station. He was taken to

the police station for detention. All details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Wan Zhishan, filed a lawsuit according to Article 187 of the Criminal Law for possessing explosives with intent to commit a crime, and stated the facts of the case, saying that at 8:10 PM last night, Detective Ma Zhongrong of the Xin Zha Police Station received information that someone was carrying explosives and intended to commit illegal acts at the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Chengdu Road. He went and arrested the defendant and found

two round bombs in his sleeves. They had handles and fuses. According to the defendant's confession at the police station, on the 24th of this month, he carried a bomb with the intention of committing illegal acts. While passing the entrance of Lane 623 on Yongjiang Road, he happened to encounter Chinese police

inspecting pedestrians. In a moment of panic, he threw the bomb into the garbage bin in the lane. The bomb has not been found yet, and the police are still investigating. Last night, the defendant carried two bombs with the intention of robbing the property of Da Xin Nanhuo Store at No. 417 Xin Zha Road, but was unfortunately arrested on the way. Because the police investigation of the defendant was not complete, they requested permission to postpone the trial. The confiscated hand grenades were dangerous items and were not suitable for submission as evidence. After the judge briefly questioned the defendant Sun Wenming, he ordered him to be detained pending a further hearing on February 4th.

### Conclusion of the Appeal Case of the Assassin of Shao Wenbin

At 8:00 PM on July 28, 1933, Shao Wenbin, the "King of Flower Shows," also known as Ma Fu A'liu, was assassinated on Rue Wagner in the French Concession due to a feud over flower show territory. At the time, a patrolman chased and shot dead one of the murderers on Avenue Edward VII. Later, the French police arrested Zhang Bingrong, nicknamed "Little Ningbo," as the murderer and sent him to court, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment. On September 2nd of last year, Wang Shilong, the principal offender, and Qian A'jin, the suspect, also known as "Hemp Skin A'jin," were apprehended and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After the trial, Wang was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment, with 10 years of deprivation of civil rights, and 2 years for opening a flower show gambling den, with a total of 14 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Qian A'jin was sentenced to imprisonment for being a recidivist in flower show gambling and fined 500 yuan. Wang and Qian did not accept the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After the investigation chamber concluded its investigation, the case was heard yesterday in the Third Criminal Court by Wu Tingqi, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court, along with Judges Chen and Wang, Prosecutor Dong, and Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department. The appellants were defended by lawyers such as Zhu Dianxiang and Wang Xiubo. During the trial, Wang and Qian both denied planning to kill Shao Wenbin or opening a flower show, claiming that they were falsely accused and forced to confess. Zhang Bingrong was also brought to the stand for questioning, but his testimony was also evasive. After reviewing the entire case file, the court believed that the facts were clear, ordered a debate, declared the case closed, and scheduled a sentencing date. The appellants were returned to the detention center, and Zhang Bingrong was sent back to prison to continue serving his sentence.

### Zheng Zhushu's Alteration of Documents Reverses Two Characters

Resulting in Incoherent Text; Defendant Posts 300 Yuan Bail

Zheng Zhushu, the owner of Dalu Nanhuo Store at No. 778 North Chengdu Road, was sued by Ma Deming, a local resident, through his lawyer Wu Luping, in the local court for altering documents. The complaint stated that Sun Runhua, the former owner of Run Kang Nanhuo Store in Minhang Town, purchased goods from the Dalu Nanhuo Store owned by the defendant Zheng Zhushu and asked the plaintiff to be the guarantor. In October 1935, the plaintiff personally wrote a guarantee letter stating, "The amount of goods purchased after October 13th of last year is standardized at hundreds of yuan." It was very clear that the plaintiff was only responsible for guaranteeing 100 yuan. However, in September of last year, when the defendant filed a lawsuit in the court against Sun Runhua to recover the price of the goods and the guaranteed debt, the defendant added an inverted symbol next to the words "shu yi" ("amount with") in the guarantee letter written by the plaintiff, changing it to "yi shu bai yuan wei biao zhun" ("with amount hundreds of yuan as standard"). Not only was the text incoherent, but it was also clearly altered after the fact, involving criminal liability. The Civil Division has already determined the facts and stated them in the reasoning section of the judgment in that case. The defendant's alteration of private documents with the intention of obtaining illegitimate profits and causing the plaintiff to perform an obligation that he had no duty to perform was sufficient to harm others, and his criminal conduct could not be concealed, clearly violating Article 220 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Guo Xiangzu held a hearing, and as a result, the defendant was ordered to post 300 yuan bail for further trial.

### Spring Household Registration for Civilian Villages

The Municipal Civilian Welfare Enterprise Management Committee, recognizing that the general working class citizens cannot solve their housing problems due to insufficient financial resources, specially allocated huge sums of money last year to build four beautiful civilian villages at Zhongshan Road and Pushan Road, Qimei Road, and Damuqiao, totaling more than 1,000 buildings. The rent for each building is only four or five yuan. The village was originally built to seek welfare for the city's people, so not only is the rent extremely cheap, but also various facilities, such as running water, electricity, public bathrooms, sanitary facilities, auditoriums, various sports fields, gardens, etc., are all available, far beyond what other commercially-run municipal houses can compare with. Each village also has a completely free municipal elementary school and cooperative. Residents can obtain beautiful housing with very little rent, and can also cultivate their children and exercise their bodies. Therefore, it is known as the "Happy Land for Civilians." Currently, the housing in each village has long been rented out. In order to allow the general citizens of this city to have the opportunity to enjoy these benefits, the committee is now opening up more housing and holding a spring household registration. Those who register first will be approved to move in in order. It is expected that many people will go to register at that time.

### Japanese and Gambling Thugs Secretly Set Up Gambling Den; Case Cracked

Japanese Okumura Hideo Handed Over to Consulate for Interrogation; Other Chinese Sentenced and Fined Separately

It was recently rumored in the Kunshan Garden area of North Sichuan Road in Hongkou that someone was secretly setting up a gambling table there, using people of a certain country as a talisman to attract general gamblers to gamble on pai gow and 26-door hulu, drinking and making noise all night long. The Hongkou Police Station heard about this and specially dispatched Chinese detectives Wang Chonghao, Chen Binzhong, Kong Guangxiao, etc., to undertake secret investigation work, and secretly sent informants to mix in with the gamblers to investigate the truth. After several days, it was discovered that the gambling table was actually jointly opened by Japanese Okumura Hideo and the gambling thug Hu Sanmei. Most of the people gambling inside were Cantonese, and there were also some foreigners. They first bought chips with cash, and then entered the game. The wins and losses were quite large. After the detectives verified the contents, they reported back to the police chief and requested the Japanese consulate and the First Special Court to issue search warrants. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, they went to the gambling den at No. 854 North Sichuan Road and arrested Japanese Okumura Hideo, Feng Si, a Cantonese who was pushing the table, the gamblers Liu Zhi, She Xin, and the woman Lai Li'e, who claimed to be Greek, along with 31 large metal chips, 30 small bone chips, 95 bone chips, a tablecloth, a set of pai gow, five dice, a shaking cylinder, nickel coins, etc. They were all taken to the police station and ordered to hand over the Japanese to the Japanese consulate for interrogation. The woman Lai Li'e was released on 500 yuan bail. The remaining 36 people were detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the facts of the case. After Judge Pan questioned each defendant, Feng Si was sentenced to three months of imprisonment in court. Chen Zhang, Li Songquan, Zeng Jin, and Li Rihong were detained for further trial. The remaining 32 people, including Liu Zhi and Lai Li'e, were each fined 30 yuan, and the gambling equipment was confiscated.

### Female Worker Has Affair with Candy Factory Owner

Husband Sues for Disruption of Family

Xie A'mao, a 38-year-old from Wuxi, who is currently working at Yixing Pawnshop on Fangbang Bridge, married Zhang A'di (25 years old this year), a woman from his hometown, in the spring of 1933. Because of the poor family situation, Zhang A'di was introduced by Zhu A'mei to work in the Gongda Yarn Factory, and she sent home six or seven yuan of her wages each month to supplement the family expenses. In the second half of 1934, Zhang A'di suddenly stopped sending money home and there was no news of her. Xie came to Shanghai to look for her but could not find her. Until recently, he learned that Zhang A'di had an affair with Huang Meiqing, the owner of Dacheng Candy Factory on Avenue Joffre, who also worked in the insurance industry, and they were living together. Therefore, Xie filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, suing Huang Meiqing for disrupting his family, and also filed a civil suit, requesting the court to order the surrender of Zhang A'di so that he could take her home to resume their marriage. Upon receiving the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday morning by Judge Yang Songlin. First, the plaintiff described the process of his wife being seduced by the defendant and living together in an affair. When questioned, the defendant Huang Meiqing denied the matter. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation on February 5th. The defendant was released on bail or detained without bail.

### Appeal Trial of the Xuan Sheng Assassination Case Opens

No Results Yesterday; Continued Hearing Scheduled

Suzhou, January 28th Telegram: In the case of the assassination of Xuan Sheng, a Japanese merchant, on Qimei Road, Dixiwei Road, Zhabei in July of last year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested eight criminals, including the main culprits Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Zhao Yunhong, Jin Daoquan, Zhu Guisheng, and Zhang Ma'shi, at Jiande Apartment and other places. After the Shanghai Local Court concluded the trial, Wang Zhensheng and Mao Yonghu were sentenced to death for jointly committing continuous murder and deprived of their civil rights for life. Zhao Yunhong was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for assisting in murder and deprived of his civil rights for 10 years. Jin Daoquan was sentenced to 13 years of imprisonment for continuously assisting in murder and deprived of his civil rights for 10 years. Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming were each sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment for preparing to commit murder. After Mao Yonghu and others were sentenced, they all expressed their dissatisfaction and appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court. The case was transferred to Suzhou the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the Suzhou Higher Court, with Judge Zhou presiding in the Third Criminal Court, first heard Mao Yonghu, who confessed that he was 29 years old and had been selling fruit at the 16th Pier. Li Ruiwu told me that he had a feud with the Japanese and asked me to kill a Japanese. Because I didn't have the courage, I introduced Wang Zhensheng. On July 6th and 7th of last year, we wandered around Qimei Road and Dixiwei Road for two days. Because the gun I was carrying wouldn't fire, I didn't succeed. On July 8th, Wang Zhensheng brought a pistol. When he saw a Japanese on Qimei Road and Dixiwei Road, Wang Zhensheng shot the Japanese. After playing around at the ice cream stand, I took a rickshaw to the Renhe Hotel in the French Concession. Later, Li Ruiwu sent me 200 yuan in banknotes. I used 30 yuan, Wang Zhensheng used 50 yuan, and Zhao Yunhong used 20 yuan, etc. Then Wang Zhensheng was questioned and confessed, "My confession at the Public Security Bureau is not true," etc. Judge Zhou then questioned Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng together. Mao suddenly overturned his previous confession. Zhao Yunhong was then questioned and confessed, voluntarily withdrawing his appeal. Following this, Jin Daoguan, Zhu Guisheng, Chen Enming, and others all claimed that they firmly denied any involvement in the assassination. As a result, Judge Zhou argued that the original judgment did not contain any valid grounds for appeal. He ordered that the grounds for appeal should be submitted in writing while in the detention center, and a continued hearing would be scheduled at a later date.

### Confirmation of Paternity Case; Zhang Wubo Cannot Deny Responsibility

Escorted from Zhenjiang to Shanghai After Being Wanted by the Court; Zhang Still Denies and is Ordered to Post Bail for Further Trial

Zhang Wubo, a native of Zhenjiang, is 47 years old and works as a broker at Yongtai Chang Foreign Goods Store, No. 8, Taihe Lane, Fuzhou Road. In 1926, he met Fang A'ying (now 26 years old), a woman from Ningbo, and soon rented a room in the penthouse of No. 763, Binqing Lane, Tiantong Road, to live together. The following year, a son was born, named Zhimin. When Zhimin was three years old, Zhang suddenly claimed that he intended to go to Japan

to do business.

He paid Fang 300 yuan as living expenses, and from then on, Zhang disappeared and there was no news of him for four years. Later, in July 1933, Fang met Zhang on the road and asked Zhang to take the child back. Zhang refused, promising to give 700 yuan to settle the matter, which was later increased to 1,000 yuan, but Fang did not agree, so they broke up. Fang then sued Zhang for abandonment in court. Because Fang had no legal standing, she lost the case. Fang then

sued to confirm

that Zhimin was Zhang's child, and again failed. She appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, and the court finally ruled that Zhimin was Zhang's child. Zhang also disagreed and appealed to the Supreme Court. The court rejected the appeal and the case became final. Therefore, Zhang should have been legally obligated to raise Zhimin. Unexpectedly, Zhang still did not bear the responsibility and hid himself. Fang A'ying reported this to the General Police Station, which requested the First Special District Court to issue

an arrest warrant.

Until recently, Zhang Xiaolin, a Chinese detective of the police station, and Detective Mao Yunlong learned that Zhang was reported to be smoking opium in his hometown of Zhenjiang and was sent to the provincial drug rehabilitation hospital for investigation by the county government. They immediately carried the official letter and went to Zhenjiang and brought Zhang to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang hired lawyer Fan Gang for defense. First, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the facts of the case and presented the judgment of the Supreme Court, requesting that he be

punished according to the

crime of abandonment under Articles 294 and 295 of the Criminal Law. Zhang and Fang A'ying were ill due to travel fatigue, so they did not appear in court. When questioned, Zhang Wubo denied having any relationship with Fang A'ying. Chief Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division then asked if he had an opium addiction because the Zhenjiang County Government had requested that he be sent back for investigation after the case was over, but Zhang also denied it. Judge Qian then ruled that the case would be adjourned for one week for further hearing, and Zhang Wubo was allowed to post a shop bail of 2,000 yuan.

### Tongyi Creditors Now Have Relief Measures

Du Yuesheng and Others Follow Hangzhou Association's Request

Since Tongyi Trust Company declared its closure, the First Special District Local Court, together with the bankruptcy administrator, accountant Li Ding, and lawyer Li Mian, have held four creditors' meetings, but the number of creditors present at each meeting did not meet the statutory quorum, and the meetings were declared adjourned. Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and others, in view of the fact that the amount of Tongyi's debt was as high as more than four million yuan, which had a considerable impact on Shanghai's financial situation, specially proposed a reorganization plan, and most creditors also agreed that the execution of bankruptcy was not beneficial. Recently, the mediators Du Yuesheng and others received a letter from the Hangzhou Tongyi Company Creditors' Association requesting relief because the creditors were in urgent need of funds at the end of the year and had not been able to meet the statutory quorum of creditors' meetings to pass the reorganization plan. After discussion, Du, Yu, Wang, and other mediators believed that relief was indeed necessary. At that time, the Taiji Silver Company on the fifth floor of the Zhonghui Building on Avenue Edward VII was holding a special year-end loan program, so Du and others consulted with the silver company and obtained permission for the creditors of the Hangzhou Tongyi Company to discount their deposit slips for cash to provide relief. It is also reported that the local creditor group is following up with similar requests.

### Child Beaten to Death by Child in Hongqiao Dabaishan

### Broadcasting Association Petitions for Relief for Eight Radio Stations

Since the eight radio stations, including Zhou Xieji, members of the local private broadcasting station industry association, were instructed by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to cancel their broadcasting rights by the end of this month, the member radio stations have successively petitioned the association to forward their petitions to the Ministry of Communications and the Central Broadcasting Business Guidance Committee, requesting that they be considerate of the difficulties of businesses, withdraw the order, and immediately promulgate the equipment standards for private radio stations so that each station can comply with and improve them. Because the Ministry of Communications has not yet approved the petition, they are petitioning the Executive Yuan for relief. According to the original petition of the association, the reasons for the Ministry of Communications' order to revoke the licenses of each radio station by the end of January are: (1) the licenses have not been renewed for several years after they were issued, (2) the equipment is simple, and (3) the broadcast interferes with other stations. However, according to the regulations for the management of private radio stations, the term of the license is only six months. However, it has been verified that each radio station has completed construction and has been inspected and approved by the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to broadcast, and has paid the license fees in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of the management regulations. However, most of them have not been issued licenses. Therefore, in 1935, each radio station prepared the documents and fees to be paid and submitted them to the association for collection. However, at that time, the Telecommunications Bureau instructed that they had to wait for the Ministry of Communications to issue them and only ordered that the documents be returned. Therefore, the failure to renew the license cannot be regarded as the negligence of the radio stations. As for the equipment problem, there is no clear provision in the regulations for the management of private radio stations. Furthermore, the equipment diagrams of each radio station have been submitted for approval in accordance with Article 1 of the management regulations before they can obtain a license and start construction. Afterwards, they must submit a request for inspection and approval before they can broadcast. Furthermore, they have complied with the orders to add or modify equipment and have submitted a request for re-inspection. However, private radio stations, due to capital relations, cannot be compared with the equipment of state-owned radio stations. The simple equipment is not clearly regulated, so it cannot be regarded as the fault of the radio stations. As for the interference problem, the power of each radio station is not strong, and they have complied with the order to install filters. For example, the Anding Radio Station submitted a request to move due to the demolition of its building last year, but it has not been able to find a suitable location and has not broadcasted yet, so there is no possibility of interference. Moreover, private radio stations are businesses that gather capital from merchants and operate for maintenance. Once they are ordered to be demolished, their livelihoods are at stake. Private radio stations cannot be transferred like other businesses, so the capital spent will be wasted, and it is difficult to know what will happen in the future. Furthermore, Shanghai is the place where the essence of the country gathers and is the place where the country's listening audience gathers. At a time when foreign radio stations are increasing their power and broadcasting, the reason why Shanghai is not affected is that Shanghai's radio stations are scattered around the city. If there is any space, they will definitely take the opportunity to enter, and the central propaganda agencies will be reduced. Therefore, the result of revoking the licenses and stopping broadcasting is that the radio stations that are punished suddenly lose their livelihood, and internationally, it only gives others a good opportunity to broadcast and propagandize. Other radio stations are also in danger and do not know what to do. Therefore, they have petitioned the Ministry of Communications and the Central Broadcasting Business Guidance Committee to allow them to accept the lower-level situation and withdraw the order. However, because of the urgency of the situation, they are specially presenting the facts and requesting the President to review and approve the petition, be considerate of the difficulties of businesses, order the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order immediately, and promulgate the equipment standards that private radio stations can meet so that each station can comply with the order to improve. If they cannot improve, they will be shut down again. Before the equipment standards are issued, they should be temporarily allowed to broadcast as usual to maintain the people's livelihood. As for the sections stated by the Huaguang Radio Station, there is no lease or transfer situation. Please order the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order together, which would be very beneficial, etc. In addition, the association submitted the petition to the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order on the 16th of this month, but it has not been approved yet, and it also sent an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, requesting immediate approval.

Shen Bao Literary Supplement

### Seven-Fingered Man

— Ai Wu

After drinking alcohol, the next day when he got up, he was listless, his eyes were red. While yawning, he would scold the monks who ate meat and drank alcohol, saying they had no morals and would definitely go to hell after death. People who heard him scolding were happy and laughed, and he would immediately feel refreshed and happy to do some work. If there was no one to listen on this day and nowhere to scold, he would yawn until night as if he were having bad luck. This person was Qingru, a monk who didn't usually live in temples but enjoyed traveling, and who only had seven fingers.

I knew him, and had been with him for a long time, in a roadside inn. When I discovered this strange habit of his, I mocked him and said:

"You're practically scolding yourself! Listen to my advice, you might as well quietly and drunkenly drink alcohol and eat meat."

After I pointed it out, he felt a little embarrassed and stammered:

"I don't feel well if I don't scold!"

Immediately, he waved his hand, which was scratching his bald head, with disgust, and his habit of scolding flared up again.

"Shouldn't I be scolded often? I want you to point at my nose and scold me, but you're all like a duck's webbed feet, all in a line, saying one thing but thinking another, or else, flattering to my face and laughing behind my back. It makes me feel stuffy in my stomach, it's really uncomfortable. You have to know that when a person understands that he has done something wrong, but there is no way to correct it, then only a scolding will make him feel better. Don't say that, let me tell you a story from a book of virtue, have you heard of it? It says that a person stole someone else's chicken and ate it, and then grew chicken feathers all over his body, which he couldn't pull out, and if he pulled hard, it would hurt terribly! So what should he do? There was simply no way, and he was so ashamed that he couldn't face anyone. Later, he happened to meet a monk, who was already halfway to becoming a celestial being, definitely not like me, drinking alcohol and eating meat, and even whoring. The monk told him that his stealing of the chicken was ill-fated, he just happened to have met good people, and hadn't been scolded or cursed at, so his sin on this side couldn't be expunged, and he had to carry it all on his body. If he wanted to get the chicken feathers pulled out, it would be best to go to those good people, kowtow, say that he was wrong to steal the chicken, and would never dare to do it again, and beg him to scold him. The chicken thief thanked the monk, and quickly went to do it. Who knew that those good people were really virtuous, and wouldn't scold him no matter what. Later, he begged bitterly, and told him what the monk said, saying that scolding him would be a good deed. Only then did he agree. If you hadn't seen it with your own eyes, you might not believe it, but it was really strange, but before they had scolded him twice, the chicken feathers began to fall off one by one. So, it seems, the most powerful thing in the world is being wronged, but not fighting back, not cursing back."

When he scolded to this point, his cloudy eyes became clear and bright, and there was naturally no shadow of yawning on the corners of his mouth. As for this kind of story, in my opinion, it was just nonsense and not worth refuting. However, in his mind, I understood that this had created his philosophy of life, and had even become the basis for daily expiation of sins. Therefore, I teased him and said:

"Judging from your past scolding, I've long been wondering why you're not afraid of falling into hell? It turns out you're the one who understands this method! Haha."

His face turned red, and he argued disapprovingly:

"Your mouth is really sharp! I have no choice, that's why I'm like this. If I had known it would turn out this way, why would I have become a monk? (Then he raised his left hand, which only had three fingers) Why would I have burned my fingers to offer to the Buddha?"

Naturally, I understood him, and admitted that there must be another reason why he was like this, but on the surface, I still teased him and said:

"See, you're not convinced! Didn't you just complain that others wouldn't scold you? With just a few words like that, you say people are sharp, then who would dare to point at your nose and scold you?"

So, he scratched his bald head embarrassedly, and stuttered with a smile:

"People are just that kind of muddle-headed thing. You can't always do things according to your own heart, you have to mess yourself up. When I was a temple manager, my master scolded and beat me every day, wasn't that good? All the sins of eating alcohol and meat were eliminated. But, that's how it is in theory, but people are always people, not made of paper, so, in the end, I still slipped away and ran out to live this wandering alms-seeking life. At first, I was free and unfettered, but later I felt that if this went on, my sins would become even more serious, and I became more and more uncomfortable, so I planned to run back to the temple again. It would be good to be scolded by that old monk, but when I thought of the fierceness with which he scolded, who would want to bring bad luck on themselves? In this case, I could only scold myself."

I laughed and said:

"Actually, what I've heard is that you're scolding other monks who eat, drink, and gamble in every sentence."

He tugged at his round-collared robe and said:

"Am I the one who dropped this off?"

"Don't say anymore, old sly fox, I know, you're an old monk scolding people, and a young monk eating, drinking, and gambling at the same time, so you have the best of both worlds and are very carefree!"

Seeing that I was being so harsh to him, he shook his bald head and said painfully:

"Friend, I haven't fallen to that point yet, I haven't fallen to that point yet."

Immediately, he sighed, blaming himself:

"Alas, I deserve to be scolded! I deserve to be scolded!"

I said solemnly:

"It seems that you shouldn't have become a monk in the first place, you really took the wrong path."

"No!" he replied just as solemnly, raising his incomplete hand, "I felt that this path was right from the start! Do you know how this finger disappeared? (He pointed at the little finger of his left hand with the index finger of his right hand) It was scolded away by my dad. I secretly gambled a few times, and he jumped up and down cursing me, scolding me so badly that I was heartbroken, and I couldn't bear it anymore, so I dragged a kitchen knife, and without saying a word, I chopped off my finger. At the time, he was very remorseful, saying that if I didn't gamble, it was fine, why did I have to do that?"

I also exclaimed:

"You really went too far."

"Too far! You don't know, at the time, I felt like there was a pot of fire burning in my heart, if I didn't do that, he would simply scold me to death. When he felt remorse, I felt much better, and even when I saw the blood gushing out of my finger, I felt that it was a worthwhile thing to do. Who knew what happened later, I was really a damned fellow, in less than a year, I was secretly playing cards and throwing dice again, don't laugh, maybe if you were in my situation, you might have done the same thing. I'm telling you, my dad's method was really too much, he kept me locked up at home all day, afraid that I would spend money, afraid that I would spend money, and he wouldn't even pay for my school fees to go to the county seat, he was just so stingy! How can a young man live a lifeless life at home all the time? This way, the problem came, at first I secretly took a break once or twice, but later it became more and more rotten, I completely forgot about the matter of chopping off my finger. When my dad found out that I had secretly taken out a lot of money and lost it all, he was furious. At first, he gave me a solid beating, and later he wanted to kick me out the door. Relatives and family members came to persuade him, but he wouldn't listen, saying that even if I chopped off both my arms, he wouldn't believe that I would change my ways. As for myself, looking at my chopped-off finger, I felt that even if I was determined to change, I wouldn't dare to have any confidence. In this case, I could only become a monk, and let the Bodhisattva dispose of me as he saw fit. Don't laugh, when I first entered the temple, seeing that everything was clean everywhere, I believed that I would get better. I felt an indescribable joy every morning and evening when I heard the sound of the bell. I lived there for two years, never leaving the temple even a step, spending all day reciting Buddha and cultivating myself. I even thought, if my dad, that old thing, came and saw me, would he still dare to say nonsense? I was really proud of myself. Who knew that we unlucky people would never become Buddhas. Alas."

Speaking to this point, he sighed deeply, and only after I urged him did he continue.

"It was just one day when the temple was doing some kind of event, and many laywomen and lay grandmothers came. I was greatly surprised, why did those young women and tender wives, whom I had always been accustomed to seeing, seem so...alas."

He blushed embarrassedly.

"The next day, the temple became quiet again, but I became uneasy, I even forgot how many times to ring the bell. When I was sweeping the floor, I saw the footprints left on the green moss by the stairs yesterday, and I was a little dazed, not wanting to sweep them away. I was thinking about going outside all day. The red and green wild flowers by the small ditch, which I had never paid much attention to before, also made me very concerned. Even the sunlight shining in the temple seemed not as bright or beautiful as the sunlight in the fields. Day by day, I even hated the sound of the bell, which I used to like to hear, and the smell of sandalwood, which I liked to smell. I secretly told an old monk about this situation, and he said that I was possessed by a demon. I asked him if there was any way to be saved? He said there was, but it was a little bitter, which was to burn my fingers to offer to the Buddha.

While raising his left hand, he continued.

Looking at it, my fourth finger, that's how it ended up. At the time, it really hurt to the bone, and I felt dizzy, and had no evil thoughts at all. Later, when the finger healed, huh, evil thoughts still crept in. In this case, everything was over.

Alas, I deserve to be scolded! I deserve to be scolded!"

His dejected appearance deeply moved me, so I made a plan for him:

"Actually, you can return to secular life! Are you still afraid of others scolding you?"

"I'm not afraid of being scolded, actually I want people to scold me. It's just this skin that has harmed me, having worn it for more than ten years, I've become someone who can't carry anything on my shoulders or lift anything with my hands."

He said with emotion, raising his right hand to straighten his clothes.

I saw that the little finger of his right hand was also missing, and I wanted to ask what the reason was, but I was afraid of causing him even more pain, so I didn't ask.

Reading Notes

### Caesar and the Masses

— Nangong Li

I have seen the English translation of Chepayev published by the "Overseas Soviet Workers Publishing Federation," and I have also seen the Chinese film adapted from this book, translated as Chapaev. The impression that this story gave me was consistent both times: I was amazed by the power of the masses expressed in this historical fact. I felt that they understood what was beneficial and harmful, knew right from wrong, and made definite choices, not as foolish as some people imagine. And I also thought that the masses in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, are not necessarily foolish. Mr. So-and-so read Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and was shocked by the "blindness" and "lack of reason" of the masses, and from this decided that he "still needed a little experience in being human." This was said in the past. Three years later, I don't know if he has that "experience" now. However, the ancient Roman masses depicted by Shakespeare, although foolish, actually have reason. They also want to recognize right and wrong, and what is beneficial and harmful, and are not blind. It's just that because they are in the dark, even though they have their eyes open, they still can't see anything. Mr. So-and-so only paid attention to the five senses of the masses, but forgot about the time of Caesar.

However, the focus of the article is not here. He also "painfully" compares China to Rome now, "painfully" describes the chicken-greeting-chicken, dog-greeting-dog masses of "recent centuries." "Ignorance," "blindness," "lack of reason," and being easily "incited" are of course unavoidable accusations. But, I also thought: Mr. So-and-so has forgotten the actual situation, and forgotten the oppression that the Caesar-style system gave to the masses. There are definitely not that many congenital mental defectives in the world.

Not even in ancient Rome.

The Roman citizens who loved freedom and hated the imperial system were killed, imprisoned, and exiled batch after batch under Caesar's rule, and finally only a few gray slaves who dared not have any hope were left. Therefore, Caesar had an army behind him to assist his ambitions; but the Republicans in the Senate didn't even have a backing. This is not accidental. People who sigh at the birds in cages and blame them for not being able to fly far are typical of those who sneer at the ignorance of the masses.

However, besides scoffers, there are also zealous patriots in the world.

In 44 BC, Caesar was stabbed to death in the Senate at the foot of the statue of his enemy Pompey the Great. Shakespeare used a realistic style and excellent artistic skill to depict the last moments of this invincible hero. When Brutus followed Casca and thrust his dagger, Caesar cried out in surprise:

"What, Brutus, are you also doing this? Then let me die!"

Caesar died, and the citizens of Rome regained their freedom and light. Unexpectedly, thousands of years later, the Caesar-style system has been revived, doesn't Mussolini want to rebuild a Roman Empire? If you say that the people of Italy in the 20th century are all a "chicken-greeting-chicken, dog-greeting-dog" mass, I will never believe it.

I also don't believe that China only has such masses.

Even in recent events, the resistance of the volunteer army in Guanwai, and the national salvation of students and workers in the country, fully demonstrate that the Chinese masses have reason and know right from wrong. However, due to the limitations of the objective environment, they may sometimes be depressed. This is not their inherent ignorance.

### Overcoming

— Ouyang Shan

The story of how the blind Shu Gen overcame the female secretary, Pei Pa Xi, who looked down on him—a sociable woman with no knowledge of social matters—is as follows:

Every Sunday afternoon, Shu Gen lectured at gatherings of young people. He wore a plain, pure white suit, a black tie, and his shoes and hat were of light colors. His dark crystal glasses were too heavy, so he and the female secretary, Pei Pa Xi, went to Nanjing Road and chose a pair of tea-crystal lenses that would enhance his handsomeness. Young students arrived in luxurious taxis to greet him.

"Mr. Li Gen—" they bowed respectfully, their heads tilted, their hands resting on the gray hard buttons of their military training uniforms. Their bones were not fully developed, and their hair was long, uneven, and unruly. They liked to use two-character pen names and refused to tell others their real surnames. "Sit down, sit down," the editor greeted them warmly, shaking hands enthusiastically with each other.

On the podium, those poor, mysterious students, with their voices as underdeveloped as their bodies, whispered a few introductory words and then slipped away. When the editor, Shu Gen, heard the applause welcoming him, he walked forward, calmly bowed, and stood on the podium like a very serious plaster statue. "Respectable young gentlemen—the lifeblood of the nation, the vital spirit of the people—" he began. He invaded the realms of philosophy, political science, and general social issues with his widely disseminated knowledge. His language was found to have an unprecedented agility and acuteness... Finally, he said:

"Just as I said, the literary world must also use you, the respectable young gentlemen with vigorous creativity, as a standing army to drive out the muddle-headed and senile fellows. I am waiting for your expulsion!... I—have an irreparable physiological defect, just like what your Xiao Su said: a blind man! I fight with every bookstore owner to find certainty, but damn it, they think pseudo-youths are not qualified for their products, those slaves!..."

Sitting in the carriage taking him home, he discovered that his carelessly spoken words, which were not fully prepared, had precisely met the ardent needs of the young people. They clapped for a long time, shouting and expressing their unrestrained joy, surrounding him and not letting him leave.... He was dazed and surprised, his whole body numb. The female secretary anxiously asked him about the results of each lecture, but he only smiled and nodded, unable to give a definite report.

Accepting Pei Pa Xi's request, he took her to the lecture. Sitting reservedly at the edge of the young people, she saw with her own eyes that they were frantically addicted to him, like Cantonese sedan carriers addicted to singers.

"Bassre, please draft this for me, listen to what I say."

Her face flushed, and she accepted Wan Gen's instructions with trepidation, listening with excessive caution to every word he said, working piously and diligently.

Then one day, Li Gen said solemnly to Pei Pa Xi.

"Look at my achievements, look...! Alas! It's a pity you can't believe it.—A serious struggle, I have begun—I am determined to be the number one person in all of China!... This person, who saved the personality of all editors!"

Pei Pa Xi, as if inexplicably subjected to a major insult, fell into a state of distress, not speaking or singing, walking listlessly without any spirit. She did not believe Li Gen could do anything better, but she could not resist him either.

### Thinking of Drama

— Leng Mo

What I want to write about now is drama, but I don't know whether to admit that I understand a little about drama or that I don't understand anything at all.

With courage, perhaps in five minutes, I can confidently call myself a playwright.

In the first minute, write a script:

"Curtain up. A cat runs across the quiet, empty stage. Curtain down."

This script can easily produce a director and stage manager in two minutes.

With two minutes left, write a review. Discuss the difference between a cat and a dog, and thus how Chinese Dadaism differs from Italian Dadaism.

To become a playwright in this way would be too absurd; but to only become a minor playwright in this way would be too miserable.

In situations where everything has to be compromised, we already have many all-rounders, so why add another?

But to squeeze into the crowd of all-rounders, one must not be denied by the experts.

The conditions for not being denied by the experts are mostly unrelated to the play itself.

Regarding the play, the only thing a practitioner has to do is admit the inaccessibility of the expert's theories or techniques.

Without theory, without technique, what kind of drama would it be? This question is precisely what leaves room for the experts to show off their abilities.

Sometimes experts also have to try to be all-rounders, but that is when they temporarily abandon their role as experts.

Therefore, there is no need to hope or regret that the dramas produced by experts carry an expert aura.

As for whether a playwright understands drama, a fairly conclusive answer can be reached here. But at the same time, one also feels that, as a reader or audience member, the question of understanding has a different effect.

I don't know if anyone has said that drama is something for the audience to choose. Our drama, however, traditionally chooses its audience.

The era when being chosen was admired was the golden age of the theater.

The selection of Kunqu opera still exists, and its pride has not diminished, but it can no longer have an effect on the general audience.

Pihuang opera still has great potential, but although there are expectant voters, the old voters often reject it, and the result will be the same as Kunqu opera, a national demise.

Spoken drama has never reached the point where being chosen is an honor; its golden age has not yet come.

The lament that too few people understand drama can often be heard.

At the same time, some people lament that they cannot see dramas and are bored reading scripts in their rooms.

Reading scripts ignites the desire to see plays. But occasional opportunities to see plays always make people feel that reading scripts is more satisfying.

Some scripts can't be staged at all, some people say, but others say that all scripts can be staged.

Before Eugene O'Neill met the people at the Provincetown Players, no one believed that his scripts could be performed.

It is excusable for established theater managers not to take risks.

Dilemmas turn into reasons, and reasons turn into rules, and easily followed rules are naturally easily insisted upon.

What the general public can understand is naturally often not the same as what people in the theater understand.

In conclusion, we cannot say that we understand drama.

Writer Introduction

### The Death of Ostrovsky

— Lin Qi

A Great Soviet Disabled Writer

Famous for his book “How the Steel Was Tempered”

The young Soviet disabled writer Nikolai Ostrovski ended his heroic struggle on December 12, 1936.

Ostrovsky's short life was spent enduring incredible hardships. In the early days of the revolution, he was still a child, washing dishes in a Ukrainian train station canteen, enduring the scolding and kicking of the owner and servants. But the movement at that time helped the development of his wit and courage, and he threw himself into the movement. He greatly assisted the secret work at that time. At the age of fifteen, he, like all other young people, dedicated his youthful blood to the revolutionary war, joining the Ukrainian Red Cavalry and the Communist Youth League. After countless hand-to-hand combats with the enemy, he charged through many enemy fortifications on horseback. Finally, in a pursuit, a huge shell exploded in front of him, seriously injuring him.

In the Red Army hospital, after proper recuperation, he was able to temporarily regain his health. He immediately plunged into the whirlpool of work again. In industry, farms, and railways, with his inexhaustible sincerity and enthusiasm, he helped the economic and cultural construction of the new society. Soon, typhoid fever knocked him down again. But he broke free from the clutches of death again, stood up, and still participated brilliantly in the propaganda, organization, and leadership of the expanded Communist Youth League work. He constantly fought against various deviations, striking blows at bureaucracy and empty talkers. His young, brave, and powerful steps shattered all obstacles and poisonous insects along the way. His activities brought glory and victory. The gates of life were unfolding before him.

At this time, the long-hidden old wound suddenly flared up, and the disease began to erode his body. Headaches, nervous system weakness, and the strong attack of typhoid fever made him lose his ability to work, and he had to have a longer period of recuperation. But as soon as the recuperation period was over, regardless of the doctor's concern about his illness and advice not to work so excessively, he immediately returned to the working group and led the activities of the Communist Youth League in an industrial area. He could not live without work. In a letter to his brother, he wrote: "In this world, there is nothing more terrible for me than falling behind on the battlefield. It is simply unimaginable." But disaster did not let go of its prey because of this. His leg was run over by a car, so he had to undergo surgery and recuperate again.

Misfortune happened one after another. The left leg also became paralyzed, followed by the arms and wrists. At this time, he was only twenty-four years old, the time when life was full of color and fragrance, work and love; yet he had to endure the pain of losing the ability to move his limbs and lying helplessly in bed. Modern medicine still has no ability to help him escape this tragic situation. But he did not despair, he still struggled. He asked to take on some cultural work that did not require physical activity, but was refused because he had not received a good education in the past and did not write well.

Subsequently, greater disaster shattered his body and mind. He lost his eyes forever, sinking into boundless darkness. He could no longer see the sun, flowers, the smiles of comrades, and lively youth. He held the cold pistol in his hand, wanting to end his life in this way several times. But he was ultimately a brave fighter in life, and he overcame that shameful temptation.

People performed another complex surgery for him, cutting his spine and twisting his neck, but all in vain. With his remaining life and vitality, he began to help the construction of the new society from another aspect. He decided to engage in literature. His close friends in the Communist Youth League sent him a radio, and everyone took turns reading works to him aloud. He diligently studied grammar and classical literature. Under these difficult conditions, he began to write his first work. He could often recite entire paragraphs or pages of what he had written. If there was no one nearby to immediately record a good composition or sentence that he suddenly thought of, he would tell the radio his ideas and record them on a record. He sent his debut work out for others to critique, but the post office lost it all. But he was not discouraged by this.

From 1930 to 1934, it took him four years to write his own experiences into that shocking masterpiece, "How the Steel Was Tempered" (How the Steel Was Tempered L), in two volumes. In this book, he successfully portrayed the attitude of a childhood soldier who grew up in the revolution and was tempered into steel by the revolutionary reality. It is not accurate to say that this is a purely autobiographical replica. Although there are still some shortcomings in artistic achievement, the overflowing youthful spirit, fresh strength, brave spirit, and the thorough realism depicted, he created for us a "typical character in a typical environment." It is no accident that he was able to receive the Order of Lenin.

Following "How the Steel Was Tempered," with the assistance of the Sochi City Committee, Ostrovsky continued to work ten to twelve hours a day, working on the film script of this novel, and also engaged in his third novel, "Son of the Storm." In his zombie-like body, there was a fiery passion and steel-like faith. However, human power still cannot completely conquer nature. This great and young heart finally stopped beating last month. How can we not express our mourning and regret with the most sublime respect for his tragic and short life, and at the same time be encouraged and infected ourselves?

Discussion on Fur Coats and Overcoats

### Fur Talk

— Yichen

Between the invasion of foreign woolen fabrics, the general fashion-conscious modern woman, in order to show off her curves, is unwilling to use fur to make fur coats. This is an ironclad fact. They would rather wear single-layer cheongsams in this winter, with narrow sleeves and slender waists, and put on a foreign-made woolen overcoat on the outside, regardless of shivering skin and chattering teeth. Some even don't wear an overcoat, freezing their faces red. I think this is their own fault. In practical terms, they are not saving money, but exposing their curves. You should know that wearing a fur coat can prevent internal heat from escaping and external cold from invading, giving you the courage to resist the God of Winter and saving a great deal of money for the national economy. I hope that fashionable ladies will wear more fur coats. It is beneficial to yourself and the country. Why not do it? Moreover, the Sage Confucius not only liked to wear fur clothes, but also had artistic designs for his fur clothes! I'm not just talking nonsense. There is such a record in the "Analects of Confucius, Township Party": "A black lambskin coat with a black lining, a white deerskin coat with plain clothes, a yellow fox fur coat, a long casual coat, with a short right sleeve." In these few words, it covers how to prepare fur goods, how to design and match them, where to wear what fur goods, and what size should the fur goods be. Because it is a lambskin coat, it is matched with black clothes, a deerskin coat with plain clothes, and a fox fur coat with yellow clothes. Isn't this Confucius's artistic design? Moreover, in order to keep warm, he often lengthened his fur clothes, and in order to make work more convenient, he shortened the right sleeve slightly. Now, in the nationwide atmosphere of respecting Confucius, we should follow Confucius's advocacy of fur clothes. Fashionable ladies, you should quickly realize that this is your responsibility as fashionable ladies. It can also save a lot of money. Although you can't imitate Yanzi wearing a fox fur coat for thirty years, at least you won't think it's worn out in three or five years. Furthermore, according to the season, the "Rites of Zhou" says: "The Tian Guan Siqiu is in charge of making large fur coats to supply the king's sacrificial clothing. Good fur coats are presented in mid-autumn, and finished fur coats are presented in late autumn." Moreover, in the current winter, there is nothing better than heavy fur coats to save you from the cold.

Now I will summarize a few stories about fur to conclude.

Buying Wine with Su Suo Fur Coat. Sima Xiangru and Wen Jun returned to Chengdu. Because they were worried and unhappy, they thought that wine could relieve their worries, but they had no money. So they had to sell their Su Suo fur coat to Yang Chang to buy wine to relieve their worries. Finding pleasure in poverty is not a new thing. The "Western Capital Miscellaneous Records" records it like this: "When Sima Xiangru first returned to Chengdu with Zhuo Wenjun, he lived in poverty and worry. He sold his Su Suo fur coat to a merchant named Yang Chang to buy wine and have fun with Wen Jun."

Stealing and Offering Fox White Fur Coat to Save Himself. Qin imprisoned Lord Mengchang, and Lord Mengchang asked for help from Xin Ji, the concubine of King Zhao of Qin. But Xin Ji did not propose any conditions, only wanting the fox white fur coat that had been offered to King Zhao, so that Lord Mengchang could be released. This was difficult for Lord Mengchang. Fortunately, a guest was able to steal like a dog, so he went to steal the fox white fur coat and offered it to Xin Ji. Then Lord Mengchang was released. This is recorded in the "Historical Records."

Not Taking Off Fur Coat in Summer. The "Essentials of Categories" states: "Zhang Zhihe often made fur coats with coarse cloth, which his sister-in-law made herself. Even in the summer, he would not take it off." This is too ridiculous. Does he really wear a fur coat all year round like in the Arctic Ocean?

### An Economist's Economic Words

— Hu Kai

Only Fur Goods Can Resist the Cold in Winter

Old Chen has a round face. He has a mustache. He always has a smile on his face. He is short and fat. At first glance, he is a person over fifty years old. His shining eyes and fluent eloquence show that he is a shrewd businessman. He owns a double-front rice store. His business is very developed. Although he has assets of forty to fifty thousand, he values money like his life. He usually does not easily waste a penny. He often says, "A penny can kill a hero." You must think of nothing when you have something. Don't wait until you have nothing. If you want something, you must weigh everything carefully and choose the cheapest way to do it. The neighbors called him an "economic expert" for calculating four ounces of bones from an eggshell. He did not deny it himself. Yes, Old Chen does have some skills. When buying things, they must be cheap and of good quality.

Every winter, Old Chen himself, Old Chen's wife, and two sons and a daughter all wear fur goods. This made the neighbors suspicious. They secretly said. Old Chen is frugal in everything else, but how can he be so extravagant in what he wears?

One day, Mr. Lu, the owner of the cloth shop next door, invited Mr. Chen to have a New Year's Eve dinner. Old Chen thought. The friends in the cloth shop are very well dressed. I have always been inferior to them. Today, I will not show weakness. I want to compete with them. He casually asked his wife to bring the newly made fur coat. His wife readily agreed. He ran upstairs to take out a newly made fur coat and ran downstairs to hand it to Old Chen. Old Chen smiled and put the new coat on his body, proud and happy, and went. He stepped into the cloth shop's guest room. He saw three tables sitting in a circle, waiting for him to arrive. Old Chen sat down without ceremony. He didn't know what was going on. The guests at the table stared intently at Old Chen. After two rounds of wine, the host, Mr. Lu, couldn't help but open his mouth and said to Old Chen. Mr. Chen, do you know why the guests here today are all looking at you? Old Chen answered very happily. It's because I'm wearing a newly made fur coat. The guests at the table laughed. Mr. Lu replied to Old Chen. Mr. Chen, I'm not joking with you. Our store eats two stones of rice every month. If you calculate it for a year, how much business do you do with us? Besides cutting some single-layer clothes and some domestically produced lining cloth, you rarely trade with our woolen and camel hair lining goods. Don't you wear cotton? Old Chen smiled and replied. Mr. Lu, don't you see that we are wearing fur robes? Before he finished speaking, Xiao Wang at the same table interjected. Old Chen. Others say you are economic. You are really not economic at all. Just talking about clothes, your whole family wears fur goods. Each piece costs dozens of gold. Then this expense is large. Is this supposed to be economic? Old Chen took a sip of wine. He ate some dishes. He paused. He smiled and said to Xiao Wang. Xiao Wang. Others respect me as an "economic expert." I also admit that I am a shrewd economic expert. Is my calculation wrong? Ordinary cotton robes also cost ten or eight yuan to wear for one or two years. The cotton will harden and have no ability to resist the cold. If you make it beautiful, then foreign camel hair at one yuan and five corners a foot and Matani at one yuan and five corners a foot will not be effective if you wear it on your body. If you spend thirty or forty yuan to buy a leather tube, match it with a solid face, and wear it warmly and lightly. You will wear it this year and next year. You will wear it again the year after. You will wear it every year. When others see me wearing a fur robe, they always say that I am rich. Wearing a fur robe every year is actually much cheaper than wearing a cotton robe and a camel hair robe. Like the fur robe I am wearing, I bought it when I first arrived in Shanghai. Now it has been more than twenty years. I have only changed the face. It is still a fur robe. Mr. Lu joked again. Mr. Chen. Are you really uneconomical this year? How come you are even wearing a fur coat? Old Chen said. What can I say? I am getting older year by year. My body is getting weaker year by year. It is really unbearable to run out wearing only a fur robe. I wanted to make a coat to wear. I ran to a suit and overcoat store. I asked about the price of woolen overcoats. They said that they were foreign new arrivals. Each piece was a special price of eighty yuan. The workmanship was free. I was so scared that I jumped out. I ran home. On the way, I thought. A woolen overcoat. The special price is eighty yuan. Wearing it on the body is said to resist the cold. I am afraid it will be ineffective. It is said to be beautiful. First, it is not like me. Second, there is nothing special about it. When I got home, I talked about this matter. My son said, "Father, don't you know that the fur industry is promoting fur coats this year? In order to strive for universality, the fur industry is especially aiming at 'cheap and good quality.'" Since Father wants to make a coat, you might as well take a look. I stood up and ran. I walked to the fur industry center area. I spent fifty yuan to make a high-quality fur coat. It just happened to be invited by Mr. Lu to eat a New Year's Eve dinner. I want to show off. I put on this new fur coat. It is indeed warm and beautiful. It is very suitable for me. I am the only one who is respected in front of the public. Haha! Old Chen said a lot. Then he drank a glass of wine. He said again. Based on my decades of experience. In winter, the only cold-resistant material is fur goods. It is the most economical and the most durable. Besides fur goods, there is nothing better.

After a while, the banquet dispersed. Everyone admired Old Chen's insightful opinions. The sea deeply imprinted Old Chen's fur coat, which was uniquely healthy, and kept in mind the experienced words that fur goods are the only items that can resist the cold in winter.

### Preliminary Thoughts on Reforming Leather Robes

— Zhou Siyong

When the north wind howls and white snow dances, this publication has specially opened a "Leather Robe and Overcoat Discussion" column, which is indeed well-suited to practical needs, especially since clothing is so closely related to people.

In winter, the purpose of clothing is, of course, first and foremost to keep warm. As for the clothes that are most effective at keeping warm, there are mainly two types: leather robes and overcoats. This is also the scope of this article's discussion.

When it comes to leather robes and overcoats, which is better and which is worse? I believe that leather robes are superior to overcoats. If you don't believe me, there are facts to prove it: First, leather robes are cheaper than overcoats. The cheapest, most inferior overcoat costs at least fourteen or fifteen yuan. If paired with a suit, scarf, etc., it will cost no less than thirty or forty yuan. If you spend fourteen or fifteen yuan to buy a leather robe, the quality will already be quite good. The padded jacket and trousers worn underneath are also much cheaper than a suit, making it very economical. Second, leather robes are more effective at keeping warm than overcoats. Leather items become warm as soon as you put them on, and the longer you wear them, the warmer they get, feeling like a stove when worn. But overcoats are short, stiff, and thin, and not as warm as a leather robe when first worn, yet they are incredibly heavy. Third, leather robes are lighter than overcoats. Thick wool overcoats in winter are often as heavy as a dead ox. If someone with a weak body wears one, they will feel overwhelmed by the weight. Leather robes, on the other hand, are lighter than overcoats, soft and not as suffocating as overcoats. Although lower-quality leather robes can also be heavy, they are still much lighter than lower-quality overcoats.

While leather robes have the advantages mentioned above, they are not without their shortcomings. The most prominent ones are: First, they are too long, making walking and getting on vehicles inconvenient. Second, it's not easy to wash them when they get dirty. Third, the lower part is too wide, allowing wind to easily enter. Fourth, the neck area is too thin and cannot withstand the cold wind. To address these issues, the following reforms are necessary:

First, the length of the robe should be shortened, preferably about two inches above the heel. The fur should not drag on the ground, making it easier to move around. It will also be less likely to get dirty. Dr. Liu Hong'en, President of Shanghai University, is a strong advocate for shortening robes. His robes are less than three inches below the knee, and many people, especially university professors, follow his example.

Second, the current manufacturing method should be improved to make leather robes easier to wash. The best way to do this is to not sew the leather and the robe material together. Instead, use snaps to fasten them. The lining should be made in two layers, which will make it more stylish and avoid the unsightly appearance of snaps. When washing is needed, the leather can be removed. At the same time, it can also be worn as an unlined robe in the spring and autumn, which is both convenient and economical.

Third, the lower part should be made smaller, no more than one foot and two inches long. The side with the buttons should have two more buttons to prevent wind from blowing in. The advantage of overcoats is that the lower part is tight and small, which is worth emulating.

Fourth, there should be two collars, one regular one for when the weather is not too cold, and one made of leather, which should be higher and larger. When it is cold, it can be turned up to protect the neck and prevent cold wind from entering. The sewing method should also use snaps, so that the collar can be chosen based on the temperature, avoiding the problems of being too cold or too hot.

If leather robes undergo the above reforms, they will be much more comfortable to wear and much better than bulky overcoats!

### Leather Robes and Overcoats – Suitable for the Tastes of the Chinese People

— Jianqing

When I was a child, I heard a joke about a French student who came back to admire the moon and said that everything in China was inferior, even the moon was not as big as the one seen in Paris. Although this statement is absurd, there is an explanation: in Paris, the prosperity of the city highlights the brilliance of the moon. Conversely, in the Chinese countryside, the surroundings are quiet, which highlights the blandness of the moon. The difference between the two is easy to see, but we cannot criticize which one is good and which one is bad. The moon in Paris is made more luxurious by the neon lights on the ground, while the moon in the countryside is made more pure by the natural setting. Each has its own beauty and suits the tastes of different people.

Since the 19th century, thanks to modern inventions – steamships – and our thousands-year-old legacy – the compass – all the material civilization of the West has been crammed into this closed-off China. They have cannons, so we have to learn to build them. They have warships, so we have to buy them. That's fine, but in this era of change, a kind of blind faith in the West has emerged. For example, they have foreign languages, so we should learn them. However, we should not abandon the original writing of our motherland, but should further study and improve it. This is because we Chinese naturally have our own characteristics and special environment, and we cannot cut our feet to fit the shoes and cater to all Western imports.

Clothing is one of the four major necessities of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and it is the most intimate to people. In this regard, Western suits have their advantages, and Chinese clothing has its advantages. For example, the advantage of Western suits is in their mental stimulation, while the advantage of Chinese clothing is in its comfort. From a physiological point of view, it avoids the constraints of many belts, allowing blood to circulate naturally. At the same time, it is also better at protecting body temperature than Western suits. Western Europeans also gradually improved and manufactured their Western suits. Now, the Chinese, with their different environment, climate, and geology, want to directly and completely accept them without making any improvements, which will of course not be suitable.

Human beings have the ability to improve and progress. We feel that Western houses do not suit the tastes of the Chinese people, so there are houses that combine Chinese and Western styles, with a Chinese exterior and a Western interior. Why do we still stick to the old ways when it comes to the problem of Western suits, especially overcoats? Why do we wear wool overcoats in the cold winter wind without thinking about making improvements?

Therefore, we should support the promotion of leather robes and overcoats. The advantages of leather robes and overcoats are:

㊀ Warmth: Everyone admits that animal skin has the best warmth retention. The purpose of an overcoat is of course to keep warm. Wearing a wool overcoat in the middle and northern parts of China in winter is not enough. This shortcoming of wool overcoats is the advantage of leather robes and overcoats.

㊁ Comfort: Leather robes and overcoats are made of leather. Wool overcoats are too stiff and restrictive. Leather and fur are soft, light, and comfortable.

㊂ Beauty: Leather robes and overcoats have complex colors, unlike the simple colors of wool overcoats. We dare not say that more complex colors are necessarily beautiful, but I believe that with good harmony, they must be more beautiful.

㊃ Patriotism: China's northwest produces leather. Wearing leather robes and overcoats is promoting domestic products and reversing China's economic misfortunes.

Some of the above advantages may not be suitable for Westerners, so we can know that the biggest advantage of leather robes and overcoats is still that they are suitable for the Chinese people, which avoids the need to cut our feet to fit the shoes, which would be a major reform.

### A Worthy-of-Promoting Outdated Garment – The Leather Outer Jacket

— Jieyu

Of the clothing styles from the Qing Dynasty, two are worth promoting: (1) using the cheongsam to replace women's skirts, and (2) using the leather outer jacket to replace the overcoat. Now the cheongsam has become a common garment, but the outer jacket is still regarded as an antique, and no one has promoted it, which is regrettable.

In the early years of the Republic of China, no one would have believed that the cheongsam would become a common garment for women. Because at that time, the costumes of Manchuria were all regarded as remnants of the imperial system, and people could not ban them fast enough. Who would dare to openly promote them? However, the simplicity of the facts can eventually defeat unnecessary psychological obstacles. Moreover, the establishment of the Republic of China originally proclaimed the five races of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan to be united in one republic. We should learn from each other's strengths to make these five major ethnic groups assimilate into the national race of the Republic of China. Therefore, for the customs, habits, and clothing among these five races, we can only distinguish between good and bad, right and wrong, and we must not have discriminatory or contemptuous ideas. This is what I should explain to you before promoting the outer jacket style from the Qing Dynasty.

Replacing the overcoat with a leather robe originally fulfilled the obligation of promoting domestic products. However, the procedure of putting it on and taking it off is relatively troublesome. Moreover, two long garments tightly wrapped around the body are inconvenient for walking. Therefore, those who promote it do so with great enthusiasm, but those who wear it are still reluctantly following. As a result, it is ultimately difficult to popularize it. If the leather robe on the outside can be changed to an outer jacket style, the cuffs and hem can be enlarged, and buttons can be replaced with ties, making it easier to put on and take off, and walking will not be more difficult than with an overcoat.

Moreover, the leather outer jacket that I am promoting does not necessarily have to be like the official robes of the Qing Dynasty. We can still make local changes according to the general style of the outer jacket. For example, the collar can be made into a movable lapel, and hand pockets can be added to the sides. It is still made of plain satin or flowered twill, with colors such as sky blue, navy blue, and coffee. Compared with overcoats, I am afraid that it will only be more beautiful, and there will be no shortcomings!

If the buttons are used instead of ties, the left and right sides can be indistinguishable. If you pay a little attention when making the leather lining into clothing, so that the outer jacket can be worn inside out, it will be even more convenient.

Everything has a habit. When we changed from the outer jacket era to wearing overcoats, we regarded the outer jacket as an outdated relic. If we remake the overcoat into an outer jacket, there will be a day when people will regard the overcoat as shabby. However, at the beginning of a change in habit, it seems that there will be some surprises. When we abolished the outer jacket, haven't we had the same surprise? This requires social leaders to set an example first, and it also requires clothing companies to carry out special publicity.

### Promoting Leather Fur Clothing and the National Products Movement

— Zhang Baling

From the standpoint of the national products industry, promoting leather fur clothing and the future of the national products movement are closely related. Because promoting leather fur clothing does contain a value that cannot be ignored.

We all know that leather fur is a domestic product of China, which can keep out the cold and is light in weight. During the cold season, people with purchasing power, both men and women, like to make a leather robe to wear. People with sufficient economic ability certainly make one after another, and all kinds of leather are also collected. Even people with relatively weak economic ability cannot do without a leather robe. We only need to look at the large number of people wearing leather robes during this cold season to know that this is powerful proof, a concrete fact that speaks louder than words.

Furthermore, we deeply feel that wearing leather fur clothing not only protects the body from the cold and maintains health, but also has the significance of promoting national products. Because in this era, many people are keen on fashion, obsessed with Westernization, and like to wear imported Western suits in this cold season. If the materials of these Western suits are absolutely domestic woolen fabrics, that would be fine, but they often buy imported woolen fabrics, resulting in incalculable outflows of money. According to the statistics of the Jianghai Customs, the import of foreign woolen fabrics from January to November of the 25th year of the Republic of China reached 24,160,142 yuan in national currency. Ask yourself, how shocking is this number! However, the peak month for purchasing clothes, December, is not included in the statistics. If we combine all the import figures for the whole year, how will this huge number make people speechless!

Therefore, from the author's perspective, whether we talk about it from the perspective of keeping out the cold or from the perspective of promoting national products, we feel that it is necessary and valuable to promote leather fur clothing. If someone thinks that promoting leather fur clothing is outdated and a step backwards, then let me ask, is it a reasonable thing to allow the economic power of our compatriots to be completely absorbed by foreigners?

### The Situation in Shaanxi and Gansu Is Expected to Be Completely Resolved

— Me

When the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu was at its most tense, I had long expected that the Shaanxi-Gansu Incident would not be impossible to resolve, and there would definitely be hope for a peaceful resolution. Sure enough, yesterday's newspaper revealed the news that the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is expected to be completely resolved, and that Wang Shuchang and Sun Weiru will take office soon. Although this news has not yet reached the stage of public confirmation, it is expected that the period of public confirmation will not be far away. Or, before this article is contributed to you, the readers, this news may have been confirmed.

My prediction is not like the fortune-tellers and character-splitting masters in Shanghai, who rely entirely on the five elements and the inspiration of the moment to analyze characters. My prediction is: After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek safely returned to Nanjing from Xi'an, no more incidents will occur in Shaanxi. Even if problems arise, they will not be too serious. The situation is extremely clear. Unexpectedly, after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing, Yang and Yu actually defied orders. This is really confusing.

I carefully considered the reasons for Yang and Yu's defiance of orders, and there must be considerable factors. Although we do not know these factors, we can see that the central government has a broad-minded intention. Not only does it not want to punish Yu and Yang severely, but it is also willing to be particularly lenient. If Yu and Yang can repent and reform themselves, they will not be seriously investigated. However, Yu and Yang, as soldiers, should know the duty of soldiers. When foreign disasters are deepening and the bandits and rebels are causing trouble, they dare to take such actions that undermine unity and disobey the central government. Not only is the national public opinion deeply saddened, but their conscience must be questioned.

I am sure of the above two points, so I dare to assert that the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu will be resolved peacefully. Even if there are any problems, after several negotiations, they can be easily solved and will never reach the point of breaking down again. Look at the current international situation, how serious it is. Any advocacy during this time should be sacrificed, and we should unite to resist the enemy desperately. If Yu and Yang do not wake up, the crime of harming the country is indeed something they cannot escape.

### Thoughts After Watching "The Thunderstorm"

— Li Yi

Amateur actors performing at the Carlton

"In short, I think it is necessary to introduce world dramas from the stage! However, what we should pay special attention to is: to make it have as much social impact as possible in our society." (Zhang Min: On the Introduction of World Famous Dramas)

What kind of "social impact" does the "Thunderstorm" directed by Mr. Zhang Min have in our society?

Comparing Ostrovsky's "Thunderstorm" with our current society, it is really too similar. How many grandmothers like Kapenovna and young wives like Katerina can you find in our society if you pay attention?

Ostrovsky is very loyal to his era. He made the poor Katerina, who had suffered so much, throw herself into the river, because he knew that the only way out for a young wife in such an environment was the so-called "eternal rest." The reason why she threw herself into the river was not only because her last supporter, her lover Boris, weakly left her, but also because when Katerina was still a girl, her life was spent with old women who went to temples to offer incense. During evening prayers, she would inexplicably cry and pray, without even knowing what she was praying for or what she was crying about. For a girl who grew up in such an environment, the only way out was to use death to relieve her suffering. In our society, in our countryside, aren't there many young wives who quietly commit suicide by throwing themselves into the river because they cannot bear the beatings and scoldings of their grandmothers or husbands? When they were girls, weren't they also spending their days "offering incense to temples" with old women?

However, in this gloomy story, Ostrovsky also foresaw another way for abused women. He made Varvara leave the family and follow her lover.

It is said that the amateur actors' performance of "Thunderstorm" this time is very faithful to the original work. I haven't read the script, so I have no way of knowing whether there are any differences. But from what I saw in this performance, I think the script can still be revised, for example, I think the third act should be omitted, and some dialogues in other acts can also be deleted. In this way, the impression of this tragedy will definitely be deeper than it is now. Although this would be a discount on being faithful to the original work.

In my opinion, the issue of being faithful to the original work should also be based on social impact as the major premise. In order to have a greater social impact in our society, even if there are some differences from the original work, it is okay to sacrifice some of the original work. Because of this, adapting world famous dramas to Chinese flavors has also become a necessary task!

For example, for "Thunderstorm", if amateur actors are willing to put in more effort, I believe that its social impact will definitely be more than this.

The director put a lot of effort into directing this play, which can be seen from the positions of the actors and their movements. The effect of each act is also as expected. If we separate the whole play into sections, it is really perfect. However, if we look at the whole six-act play, we always feel like something is missing. This may be due to a lack of momentum, but it seems a little inappropriate to say "lack of momentum." After a careful analysis, it is probably due to: ㊀ the limitations of the script, the division of the script is too loose for the main line; ㊁ the director probably paid too much attention to the drama in each act and neglected the connection between each act.

The stage design is really beautiful. I believe that in the Chinese theater scene, there has never been such a beautiful and realistic stage before, especially the first and fourth scenes. Such a beautiful stage is simply a painting full of poetry, a three-dimensional painting.

The effect in the first act was relatively poor (I watched the first day's afternoon performance), but it was very good in the fifth act. Due to experience and proficiency, it will definitely be better in the following performances.

The acting skills of the actors are mostly above average. What makes me even happier here are Ms. Lan Ping, Shu Xiuwen, Zhao Dan, and Ye Luqian, who accurately grasped the personality of each character and fully developed it. Others, such as Zheng Junli, Gu Erji, Zhang Manping, and Lu Ji, are also working hard and are very dedicated.

This is a play worth watching, and I dare to recommend it to you.

### In the Village

— Zhang Hai

Early morning, the cold is biting, and the melted snow water from yesterday outside has frozen into transparent thin ice, and the ground is like a layer of glass. The camels lying quietly under the eaves are closing their eyes and not moving, as if they are listening to the hunting horn in the distance. The wind stopped, but the cold became even more biting.

"Sal! Sal!" The Buryat Mongolian who was traveling with me called out to the sleeping camel driver.

The camel driver Sal rubbed his eyes that had not had enough sleep and slowly got up. He smoked a cigarette and drove the camels to graze in the meadow.

Today it was Haoming and Susan's turn to cook. The Buryat Mongolian Baludan fetched water for his cooking partners and said to them kindly:

"You have to cook quickly! We are going to stroll around the village and come back for dinner in two hours! Oh! Don't forget to cook the two rabbits we bought yesterday!"

The sun came out. The American woman Jiepu carried her camera, and Volensky, who had been a classmate with me in Vladivostok since childhood, sang Siberian plains folk songs. Baludan always liked to walk with one hand on someone's shoulder. Now he walked in the front, and the four of us, like drunkards, sang and hummed and stepped into the village.

"It stinks! It's like entering a manure factory!" Jiepu said, covering her nose with a handkerchief.

There were piles of manure everywhere, emitting a strange smell, but we did not leave here immediately because of this. Dogs barked wildly, chasing us. Baludan asked the villagers in Mongolian to let the dogs not bite us. Sure enough, the middle-aged women or the elderly standing at the door quickly called the dogs into the house. We strolled around safely.

This is a dilapidated village, with few people, and everywhere presents a scene of poverty. The villagers looked at us with strange eyes, and some hid in the door, looking at the few of us through the cracks in the door. Perhaps they were afraid of foreigners, so they did not dare to look at us openly.

There were three women sitting in the sun doing work at the door of a house. Our appearance naturally surprised them, because Baludan spoke to them first, meaning to tell them not to be afraid. One of them was a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl, who looked very healthy and beautiful, exposing half of her leg, and using her hand to constantly rub hemp rope on her bare leg, already carrying the flavor of a semi-civilized person. Volensky said in my ear:

"Look! She is even more beautiful than Lilla!" Lilla was a Soviet woman I loved in Vladivostok.

Near the end of the village, there was an old jujube tree. The three of us leaned on the giant trunk of the jujube tree, and Jiepu took pictures of us. Then we sat on the root of the tree to rest. An old man appeared at the turn of the street, with a long white beard, wearing a purple robe. He walked slowly closer and spoke kindly to Baludan:

"Where are you from?"

"Kulen! We are all from Kulen!"

A smile appeared on his wrinkled old face, but soon he lowered his face, as if he suddenly remembered something. Finally, he spoke again:

"Are you going south? You probably haven't heard any rumors, have you? There is a war in Ikhe Zhao League (Suiyuan)! Chinese soldiers are fighting with short devils! The road ahead may not be easy. They often arrest passers-by as spies and punish them! ×× people often come here to recruit soldiers, and many young men are deceived by them, and it is said that they are all killed! Now no one will be fooled anymore. The gentleman is helping ×× fight the Chinese people, which is too conscienceless!"

"Yes! Old man, we are also preparing to fight, but we are going to resist the invasion of ××!" I excitedly said to the old man.

When we came back, the rice was cooked. We stood in the sun and ate our fill.

When we left Geer Village, the old man from before sent his son, a young and strong young man, to us:

"Everyone! Take my child with you, he can shoot a gun and shoots very accurately!"

Moving forward, we added a new partner!

### Snow Falling

— Lin Ji

He woke up especially early this day. Opening his eyes, he saw that the half-old clock hanging on the wall read only 7:05. He believed this was the accurate time. His wife had already gotten up and was downstairs making him rice porridge. She was truly a good housewife. Even with a nanny, she still insisted on doing things herself, busying about in the kitchen. For such a wife, he thought he should give her something in return! Like buying her some fabric for a dress. Today was the end of the month, wasn't it, payday? Thinking this, he glanced at the calendar on the wall. Right, not a doubt about it, today was payday. So, he smiled and, sitting on the edge of the bed, made this decision: don't go straight home after getting paid. He would go to the department stores, the silk shops, and those places to pick out a beautiful cheongsam fabric and some children's toys to bring home. He wanted to do it without a sound, so when his wife saw it, she would first be surprised, then happy, and finally pout and complain that he shouldn't have gone off to spend money quietly when there were so many proper uses for it at home. The three-year-old child would receive those novel toys and shout "Good Daddy!" He would pick her up and kiss her, and then kiss her delicate little mouth. If his wife wanted to go out, he could even take her to see a movie at night and have a good time. His wife's life was really too monotonous...

Thinking this for a while, he didn't realize that his wife had already opened the door and brought in the wash water. She noticed that her husband had gotten up so early and seemed to feel sorry for him, as if he shouldn't have missed out on sleep. She said:

"Why are you up?"

The sky was gloomy, filled with heavy, gray clouds. It was past eight o'clock, but the sun hadn't come out yet. On the bus, people talking about the weather today kept expecting it to rain. But he felt the wind blowing sideways, and for some reason, it seemed particularly cold. Maybe it would snow! He thought.

No matter how cold it was outside, in the office on the third floor, it was warm enough to completely forget that it was winter. The sound of typewriters, the sound of female employees answering the phone, the sound of nibs scratching on white paper... He kept looking at the clock. This day felt like a month to him... During lunch, colleagues were discussing how to spend the evening since it was payday. Those young, single men were talking excitedly, and one of them suddenly asked him:

### The Neighbor's Cough

— Li Zi

Next door to me lives an old man surnamed Huang.

Every day after I finish work and return home, tired, lying on my bed, I often hear the old man next door making choking coughs. Because there's only a wall separating us, the coughs clearly enter my ears, making me feel very impatient!

As the weather turned cold, the old man's cough increased even more. Sometimes I was awakened in the middle of the night by his coughs, and then I couldn't fall back asleep. I thought this old man must often suffer from colds or lung disease. I found his coughs really unbearable!

But recently, I haven't heard the neighbor's coughs anymore. I've gotten peace and quiet, which is very gratifying. One day, I met the old man, and I asked him the reason for his cessation of coughing. He said, "I am now taking Wuzhou Pharmacy's Breathing Lozenges," a few tablets every day, so my cough has been cured.

### Appreciated by All

— Wan Zhong

People's precious eyes can appreciate great mountains and rivers, beautiful flowers and plants, and splendid articles… They are the most important object in people's physiology. Therefore, a person with bright eyes is sure to have a limitless future.

But if a person's eyes have pain, he cannot appreciate everything, and everything is abandoned! How unfortunate this is!

Wuzhou Pharmacy, which is now devoting itself to the pharmaceutical movement, has specially made "Mingming Eye Drops," a kind of eye drops that extracts elements from domestic Coptis chinensis and Ephedra, and is formulated with zinc salt, boric acid, and other agents. For symptoms such as redness of the eyeballs, swelling and redness of the eyelids, photophobia and tearing, itching and stinging, etc., a drop will immediately show effect, and the bottle style is novel, making it extremely convenient to use. This can truly be said to be a wonderful remedy appreciated by all.

He said:

"What about you? Do you want to come have some fun too?"

He knew that person was inviting him entirely out of good intentions. But all he longed for was his wife and child at home, so he politely declined, saying that he already had another appointment.

At five to five, the salary was delivered to him. He put on his overcoat, preparing to leave. But there was also a letter attached. He didn't open it to take a look… He looked at it, and his hands began to tremble. Had the heat in the office suddenly stopped? He felt cold, and his body also trembled… Colleagues had all left at some point. The tea boy, hunching over, came over and glanced at him with a strange look, asking:

"Why, Mr. × hasn't gone home yet—it's snowing heavily outside."

Yes, it was snowing outside, falling like cotton: falling on the skyscrapers, falling on the bargain flagpoles of department stores, falling on people's hats… The bus stopped at the station for a moment and then drove off. He hadn't jumped on. He kept walking forward, the snowflakes soaking his overcoat and hat, but he didn't feel it. He repeated the letter once, and as he read it, his heart ached as if ants were biting it. He had been working constantly in that office for three years, and now… He didn't understand this world, why it couldn't tolerate someone like him! And he had a wife, a four-year-old child, he couldn't think anymore… He walked past who knows how many silk shops and department stores, but didn't step inside: he had completely fallen into another state.

In that small room, that virtuous wife must be anxiously waiting for his return, because it was getting dark and dinner was ready. But he was wandering the streets like a ghost. On the snowy, cold streets, until late at night.

The snow was falling, falling without stopping...

Dark and gloomy, dark clouds fill the sky. Black and black, dark rain is continuous. Fine and fine, fine rain doesn't stop. Muddy and muddy, the muddy road is difficult to travel. Wind whistling, wind attacks the face. Wet and wet, the wanderer's clothes are wet. The road is far, the road is thousands of miles away. Going, going, the journey is difficult. Tears falling, tears dripping endlessly. Walking, walking, the feet are already tired. I resent, I resent my family's decline. Worried, worried, worried days like years. Helpless, helpless, what to do to visit relatives. Departing, departing, departing from the home. Exhausted, exhausted. Empty stomach, empty. Eyes dizzy, dizzy. Feet lame, lame. I fear this journey will be difficult to see my mother's face again. Thinking, thinking, the heart and intestines are about to break. He is, heart broken. Intestines ruptured. Walking even more staggering, eyes dizzy. The road slippery, the road muddy, the legs are submerged. Strength exhausted, strength exhausted, falling into the mud. Breath faint, breath faint, only one breath remains. The rain pouring, the rain pouring, the rain is even worse than before. The faint soul dreams go back home.

Movies

### "The Passionate Genius" Public Screening

Charles Laughton, the great star known for his leading roles in great masterpieces such as "Les Misérables," "The Old Maid," and "Mutiny on the Bounty," now plays the world-renowned painter Rembrandt in "The Passionate Genius." With his consistent and profound artistic cultivation, every move deeply portrays the posture of an artist who is unkempt and uninterested in fame and fortune. He is also a man of great spirit, unyielding to wealth and power, uncorrupted by riches and honors, purely using his genius skills to express the universe's greatest inspiration in a few strokes of painting. The film is publicly screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater starting today. The director is Alexander Korda, the great director of "The Private Life of Henry VIII."

### Giving Away "Elastic Girl" Songs

The two songs in the Yi Hua masterpiece "Elastic Girl," namely "Elastic Girl" and "Paired Swallows," the lyrics and music depict the dancers in the metropolis, who are burning with the flames of sin, tasting the deception of love, and enduring the hardships of life. The lyrics are like blood and tears, tactful and moving, and those who love songs, regardless of whether they are local or from other places, can send three cents of postage to the Propaganda Department of Yi Hua Company, and it will be sent to the address immediately.

### Huaan Broadcasting

Huaan-produced, Lianhua's new film "A Match Made in Heaven" has now been completed by Director Shen Fu, who has supervised the editors and splicers to work day and night. The film is Director Shen Fu's more advanced and humorous masterpiece after "Carefree Gentleman." Those who have watched "Carefree Gentleman" cannot miss "A Match Made in Heaven."

"A Match Made in Heaven" has business significance, social significance, and contemporary significance. It is an unprecedented success for Chinese comedy.

"A Match Made in Heaven" can make you laugh, make you laugh happily; it can also make you shed tears, but it makes you shed tears comfortably. It is a lesson in life that everyone should read, and it is a great tonic for the Chinese masses who are crushed and suffering - vitamin.

The ingredients of "A Match Made in Heaven" are simple but gorgeous, and there is a sense of deep love in the satire. The most precious thing is that it is meaningful and does not just make the audience laugh.

"Spring Comes to the World" has gradually come to an end, and Sun Yu and Situ Huimin are studying the splicing and testing every day in the work of dubbing and splicing.

In "Spring Comes to the World," Chen Yan Yan plays a maid, Xiao Hong. Although she is subjected to the oppression of violent forces like Miss Chen in "The Orphan Girl," her performance is absolutely not the same. Therefore, it can be seen that Yan Yan's skills are extraordinary.

"Spring Comes to the World" is Mei Xi's first feature film to star in Lianhua. He plays a boatman, who transforms into a revolutionary soldier because of his progressive thinking.

There are not many scenes left in "The General's Daughter." It is expected to end this month. Director He Mengfu must give deep consideration to every shot, so every scene is shot very wonderfully and satisfyingly.

In "The General's Daughter," Li Zhuozhuo and Li Qing play a love scene in a large forest. It is natural to talk about love under the towering ancient trees, which is very beautiful. However, the forest is full of ancient tombs, which becomes too humorous to talk about love in the tombs. However, the director's use of the shots is appropriate, and it is impossible to see that it is a tomb, only feeling that it is wonderful.

### A Scene from "Mr. Wang's Way to Wealth"

### "Era Movie" February Issue Published
