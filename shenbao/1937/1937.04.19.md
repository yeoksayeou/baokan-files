[Nanjing] Chairman Lin delivered a speech at the tenth anniversary commemoration of the National Government's establishment of the capital in Nanjing on the morning of the eighteenth, titled "People's Livelihood Construction Over the Past Decade." The original text is as follows:

Reflecting on the Past Today marks the tenth anniversary of the National Government's establishment of the capital in Nanjing. I believe that the greatest significance of holding this commemorative meeting today lies in reflecting on our work achievements over the past decade. Zeng Zi once said that he examined himself three times a day. I feel that not only should we, as individuals, examine ourselves three times a day, but the government should also frequently reflect on past policies to see if they are all based on the principle of benefiting the country and the people, and whether there are things that should have been done but were not, or things that should not have been done but were. Therefore, in today's commemorative meeting, we should present a report on the work done by the government in the past decade, partly as our own self-examination and self-reflection, and partly as a report to the people of the whole country on the work of the past decade. The work done by the National Government in the past decade has been very extensive. In this short period, we certainly cannot give a very detailed report. The Premier told us in the Outline of National Reconstruction that the primary task of national reconstruction is people's livelihood, and the four basic needs of people's livelihood are food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Today, we will present a brief report on the work done by the government in the past decade regarding the aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation for the people of the whole country.

Food In terms of food, our country has been based on agriculture since ancient times. In terms of food, the production was originally very rich. The various grains produced domestically were not only sufficient for self-sufficiency, but there was often a surplus. However, in recent decades, due to the advancement of agricultural technology in the world, our country's agriculture has inevitably paled in comparison. In addition, banditry and unrest made the rural areas close to bankruptcy. The government, recognizing this, has made extraordinary efforts in recent years to relieve the rural areas, and has paid special attention to the improvement of agricultural technology. Regarding agricultural improvement, there are the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, etc. Regarding agricultural extension, there are the Central Model Agricultural Extension Area and the Wujiang Agricultural Extension Experiment Area, etc. Regarding the relief of rural economy, there is the Central Model Warehouse, which currently has five specialized warehouses and over 300 branch warehouses. Recently, in order to adjust agricultural products, circulate rural funds, and promote the development of the national rural economy, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has jointly organized the Agricultural Capital Bureau with domestic banks, with a fixed capital of 30 million yuan, which will be allocated by the government in installments, and a matching fund of 30 million yuan, which will be jointly paid by the participating banks. The amount of circulating funds will be agreed upon by the participating banks and the Agricultural Capital Bureau. It has now been established and is actively operating. We anticipate that the results achieved in developing the rural economy in the future will be very significant. The above is the work done by the government in recent years regarding food.

Clothing Secondly, regarding clothing, it can be divided into two parts: the agricultural part and the industrial part. In the agricultural part, the agricultural improvement, agricultural extension, and relief of the rural economy mentioned above are mostly related to the aspect of clothing. In addition, there is the establishment of the Silk Improvement Committee and the improvement of the Zhengding Cotton Experiment Field. Research is being conducted separately on mulberry planting, seed production, silkworm rearing, and cotton planting to strive for improvement. Although the time has been short, considerable results have been achieved. This is the work done by the government regarding the agricultural part of clothing. In the industrial part, such as the establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Committee to concentrate power and thoroughly seek the improvement of the cotton industry, as well as the encouragement of the textile industry, the relief of the silk reeling industry, and the promotion of the woolen fabric industry, the purpose is to increase the massive production in the industrial aspect. This is the work done by the government regarding the industrial part of clothing.

Housing Thirdly, when it comes to housing, there is also an important report. Before our country opened up to trade, we also had very good architecture and magnificent palaces. The bricks, tiles, and wood used were all sourced domestically. However, in recent decades, many of the materials used in construction have been imported, and the original domestic materials have been discarded, resulting in an increasing trade deficit for the country. The government, recognizing this, has made every effort in recent years to promote the use of domestic materials in construction. China originally had very good wood. Now, after the government's promotion, timber merchants have also made this wood into tongue-and-groove boards, which are not only cheaper but also more beautiful than foreign goods. Recently, construction in various places has been adopting this domestic material one after another. This is indeed a significant progress in Chinese architecture. In addition, the manufacture of bricks and tiles has progressed very quickly in China. China also has some production of non-ferrous metals and cement, but unfortunately, the quantity is too small to meet the demand. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is currently operating a steel plant. After large-scale shipments in the future, it will definitely be of great help to the building materials aspect.

Transportation Fourthly, when it comes to transportation, the government has done the most work in this area. It can be divided into four parts. First, the railway part. The railways newly built in the past decade that have been completed and opened to traffic include the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the western section and port section of the Longhai Railway, and the Taizhao branch line, the Sujia Railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Jiangnan Railway, the Huainan Railway, and the main and branch lines of the Tongpu Railway, totaling 2,754 kilometers in length. Those under construction include the Hangcao Railway, the Nanping Railway, the Xuanqu Railway, and the Xiangqian Railway, totaling 1,790 kilometers in length. Other major projects related to the railway include the Capital Ferry completed in September 1933, the Lianyungang Port completed at the end of 1935, and the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which began construction in November 1934 and is expected to be completed in the summer of this year. Second, the highway part. Before 1927, domestic highway construction was sporadic, crude, and had little to show for it. After the National Government established the capital in Nanjing, the Ministries of Communications and Railways successively formulated a system of national trunk and branch lines, as well as engineering standards. Highway construction officially began to proceed. After the establishment of the National Economic Council Preparatory Office in November 1931, it first began to supervise the construction of inter-provincial highways, expanding from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan. In 1933, the Council was formally established, and it comprehensively planned the inter-provincial highways, allocated funds, and continued construction. The important routes in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Fujian, and Qinghai, as well as the borders of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, were also successively included in the scope of supervision. The Xilan, Xihan, and Hanning roads have been successively built. Recently, the Jingdian Highway has also been directly opened to traffic. In total, 100,9749 kilometers of highways have been completed nationwide, 16,165 kilometers are under construction, and 45,979 kilometers have been surveyed and are about to begin construction. A total of 171,893 kilometers of highways will soon be fully open to traffic. It cannot but be said that this is a significant progress in China's transportation. Third, the shipping administration aspect. Our country's shipping industry was originally very immature. After active reorganization in recent years, it has made daily progress. For example, the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the improvement of shipping management, the improvement of shipping methods, the increase of sailing speed, and the promotion of shipping cooperation have all achieved considerable results. If the competent authorities can continue to pay attention and make efforts in the future, it will not be difficult for our country's shipping industry to compete with foreign shipping companies. Fourth, in terms of civil aviation, since the successive establishment of the China National Aviation Corporation and the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, as of the end of 1936, China's aviation routes have increased to 14 routes, with a total length of 17,800 kilometers. The two companies commonly use 24 aircraft. The number of passengers was only 2,654 in 1930, but it has increased to 10,404 in 1935. The distance flown by passengers was only 1,027,902 kilometers in 1930, but it has increased to 5,857,103 kilometers in 1935. Based on this extrapolation, in a few years, China's aviation routes should be able to cover the entire country. The above is the work done by the government in the past decade regarding transportation.

Striving for the Future The above report is only in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. In addition, the development of mineral resources, the promotion of forestry and land reclamation, the construction of water conservancy, the improvement of postal and telecommunications, and the widespread establishment of long-distance telephones in major cities across the country are all related to people's livelihood construction and are also the basic work for building a new China. Therefore, some people believe that China has made great progress in these ten years. However, when we think about it ourselves, we feel that it is still far from the degree we hope for. The Premier said in the Plans for National Reconstruction that the whole country should build 100,000 miles of railways and 1,000,000 miles of stone roads. Now we have only built more than 10,000 miles of railways and more than 100,000 miles of highways, which is only one-tenth or two-tenths of what the Premier said. There are many other things that have not reached one-tenth or two-tenths. How should we encourage ourselves and strive to complete the work we want to do and the responsibilities we should fulfill in the future? I think we all have the same feeling when we participate in this commemorative meeting today. In the future, we can only work together with the people of the whole country to complete our mission of building a new China. (Eighteenth, Central News Agency dispatch)

### Kawagoe Plans to Suggest to the Japanese Government a Diplomatic Policy Towards China

Adjustment of the Economic Activity Front is Necessary; The Newspaper Publishing Rights Case Should Be Negotiated with a Sympathetic Attitude; Japanese Newspapers Publish Reckless Provocative News

[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun reported this morning a special dispatch from Nanjing stating that the Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, is preparing to submit six points of suggestions regarding the diplomatic policy towards China to the Japanese government after returning to Japan. They are: 1) State that as a result of the clarification of the Southwest issue and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident, the Chinese National Government is now taking advantage of this favorable development and moving towards national unification. 2) In terms of its policy towards Japan, the National Government sincerely hopes for a resolution of the North China political issue. Although the resolution of such local issues is difficult to ensure the complete opening of the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations, given the current environment, even if Japan insists on a "realistic approach," it is necessary to seek its resolution within a considerable range. 3) The degree of Sino-British economic cooperation is progressing extremely rapidly, which can be regarded as an expression of the US policy towards the Far East, especially towards China, and should be given special attention. 4) Japan should not be indifferent to the National Government's five-year economic construction plan. 5) It is necessary to adjust and strengthen the front line of Japanese economic activities in China. The institutions established by various provinces in China should be integrated and an "economic embassy" should be organized as a control mechanism. 6) Regarding China's demand to abolish the extraterritoriality of various countries, Japan should negotiate with a sympathetic attitude. (Eighteenth, Central News Agency dispatch)

[Tokyo] The cancellation of the resignation intention of our Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, and the scheduled return to Japan for debriefing by Ambassador Kawagoe, both indicate that the atmosphere of Sino-Japanese diplomacy has entered a new stage, gradually changing from mutual observation to crystallization. Japanese newspapers have recently published extreme provocative news about our country. The Yomiuri Shimbun is particularly noteworthy. The newspaper published a news item on the 15th of this month, detailing how our country is preparing for war against Japan and publishing a map showing our country's three major defense lines and bases for land and air forces, pointing out that our country intends to declare war on Japan. The newspaper again published a report the next day on the extensive schemes of our government to manipulate the independence and anti-Japanese movements of the Manchurian, Mongolian, and Korean people. Today, the newspaper published another news item, which is very long, describing how our country's attitude towards Japan is overly tough. This kind of news has been published in the first item on the front page in the largest font for days in a row. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun also published a news item in the same position in large headlines today, detailing how our government is taking advantage of Kong Xiangxi's visit to England to attend the coronation of the British king and Zhang Qun's overseas inspection to provoke European and American countries and hinder Japan, causing Japan to fall into a seriously unfavorable position. The sources of the above news are all marked as coming from special correspondents in Shanghai. Furthermore, the "Evening Empire" even published lengthy extra editions on the 15th and 16th, the content of which was entirely about how China is taking advantage of Foreign Minister Sato's diplomatic policy to despise Japan. The newspaper, on the one hand, advocates a punitive policy towards China, and on the other hand, overthrows Sato's diplomatic policy. This kind of news is as abundant as a tide, which makes one suspect whether someone has recently intentionally instigated this systematic anti-China provocative movement, so as to at least resist the opinion advocating a re-examination of Japan's view of China. (Seventeenth, Central News Agency dispatch)

[Tokyo] The Nichi Nichi Shimbun continued to publish a news item in the most prominent position today, saying that our country will urge Britain, the United States, and other countries to organize a Pacific collective security guarantee system, entitled "Absolutely Cannot Tolerate Opposition to Our Continental Policy." According to the newspaper's opinion, the establishment of this system will eventually threaten the exercise of Japan's right to national survival. Therefore, Japan should be determined to reject it from beginning to end. The above news gives people the feeling of being reckless or an international provocation.

[Nanjing] In order to regulate material funds and ensure sufficient turnover, the Ministry of Railways, after consulting with the Central Trust Bureau and banking consortia composed of Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Zhejiang Industrial, and Zhongnan banks, issued material purchase promissory notes with the banking consortia guaranteeing payment. The contract was recently signed, with the content being that starting from January of this year, promissory notes will be issued in twelve monthly installments at a rate of 800,000 yuan in national currency per month. The promissory note fund will be allocated by the Ministry of Railways from the operating income of each railway bureau on a monthly basis, and will be submitted to the banking consortia for 34 months from the date of signing the contract. Shanghai is the submission location. It is estimated that the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Pinghan, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai railway bureaus will each submit 75,000 yuan per month, totaling 300,000 yuan in national currency per month, and a total of 10,020,000 yuan in national currency will be submitted in 34 months.

### Central Government Plans to Temporarily Allow Half of the Duty-Free Import of Foreign Rice to Guangdong

Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce to Hold Executive Committee Meeting Today to Discuss; Guangdong Rice Industry Association Sends Telegram to the Whole Country and Overseas Chinese

[Hong Kong] The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce accepted the requests of various merchants and decided to hold an executive committee meeting on the nineteenth to discuss the method of convening a meeting of representatives of all members of the city. The General Assembly will elect representatives to petition Cheng Tiangu and Yu Wu to allow the duty-free import of foreign rice in accordance with the number previously determined by the Central Government. The Guangdong Rice Industry Association telegraphed the whole country and overseas Chinese on the eighteenth, saying that Guangdong rice can only buy six, seven, or eight catties per yuan, which is unprecedented since the Republic of China. The central government has a temporary decree to allow the duty-free import of foreign rice, with a fixed amount, to help the people who are suffering from famine. Although it is not a fundamental and thorough plan, it is still a necessary measure at present. However, some rice merchants in Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shanghai, and Zhejiang used the Guangdong famine in advance to raise the price of rice to profit, and then delayed transportation on the pretext of using their insidious schemes, regarding the Guangdong famine as a private source of profit. The so-called promotion of domestic rice and maintenance of the countryside are nothing more than using public office for private gain, wanting to put the people of Guangdong on the stove to be cooked and chewed, and enjoying themselves privately. It is hoped that they will speak out righteously and uphold justice, so that the traitors can restrain themselves. It is heard that the central government plans to temporarily approve half of the duty-free import of foreign rice to Guangdong, which is 2 million dan. (Eighteenth, Special Dispatch)

As for the flood discharge route, there are currently three options: Xiaodigou on the opposite bank of Jiujiang, Fuxing Town above Xiaogushan, and the area below Xiaohushan. However, it is still necessary to measure and decide which location is most suitable. This project is extremely important for the entire Yangtze River water conservancy issue. After the completion of the entire project, it can absorb the high tide of the Yangtze River, and nearby farmland can be protected from flooding.

Procedures Completed, Certificate Issued

She believes that it is unreasonable for foreigners in China to have extraterritorial rights, saying that since they do not accept Chinese law, they should not come to China. Since they have come to China, they should respect Chinese law. This naturalization is due to her admiration and belief in Chinese morality and culture.

Current Commentary

### Soviet Shipbuilding and US Military Exercises

— Hua

Since Japan announced the abolition of the Washington Treaty until it officially came into effect at the end of last year, the situation in the Pacific has fallen into a state of no treaty. Judging from the current situation, the conclusion of a new treaty seems to be a distant prospect. As a result, large-scale naval competition has gradually begun. In the past two or three months, the British Navy has continuously held exercises in the South Pacific and has decided to increase the defensive works of Singapore and Hong Kong with huge funds. Now the Soviet Union also has a plan to accelerate the construction of warships, and the US Air Force is conducting an unprecedented large-scale military exercise near the Hawaiian Islands.

We must know that all these naval competitive activities are developing with the aggressive ambitions of certain parties. Japan is adopting a policy of advancing both north and south in the Pacific. The Japanese warlords have already placed the entire financial and economic structure on the basis of a "quasi-wartime system." This naturally aroused the emergency alert of various countries in the Pacific. Therefore, the increase in these military activities, on the one hand, shows the approaching crisis of World War, and on the other hand, shows that various countries are preparing their strength to resist the threat from Japan.

This Soviet shipbuilding has a significant meaning in the situation in the Pacific. The Soviet Navy was originally weak. However, in recent years, due to the intensified threats from Japan and Germany, the Soviet Union began to pay attention to naval power after completing the defensive works of the eastern and western borders. The British-Soviet naval agreement was concluded last autumn. Britain recognized the Soviet Union's right to expand its navy in the Far East at its discretion. This was the precursor to the Soviet shipbuilding. From then on, the Soviet Union rushed to build submarines and completed the first step of coastal defense. It also actively opened the Arctic route so that the Baltic and White Sea fleets could be quickly transferred to the Far East. According to London’s "Daily Telegraph", the Soviet Union's submarine power now has ninety submarines in the Baltic Sea and forty in Vladivostok, ranking first in the world. After this step was successful, it further planned to build giant warships.

The US Air Force has often conducted military exercises in the Hawaiian Islands in recent years. But this time, 139 warships participated in the exercises, and the exercise area reached 2 million square miles. It can be said to be the largest-scale exercise in American history. The demonstration effect of such a large-scale exercise is very obvious. I remember that in the large-scale exercise of the US Navy two years ago, a secret document was stolen by a spy. Therefore, the exercise was suddenly stopped. Last year, the United States uncovered a naval espionage case, which involved many Japanese people. Therefore, in this US Air Force exercise, the formation of the fleet was kept completely secret. From this point, we can also see the sharp opposition between the US Navy and Japan in the Pacific.

It is rumored that this Soviet shipbuilding has contacted the United States and France, hoping to obtain their assistance in engineering, but the United States and France have refused due to various reasons. We feel that the spread of this news also obviously has the meaning of showing off to Japan and making it concede in naval competition. There is no military conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. There is only a convergence of interests. There is no need to say anything about the relationship between France and the Soviet Union. Recently, Davis, the special envoy sent by the United States to London, also met with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gorsky to discuss naval issues. This indicates that naval cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is still quite possible. If this step can be realized, it will be a great pressure on Japan's aggressive ambitions and will be very beneficial to the entire situation in the Far East.

### Oslo Convention Countries Draft New Trade Agreement

A Prelude to Improving International Trade: Beque Invited to Visit the US in June to Promote a World Economic Conference

⊙Beijing After a six-day meeting, the expert conference attended by economic authorities from the Oslo Convention countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, closed yesterday. The draft of the new agreement will be signed by various countries, and its purpose is to increase the trade volume of the so-called "Oslo" countries. According to the official gazette issued by the expert conference, this is the first step to eliminate international trade barriers. Experts from various countries will send the draft agreement to their respective governments, and the governments will send ministers to attend official meetings to decide on the implementation policy. The official meeting is scheduled to be held in The Hague at the end of May. (National Maritime Telegraph on the 18th)

⊙Beijing Before the Prime Minister of Belgium, Zeiland, is about to leave for the United States, experts from Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the signatory countries of the Oslo Convention, have suddenly drafted a multilateral agreement to improve international trade. This practical achievement is the result of months of consideration, and all those who promote new international economic organizations welcome it. It is also found that Zeiland's visit to the United States is related to the recent visit of Dr. Schacht, President of the German National Bank, to Belgium, and the subsequent visits of US special envoy Davis and British Foreign Secretary Eden to Belgium. Eden's visit to Belgium will be around the weekend of next week. The currently drafted agreement has been attached with implementation procedures and submitted to the governments of their respective countries for approval. The Belgian Prime Minister's visit to the United States, although nominally to accept an honorary degree from Princeton University, is actually to discuss with the US President ways to revitalize world trade. If this is successful, a world economic conference will be convened. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 18th)

[Washington] Washington officials are speculating today about the Belgian Prime Minister Zeiland's visit to the United States in mid-June to meet with President Roosevelt. Because Zeiland is informally entrusted by Britain and France to inquire about the hope of holding a world economic and peace conference with the United States. Informed sources believe that the second move of the United States may be closely related to the Spanish Civil War, because the current war has fallen into a stalemate. Both sides may ask President Roosevelt to mediate and establish a lasting truce. At the same time, officials here also believe that European countries are deeply aware that the President has no intention of proposing an economic and disarmament conference at this time. Secretary of State Hull feels that if the United States initiates it at this time, it will not be successful. (National Telegraph on the 17th)

⊙Brussels Regarding the Belgian Prime Minister Zeiland's visit to the United States to meet with President Roosevelt, it was recently learned that President Roosevelt invited Prime Minister Zeiland to visit the United States on the 11th of this month, before the by-election of the Belgian House of Representatives. At the same time, the governments of Britain and France also entrusted Prime Minister Zeiland to investigate the possibility of removing various obstacles to international trade, as stated in the monetary agreement between Britain, France and the United States. It is known that President Roosevelt's invitation is naturally complementary to the actions of Britain and France. He will do his best to make the mission of Prime Minister Zeiland come to fruition as soon as possible. In addition, the devaluation of the Belgian currency last year promoted the restoration of the economy and finance, and part of the reason was that it was successful by referring to President Roosevelt's experience. The ultimate goal of the investigation work currently being carried out by Prime Minister Zeiland is to convene an international economic conference. Once the Prime Minister arrives in the United States, the investigation work will have been completed. He will know clearly what European countries can contribute to the international trade recovery and can talk to President Roosevelt as "Europe's envoy" so that the international economic conference can be convened quickly.

### Disarmament Bureau Extends Meeting

[Paris] The Parisian newspaper "Le Petit Parisien" recently reported that the Disarmament Conference Bureau, which was originally scheduled to hold a meeting on May 6, will be postponed because the League of Nations will hold a temporary congress at the end of May to discuss the issue of Egypt joining the League of Nations. At that time, representatives from various countries can take the opportunity to discuss the disarmament issue first, so the Disarmament Conference Bureau meeting may be postponed until then.

Berlin Denies Rumors

[Berlin] Political figures here, in addition to firmly denying the rumors of a German-Soviet union that have been circulating in recent days, also pointed out that the rumors were deliberately fabricated to influence certain Balkan countries that are hovering and recognizing Soviet Russia. The "Essener Zeitung", which has close ties to General Goering, reported that the rumors were obviously spread jointly by Paris and Moscow to paralyze the anti-Bolshevik front and promote the cooperation of Soviet Russia with Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states. The newspaper did not mention that it can be seen from the remarks of any party leader that Germany's anti-Bolshevik policy is undoubted. (National Maritime Telegraph on the 17th)

### Shipbuilding Materials Shipped to the Soviet Union

US Government Approves Licenses Except for Leaking Military Secrets

[Washington] Regarding the shipment of cannons and shipbuilding materials to the Soviet Union for the construction of battleships, the State Department recently stated that if there is no leakage of national secrets in the export of various military equipment, the State Department cannot refuse to issue export licenses in accordance with the law. At this time, if the arms dealers concerned intend to ship cannons and shipbuilding materials to the Soviet Union and request the State Department to issue licenses, the State Department will solicit opinions from the Navy Department to clarify whether the move violates the law on national secrets before deciding whether to issue the license.

### Coronation of King George VI Approaching

London Rehearses Ceremonial Parade

[London] The coronation ceremony of King George VI is less than a month away. London rehearsed a ceremonial parade this morning. At dawn, the streets were deserted, and the parade followed the scheduled route. The parade started from Westminster Abbey with a total of sixteen carriages. The first was the royal carriage in which the King and Queen rode together, followed by the carriages of the Prime Minister and the Prime Ministers of the various autonomous territories, then the carriages of the royal nobles, and finally the carriage of the Queen Mother Mary. A music band led the way in front of the carriages, and a team of mounted police escorted the parade on both sides. Staff members held clocks to measure the time and recorded some details in a book for reference. There were also two small trucks full of police officers, equipped with wireless communication devices for broadcasting. When the parade started, because it was still early, there were few pedestrians on the street watching. Later, more and more people gathered. In addition, to make the rehearsal as realistic as possible, the organizers built grandstands in two areas. When the parade arrived there, the grandstands were already crowded. Except for the King and Queen and other major personnel who did not participate, everything else was the same as the formal ceremony. There were even vendors along the street selling "Coronation Ceremony Rehearsal Order Forms," and citizens scrambled to buy them. City threefold.

### British Coal Mining Industry Brewing General Strike

Shipyard Workers' Strike Has a Tendency to Expand

[London] The Miners' Union recently held a vote among its members in various districts because the Nottinghamshire coal mine owners refused to recognize the labor bureau, to gauge the public opinion of coal miners nationwide on whether to strike to support the workers in Nottinghamshire. The results of the vote will not be announced until the 20th or 21st of this month. Currently, only the South Wales province has released its results, with approximately ten times more votes in favor of the strike than against it. Extrapolating from this, it is certain that those in favor will be the vast majority, and all 400,000 coal miners will hold a strike. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 17th)

### French Foreign Minister Elucidates Diplomatic Policy

Restoring the Authority of the League of Nations, Peaceful Cooperation with All Countries

⊙Garges, Southern France. Foreign Minister Delbos recently delivered an important speech at a banquet for the Radical Socialist Youth Party members here, explaining that the goal of French foreign policy is to safeguard peace. The main principles followed are as follows: ㊀ Mutual assistance pacts should be signed by the member states of the League of Nations by region to restore the authority of the League of Nations. ㊁ The policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War should be strictly enforced and monitored. Volunteer soldiers from all countries should withdraw from Spain, and the civil war should be mediated in the hope of restoring its independence. ㊂ The three major democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States must cooperate with each other to safeguard peace. Any situation in which ideological groups form opposing sides must be avoided at all costs. ㊃ The existing friendly relations between France and its allies, especially the Soviet Union, Poland, and the Little Entente countries, should be maintained and promoted. In addition, France should establish new friendly relations with other countries, but only on the condition that these new relations do not conflict with existing agreements. ㊄ France should take the lead in advocating for universal disarmament and propose to the presidency of the Disarmament Conference the implementation of a monitoring system for the armaments of each country and the public announcement by each country of its armaments situation. ㊅ Revitalize international trade and promote peaceful cooperation among nations so that the economic self-sufficiency policies pursued by certain countries can be gradually abolished. Regarding this, Belgian Prime Minister Janson is currently making efforts (referring to conducting an investigation into the possibility of removing international trade barriers).

### British Prime Minister Baldwin Speaks of Peace

With Pioneer Qualifications, Britain Undoubtedly Holds the Key

[London] British Prime Minister Baldwin delivered a broadcast address on the responsibility of the British Empire on the evening of the 16th, saying that although the world is encountering various national difficulties and dangers, he firmly believes that it will eventually reach a state of peace and prosperity. However, there are still many thorns ahead, which cannot be achieved overnight, so there must be a joint effort, perseverance, and above all, a pioneer. Among all countries in the world, the British Empire is best qualified to lead the way. This is not because the British are superior to other nations, but because they have experience and have learned the lesson of cooperation in solving current problems. In practice, we have shown that the solution to difficulties depends on discussion, not force. Only patience can create trust, and only trust can create harmony. The construction of the British Empire is based on the idea that internal war is impossible. If this concept were extended to all countries in the world, would it not be even more beneficial? The British people have always held the ideal of freedom, and today they should aim to maintain this ideal and prove its appropriateness. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese Political Warfare

Entering its Fourth Week

[Tokyo] The third week of political warfare ended yesterday, the 17th, and we have now entered the final decisive stage. The nationwide candidate lineup has also been largely completed. At the same time, the battle lines have been reinforced, and all efforts have been concentrated on the battle of words. The final charge has not yet been reached because the government has no party affiliation and is therefore inevitably low-key. Yesterday (17th), one additional candidate was added from the Minseito and neutral sides. At this point, it can be said that the fourth week of the battle of words has been entered. With the exception of two districts in Oita and Ehime prefectures, all districts have exceeded the quota. The 19th is the last day to stop the election bulletin, and the official struggle for power will then unfold. (Domei News Agency, 18th)

### Former Minister of Education Enters the Battle - Need Funds, Come to Me

[Tokyo] More than ten days have passed since the dissolution of the Diet. More than 840 candidates, aiming to win the clean votes of the people, are fighting for the central plains with a do-or-die spirit. The greatest difficulty for these candidates is obtaining election funds. Former Minister of Education Hirao Hachisaburo suddenly entered the vortex of political warfare and issued a declaration: "Anyone who needs funds, come to me. If you are truly a candidate who can purify the political world, regardless of your party affiliation, I will provide you with funds." In this era of election fund panic, Mr. Hirao's declaration has become a major topic in the political world. There are already thirty candidates who have passed Mr. Hirao's "examination." It is said that Mr. Hirao's move has nothing to do with the new party. (Domei News Agency, 18th)

### Government Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude, Hoping for Factionalization of Existing Parties

[Tokyo] With only ten days remaining until the general election, the anti-government fervor of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties is becoming increasingly intense. In this state, it is inevitable that they will submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet in the special Diet session. However, the government is relatively optimistic and continues to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the strong attitude of existing parties this time has a strong election policy connotation. However, regarding the establishment of a new party, according to the current situation, it is almost impossible to expect the emergence of the new party initially planned by Prime Minister Hayashi. Therefore, the government has no intention of coming out to carry out new party work before the general election. They can only hope for a new turn of events in the political world after the general election. After all, even if the Seiyukai and Minseito parties occupy a majority of 370-380 seats as a result of this election, their divisions are expected to undergo considerable qualitative changes. At the same time, the internal affairs of the political parties themselves are quite complex. Even if some people advocate submitting a no-confidence motion after the special Diet session opens, considerable disputes will inevitably arise before they can achieve a united front, or even trigger a crisis of division within the existing parties. This is the point of greatest concern for the government. If the unity of the political parties is unexpectedly strong and they take a stand against the government, the government has secretly resolved to dissolve the Diet again. Therefore, the extent to which the confrontation between the political parties and the government intensifies after the election is the deciding factor in the future direction of the political situation.

### Japan-Chile Trade Conference

[Tokyo] The first trade deliberation meeting between the Chilean commercial delegation and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the business community was held in Tokyo on the 17th. The Chilean delegation asked questions about the Japanese proposal to renew trade relations, and the Japanese side responded. The intentions and proposals of the Chilean side can be presented at the second deliberation meeting on the 20th. All parties concerned are highly anticipating the effect of this meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, the Japanese proposal was generally based on the adjustment of Japan-Chile trade in order to increase mutual benefits, and it was hoped that Chile would ease the current exchange control measures. The Japanese side also believed that if it was necessary to adjust trade, it would implement compensatory imports for Chilean products. For products such as Chilean nitrate and copper, a public association would be established in the private sector to increase their imports. On the other hand, the export of Japanese low-priced heavy industrial products should also be increased. A consortium would be formed based on the model of the Japan-Brazil Enterprise Council in order to promote trade between the two groups. In addition, it is also desired to take this opportunity to realize a Japan-Chile trade reciprocity agreement and establish settlement compensation methods, etc., and to use this as a prerequisite for the establishment of a Japan-Chile Economic Association.

### Canadian Auto Workers' Strike

Labor-Management Negotiations Break Down

⊙Toronto: The strike at the General Motors plants in Canada was mediated today by Ontario Premier Hepburn, who convened a meeting between representatives of the United Auto Workers and plant management. Afterwards, it was announced that all hope of an early resolution had been dashed. Hepburn asked for the reason for the breakdown in negotiations, which was the issue of recognizing the Committee for Industrial Organization. Union representatives insisted on recognizing the representatives of the CIO, but Hepburn refused to intervene in the negotiations. Plant management took advantage of Hepburn's attitude and was also quite strong. The local union has now requested that the United Auto Workers order a strike at General Motors' US plants as well. If a general strike cannot be implemented by 9:00 AM on Monday, the union will resolve everything on its own. (National Telegram, 17th)

### A Record of Our Country's Special Envoy Delegation to the Coronation of the English King, Westward Bound

—Via Hong Kong to the Philippines—

Singapore News: Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, and their party of twenty-seven people, were ordered to represent the Chinese government to celebrate the coronation of the English King. This reporter also had the opportunity to accompany them and will now write a summary of the sights and sounds along the way to inform the people of the country.

The ship the delegation took was the Italian vessel Victoria. It was originally scheduled to depart at 12:00 noon on April 2nd, but because so many people came to the ship to bid farewell to Special Envoy Kong, it was delayed until 2:00 PM before it set sail. The Victoria was very well-equipped, and the weather was calm along the way, so everyone felt very comfortable. The next afternoon, Special Envoy Kong gathered the people traveling with him on the ship for a meeting, assigned tasks, and instructed everyone on the points to pay attention to during this trip. Many of the people traveling together had not met before, but on the ship, there were many opportunities for conversation and laughter, and in less than two days, everyone became good friends.

At 10:00 AM on the 4th, the ship arrived in Hong Kong. The Governor of Hong Kong, who was resting in the countryside, specially sent the Colonial Secretary, Smith, to greet them. In addition, local gentlemen and representatives from the military and political circles of Guangzhou, numbering no less than several hundred, welcomed them at the pier. Special Envoy Kong and others were first accompanied by Smith on the Governor's launch directly to Government House for a brief rest, and then proceeded to Sir Robert Ho Tung's banquet. During the banquet, Sir Robert Ho Tung raised his glass to celebrate the longevity of the Republic of China, and Special Envoy Kong also raised his glass to celebrate the longevity of the English King in return. Sir Robert Ho Tung praised Special Envoy Kong's past achievements in politics and wished that this trip would further consolidate Sino-British relations. Special Envoy Kong replied briefly, saying that this trip was solely to celebrate the coronation of the English King, but after the ceremony, he hoped to travel to various countries to visit various economic construction projects as a reference for the construction of a new China. He also said that Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland were connected, and since the opening of the Canton-Hankow Railway, the relationship has become even closer. In the future, Hong Kong should be an important figure in promoting Sino-British friendship. Because Deputy Envoy Chen also had a banquet with the British Naval Commander of the Far East, Liddell, he excused himself shortly after sitting down at Sir Robert Ho Tung's house. In the afternoon, there were two more tea parties, one organized by more than forty overseas Chinese groups to bid farewell to Special Envoy Kong's trip to England, held at the Hotel des Nations at 4:00 PM, and the other a farewell party by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, held at 5:00 PM. Special Envoy Kong gave speeches at both times, mainly saying that the achievements of the National Government's revolution in the past decade or so owed much to the contribution of Guangdong compatriots at home and abroad. In the future, there would be many national construction projects, and he hoped that Guangdong compatriots would continue to work hard for the country with the same spirit as before. Special Envoy Kong especially made three earnest requests to the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, saying that China was increasingly industrialized, and the outlet for industrial manufactured goods depended on merchants. Merchants opened up sales channels, and then industry had a way to succeed. If industry succeeded, the living standards of farmers could also be raised. In the past, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce had already achieved results in promoting domestic goods, and it should continue to do its best in the future. Special Envoy Kong was extremely sincere when he spoke, and the listeners were moved and responded with warm applause. On the 4th, all the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong published the news of the special envoy in large characters and had editorials to bid farewell to the special envoy to England. The Victoria also left Hong Kong at around 8:00 PM that afternoon.

After leaving Hong Kong, the weather became hotter day by day. Everyone packed away their spring clothes and put on their summer clothes. Some people, because there were still stoves at home when they left Shanghai and Nanjing, did not expect it to get over ninety degrees on the way, so they did not bring summer clothes. At this point, they all complained. Fortunately, there was still a slight sea breeze blowing on the deck, and when it was too hot, they could also take a bath and swim, so the days could still be spent comfortably.

At 7:00 AM on the 6th, our ship arrived in Manila. Representatives of the government, the party headquarters, and Chinese merchants crowded the ship's reception room to welcome Special Envoy Kong. Our Mr. Kong had prepared cars to take us on a tour of the city for a week. The scenery of the South Seas was different from that of temperate regions. Red and purple were everywhere. The person leading our tour said, "This is heaven on earth."

After a brief tour, we went to attend the tea party of the Kuomintang's general branch. Special Envoy Kong knew that the overseas Chinese in the Philippines would definitely want to know the latest news of various constructions in the country, so he took this opportunity to briefly explain the construction of highways, railways, aviation, and other aspects in the past few years. At the same time, he particularly pointed out that under the leadership of President Chiang, China's construction in the past few years had been progressing simultaneously in both material and spiritual aspects. The spiritual aspect of construction was the New Life Movement. Finally, he said that overseas Chinese in the Philippines, in addition to developing their careers locally, should never forget their motherland. China had had import problems for many years, but it did not damage the country's vitality. The most important reason was that it benefited from remittances from overseas Chinese. From this point alone, it can be seen the contribution of overseas Chinese to the motherland. China is now advancing on the road of construction, and overseas Chinese can serve the motherland in both manpower and financial resources. After the tea party, he went to the champagne party held by the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines and the Philippine President at the Presidential Palace. At 12:00 PM, he attended the banquet held by the Chinese Consulate General in the Philippines and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce at the Manila Hotel. During the banquet, Special Envoy Kong said that Sino-Philippine friendship had always been harmonious, and the Chinese government expressed great sympathy for Philippine independence. China is a peace-loving country, and a strong China would not be an obstacle to the Philippines, but an aid to the Philippines. In the future, the two countries should cooperate with each other in commerce and culture to seek peace in the Far East. Many representatives from local political, academic, and business circles attended this banquet and unanimously expressed their admiration for Special Envoy Kong's speech.

The time spent in Manila was not long. In addition to formal banquets, there were many private engagements. There were three people with the surname Chen traveling with us this time. In addition to Deputy Envoy Chen, there were also Mr. Chen Bingzhang and Mr. Chen Liting. The Chen Clan Ancestral Hall in Manila invited all three of them to take photos, write inscriptions, and have tea. Mr. Gui Rongshan, chairman of the National Goods Importers Association in Manila, found the military attache Gui Yongqing in our group and was overjoyed, because there are very few people with the surname Gui. The two of them were from the same clan, and it was rare to meet again overseas, so they were treated with special hospitality. From this point alone, it can be seen that although the two compatriots are far away from their motherland, they are still reluctant to part with the customs and traditions of their motherland.

The Victoria is scheduled to arrive in Singapore on the morning of the 9th. (Central News Agency, dispatched on the 8th)

### Promotion of Cotton Bean Production in Northern Anhui

Tens of Thousands of Acres of Land Have Been Closed Off as Areas for Planting Cotton Beans

Wuhu News: The land in northern Anhui is vast, and the production of miscellaneous grains is extremely abundant. However, in recent years, due to the economic depression in rural areas, the farmers in those areas have been unable to seek revitalization. After careful investigation by the construction authorities, it was believed that the soil in northern Anhui could still be widely planted with cotton beans. Now, Hefei, Shouxian, and other counties have been selected, and tens of thousands of acres of land have been closed off as areas for planting improved cotton beans. Technicians such as Jiang Zemin have been dispatched with a large amount of seeds to distribute to farmers for planting around the Grain Rain season, and to provide overall management to seek development. The Construction Department has established a cotton bean promotion management office. Matters such as the design, promotion, production, and cooperative marketing of cotton bean improvement throughout the province, as well as the technical guidance for cotton harvesting, ginning, and packaging, are all the responsibility of the management office. Counties with more than 50,000 acres of cotton bean promotion areas will establish one office, and those with more than 10,000 acres will establish one branch office. All tasks have been fully implemented. If significant results are achieved after the autumn of this year, the promotion will be expanded in the future.

### Jiading: Police Team Conducts Air Defense Drill

On the 17th, the county police chief and more than 80 members of the police training team conducted a temporary air defense drill. In the morning, leaflets were distributed throughout the city to inform all sectors of the population. In the afternoon, a signal was issued using the time bell of the Jinsha Pagoda to implement traffic control. From 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, lighting control was also implemented to search for poison gas, rescue the wounded and dead. The air defense gun team fired into the air, creating a very tense atmosphere.

### Suzhou: Shen Junru and Others to Be Publicly Tried

Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, Shi Liang, and seven others were arrested in Shanghai on November 23 last year. Shi Liang was released on bail to return to her hometown for medical treatment. Shen and the other six were transferred to the Jiangsu Higher Court in Suzhou and sent to the Higher Court Detention Branch Office in Hengjie, Wuxian County, for detention and investigation. Later, Shi Liang recovered from her illness and voluntarily surrendered in Suzhou. After being detained in the women's prison of the Simaqian Street detention center by the High Procuratorate, the prosecutor Weng Zannian completed the investigation. The defendants were charged with forming an organization for the purpose of jointly endangering the Republic of China and propagating doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. In accordance with Article 11 and Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 6 of the Emergency Crime Punishment Law for Jointly Endangering the Republic of China, except for Tao Xingzhi, Zhang Zhongmian, Chen Daohong, Chen Zhuo, and others whose whereabouts are unknown and have been wanted, the defendants Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, Luo Qing (in custody), Gu Liuxin, and Ren Songgao (on bail) were publicly prosecuted to the Criminal Court of the same court on the 3rd of this month. The presiding judge of the Criminal Court 1 of the Higher Court, Wen (Jiongfu), was assigned to hear the case. The case has been fully sorted out and is scheduled to be publicly tried on the 28th and 29th of this month. At that time, in addition to the presiding judge Fang Wenshen, and the chief clerk of the Wu Daquan subject, the two judges Si Wen and Zhu Jianxun will also attend the court to serve on the jury. Furthermore, Li Liejun (Xiehe), a member of the Central Committee who had been convalescing in the Soviet Union, went to the Higher Court Detention Branch Office and the Detention Center on the afternoon of the 17th to visit Shen Junru and Shi Liang, among others.

### Wuxi: Sericulture Farmers in Four Rural Areas Collect Ant Eggs

The spring silkworm season is approaching in an instant. The enthusiasm of farmers in the four rural areas of this county for silkworm farming is stronger than in previous years. The number of silkworm eggs ordered has increased sharply. As of the 18th, more than 145,300 sheets have been ordered. However, the silkworm model area has only received more than 142,000 sheets from the Improvement Association, which is not enough to distribute. The Tangshan Improvement Association purchased 100,000 sheets of Japanese silkworm eggs from Japan to provide assistance. The Japanese silkworm eggs have already been transported to the county and are approved to allocate 20,000 sheets to avoid a shortage of silkworm eggs. Currently, the various guidance stations are scheduled to distribute them on the 19th, 20th, and 21st for three days. However, because the weather this year is colder, the large spring silkworm must be collected by the end of this month. It is reported that a small number of sericulture households in the northern countryside are still using ten types of silkworm eggs, and their hatching period is earlier. They collected silkworm eggs yesterday, and the silkworm bodies are quite good.

Tourists Reach 60,000 People

This county is located on the shores of the lake, with beautiful mountains and clear waters. Party and state dignitaries, as well as people from various ports, come to Wuxi in groups to visit, with several thousand people every day. According to a survey by the county's railway station, an average of 3,000 more tickets must be collected on Saturdays and Sundays each week. At least 6,000 or more tourists arrive in Wuxi every week. If the weekly holidays and spring break during the spring season are combined, there are a total of more than 20 days of vacation, then there will be more than 60,000 tourists. Each tourist spends an average of four yuan in Wuxi, then there is a cash amount of more than 20 million yuan circulating in the county's market during the spring season. Travel agencies and groups came to Wuxi yesterday and the day before yesterday, and all the hotels were full, and the catering industry was booming.

Investigation of Police Chief's Case

Li Junjian, chief of the fifth police station in Dangkou Town, District 8, was recently charged by five citizens of the town, Hua Bingyi, Chen Guojun, Cai Tianmei, Wu Xingnong, and Jin Zhifan, with illegal extortion, bribery of opium offenders, and letting go of the ringleader of thieves. They filed a complaint with the Supervisory Envoy Office, requesting an investigation. After receiving the complaint, Supervisor Ding Han believed that the truth of the allegations should be thoroughly investigated and sent an official letter to County Chief Ji, who then instructed Police Chief Zhang Da to investigate and verify the facts.

### Changzhou: Robbery on the Wu-Li Road

Xiang Wei'an, a resident of Dongdai Town, District 2 of Wuyi, transported more than 50 piculs of rice to Wuxi for sale on the 14th of this month and obtained more than 200 yuan in rice money. On the afternoon of the 16th, he took the money back to Changzhou by car. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 PM, while traveling on the Wu-Li Road near the West Lane of Cuojiatang in Chendu Township, three robbers wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants suddenly appeared. Two of them, holding pistols, ordered Xiang Wei'an to stop. They immediately stepped forward to search him and took all the more than 200 yuan of rice money hidden on his body. They also ordered Zou Wei'an to follow them to a remote place under the desolate kiln at the top of Tangmen. The bandits then left in a north direction. Xiang Wei'an reported the incident to the township chief afterward and requested the county to investigate and arrest the bandits.

### Zhenjiang: Increase in the Proportion of Business Tax

The provincial revenue of Jiangsu Province is mainly from land tax and business tax. Regarding business tax, the initial collection was not effective due to the wait-and-see attitude of the business community, and the results were poor. Later, after several reorganizations, the amount collected gradually improved. However, the contractor system allowed many contractors to embezzle the funds. Since the Finance Department took over the collection itself from two years ago, it has been put on the right track. Last winter, the tax rate was amended, and the amount collected increased even more. The recently announced provincial budget lists the business tax revenue as 5,109,600 yuan, accounting for one-sixth of the total revenue, an increase of more than one million yuan compared to last year. For this increase, the Finance Department decided to increase the business tax. A meeting of business tax directors from all over the province was specially convened the day before yesterday to discuss this in detail. Preliminary agreements have been reached on both the tax rate and the proportion. Once the reorganization is completed, it can be submitted to the provincial government meeting for discussion and announcement. After this news spread, the business community gathered to discuss it. It is reported that the Provincial Federation of Commerce will convene a temporary members' meeting to discuss this matter.

### Nantong: Vehicle Inspection Uproar Subsides

Yao Daru, an inspector of the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration, inspected automobiles in Tongzhou. More than 200 vehicles were inspected, and 46 were found to be unqualified, resulting in the revocation of licenses and causing an uproar. Director Shen Qi of the Administration specially came to Tongzhou from Zhenjiang. After discussing with representatives of the Party and government agencies, it was decided that all unqualified vehicles would be repaired and then re-inspected by personnel dispatched on May 5. The problem was immediately resolved. Shen talked about Jiangsu Province's rectification of automobiles in various counties, prohibiting the sale of eliminated vehicles from Shanghai to the inland areas.

Lawyers Association Re-Elected

The Nantong County Lawyers Association held a general meeting of members at 1:00 PM on the 17th. As a result of the re-election, Liu Guoquan was elected as the president, and Zhu Rongchang was elected as the vice president.

### Ningbo: Major Fire in Caishi Lane

A major fire broke out in Caishi Lane, Lingqiao Road, at about 11:00 PM on the 16th. When the residents noticed it, it was already beyond control. Because the lane was very narrow, rescue was difficult, and the fire spread more violently. It took an hour to extinguish. The houses burned down include the Shixia Rong Shui Mu workshop, Chun Ji Oil Cage workshop, Fumao Fruit shop warehouse, Yongtai firewood shop, and residences of Yin Xinsheng, Chen Azhu, Qian Abaobao, Dai Azhu, and Gong Jintian, among others, as well as the Zhejiang Hotel on Lingqiao Road, the Yibi Qinfeng Southern Goods Store, the Yuan Tai Rice Shop, the Tongsheng Xiang Sesame Oil Shop, the Tianshun Distilling Shop, the Tong 　 Sauce Garden, the Shisheng Hat Shop, the Xiehe Straw Paper Shop, the Xianghe Sauce Garden on Haohe Street, the Taishun Linen Yarn Shop warehouse, the Yifeng Rice Warehouse, the Dingheng Linen Warehouse, and the Henghe Tai Hardware Store, among others, totaling more than 80 rooms, with losses amounting to more than 100,000 yuan.

Meteorological Observatory Opens Wind Signal Reporting

The places for which reports are being sent include Nanjing, Qingdao, Wusong, Kanmen, and Dinghai. National weather information is reported at 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM every day, and local weather information is broadcast at 7:30 AM. Those with radios can listen in at the appropriate times.

### Homeland Sightseeing Group Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Led by Group Leader Pan Kaixing, a Party of Twenty-Seven People to Stay for a Month, The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Held a Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome Them

Xin Xin News Agency reports that the second Homeland Sightseeing Group of the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Association, consisting of twenty-seven people led by Group Leader Pan Kaixing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 3:00 PM aboard the Tjisedane ship. They are staying at the New Asia Hotel and plan to stay in the homeland for a month to visit various places. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau held a tea party yesterday to welcome them, and organizations such as the China Children's Welfare Association are scheduled to hold a banquet at noon today. Group Leader Pan spoke about the motives and hopes of the second Homeland Sightseeing, and the details are recorded as follows:

Arrived Yesterday

The Tjisedane ship they were on arrived at the port at about 1:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. All the group members changed to ferries and arrived at the Jianghai Customs Wharf at about 2:00 PM to disembark. Those who went to welcome them included the director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, Jian Jinglun, receptionist Tan Zhonglu, the Overseas Chinese Cultural Affairs Department of National Jinan University, the South China Overseas Chinese Endeavor Association, the China Children's Welfare Association, the Chinese Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, and representatives from more than a hundred Shanghai YMCA and other organizations, holding banners that read "Welcome the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Homeland Sightseeing Group" at the wharf to welcome them. Group Leader Pan Kaixing led the group members to shake hands and thank all the welcoming personnel, and then took cars directly to the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, and attended the welcome tea party held by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau at 5:00 PM.

List of Group Members

Group Leader Pan Kaixing, group members Chen Jianzhang and his wife, Zhao Weilin and his wife, Chen Mianchang and his wife, Lin Shaolu and his wife, Xiao Fengrong and his wife, Yao Ronghui and his wife, Yang Zhongjie and his wife (male), Zhang Yizong, Guo Shenbao, Gao Longxian, Shi Xinjie, Han Quanging, Lin Ganlin, Liao Yuanyuan, Wei Xiaozhang, Chen Zhengui, and females Tang Baoniang, Chen Naizhi, Chen Yangliu, etc., totaling 27 people.

Group Leader's Speech

Group Leader Pan Kaixing said to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter that the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Sightseeing Group had returned to the homeland for inspection once before, and was very excited that various construction projects in the homeland were proceeding in order. Over the years, it must have made rapid progress, so there was a motive to organize a second Homeland Sightseeing Group, hoping to tell the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia about the various progress situations in the country and assist in the development of the homeland. As for the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, there are many of them. In Java alone, there are more than 600,000 people, most of whom are engaged in commerce, followed by agriculture and industry. However, in recent years, due to the cumulative effects, the economic situation of the overseas Chinese has not been as active as before. The overseas Chinese are all hardworking people, so in the face of the current state of decline, they are still working hard to unite and promote revitalization. It is hoped that compatriots in the country will communicate and assist in the progress.

Tea Party Welcomed

The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau held a tea party at the New Asia Hotel at 5:00 PM yesterday to welcome them. More than 50 people attended, including Jian Jinglun, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, and Group Leader Pan Kaixing of the group, as well as representatives from all group members and various organizations. First, Chairman Jian Jinglun gave a welcome speech, saying that today's tea party was held on behalf of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to welcome the Java Overseas Chinese Youth Homeland Sightseeing Group and express respect. Historically, overseas Chinese have paid close attention to and assisted in the various developments in the homeland. The enthusiasm for donating planes to celebrate birthdays last year is an example of this. It is hoped that overseas Chinese will often organize inspection groups to return to the country for inspection, so that they can promote to overseas Chinese the various construction situations that they have seen on the ground. The group's return to China this time is quite opportune, as the Chinese Art Exhibition has just opened in Beijing. Although this art exhibition is the second of its kind, it represents China's culture for thousands of years and is quite valuable. It is hoped that your group will visit Beijing. Then, Group Leader Pan Kaixing gave a reply speech, saying that he represented all the group members to express his gratitude and thanks for the warm welcome from the compatriots in the country. The overseas Chinese are very concerned about the homeland. This second return to the homeland is entirely to visit the various construction and progress situations in the homeland. It is hoped that compatriots in the country will also often organize inspection groups to inspect the situation of the overseas Chinese in order to seek common development.

Group Banquet

Six charitable organizations, including the China Children's Welfare Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Chinese Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, and the Shanghai YMCA, believe that the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have always supported and spared no effort in various social causes in the homeland, so they are scheduled to jointly hold a banquet at Yuantuan in Jiangwan at 12:30 PM today to fulfill the responsibility of the host. Organizations such as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the China National Foreign Trade Association are also preparing to hold a grand welcome and are currently negotiating the date.

Inspection Itinerary

The group plans to stay in the homeland for a month and is scheduled to return to Java from Shanghai on the 20th of next month.

### Public Concession Tram Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning, All Routes Suspended

Because the Company Did Not Agree to New Conditions and Immediate Negotiations, the Party and Government Thoroughly Investigated and Decided on Measures Today

According to the Greater Shanghai News Agency, workers in the vehicle and machinery departments of the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession announced a strike at 6:00 a.m. yesterday due to five new demands that the party and government repeatedly mediated but the company refused to accept. All trolleybuses and trams on all routes were suspended. The police sent detectives to maintain strict vigilance. The party and government authorities consulted on measures to be taken, and will first persuade the workers to resume work and await mediation. The details are as follows:

Negotiations Break Down

The tram workers originally had five demands, and the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to repeatedly invite labor and management to negotiate. Except for the retirement pay issue, which has been resolved, the remaining clauses have been difficult to resolve due to divergent opinions. The workers, to show their willingness to compromise, declared that they would only insist on: ➀ A raise of two days' pay per month for workers in the machinery department; ➁ An increase of one day's pay per month for drivers who work 25 days or more (for a total of three days, including the previous two days). The management also refused to accept this. The company's general manager, Ivan, also stated that he was about to go abroad and requested that the workers' conditions be discussed again after six months. The workers said they could not accept this, and the negotiations broke down.

Joint Strike

After the breakdown of negotiations, the workers held an emergency representative meeting the night before and decided to strike across the board yesterday morning. Therefore, starting at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, all of the company's trams (Route 1) Jing'an Temple to Park Shooting Range; (Route 2) Jing'an Temple to the Sixteen Pups; (Route 3) McLean Road to East New Bridge; (Route 4) Zongshan Road to Tilanqiao; (Route 5) The French Concession tram originally ran from Old West Gate to the North Railway Station, but due to the tram strike in the Public Concession, the route has been shortened to Old West Gate to East New Bridge; (Route 6) Round Road; (Route 7) North Railway Station to Tilanqiao; (Route 8) Yangshupu to the Sixteen Pups; (Route 12) Jing'an Temple to Tilanqiao, trolleybuses (Route 14) Minguo Road to the North Railway Station; (Route 15) Sanyangjing Bridge to Yuezhou Road; (Route 16) Caojiadu to Minguo Road; (Route 17) Dapu Bridge to Lan Road, Kunming Road; (Route 18) Xieqiao to Yuezhou Road; (Route 19) Minguo Road to Little Shadu; (Route 20) Jing'an Temple to Zhaofeng Park; (Route 21) Gordon Road to Pingliang Road. All vehicles on all routes were suspended. The French Concession trams on Routes 4 and 5, as well as trolleybuses on Routes 47 and 18, were also temporarily not running into the Public Concession.

Party and Government Measures

Since the suspension of trams on all routes, traffic in the city has been extremely inconvenient. Public buses on all routes have suddenly become crowded. The party and government authorities believe that a prolonged stalemate would not only cause losses to both labor and management, but also seriously harm society. Therefore, in addition to sending personnel to investigate the details of the strike, they decided to consult on measures to be taken this morning, and will urge the workers to resume work first in order to seek a proper solution. It is reported that the management has indicated that it can make concessions, while the workers believe that this strike is the third time and insist on not resuming work until their goals are achieved. Therefore, the future of the labor unrest is of great concern.

Police Security

Since the tram workers in the Public Concession put forward five demands, the police have been closely monitoring the trend of negotiations by sending personnel from the Political Department to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Since the labor unrest broke out again yesterday, the police immediately ordered a large number of detectives to go to Hart Road, Wayside Road, and Baker Road, at all tram depots, to maintain order and maintain strict vigilance. The headquarters on North Suzhou Road has also dispatched police detectives for protection. However, the workers have been strictly observing order, except for finding a communication location and waiting for news, and no accidents have occurred.

Petition This Morning

Since the tram workers implemented the joint strike, both party and government agencies and the company have stopped working because it happens to be Sunday. Therefore, the two sides have not conducted negotiations. The workers' attitude is unusually firm in order to implement the demands. If they do not achieve their goals, they will not hesitate to make significant sacrifices. However, in order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible to avoid affecting traffic, they have specifically appointed representatives such as Yang Zhaoyu to go to the Municipal Party Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, and other agencies this morning to petition, requesting practical assistance.

### Zhu Qinglan and Others Will Fly to Sichuan This Morning

Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief Work Committee, went to Beijing on the 16th to discuss relief measures for the Sichuan-Guizhou earthquake disaster. After meeting with Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, Wei Daoming, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and others, Zhu returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. Zhu said that the Ministry of Finance allocated one million yuan in public bonds for relief of the Sichuan disaster. Now, a deal has been negotiated with Juxingcheng Bank to mortgage the bonds for 714,000 yuan in cash. Therefore, he is scheduled to take the China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Chongqing line aircraft to Sichuan this morning with Secretary Rao Pinqing, Cao Zhonghuan, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, and others to provide relief. According to Zhu's interview with a reporter from the New News Agency, after receiving one million yuan in public bonds from the Ministry of Finance for earthquake relief in Sichuan, he immediately consulted with Ren Shishang, manager of Juxingcheng Bank, to handle the conversion of the bonds into cash. Because the funds were urgently needed, the bank has found a way to convert them into cash, totaling 714,000 yuan, which has been remitted to the Chongqing head office by the bank. Therefore, he will first go to Chongqing to receive the funds from the bank, and then go to Chengdu to meet with the Sichuan provincial authorities to discuss everything. The preliminary plan is to contact the Sichuan provincial authorities and local gentry to organize a large-scale relief association so that personnel can be sent to the disaster areas to conduct on-site investigations and relief. In addition to the one million yuan in public bonds allocated by the Ministry, another one million yuan will be allocated by the Sichuan Provincial Government. He has already consulted with Liu Hangchen, Director of Finance of Sichuan Province in Shanghai, today (18th). Liu advocated that all three million yuan of agricultural loans from the Agricultural Bank of China be used for agricultural loans. As for the provincial government's relief funds, Liu has telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Bank Association to prepare 714,000 yuan from each bank to form 1,428,000 yuan as urgent relief funds. In addition to the special commissioner sent by the Ministry of Finance to supervise the implementation, he has also telegraphed Hong San, the special commissioner sent by the former Executive Yuan to supervise the implementation in Xikang, to go to supervise the implementation nearby. He will stay in Sichuan for about four days, and then fly to Lanzhou, Gansu for inspection. After staying in Gansu for about three days, he will return to Shanghai.

### Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association Asks Ministry of Finance to Prevent Dumping of Foreign Silk

Luo Qinghua Has Gone to the Capital to Petition

The Silk and Satin Industry Association believes that the tax rates on rayon and woven products are unbalanced, and foreign silk can be dumped. If we do not seek remedies urgently, the surge will drain the national silk industry, leaving it as dried fish in the market. Luo Qinghua, Chairman of the Association, went to the capital a few days ago to meet with the Ministry of Finance to discuss remedial measures. The reasons given are that the initial import tax on rayon in China was set at 60% ad valorem, and the import tax on woven products was 80% ad valorem. The intention was to make the tax rate on woven products higher than the raw material tax, so as to prevent the domestic sale of foreign silk. The legislation was excellent. However, rayon is taxed by quantity. The price of each box of goods used to be 500 yuan, but now it has fallen to 150 yuan. Because the tariff is based on quantity, it still needs to pay 290 yuan. Its tax rate is almost three times lower than that of woven products. The tariff barrier is counterproductive. Our country's silk industry uses raw materials with a three-fold tax rate to weave goods, and compares them with foreign woven products with 80% ad valorem tax. The selling price is vastly different (the original price of a box of rayon in China is 150 yuan, plus 290 yuan in tariffs, plus 11% profit on rayon, the total cost is 456 yuan. Foreign countries use raw materials worth 150 yuan, plus 80% ad valorem tax of 120 yuan, the total cost is 270 yuan). The breach of defense will lead to a collapse. Last year, a certain country's silk spinning industry has filled the market. In the past three or four months, like bamboo shoots after a rain, the markets in various ports and cities are full of them, dumping goods at low prices. General merchants, because of their cheap prices and good quality, are easy to attract, and act as sacrificial lambs, competing to promote them. At this time when summer goods are just starting, there is a danger of being wiped out by foreign goods in one fell swoop. If measures are not taken urgently to restore the balance of tariffs, the sale of military silk will be bankrupted, and millions of weavers will lose their jobs. The future is dangerous and unimaginable. The Association once sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a re-imposition of import taxes on woven products. On the one hand, before rayon has its own manufactured products, the import tax will be collected ad valorem. Now, because the matter is significant, it is necessary to not only find ways to prevent the invasion of foreign silk, but also to consider the consequences of rejecting a tiger and introducing a wolf. Therefore, they made a special trip to the capital to discuss the matter at length.

### Shanghai Bank Held Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday

At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank on Ningbo Road held its annual shareholders' meeting.

### Zhabei Water and Electricity Company Held Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday

Actively Expanding Both Water and Electricity Sections, Directors and Supervisors Re-elected After Term Expiration

The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company held its 13th Annual Shareholders Meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association yesterday, and also held a joint 3rd Additional Capital Increase Shareholders Meeting. A total of 258,415 shares were represented, totaling 235,740 votes. The meeting opened at 2:00 p.m. Le Zhenbao was elected as the chairman. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the supervisors first reported on the capital increase situation, and then the general manager Lu Bohong reported on the business situation. He said,

The business of our company in the 25th year can be divided into three stages. The first half of the year was affected by the decline of various industries last year, and the business was even worse than that of the 24th year. This was a period of hesitation. In the second half of the year, the market was active, various industries made rapid progress, and factories were operating day and night, so the demand for electricity suddenly increased. This was a period of development. In the autumn, it was affected by local rumors, and at the beginning of winter, the Xi'an Incident occurred. Residents moved away, and industrial demand declined. This was an unexpected period. Although the changes in one year were different, the policy of progress remained the same. The total business revenue for the whole year was still higher than last year, which is gratifying to all shareholders.

The business and engineering of the water and electricity sections can also be roughly described separately. Although the demand for water did not reach the expected level, due to the increase in demand last year, the original water production of the water plant was about to be exceeded, so preparations had to be made in advance. Therefore, the water plant expansion project determined last year began construction in early March, including a settling tank, four rapid filtration tanks, a water tower, and a 900-kilometer trunk line. All of these can be completely completed before the summer of the 26th year, to meet the increased demand during the hot summer. After this expansion, the daily water output can be increased by more than 36,000 cubic meters. In view of the business situation in the 25th year, it is necessary to promote outlets to digest this new water output. Therefore, it was decided to expand the water supply on Zhongshan Road. There are many factories and residents are increasing there. It is expected that after the pipe water supply, it will definitely enhance the business.

In the electrical section, in the second half of the year, the demand from various factories suddenly increased, and the maximum load jumped to more than 29,000 kilowatts. Fortunately, the Guangchong project decided last year was carried out as scheduled. A new 14,000-kilowatt turbine generator, two boilers with a steam output of 50 tons per hour, and other equipment were installed and tested before the end of the year, so that they could cope with the sudden increase in demand without being caught off guard. There is still one boiler that will be installed in the 26th year. At the same time, in order to promote business, the pole line supplying power to Jiafeng Textile Factory was used to sign a contract with Jiading Huaxing Yongji Electric Light Factory to supply power to the factory, which has been implemented. The Nanshang Shengming Electric Company is also being powered by our company, and negotiations have matured. A new Yinghua area is being expanded in the Pu Song area of ​​West Shanghai, which has been approved by the competent authorities. The convenience of the location and the company's business are mutually beneficial. However, in view of the past situation, the demand for electricity has continued to increase. Therefore, in the 26th year, the second phase of the power plant expansion plan was decided again, and another 14,000-kilowatt turbine generator was purchased, which is in progress. It is expected that after the completion of the second phase of expansion, it can be handled with ease in three or four years, without fear of being exhausted. This is a general overview of the business and engineering of the water and electricity sections.

The company's efforts have won the government's commendation and the investors' trust. The Construction Committee has awarded an honorary certificate, and it has been awarded for five consecutive years up to this session. The increase in capital has proceeded smoothly each time. The one million yuan for the third capital increase has been fully collected, and the company bonds issued for the second time have also been fully subscribed, making the company's economy stable. Although the business revenue of this session has increased compared with last year, most of the increase is electricity, which is extremely low in cost. The electricity price has also been reduced in this session, so the profit is thinner. Since the company is determined to assist industry and commerce, it should have a long-term vision and strive for prosperity with various industries, without being obsessed with its own self-interest, which should be approved by all shareholders.

The supervisors then reported on the accounts, passed the profit distribution and two amendment proposals, and finally elected directors and supervisors. The results of the vote were: Lu Bohong, Shi Shengzhi, Qian Xinzhi, Feng Bingnan, Le Zhenbao, Xu Xinliu, Wang Zisong, Zhu Shoucheng, Chen Fanqian, Zhang Yunbo, Xu Chunrong, Shi Bingzhi, Zhu Kongjia, Lu Zidong, and Shen Lianfang were elected as directors. Shi Boqun, Wang Yunfu, Xu Qianlin, Li Jisheng, and Liu Pinsan were elected as supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m. It was also learned that the company's dividends and bonuses for the 25th year will be issued starting on May 10th of this year.

### Various Chinese Goods Organizations Jointly Request Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction

Submitted to Foreign Minister Wang

Various organizations in the city, including the Federation of Chinese National Products Manufacturers, the National Goods Consumption Association, the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association, the Federation of Citizens of the First Special Zone, and the National Goods Movement Committee, jointly submitted a petition to Foreign Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that in order to implement the central government's resolution, they requested the speedy declaration of the abolition of consular jurisdiction of various countries in China in order to restore national rights and comfort the people. Since the Opium War, foreign disasters have been pressing down on us, and various countries have forced us to sign unequal treaties, among which the most damaging to our national sovereignty is consular jurisdiction. Those unscrupulous foreigners in China use consular jurisdiction as a shield to openly act out of bounds and humiliate Chinese people, or harbor smugglers, or traffic in drugs. If they are reported, they are not subject to trial under our country's laws and can still escape justice. As a result, social tranquility and the national economy are all adversely affected. At the Washington Conference, the Chinese representatives stated the harms and negotiated for abolition, but although various countries organized inspection teams to come to China to investigate the judiciary, no results were achieved. This year, the central government held the Third Plenary Session and paid special attention to this, and made a resolution to abolish consular jurisdiction of various countries in China. Today, our country's unification has been completed, and the judicial system is improving day by day, which is proven by the facts. The excuse of judicial misconduct no longer exists. Therefore, we specifically request Your Excellency to uphold the legacy of abolishing unequal treaties, based on the resolution of the Third Plenary Session, and proceed with negotiations to abolish consular jurisdiction of various countries in China. If there are those who do not understand our country's situation and attempt to obstruct it, we especially hope that you will resolutely declare abolition on your own initiative with the spirit of revolutionary diplomacy in order to restore national rights and comfort the people. We are deeply grateful.

### Silk Weaving Industry Labor Unrest at a Stalemate

Appeal Case May Be Approved Today or Tomorrow, Zhenhua and Three Other Factories Strike Again

According to the Dagon Company, the labor unrest in the silk weaving industry in this city has not yet stabilized. Strikes and slowdowns have occurred one after another in silk factories in various districts. The municipal government's appeal to the industry association may be approved today or tomorrow, and the original method determined by the Social Affairs Bureau will be followed. The details are as follows:

Meiya and Other Factories Are Still at a Stalemate

After the Shanghai silk factory labor-management dispute was resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers had complied with the order to resume work. Half a month has passed, but the management has not yet accepted the expression and has filed an appeal to the municipal government requesting the withdrawal of the order, which has aroused the anger of the workers. The workers of Meiya Jingwei Factory and the General Factory first went on strike and petitioned the party and government, but there was no result. Later, Meiya's weaving factories announced a shutdown due to a lack of raw materials. The workers in each factory requested that they be ordered to start work, but there was no result. The labor attitude is currently very strong. If the management does not accept the method approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, they are afraid of resuming work. Therefore, the current situation is still at a stalemate.

Zhenye and Other Factories Announce Strikes

Zhenye Weaving Factory, No. 689 Baker Road, Pudong, with more than 400 workers, is one of the largest silk factories in the city. On the afternoon of the 19th, the workers went on strike because the factory refused to implement the conditions approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The management tried to persuade people to mediate, but the workers were determined that there was no possibility of negotiation because the factory did not accept the government's order, so there was no result. The workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau the day before, requesting strict orders for the management to comply with the compromise method. Zhang Chuqiang met them and promised to forward the request to the director for verification and order the workers to resume work first. The workers expressed dissatisfaction and are currently continuing their strike. Also, Yi Xin and Yue Ping two silk factories on Xietu Road in South Shanghai also went on strike the day before due to the same reason, and negotiations have not yet yielded results.

The Dispute Between Fuxing and Puyi is Resolved

Fuxing Silk Weaving Factory on Bailinan Road, West Shanghai, with more than 400 workers, once went on strike the day before due to requests for implementation of conditions and subsidies, and the transformation of tools. After the dispatch of personnel by the Third District Silk Weaving Trade Union, it was agreed that the workers in the preparatory department would receive a subsidy of 27 cents per day, and the workers in the weaving department would receive a subsidy of 30 cents per day. All other conditions were implemented in accordance with the order, and the dispute was resolved. The workers also worked as usual yesterday morning. Also, more than 500 workers in Puyi and Tongyi Silk Factory on Xiaoshadu Road also announced a slowdown starting at 4:00 p.m. the day before because they requested the implementation of the conditions approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The night workers did not enter the factory. The Puto Road Police Station and personnel from the First District Labor Union were dispatched to jointly mediate and persuade the workers to resume work immediately. Wages will be paid as usual during the slowdown. The Social Affairs Bureau approved the conditions, and the factory agreed to investigate within March. If other factories have already implemented them, they will be paid the same. The workers expressed their acceptance and resumed work at noon yesterday.

The Municipal Government Decides to Maintain the Order

The compromise method proposed by the Social Affairs Bureau in this labor unrest takes into account both sides and is extremely fair. However, both labor and management were dissatisfied in the past, but the labor side has complied with the order to resume work. However, the management has not yet agreed to accept it and has filed an appeal to the municipal government requesting further mediation and has notified all member factories that they must not implement it alone. After delaying for half a month, it has aroused the resentment of the workers, and strikes and slowdowns have occurred one after another. There is a possibility that the labor unrest will expand again. The Social Affairs Bureau has already replied to the appeal and requested that the municipal government maintain the original proposal. After the mayor heard the report, he invited opinions from all parties and believed that the labor unrest should be resolved quickly in order to protect the budding national industry and take care of social security and the people's livelihoods. Therefore, it was decided to maintain the Social Affairs Bureau's order to quell the labor unrest. Yesterday was Sunday and offices were closed. The order will be issued today or tomorrow.

### Young Man in Western Suit Impersonates Yu Xuezhong's Eldest Son

Dares to Swindle in Minhang; Car Overturns in Ditch Due to Careless Driving

At 1 PM the day before yesterday, a young man in a Western suit, driving a car with municipal license plate 7735, rented license plate 7957, arrived at the Shanghai-Minhang Company on Guohuo Road in the South City, seeking out Ge Zimin, a Shandong driver from the No. 2 car. Because Ge was in Minhang, he drove the car to Minhang to find Ge, but Ge was not there. Ge's wife asked about his intentions, and he claimed to be the eldest son of Yu Xuezhong, commander of the 51st Army. He said he wanted to buy a new car, so he came to find Ge and falsely claimed that Ge's aunt was seriously ill in Shanghai and suggested that she take his car to visit her. Ge's wife declined because she had just come from the countryside. Unable to achieve his goal, he claimed that he had not brought any money and planned to buy something else in Minhang, so he asked to borrow a few yuan, promising to return it when Ge came to his residence. Ge's wife then asked Cheng Tonglu, a porter at the station, to borrow nine yuan in national currency from the accounting office, and Cheng accompanied him on a tour of the town. At 4 PM, he got into the car and drove back to Shanghai. However, while driving south of the Tongqiao station, due to lack of skill, the car overturned into a ditch by the roadside. The two people in the car both suffered facial injuries. At the time, the station staff still thought he was the real Yu's son and helped rescue the people, taking them to a nearby sanatorium for treatment. They then notified the Minhang station to send someone to tow the vehicle. After the injured were bandaged by the doctor, they hired another car to take them to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment. The driver was sent away first, and then he took the opportunity to escape. Later, when the driver returned, intending to drive the car back, he realized that he had been tricked by an imposter. The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau detained him. However, when questioning the driver, he seemed unaware and possibly had been deceived himself. After contacting the Yu residence, they were informed that the son was only five years old. The car is currently being held at the county government, and the driver has been released on bail while the origin of the car is being investigated.

### Boiler Explosion at Minyi Factory Injures Workers

Two or Three Rooms Burned; Seven or Eight Workers Injured

At 995 Xitiyu Association Road, Jiangwan, at the Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory, founded by a Chinese-Western pharmacy, at 3:45 PM yesterday, while medicine was being refined on the stove, the boiler suddenly exploded, and sparks spread to the factory building, becoming uncontrollable. The fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire. As a result, two or three rooms were burned down, and seven or eight workers were burned by the medicine, but fortunately, they were only slightly injured. They were treated by the factory's doctors and quickly recovered.

### Egg Factory Worker Ma Mingyi Dies from Injury

Falls Through Elevator Gap; Dies Despite Hospital Treatment

Ma Mingyi, a 22-year-old worker from Nanjing at the China Egg Factory at 501 Minhang Road, fell from the elevator gap while working on the third floor of the factory at 12:20 PM the day before yesterday. At the time, approximately 300 pounds of almonds were being loaded onto the elevator, and Ma planned to carry the heavy load out of the elevator. For the convenience of carrying, the driver had raised the elevator about two feet. However, as Ma was bending over to carry the large bag, he could not bear the weight of the load and fell through the elevator gap, suffering severe injuries. The factory quickly sent him to Tongren Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The body was taken to the forensic center on Feilun Road. The Hongkou police station ordered Detective Chen Dabao to investigate. Yesterday morning, the First Special Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhang Zongru to the center to confirm the cause of death. It was determined to be an accidental death, and the body was released to his uncle, Ma Guangyi, for burial after he signed the necessary documents.

### Leniency in Sentencing for Inducing Prostitution

Chen Gezi Gets Off Easy; Chen Xiaowuzi Flees

Xiao Chengbao, a 19-year-old woman from Yancheng living in a shed on Robison Road in western Shanghai, worked at the Shenxin Yarn Factory. On the 25th day of the first lunar month of this year, she fell ill at home. Her friend Chen Gezi, on the pretext of accompanying her to see a doctor, took Xiao Chengbao to the Tiansheng Hotel on Datong Road for the night. The next day, he took her to another hotel for another night. On the fourth day, he handed her over to Chen Xiaowuzi, who took her to Tianjin on the Hubei steamer. She was housed in Xuxing Lane in the Japanese concession. Chen Xiaowuzi then sold Xiao Chengbao into prostitution. Xiao Chengbao vowed not to comply. The brothel owner, because Xiao Chengbao refused to receive guests, returned her to Chen Xiaowuzi, who brought Xiao Chengbao back to Shanghai to find another buyer. However, Xiao Chengbao, realizing that she had arrived in Shanghai, escaped back home like a bird freed from its cage and told her parents, who reported the matter to the police. Chen Gezi was arrested and brought before the local court, while Chen Xiaowuzi fled. Prosecutor Jiang prosecuted him for abduction. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wang Shanxiang. Xiao Chengbao, accompanied by her mother, Xiao Cao, testified to the previous events. Chen Gezi vehemently denied the charges, claiming they were malicious accusations. Finally, witnesses Qi Amao and Tang Cailian testified that they had seen Chen Gezi taking Xiao Chengbao to the hotel. The judge, finding the facts clear, immediately announced the verdict: Chen Gezi was found guilty of joint abduction, but in consideration of the fact that the victim was a woman, he was sentenced to three months of imprisonment as a warning.

The embassy should do its best to assist, but the credibility of these businesses and the reliability of their products have a significant impact on international trade.

For the convenience of the consulates in managing this, all members who intend to promote trade overseas in the future should submit their requests to the Ministry of Industry's International Trade Bureau for review and transmission to ensure proper procedure and facilitate sales. You are hereby notified to comply accordingly.

Xing discovered the act and reported it to the police, who arrested Xu Hongshou. The Tangqiao police station transferred the case to the local court. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin investigated the case. The plaintiff claimed that there was only one instance of rape. However, a forensic examination revealed traces of more than ten instances of rape, even the hymen had been ruptured. The girl stated that she had been raped more than ten times since January of this year, or the twelfth lunar month of last year. The defendant, however, firmly denied the charges. The prosecutor stated that the facts were clear and there was no room for denial. He filed a public prosecution for the crime of rape of a minor. Because the main punishment in this case is severe, the court specifically appointed a pro bono lawyer, Liu Xiang, to defend him. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Chen. The plaintiff and Xing Meimei both claimed that there was only one instance of rape. The defendant still denied the charges. The prosecutor, based on the facts and the victim's testimony, requested a severe sentence. The defense lawyer, based on the defendant's defense, argued that Xing Zhigang had a feud with the defendant and was venting his anger by injuring his daughter with his fingers and framing the defendant. He argued that a ten-year-old girl who had not yet developed could not have been sexually violated by a man more than ten times. The court concluded the debate and will announce the verdict on the 22nd.

### Reporters Association Requests Municipal Government to Thoroughly Investigate Case of Police Officer Assaulting Reporter

Sixteenth Precinct Sends Letter to Reporters Association, Claiming the Officer Was a Supervisor Dispatched by Headquarters

The Shanghai Journalists Association, regarding the case of its member Qu Yicheng being assaulted by a police officer from the Sixteenth Precinct, had sent a letter to the Municipal Police Department requesting strict punishment. On the 17th, the association received a letter from the Sixteenth Precinct stating that the officer responsible for maintaining traffic that day was a supervisor dispatched by the Municipal Police Headquarters and not an officer directly under the jurisdiction of the precinct. That evening, the association received reports from members of various newspapers stating that the Municipal Police Department had sent letters to each newspaper stating that an investigation had been conducted and that nothing had occurred. On the 18th, the association received a letter from member Zhai Yicheng, providing a supplementary account of the incident. The association immediately convened an emergency executive meeting that day (the 18th). It was decided to submit a request to the Municipal Government to dispatch personnel to conduct a fair and thorough investigation to ensure the convenience of journalists exercising their duties.

The Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Sixteenth Precinct sent a letter, stating: "We have read the news item in your newspaper entitled 'Police Officer from Sixteenth Precinct Assaults Journalist.' The content is inconsistent with the facts. On that day, all traffic matters were placed under special guard, and a supervisor dispatched by headquarters was in charge of directing traffic. The journalist attempted to enter the restricted area and was explained to and persuaded by the supervisor, which led to a misunderstanding. This is a matter within the supervisor's authority and responsibility, and this precinct cannot arbitrarily interfere. Furthermore, the supervisor is not a direct subordinate of this precinct. How could we have the ability to allow the supervisor to assault the journalist? In addition to reporting the facts of the day to headquarters, we fear that the outside world may misunderstand the truth. Therefore, we are sending this letter to request a correction. To the Shen Bao Newspaper, from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Sixteenth Precinct, April 18th."

### Zhang Afeng, Waitress at the Great New World, Suspected of Bigamy Due to Husband's Poverty

Denies Marriage Relationship with Shi; Shi Presents Evidence of Marriage

Zhang Afeng, a first-class waitress (commonly known as a "glass cup") at the Great New World Entertainment Center, enjoying a reputation as one of the top beauties, unwilling to be harmonious with her rustic husband, Shi Lianfa, in her ultra-modern identity, used her opportunity and skills in entertaining guests to fall in love with and commit herself to Zeng Rongzhang, a wealthy soy sauce merchant. On December 8th of last year, they formally held their wedding ceremony, thinking that their love would finally be fulfilled. However, the beautiful scene did not last long. Shi discovered the affair and sued her in the local court, ordering Zhang Afeng to post bail and indicting her for bigamy. Zeng Rongzhang, not knowing about the previous marriage, was investigated by Judge Bai Dongling. Zhang Afeng denied any marital relationship with Shi, claiming that she had only been raped by Shi once in an attempt to extort money, leading to the lawsuit. However, Shi Lianfa presented evidence of their marriage. Therefore, the judge determined that Zhang Afeng was guilty of bigamy due to her husband's poverty and sentenced her to four months of imprisonment in court. She is currently within the appeal period and has been released on the original bail.

### Zhejiang Provincial Association Cables Zhejiang Provincial Government to Relieve Panic Over Silkworm Feeding

Sudden and Rapid Increase in Silkworm Egg Hatching This Year; Panic Inevitable Due to Peak Leaf-Eating Season; Two Suggestions Proposed for Adoption and Implementation

The Zhejiang Provincial Association cabled the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday to request relief from the panic over mulberry leaves, stating: "To Zhu Junjian, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, our Zhejiang Province has always been a prosperous region for sericulture. Since the drastic drop in overseas silk prices, silkworm farmers have viewed raising silkworms as a daunting task and no longer

pay attention to planting mulberry trees

leaving them barren and uncultivated, with no efforts to cultivate them. The good mulberry forests have gradually become bare. Our association believes that sericulture is a natural benefit to our country. In the autumn of the year before last, we requested the former provincial government to issue an order to all counties, stating that the silk market was gradually improving and that sericulture would surely recover. We advised farmers to fertilize and replant their existing mulberry gardens to meet the needs of feeding silkworms and composed a

song to encourage farmers

describing the possibility of sericulture recovering, distributing and posting it as encouragement. However, considering the ten-year plan of planting trees, it is impossible to restore the once lush and verdant appearance of the mulberry trees, which are gradually withering, overnight. Last year, silkworm farmers, bearing the burden of years of failure, did not have a strong interest in raising silkworms, and the harvest was only moderately good. Therefore, the

supply of mulberry leaves

was still able to meet the demand. This year, there has been a sudden and rapid increase, with improved breeds of silkworm eggs hatching, increasing by 20% compared to last year. The native species are also showing similar trends. However, the mulberry leaves, which are essential for feeding, are far from as abundant as in the past. With the arrival of the peak leaf-eating season, it is inevitable that a

shortage will occur

leaf prices will skyrocket, and the costs will outweigh the benefits. The future of silkworm feeding is deeply worrying. Our association, deeply concerned about local affairs, has the following suggestions for relieving the leaf shortage: ㊀ Based on the silkworm season in various regions, which varies due to differences in climate, soil, and customs, some are earlier and some are later. For example, in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area, Yuhang is the earliest, followed by Haining and Xiashi, and then Jiaxing and other regions. After the

silkworm season ends early

there are still surplus leaves in some areas. Qingyunqiao, Xieqiao, and Guodian, in particular, have always been known as leaf mountains. In the past, merchants would often transport leaves to the lower reaches to sell. Due to the inconvenience of transportation in the past, there was often a lament that goods were abandoned on the ground. It is proposed that the Construction Department be ordered to consult with the Sericulture Control Association to borrow the remaining funds from the improvement fund and dispatch personnel to the counties with abundant leaves to

purchase them separately

(or have the county guidance offices take on the responsibility). At the same time, the Highway Bureau should be ordered to provide 20 designated vehicles to transport the leaves in batches daily to areas lacking leaves for sale. The route from Yuhang to Jiaxing is the longest, and it is estimated that two round trips can be made daily. This will ensure that market prices are stabilized and prevent price gouging or speculation, and the silkworm feeding can be assured. ㊀ To fundamentally revitalize the sericulture industry, it is necessary to promote mulberry planting, especially relying on high-quality mulberry seedlings to ensure vigorous growth. In recent years, due to the low value of mulberry leaves,

the planting of mulberry seedlings

has also been affected. It is proposed that the Control Association prepare millions of mulberry seedlings and distribute them to the counties for distribution to farmers. At the same time, consult with various banks to provide loans for farmers to purchase mulberry seedlings for replanting. It is also necessary to encourage them to apply more fertilizer, cultivate diligently, and increase production so that the benefits of mulberry planting can gradually develop, especially for the revival of the rural areas, which will be greatly beneficial. Respectfully hoping that the Honorable Chairman, with deep concern for the people's livelihood, will pay special attention to improving the sericulture industry. Are these humble suggestions feasible? We earnestly hope that you will review them and adopt them. We will be infinitely grateful. Shanghai Zhejiang Provincial Association respectfully.

### Embezzlement Case of Detective

Public Trial to be Held Tomorrow for the Third Time

Liu Bingyuan, the leader of the Zhabei Sixth Squad of the Municipal Police Department's Detective General Team, and detectives Miao Yizhong, Wu Songshan, and others, were previously sued by Ruan Defu, who owns a leather goods and sundries shop at No. 119 Xinmin Road in the Shanghai Local Court, for embezzling money under false pretenses of official duties. The prosecutor has filed a public prosecution, and Judge Li Xuedeng has held two public trials on March 23rd and April 2nd. However, due to insufficient evidence, it was ruled that further summons and investigations were needed and the date for the hearing was postponed. It has now been learned that the court has issued subpoenas to the plaintiff, defendant, witnesses, and related parties, scheduling the third public trial for 9 AM on the 20th of this month (i.e., tomorrow). The previous trial had a full audience, and a large number of attendees are expected this time as well.

### Forged Receipts and Stamps: Wu Yongsheng and Others Defraud for Money

Defrauding Various Associations of Membership Fees

Wu Yongsheng from Anhui, colluded with Wang Yuming from Pinghu around January of this year, forging receipts for the Civic National Goods Promotion Association located at 47 Gaodun Street, Ji畝地, Huajie. They privately carved a seal and defrauded Hengyi Sheng Department Store on Wusong Road, Hua Feng Cotton Weaving Factory on Qipu Road, Puqiu Hardware Store on Fujian Road, Yuhua Mirror Store on Tiantong Road, and other businesses, collecting over 頁 yuan in membership fees, which they divided and spent. On February 3rd, Wu was arrested by Feng Qishan, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, and taken to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Subsequently, Detective Feng discovered that Wang had committed the same crime at the Chinese District Court and was sentenced to three months in prison. He then sent an official letter to have Wu transferred to the Criminal Court III. After an interrogation, Wu was returned to the police station. The other day, Wu and Wang were both escorted to court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, prosecuted them under Article 210 of the Criminal Code for forging documents and obtaining property by fraud, requesting an investigation. When questioned, the two defendants stammered in their testimonies. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled a sentencing date.

### Chen Tingbiao Loses Thousands of Yuan Gambling on "Turn-Over Game," Seeks Justice

Defendants Fail to Appear; Chen Requests Suspension of Trial

There is a group in Shanghai known as the "Turn-Over Game" gang, specializing in luring people into gambling. They use dice filled with lead or cards with pre-made marks to cheat people out of their money. They are commonly referred to as "Ground Measurements." Chen Tingbiao, residing at No. 15 Yujia Lane, Rue Wagner, in the French Concession, was invited by Hu Aqing, Ren Ajiu, Zhou Mingde, Zhao Zhiquan, and others on March 1st this year to gamble on Pai Gow in Room 207 of the Paramount Hotel on Yuyuan Road. They gambled for five consecutive days, and Chen lost every time. In total, he lost about 800 yuan in cash and owed 200 yuan. He pawned a diamond ring worth 300 yuan. On the 6th, they continued to gamble, but Chen discovered obvious patterns on the cards, which were the so-called "disordered muscle cards." He realized he had been cheated and immediately seized sixteen cards. He negotiated with Hu and the others. At that time, the Paramount Hotel hastily closed its iron gate. After mediation, everyone dispersed. Now, Chen is unwilling to accept this and has hired lawyer Li Zhongwen to file a criminal lawsuit against Hu and the other four in the Special District Court for fraudulent acquisition of property. He also filed a civil lawsuit, demanding the return of the 808 yuan in cash that was cheated and the diamond ring worth 300 yuan. The other day, Judge Pan Zhenyang of the Special District Court opened the Criminal Court V to summon the defendants Hu Aqing, Ren Ajiu, Zhou Mingde, and Zhao Zhiquan, but none of them appeared. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Li Zhongwen, immediately requested that the case be suspended. Judge Pan approved the request and ruled that the trial would be suspended.

Regarding the civil case, they requested that it be suspended in accordance with Article 183 of the Civil Procedure Law. The court, after reviewing the situation, ruled that the case would be investigated and re-examined at a later date.

### Wu Yaozong and Zhao Sihong Gather Crowds for a Bloody Brawl

A Jocular Remark Turns into Resentment; Police Station Should Investigate

Wu Yaozong, over 30 years old and nicknamed "Chicken Feather Girl," the owner of the First Teahouse across from the Qiujiang Bridge Small Vegetable Market in Zhabei, is a well-known hooligan. Last autumn, he led his followers to hack Nantong native Cheng Liuming with axes and was wanted by the police. Wu fled to another port to evade punishment but recently returned secretly, claiming to be a detective team member of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, wearing a pistol and swaggering through the streets, boasting to his peers. Around 3:00 AM the other morning, Wu encountered Zhao Sihong, a native of Yangzhou whom he knew, at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Old Baz Road. They exchanged jokes, but Wu suddenly became angry and fired a shot. Fortunately, Zhao was alert and ran away. Then, both sides displayed their power and gathered over forty followers each, armed with pistols and axes, and engaged in a brawl. As a result, four or five people were injured on each side and bleeding profusely. They each hired cars to take them to the hospital, and the crowd dispersed. Until yesterday morning, both sides gathered again at the First Teahouse, intending to brawl again. The number of people gathered grew to over 110, blocking the road. The North Sichuan Road Police Station dispatched a large number of police officers to rush to the scene, and the crowd dispersed. The police station is currently investigating.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (20)

Question: Mr. Xia Cheng from Nanjing asks: I would like to send printed matter to a bookstore in the United States. I don't know how many stamps to attach in the letter. If I attach Chinese stamps, can the United States use them (referring to using them to pay the postage for the printed matter sent from the United States to China)? If they cannot be used and I need to attach American stamps, I don't know where I can buy American stamps in China. Also, the American currency system is different from ours. Is one cent of an American stamp equal to one cent in our country when used?

Answer: The postage depends on the weight. The postage for printed matter sent from the United States to China is 1.5 US cents for every 90 grams. US stamps should be attached. Stamps from other countries cannot be used. Also, our country's and the United States' currency systems are different, and the value of the two countries' stamps is naturally not equal. There is also nowhere to buy American stamps in China. However, the Chinese Post Office, in accordance with the regulations of the Universal Postal Convention, prints an international reply coupon, which is sold at post offices and is specially used for situations like the one you described. If you buy one and attach it in the letter, the bookstore can take it to the US post office and exchange it for one or several US stamps, the total value of which is equal to the postage that should be paid for an ordinary letter weighing no more than 20 grams sent from the United States to China, which is 5 US cents. If the printed matter you are requesting weighs less than 150 grams, it will be enough to pay the postage.

Or someone asks: I am studying in Beijing and my home is in Ba County, Sichuan. The other day, because I urgently needed money, I telegraphed home to remit money. My family heard that postal airmail remittances could arrive on the same day, so in the morning, I bought a remittance order at the Ba County Post Office using the usual procedure and enclosed it in a letter as airmail to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing in the afternoon, I rushed to the Beijing Post Office before 5:00 to cash the money. However, the post office said that the stub had not arrived and could not be cashed at that time, and a stamp was affixed on the remittance order saying, "This is an ordinary remittance order sent by airmail and must be paid only after verification of the certificate (i.e., the stub) has arrived." I don't know why.

Answer: The remittance order you purchased is an ordinary remittance order that you sent in an airmail letter. It is not a special airmail remittance order provided by the post office. The procedures for the two types of remittance orders are different. If the remitter wants to purchase an airmail remittance order, they should explain to the post office when purchasing it and request a remittance order form printed with the red characters "飞滙" (airmail remittance), fill it out according to the instructions, and pay an additional airmail fee of 1.5 jiao per order in addition to the ordinary remittance fee. The post office will then fill out a remittance order stamped with a rectangular red "飞汇" (airmail remittance) stamp and enclose it in an airmail letter for delivery. The stub will be sent by the post office by airmail. If you only purchase an ordinary remittance order, even if the remitter encloses it in an airmail letter, the stub from the post office will be sent by ordinary mail, and it will naturally not arrive at the same time.

### First Day of Public Screening of "Secret Code"

Four Sold-Out Shows, Praised by Chinese and Foreign Audiences

Yesterday was the first day of the public screening of "Secret Code," produced by the Central Film Studio, at the Grand Theater in the city. Because of the film's long-standing reputation among the public, everyone was eager to be the first to see it. Moreover, yesterday was a holiday, and although the weather was not good, all four shows were extremely crowded. Every show was sold out before the screening began. Many foreigners also came to see it. The second and fourth shows were especially crowded. The belief that the film gives to the public can be seen from this. Before the screening of the film, there were three other excellent short films worth introducing: ㊀ "China News" No. 48, which contained the latest news in the country, such as Chairman Chiang's personal tribute to General Zhu Peide, the German warship "Emden" visiting the capital, the Qiantang River Railway Bridge project, and Kong Xiangxi's special trip to England to attend the coronation of the British King; ㊁ a cartoon of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and Chairman Chiang's mottos; and ㊂ the grand occasion of the International Eucharistic Congress recently held in Manila. All of these were newly obtained news materials from various places by the Central Film Studio News Department, and they were warmly welcomed by Chinese and foreign audiences.

### Miscellaneous News

▲A Passenger Vomited Blood and Died. At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, a rickshaw with license plate No. 5530, driven by Wang Jiahua, a 1-year-old from Taixing, who lived at No. 88 Nancang Street in the South City, was traveling north on Rue du Consulat when a passenger, about 40 years old, wearing a duckbill cap, a black cloth padded jacket, cotton pants, black shoes, and gray socks, resembling a vendor, suddenly vomited fresh blood near Xietu Road and was unable to speak. The rickshaw puller notified the police, who urgently summoned the ambulance from the West District Fire Brigade to take him to Hunan Hospital. He had already died when he reached the hospital.

### Appeal Investigation into the Use of Elderly People to Transport Counterfeit Money

Han Yan耕 and Others Disagree; Judge Wu Rules for Postponement

The French Police Station received a tip-off in January this year that private traffickers of counterfeit banknotes were using poor elderly people to transport the goods. The delivery location was at No. 4 in Fuxing Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, and so on. Inspector Jiang Futian led the detectives on duty to wait at the address. They saw Wang Zengjin (65 years old, from Shaoxing) and Zhao Yixian (56 years old, from Ningbo) coming along, wearing ragged clothes. They went forward to inspect them and found 98 counterfeit one-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank, two counterfeit five-jiao banknotes, and 400 counterfeit two-jiao banknotes of the Chinese Farmers Bank. They were arrested and confessed that their boss was Han Yan耕 (44 years old, from Shaoxing, living at No. 60 Yuelai Lane, Caishi Road). The detectives then arrested Han. Han confessed that the sales agency was at Xie A Mao's house at No. 22 Kangyi Lane, Kangti Road. The detectives then went to arrest Xie, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. Only his mistress Han Wangshi (i.e., Wang Xiuzhen, from Suzhou) and Liu Wangxuan were arrested. Rubber sticks, flower plates, and other items used for printing banknotes were found in the pavilion. They were all sent to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution. At the end of the trial, Wang Zengjin and Zhao Yixian were each sentenced to two years in prison and deprived of their civil rights for two years. Han Yan耕 was sentenced to three years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for three years. Liu Yuxuan and Xie Wu were each sentenced to one year and six months in prison and deprived of their civil rights for two years. Han Yan耕 and others disagreed with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The other day, Judge Wu Tingqi, accompanied by Judges Chen and Wang, presided over Criminal Court III to interrogate and investigate the facts and reasons for the appeal. They ruled that they would wait for a later date to re-examine. The appellants were remanded in custody.

Talking Points

### Forging Business Cards

— Zhou Ge

Not long ago, there was a "fool" who stole someone else's things, but turned himself in to the police station, demanding to be sued. Later, the judge sentenced him to fifty days, but frowned and thought the sentence was too light. To the average person, this news is truly a bit "ridiculous," but to that "fool" himself, it was a major matter of solving the three major problems of life: food, clothing, and shelter!

People are willing to be sued and lose their freedom for the three major problems of food, clothing, and shelter. It seems that the French precept "Liberty or death!" has lost its sacred value when it comes to China (in fact, it can be said that this is the case all over the world now). Is this because people voluntarily give up freedom? Isn't it still to solve the three major problems of life: food, clothing, and shelter!

In order to solve these three major problems of life, countless people in the world have committed "crimes" and received terrible "punishments"!

"Young Wu Zhenmin, having been unemployed for a long time, suddenly had a whimsical idea and forged Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's business card. He went to the Municipal Government to seek an audience with Yu Hongjun the other morning, intending to trick him into a position." Wu's courage in forging Chairman Chiang's business card cannot be said to be small. Moreover, he wrote in ink on the business card: "Acting Mayor Yu, please arrange a position in the Municipal Police Bureau for the bearer." This kind of "fraudulent deception, hoping for illegal gains" is an unforgivable crime! However, after all, it was because he had been "unemployed for a long time" that he "whimsically" forged Chairman Chiang's business card to seek a position in order to secure his livelihood. Although his behavior is shameful and despicable, his situation is truly sad and pitiable.

### Medicine

— Luo Quan

The wind whistled, tightly beating the rain's dots and lines against the glass window, against the scrap metal in front of the house, sounding ancient and dark tinkling.

I was watching a quivering, almost broken spider silk in such a violent storm.

What overwhelmed my partner was not only the heavy illness but also the accumulated fatigue of the large pile of days that had passed. Therefore, what would cure him was not just medicine, but also some days of rest. This was clearly impossible for my partner.

I remember a gloomy dusk when he staggered back, holding his head in both hands. Then he collapsed on the bedding without a word, shouting about a headache, shouting about thirst, and shouting about blood... Then the phlegm he spat on the floor shockingly had a streak of scarlet.

When I went over to help him up, I realized that the veins on the back of his hands were swollen like earthworms, completely devoid of color, and his body was trembling as if cold. A terrifying shadow invaded our hearts, making us feel empty and looking at each other in fear.

He was overwhelmed by the heavy illness, and the accumulated fatigue of many years made him even weaker, making his breathing even more ethereal, like a quivering, almost broken spider silk stretched across a rainstorm.

Because I unintentionally placed a few playful coins in front of a fortune-telling stall during the day, I heard that his illness was like a handful of sugar scattered in water, which would slowly dissolve on its own. When I came back, I couldn't help but secretly look at him as he slept, his face ashen, piled with unbearable pain, his chest rising and falling feebly under the covers. I knew that the rising and falling was uneven and tired.

Could the strongly heightened stupor keep out his pain? Could the daily coarse food stem his scarlet blood streaks?

I can't wait idly, I can't!

The words of consolation bought with those few coins were not enough to reassure me. I thought that the fragile lifeline might be broken by a gust of wind and rain. I could not and could not bear to watch him struggling in pain.

So I squeezed into a large crowd of worried people.

I jostled with other anxious people, and was jostled and pushed by the people in front and behind. I couldn't take care of the old and weak, couldn't take care of the women carrying their sick. I felt like I was going to a tense life-and-death arena to help a dying man. I was impatient, for the sake of begging for a good medicine for my partner.

I began to explain his condition to the person in the small window. I said that he was in pain now, rolling in bed, shouting about headaches, shouting about thirst, and that he coughed up blood after coughing. This was all I knew.

But his condition was indeed not just these. He was yelled at, he was driven away. He tore his own flesh, eating his own blood and sweat, he lived like a cow or a horse. Now he was overwhelmed by illness and fatigue, and I came for him.

I wanted to beg for some medicine.

The man asked me what disease he had. This was exactly what I wanted to ask him, and I was going to ask everyone.

But what could I say? I had to beg for something, and I had to lower my head, feeling ashamed. Like the others, they felt happy and infinitely comforted.

But I finally got angry. I wanted to ask the reason for his illness. I not only wanted to beg for some medicine for him, but I should also get back all that had been taken away from him. I used a roaring tone, yes, it was useless to use a friendly tone to get back what had been taken away.

I was impatient, I was angry, and I quarreled with the man in the small window for no reason. I madly hammered at the small iron window, wanting to grab the heads of that man and everyone else, drag them to the ground, and tear off their hair. I shouted, waving my arms, I jumped, my fists landing on the bodies of the people around me.

A rude man ran over and gave me a heavy punch, and we fell to the ground, unable to struggle any more. I propped up my upper body with my right hand, glaring at that wild animal with hostile eyes.

Can some medicine cure my partner's illness? No. His vitality had been deprived for a long time. Some medicine would be in vain for his illness. I thought.

### Gunfire

— Luo Yu

On my fifth day in Tianjin, braving the wind mixed with yellow sand from the north that raced through the streets, I moved to the N school dormitory in the southwest of the city. While busy sorting through my luggage, I took a moment to look at the long north-south street, wondering if it had already been lost to my memory. At the southern end of the street, behind the empty earthen embankment, the wind ran back and forth wildly, chasing after itself. The sandstorm also blurred the nearby buildings.

Were there very few pedestrians? Even rubber-wheeled carts hid in recessed corners of the walls: Only a unique sound occasionally drifted from the south.

Boo-boo-boo…

Some students, wearing goggles or Japanese-style masks, hurriedly crossed the street. As they ran, they chatted and laughed with each other, entering the doorway of a photography studio. Everything looked new, familiar, and indifferent, except for the yellow sand mixed in the wind, which sometimes got into people's eyes and made them tear up for no reason, and the sound mixed in the wind, which drifted over more frequently and urgently,

Boo-boo-boo-boo…

From then on, whether I was in the dormitory, in the cafeteria, or walking around the campus watching the goldfish in the pond, I always heard that monotonous yet assertive sound, circling in my ears.

One Sunday evening before school started, only I and a fourteen or fifteen-year-old classmate were in the room. While the other five or six children had all run into the concession to see a movie, we were all writing letters. The courtyard was very quiet. However, my heart was always filled with unease, confusion, and doubt, and I always seemed to hear the piercing gunshots constantly mixed in the wind.

I timidly asked the child if he also "heard that peculiar sound." He smiled at me, wrinkled his nose, and said disdainfully:

—It's the Japanese soldiers doing target practice! You'll get used to it eventually.

This revelation was a very effective help to me, turning me from confusion and doubt to concrete imagination.

After that, every three to five days, I could hear the same gunfire again. Sometimes, in the middle of a dream during a peaceful gray dawn, hearing the crisp and closely connected continuous strikes, it would be like imagining some bean-green, short and lively soldiers moving in the field, stepping over people's crops, crossing some water ditches in the vegetable gardens, placing the slaughtering machinery on the ridges of the fields, and starting to play out their roles towards the morning light, towards the small village in the sound of crowing roosters.

Boo-boo-boo-boo… Boo-boo-boo-boo…

Sometimes, on a foggy morning, I would hear the heavy and muffled gunfire, and I would even lose track of the direction from which it was drifting. I could only imagine the cold, dead angel of the aluminum fields, passing through and back through a misty fog bank indiscriminately.

Although it was a sound I had grown accustomed to, it eventually made it impossible for me to remain calm. My imagination produced needles, and those needles pricked my nerves very subtly, so a newly arrived and amplified confusion and doubt took over me again.

One evening, I strolled towards the racecourse road in the suburbs, walking while grasping the elusive gunfire that seemed like black bats. I saw cars driving from the end of the avenue, from the racecourse, towards the city. Those gamblers, sitting in rubber-wheeled carts, wore faces painted with gray dirt, making them look like comical or pitiful clowns. I walked a long way until the sun had slowly set. The gunfire stopped.

Not long after, a large car came running from the front, carrying bean-green soldiers, rushing towards the city. I saw the slaughtering machinery erected on the roof of the car pointed directly at my chest, directly at my eyes. I guessed that the death angel's water-cold arrows were also aimed at my heart, grinning menacingly.

A whirlwind left me with a chill. The whip of survival sobered me up.

### The Cherry Blossoms Have Fallen

— Lu Ping

The cherry blossoms have fallen…

A kind of terror, like a millstone, presses on my heart. For three whole years, I have almost been crushed to the point of losing the freedom to even take a breath. As a result, my mood has changed drastically. In the past, I loved spring and autumn because spring was like a beautiful young woman, and her bright and lively posture aroused my love very much. Autumn was like a brave and heroic warrior, and his majestic and unyielding spirit filled me with boundless admiration. But now, I am not only afraid to see autumn, but I simply can't even develop a good feeling for spring. I hate this snobbish spring light. It gives people gentleness and sweetness, but in the blink of an eye, it makes people suffer its cruel exploitation, like a disloyal woman. At first, she makes people love her, but soon she finally makes people suffer her deception, and she herself goes away triumphantly. Everything in autumn is dead. As soon as autumn arrives, half of nature dies. At this time, the millstone of fear in my heart also presses especially hard. Once a person passes middle age, it is as if autumn has arrived in the year. Autumn is a symbol of middle-aged people about to grow old and elderly people about to die! Although I have just stepped into the edge of middle age, seeing this symbol will arouse the sorrow of life being as fleeting as morning dew.

This time, returning to my hometown, it happened to be the season when the cherry blossoms were withering, so I didn't see the cherry blossoms. However, although I didn't see the cherry blossoms, the aftertaste that the cherry blossoms give me will never be forgotten.

I love the cherry blossoms. Mother always said that it was because I sympathize with the brevity of the cherry blossoms' life, just like my own happiness. So when I see the cherry blossoms, I will immediately recall my childhood. But the past is just like a dream, and this dream has gone so far away that it is somewhat vague when I think about it. Even if I could see other children singing and laughing under the cherry blossom trees, it would still arouse a little joy in me, but this joy would be covered with a thin layer of sadness in an instant.

Now it is the season when the cherry blossoms are withering again, and the spring light will also quietly pass away, and unintentionally, I happened to run back to my hometown from a distant land at this time. So, under the cherry blossom trees, I relived the old dream of childhood. Although I did not see the delicate and pure white cherry blossoms in full bloom, when a gust of wind blew, I only saw countless petals of withered flowers dancing in the air, floating on the grass path, floating on my body, like fallen leaves in the autumn wind. I couldn't help but sigh, "The cherry blossoms have withered again! Why didn't I come back sooner?"

Now, I have quietly left my hometown again and embarked on this journey of life.
