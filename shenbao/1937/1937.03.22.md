### Hunan Province's Opinion on the Hunan-Hubei Water Conservancy Dispute

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan recently convened relevant departments and representatives from Hunan and Hubei to discuss the Hunan-Hubei water conservancy dispute. It only decided to temporarily suspend the Tianhu Dike project and did not fully accept Hunan Province's opinion. The Hunan representatives telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. They received a reply on the 21st stating that the construction of the Tianhu project in Hunan Province was carried out in accordance with the order of the Nanchang Headquarters, with a deadline for completion, and a public letter from Secretary-General Weng of the Executive Yuan requesting the provincial government to advance funds. The Provincial Bank has already advanced 400,000 yuan, and the farmers have invested no less than several hundred thousand yuan. The project is more than 70% complete.

### Prince De's Ambition ㊁

— By Our Reporter Qian Hua

Wants to Use Foreign Forces to Become Genghis Khan; A Mongolian Scholar with Genius

㊁ Promoting Ambition

Prince De's hometown is in Pangjiang. Pangjiang is a transliteration of a Mongolian word, and there is no river at all in that place. It is just like Jiabusi, where the Chahar Border Mongolian Political Council is located. Jiabusi is also a Mongolian word, and there are no temples there either. It would be a joke for inland travelers to try to visit Pangjiang and Jiabusi. Prince De's palace in the West Sonid Banner is decorated very luxuriously, especially his study, which is filled with various Chinese and foreign newspapers, magazines, and many other books. Portraits of Hitler, Mussolini, and Kemal are hung on the walls. He often receives Chinese and foreign journalists and distinguished guests who come from afar. He is indeed a Mongolian scholar, with the demeanor of a statesman and a wealth of global knowledge. At the same time, he is also an artist, a musician, and possesses extremely clever talent. He is quite skilled in singing and painting, and his horsemanship is even stronger. Riding and shooting are his daily morning exercises. His accuracy in firing bullets and arrows is already above the average level. He is also good at Mongolian wrestling. When he has free time in the palace, he sometimes plays with photography, drives cars, and can even repair small machines himself. However, his clothing, daily life, and diet are very simple. Although there is a Beijing chef in the palace, he still eats ordinary Mongolian food except when entertaining guests. Mongolians possess ancient virtues, emphasizing trust and friendship. Their respect and obedience to the prince and their sincere belief in lamas are truly wholehearted, without any insincerity. Therefore, they naturally have even greater respect and obedience to this modern prince who can embrace the trends of the times and are willing to listen to his commands and drive. Prince De has a black mole on his forehead, and those who like to flatter say that he has the face of an emperor. Prince De's ambition has therefore flared up, and coupled with the convergence of circumstances and the temptation of material things, his ambition has expanded day by day, eventually leading to the situation today. He delusionally wants to use foreign forces to restore the achievements of his ancestor Genghis Khan. Therefore, in recent years, he has extensively recruited knowledgeable Mongolian youths, shouting the slogan of Mongolian national liberation and wanting to establish an independent country. He hates the Qing Dynasty's policy of control over Mongolia, especially the unbreakable religious belief, believing that Lamaism has ruined the life of the Mongolian people. He has vigorously instilled the knowledge of the new era into Mongolian youths. After receiving the new baptism, the general Mongolian people believe that this Prince De is the comet that appeared after the death of Genghis Khan. Many more forward-thinking princes also wholeheartedly support and admire him. On the one hand, Prince De, because he was too eager to govern, held power in everything as Secretary-General of the Mongolian Political Council, offending other princes and creating a situation where the Chahar and Suiyuan leagues and banners were divided. At the same time, due to the continuous explosion of various fuse lines, he quickly accepted certain parties' conditions for invading Mongolia, willingly acting as a puppet leader to realize his dream of becoming Genghis Khan the Second. Many experienced and prudent Mongolian intellectuals have expressed great dissatisfaction with Prince De's hasty means. Even Prince De himself, since the defeat in the Suiyuan War, has not failed to deeply reflect and realize his past mistakes. Someone asked Prince De: "You wanted to use others, but now, others have taken us into their grip, unable to move. How did this happen!" Prince De was naturally speechless. However, based on the slogan of national unity and the Chinese people not fighting the Chinese people, we always hope that those who have been exploited can quickly embark on the path of self-renewal. We can certainly forgive their past and cooperate sincerely. Moreover, Prince De is indeed a new-era figure and has a certain amount of power. The fundamental shattering of a certain party's Manchurian-Mongolian policy must depend on the great enlightenment of the Manchurian and Mongolian people themselves, building a Great Wall psychologically to resist the poisonous division and aggression. As the saying goes, what is past is past, and what is to come can be remedied. This is the only hope that our people have for Prince De!

㊂ Conspiracy and Goodwill

A certain party's plan to plunder Inner Mongolia is proceeding in parallel with the invasion of North China, and its meticulously planned conspiracy to invade Mongolia has been underway for far more than fifty years. Since Outer Mongolia inclined towards the Soviet Union, they believed that Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia had a vast border and would be an important battleground in future continental wars. Therefore, the plunder of Inner Mongolia was intensified, and Inner Mongolia also possessed vast economic resources, which were especially coveted by a certain party's capitalism. Special agents of a certain party are spread throughout Inner Mongolia, on the one hand, engaging in reconnaissance of terrain and resources, and on the other hand, trying to instigate and agitate, causing the Mongolian princes, large and small, to become divided and gradually alienated from the central government, creating the so-called "clarification" of Inner Mongolia. Among these special agents, the most famous was Dr. Shengdao, the former chief of the special agency stationed in Bailing Temple, who also held the rank of major general. His methods were also the most poisonous. He was a Mongolian expert, speaking fluent Mongolian. It can be said that the certain party's invasion conspiracy was entirely planned and implemented by him. He is now fifty-five years old and has been wandering in Mongolia for nearly thirty years. Initially, he was in Kulun, and later he traveled to various parts of Inner Mongolia. He has been a lama, familiar with the scriptures, and now has a Mongolian wife. His entire life is Mongolianized. He is very thin, with a long beard, likes to drink and tell jokes, and on the surface is truly amiable and approachable. He has endured many hardships in Mongolia for decades, and his skin has turned reddish-brown, but his body is very strong. Mongolians like to get small advantages, so he used this point to spend small amounts of money recklessly. Therefore, the general Mongolian people have a good impression of him. He opened a Good Neighbor School in Bailing Temple, providing free education to Mongolian elementary school students. The primary purpose was to instill pro-Japanese ideas in them. Mongolian and Japanese languages were emphasized, while Chinese was completely eliminated. Now, Chahar Province is full of such educational institutions. At the same time, he also established a cavalry officer school and a Good Neighbor Hospital in Bailing Temple. Mongolians do not pay much attention to hygiene, so there are many diseases and epidemics. In the past, when they got sick, they would ask lamas to chant scriptures, and the result was that more people died than lived. Now that there is a hospital, providing free diagnosis and treatment, they are of course extremely grateful. The psychology of the general Mongolian people has gradually changed to that Japanese are approachable, while Chinese are frightening. This kind of conspiracy is really terrible. The meaning of "Good Neighbor" has the same wonderful effect as the common "friendship and cooperation." The so-called "dagger hidden in a smile," this kind of friendship and cooperation is really frightening. But we must ask ourselves why, since the Mongolian and Han peoples are one family, the Mongolian people still have a frightening psychology towards us? If this point is not eradicated, the Mongolian problem will never be solved. "The transformation from frightening to approachable must be achieved through the joint efforts of the government and the people, and it is hoped that the border provincial authorities will pay special attention to this!"

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Significance of the Shanghai Festival

— Du

The Shanghai Festival, after much preparation and discussion, was initiated yesterday, providing all citizens with public awareness. Officials are promoting it from above, and the gentry and commoners are encouraged from below, getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, assisting in this grand event. The situation is enthusiastic and worthy of praise. Since the national crisis, the people have been in dire straits, suffering deeply from the poison and unable to find a way to relieve their worries. They are constantly under the pressure of sorrow and suffering, gradually becoming decadent and demoralized. Therefore, the worthy officials must seek other ways to revitalize and use it as a means of encouragement. On this day of brilliant spring sunshine, originally a day for people to enjoy life, we use commemorative forms to seek temporary joy, to create momentum, so that they are fully developed. The intention is profound. However, the name "Shanghai Festival" is still newly heard, and the common people may not be familiar with it. Therefore, following the intention of the authorities, we will briefly fulfill the responsibility of explaining it.

The reason why the Shanghai Festival is scheduled to be held on March 21 is that this day is the day when the National Revolutionary Army conquered Shanghai, and also the day when the citizens of Shanghai got rid of the shackles of the warlords. Before that day, people had no interest in life, suffering under the cruel regime and enduring the hardships of oppression. They were deprived of everything, large and small, and their thoughts were imprisoned, with prohibitions even on casual conversations. The rampage of the Big Sword Society, wantonly killing in the city, made the good people terrified and unsure of how to protect themselves. After that day, the people were revived, as if pulling themselves out of the mud, and enjoyed the joy of warmth and security again. They breathed in the free air, surpassing the coercion and exploitation. The past harassments were all eliminated. Therefore, this day is worthy of commemoration and is the unanimous request of the citizens. Regarding the significance of the Shanghai Festival, this is one aspect.

Shanghai is the only metropolis in the country, where guests from all directions rely on. People are numerous and businesses are busy. However, due to the complexity of the components, it is difficult to unite. Farmers, workers, merchants, students, military police, and officials all perform their duties in their respective positions on weekdays, and there are few opportunities to gather together, resulting in difficulty in communicating opinions and limiting knowledge to one corner. There is a sense of dedication, but a loss of the purpose of enjoying the community. Now, on the specified day, a grand gathering is held to allow them to participate and have fun together, to demonstrate the spirit of love and unity, and to show the necessity of mutual assistance and cooperation. As for welcoming gods and temple fairs, they were originally superstitious activities, but due to long-standing habits, it is not easy to change them suddenly. Moreover, farmers use this as a way to relieve labor and seek pleasure, and peddlers use this as a source of profit for selling goods. Forcing a ban will only cause disputes. Now, we can guide them according to the situation, make them comply with the scope, eliminate the concept of theocracy, maintain the practical meaning, ensure the upward trend of production, and increase the prosperity of the market. Reforming customs is a matter of transformation. Regarding the significance of the Shanghai Festival, this is the second aspect.

With the above significance clarified, the hard work of the authorities in promoting it is greatly admired by us. We sincerely hope that the worthy local party and government officials can all understand this intention, share it with others, restrain their subordinates, and support the people's aspirations. Do not abuse their power by relying on their position, and do not hold on to emotions and bully the kind and weak, to eliminate the occasional estrangement among the people, to promote the further development of the municipality, and to glorify the infinite reputation of the Shanghai Festival and pass it on to immortality.

### Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Carries Three Main Conclusions of the Japanese Economic Survey Group

Acknowledges That the Current State of Opposition Between China and Japan is Not Easy to Break; There is Ample Room for Economic Expansion in North and Central China

[Tokyo] The Japanese economic survey group is scheduled to disband on the 22nd. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun today resumed carrying a Shanghai special dispatch, saying that after staying in China for a week, the survey group and others have formed three main conclusions: ㊀ Acknowledges the current state of opposition between China and Japan, and in the process of maintaining this state, except for reducing friction caused by occasional incidents between the two countries to the lowest limit, no further action can be taken; ㊁ It is undeniable that China has completed the organization of a modern country, so it is necessary to assist it in completing this organization. At the same time, China has frankly expressed its hope for Japanese assistance, so there is still a great deal of room for Japan to make further economic expansion in China; ㊂ However, because Britain has established a solid economic force in the Yangtze River basin, Japan has no other way to follow except to increase the volume of mutual goods in the Yangtze River basin and watch the unprotected investment activities. While Japan is limited to maintaining the status quo of Japan's economic power in Central China, it must take the economic expansion in North China as the basis for implementing Japan's overall economic policy towards China.

### Japan Decides to Revamp Diplomatic Institutions

Sato Considers Plan

[Tokyo] Due to the recent situation in the Diet, there is a high demand for reform of diplomatic institutions. At yesterday's general budget meeting, Tetsuo Kudo and Kozo Makiyama of the Minseito Party also demanded the implementation of this plan. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister both responded with the same feeling and agreed to begin implementing the reform of administrative institutions and the recruitment of external talent. Therefore, this matter will soon be realized. The scale of this reform of diplomatic institutions is relatively large. The Foreign Minister will soon submit a reference plan. It is heard that Foreign Minister Sato intends to take this opportunity to implement a considerable renovation. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)

### Japanese House of Peers Prepares to Approve Original Budget Draft

Diet Session May be Extended

[Tokyo] The deliberation of the budget in the House of Peers is progressing smoothly. It is expected to end the questioning around the 22nd and transfer it to the subcommittee for handling. Due to the imminent end of the session, Chairman Hayashi will announce his intention to request the government to extend the session, and then decide on the general policy. As for the attitude of each faction towards the budget proposal, it will be discussed separately after it is transferred to the subcommittee. It can only be decided at the final budget conference. The general intention is that this budget is an unprecedented amount and focuses on military spending. It is a lame budget, but considering the internal and external situation, its establishment is inevitable. However, the army and navy budgets that cannot be used within the year are included in this budget at 22 million yen each, which is questionable in terms of the constitution and seems inappropriate. Therefore, in the future, the preparation of the budget should not be taken as a precedent, and the government should be urged to pay attention. This opinion is very strong, so a serious supplementary resolution should be attached according to this intention, and then the original proposal will be approved. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)

[Tokyo] There are only five days left in the current Diet session. The government and members of the Diet both believe that the issue of extending the session must be specifically studied. Today is a festival day, and the actual number of deliberation days is only four days, so it is even more urgent. The government is currently struggling to decide on the number of days. The government is now expecting the statement of the Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Peers on the 22nd in order to make a decision. Therefore, the meeting between Prime Minister Hayashi and Chairman Hayashi at that time is likely to be decided. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)

### Japan Plans to Develop Aviation Industry

Establishes Comprehensive Research Institute; Promotes its Realization Within This Year

[Tokyo] The Army, Navy, and Ministry of Communications have been vigorously studying countermeasures for the development of civil aviation and the improvement of air force strength. It has now been decided to establish a new central organization for comprehensive research on aviation to provide fundamental guidance. A specific plan has been obtained. As soon as the current Diet session closes, the three ministries will carefully discuss the important items such as the structure, operation, and objectives of the Central Aviation Research Institute, and quickly materialize it. It is expected to be promoted within this year.

In order to promote the performance of aircraft, the agency will conduct comprehensive research and experiments. Also, training aviation technicians and manufacturing civil aircraft are its main goals. The establishment and structure are roughly as follows:

㊀ The new agency should be established separately from the existing aviation research agencies, and the important parts of the process of moving from the basic theory of aviation to the actual manufacturing process, such as aviation materials, special aircraft, engines, fuel, aviation meteorology, and aviation medicine, must be fundamentally researched and experimented, and guidance on manufacturing must be carried out in parallel. ㊁ Special large wind tunnels, large experimental water tanks, and various other equipment necessary for aviation research and experiments will be equipped. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)

### Japanese-Made Giant Aircraft Completed

Will be Test-Flown in Kagamigahara

[Tokyo] The ultra-long-distance aircraft designed and manufactured by the Imperial University Aviation Research Institute over a period of forty years, with a huge investment of hundreds of thousands of yen, has recently been completed and a world-class long-distance test flight has been decided. Captain Yuzo Fujita, an authority on the army's aviation, has been selected as the pilot. Also, since the aircraft is extremely large, it has been decided to temporarily disassemble it at the end of this month, transport it to Haneda Airfield, test its operation on the ground, and then send it to Kagamigahara Airfield to begin test flights. Depending on the results, it may soar over Kanto this autumn and set a world record for continuous flight. (21st Domei News Agency)

### Japan Actively Explores Overseas Markets

Establishes Trade Mediation Offices

[Tokyo] The Central Export Association plans to convene a council meeting in Tokyo on the 22nd to discuss various issues based on the government's policy of promoting trade. The association plans to change its policy, not only to be the central organization of the national export association, but also to seek the overall development of export trade, and to raise common issues in the trade community as follows:

㊀ Establish overseas trade mediation offices; ㊁ Dispatch trade affairs trainees; ㊂ Investigate the credit of overseas merchants. In order to handle the above emergency business, preparations are now underway, and the most noteworthy is the establishment of trade mediation offices. The overseas commodity halls operated by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be abolished in the future, and all will be transferred to the Central Export Association for handling. For example, the Calcutta Commodity Hall of the Japan Industrial Association and the Slavoraya Commodity Exhibition Hall of the South Seas Association, as well as the Istanbul Commodity Hall of the Japan-Turkey Trade Association, will all be transferred to the association for operation. The association will take this opportunity and not fix the establishment of commodity halls in a certain city, but relocate them to major cities for a period of one or two years and rename them trade mediation offices in order to actively explore the market and make them active on the front lines.

### Japan's Third Batch of Cash to be Shipped to the United States Soon

Over 15 Million Yen

[Tokyo] The government plans to ship cash to the United States, with an amount of 50 million yen. The first shipment was approximately 17.5 million yen, and the second shipment was approximately 16.7 million yen, totaling approximately 34.2 million yen. The first shipment is now planned to be approximately 15.8 million yen. Although the transport ship has not been decided, it seems likely that it will be transported by the Taiyo Maru (departing from Kobe on the 23rd) or the Chichibu Maru (departing from Kobe on the 6th of next month). The government's shipment of cash to the United States will come to an end after the third shipment. The situation after this will have to wait for a while. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)

### Philippine Independence Issue

U.S. Congressmen Say It Should Not Be Rushed

[Washington] Congress seems to be mostly sympathetic to Philippine President Quezon's suggestion to advance the date of Philippine independence. However, leading congressmen also said that rushing it may be harmful to the Philippines. Senator Nye said that the sooner the Philippines is independent, the better, but Congress should take action only after the expert committee submits a report. Once the Philippines is independent, its agricultural products should be treated the same as the goods of other countries, and the United States should not establish a strong naval base in the Philippines. Senator Walsh also said that the impact of Philippine independence on the naval position of the United States should also be studied. Senator Borah said that he fears that if the Philippines becomes independent in 1938 or 1939, it may not be able to cope with economic and financial difficulties, so he believes that Quezon's proposal is inappropriate.

### Increase in China's Trade with Vietnam After Approval of Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty

Last Year Saw a 70% Increase, with Raw Silk as the Main Export

▲Hanoi, Vietnam Correspondence: Following the formal approval of the Sino-French Commercial Treaty regarding Vietnam by both countries in 1935, China's exports to Vietnam have seen a significant increase. In the past year alone, the value of Chinese goods exported to Vietnam increased by 75% compared to the previous year. The total value of Chinese goods sold to Vietnam in the previous year was 5,643,000 Chinese dollars, which increased to 9,891,000 dollars last year. Among the exports, raw silk accounted for more than half. The value of raw silk exported to Vietnam in the previous year was 2,598,000 dollars, which increased to 5,285,000 dollars last year, an increase of 103%. In 1936, the countries purchasing raw silk from China were led by the United States, followed by France, with Vietnam ranking third. France purchased raw silk worth 8,790,000 dollars from China, while Vietnam's purchases amounted to 5,285,000 dollars, totaling more than 14 million dollars. Last year, the total value of raw silk purchased by the United States from China was only 11 million dollars. This shows that metropolitan France and its Asian colonies are the largest customers for Chinese raw silk. As for this year, there is hope for further improvement in trade between China and Vietnam, as Vietnam's economy has recovered in the past year, increasing people's purchasing power. Therefore, purchases of Chinese goods will inevitably increase compared to before. (Central News Agency, March 21, Havas Correspondence)

### Indian Congress Elected Members Vow to Fight for Freedom and Independence

Amendment Passed on Oath-Taking Conditions; Gandhi Still Wields Influence Over the Congress

⊙New Delhi: Newly elected Congress provincial assembly members solemnly took an oath at the Congress headquarters under the bright light of countless electric lamps, pledging allegiance to the Congress and the nation. Congress President Nehru, who studied at Harrow and Cambridge Universities in England, slowly read the oath in Hindi, which was recited aloud by over a thousand people. The oath reads: "As a member of the All-India Congress, I swear allegiance to India and will work inside and outside the provincial assembly to achieve India's independence, end the exploitation of the Indian people, and alleviate their poverty. I swear to work under the discipline of the Congress to promote the Congress's principles and advance its goals, so that India may be free and independent, and its hundreds of millions of people may be relieved of the heavy burdens they now endure." Nehru then declared, "Taking office is out of the question if our conditions are not met. These are not empty conditions on paper." He also said that he personally felt that taking office would reduce the prestige of the Congress, but since the resolution to take office had been passed, he would obey like a common soldier. However, if the situation became impossible, he would ask the members to relieve him of his leadership responsibilities. Nehru's words indicated that he did not want to raise disputes immediately. According to Gandhi's words to guests, the resolution to take office was fair and impartial, without any reservations in intent. It should be read in its entirety and not divided. If the governor is willing to have Congress members take office, he feels there is no difficulty in the resolution in fully satisfying the leader of the Congress in his province. The resolution seeks nothing further. (Special dispatch from the North China Daily News, 19th)

⊙New Delhi: The organization of the All-India National Congress Party government in the Indian provinces has reached a deadlock due to the issue of taking office. The Standing Committee of the All-India National Congress had resolved that Congress members could only take office if the governors of each province guaranteed that they would not exercise the special powers granted by the new constitution. Now, after the Standing Committee has discussed the matter for thirteen hours, a proposal to amend this resolution has been passed by a vote of 127 to 70, allowing party members to take office in provinces where the Congress Party holds a majority in the legislature. However, Congress members may not assume administrative office unless the leader of the Congress Party in the provincial legislature is satisfied that the governor will not exercise his constitutional powers or disregard the advice of administrative officials, and can publicly declare this. With the passage of this resolution by the Standing Committee, each province can weigh the situation and handle the issue of taking office separately, without the need for each governor to issue guarantees that would invalidate important parts of the constitution. Therefore, the issue of whether to take office or not now depends on the relationship between each governor and the leader of the Congress Party. The passage of this resolution by a majority is seen as clear evidence that Gandhi still wields influence over the Congress. Gandhi's faction now seems to advocate striving to implement the Congress's program in accordance with the constitution. It is said that if the Congress forms a provincial government, it should not intentionally create a stalemate. If a stalemate is unavoidable, it will arise from the governor's restriction of the Congress's program, and the Standing Committee of the Congress will reconsider the overall situation. A notable feature of today's meeting was the relative failure of the socialist faction, which proves that they are not yet strong enough to challenge Gandhi's faction.

### British Cabinet Said to Be Reorganized

Chancellor of the Exchequer to Succeed as Prime Minister; MacDonald to Retire

[London] It is rumored that after King George holds his coronation ceremony on May 12, Prime Minister Baldwin will retire immediately, and the cabinet will be reorganized accordingly. In addition to the position of Prime Minister, which will be succeeded by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, it is now reported by the Daily Herald that Lord President of the Council MacDonald will also retire and be succeeded by former First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill, a leader of the Conservative Party's extreme faction. He will also guide the expansion of armaments together with Minister for Coordination of Defence Sir Thomas Inskip. As for the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, it will be transferred to Home Secretary Sir John Simon, and the position of Home Secretary will be succeeded by Minister of Health Sir Kingsley Wood. In addition, Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, is said to be retiring due to poor health, and will be promoted by Lord Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice. Political figures believe that although the resignation of Lord President of the Council MacDonald is certain, it is still uncertain whether Lord Chancellor Hailsham will retire.

### Tragedy of a Village School Explosion in the United States

Board of Directors Cannot Evade Blame

⊙New London: In the village school explosion here the other day, 425 teachers and students died. Today, the army sent personnel to investigate the truth. According to experts, the school's board of directors can hardly evade the blame for negligence. The number of deaths has now been re-checked. 286 corpses can be identified. Of the 125 injured, 48 are still being treated in the hospital. A total of 900 people were in the school at the time of the explosion. Only 350 people were not injured. A salesman from a boiler company told investigators that the company had repeatedly advised the school authorities to install safety equipment, but it was never adopted. Furthermore, the company was not notified before the switch to natural gas, which was extremely negligent. A boiler engineer also stated that he had warned the school board that an explosion would occur sooner or later. However, local prosecutor Wells said that there was no need to file criminal charges at this time. (20th National Telegram)

### German Ambassador to the United States Said to Be Replaced

### Sudden Dismissal of Stummer, Key Figure in Austrian Pro-German Faction

State Secretary Assumes Concurrent Responsibility for Police Affairs; National Socialist Party's Influence Hit

[Vienna] The influence of the Austrian National Socialist Party has now suffered another major blow. Stummer, the Minister of Public Security representing the National Socialist Party's influence in the Austrian cabinet, was dismissed today by State Secretary Schuschnigg. Stummer was appointed Minister of Public Security after the conclusion of the German-Austrian agreement on June 11, 1936. However, after Stummer took office, he often clashed with the State Secretary due to his excessive National Socialist tendencies. Stummer's dismissal is also the result of the intensification of the conflict between Germany and Austria. The deterioration of the national conditions of the two countries can be seen in the tone of the newspapers of both sides. After Stummer's dismissal, the post of Minister of Public Security will be held concurrently by Schuschnigg himself. Schuschnigg, who holds the important positions of State Secretary, Army, and Foreign Affairs, is now in charge of police affairs as well, and his power is increasingly prominent. However, the actual work of the Ministry of Public Security will be handled by Skubl, who has served as the Director of the Vienna Police Department for the past two and a half years. He is a close friend of former State Secretary Dollfuss and is also the most vocal opponent of National Socialism. (Central News Agency, March 19, Reuters Dispatch)

[Vienna] An official bulletin was recently released stating that President Miklas has approved State Secretary Schuschnigg's request to dismiss Minister of Public Security Stummer. The vacant position will be held concurrently by the State Secretary, and Vienna Police Chief Skubl will be appointed as Deputy Minister of Public Security. The bulletin further explained the reasons, stating that when the domestic political situation was tense, the government organized a committee, chaired by Stummer, to draft special laws to prevent communism and National Socialism. Recently, Stummer demanded the repeal of various anti-National Socialist laws, which caused great difficulty. This is the reason for his dismissal. In the future, the committee will continue to work, and the current constitution based on the professional group system will also be implemented as before. In addition, responsible parties declared that Stummer was a representative of the pro-German faction in the cabinet. Recently, people close to him had attempted to form various cultural groups to promote Pan-Germanism, but State Secretary Schuschnigg took a negative attitude towards this activity, so the pro-German faction was in a dilemma. In addition, the Catholic People's Daily of Linz was ordered by Stummer to suspend publication five times for opposing the pro-German faction. The general public was annoyed by the fact that Stummer had taken this decision at a time when German newspapers were attacking Austria. All of these are the reasons for Stummer's departure. (Central News Agency, March 20, Havas Dispatch)

[Vienna] The new Deputy Minister of Public Security, Skubl, recently gave a speech to the Neue Wiener Journal, saying that the foundation of his political network lies in ensuring Austria's security and peace. We civil servants have only one slogan, which is Austria. (Central News Agency, March 21, Havas Dispatch)

### German Political Circles Express Dissatisfaction

The Attempt of the Austrian National Socialist Party to Participate in Politics is Almost Shattered

[Berlin] When the news of the dismissal of Austrian Minister of Public Security Stummer reached Germany, political figures expressed dissatisfaction, believing that National Socialism had suffered a blow in Austria. It was said that the movement to punish National Socialism in Austria was presided over by Vienna Police Chief Skubl, who is one of the main enemies of National Socialism in Austria. Now he has been promoted to Deputy Minister of Public Security, which is very unfavorable to National Socialism. It is hoped that State Secretary Schuschnigg will use his influence to move towards a moderate path, so that Austria's foreign policy will not be affected. In general, it is believed that German Foreign Minister Neurath's recent visit to Austria was primarily aimed at enabling members of the Austrian National Socialist Party to participate in the government. Now this attempt has almost been shattered. (Central News Agency, March 20, Havas Dispatch)

### Paris Pays Attention

Tension in German-Austrian Relations Increases the Severity of the European Situation

[Paris] The tension in relations between Germany and Austria can be seen in the war of words in the newspapers of both sides. The local newspapers have paid attention to this. Among them, the right-wing "People's Friend" newspaper stated, "The sudden attack on Austria by German newspapers is a pretext for the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to indicate to Austrian State Secretary Schuschnigg that Germany is extremely dissatisfied with the evolution of the country's policies. Schuschnigg does not seem to be moved by this. The dismissal of the country's Minister of Public Security Stummer yesterday shows that Schuschnigg is determined to maintain the country's independence, even knowing that this action could endanger his life. This is commendable. The left-wing socialist newspaper stated, "The intensity of the attacks on Austria by the German press is greater than the attacks on France when relations between France and Germany were most tense. Foreign diplomatic figures in Berlin believe that this is a method used by German leader Hitler to indicate to Austrian State Secretary Schuschnigg that Germany is dissatisfied with the policies pursued by Austria since German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Vienna last month. In other words, German Foreign Ministry is not happy that State Secretary Schuschnigg wants to get closer to Hungary and even Czechoslovakia, regardless of everything." The New Era newspaper of the same party stated, "It is obvious that the German government has been defeated everywhere. This time, its attempt to promote expansion policies in Austria and Hungary has also encountered resistance, and it feels resentment." The right-wing Petit Journal stated, "The severity of the current crisis is unparalleled, and Hitler's ambition is greater than ever. Perhaps the small countries will form a new group because of this common disaster. It is also unknown." (Central News Agency, March 21, Havas Dispatch)

### Outline of Italian Foreign Policy

Advocates the Resumption of Cooperation Among the Four Major European Powers; Says Italy Has No Territorial Ambitions in Spain

—Article Published by Italian Dictator's Spokesman Gayda—

[Rome] An article written by the famous reporter Gayda, published in the semi-official "Italian Daily", outlining Italy's foreign policy, is noteworthy. The content can be divided into three main points: ㊀ To restore the Locarno Treaty on the basis of the joint cooperation of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, ㊁ Countries with colonies should form a united front, ㊂ Regarding the Spanish issue, a consensus should be established among all countries, and Britain should also be invited to participate. In addition, Gayda denied rumors that Italy intends to develop abroad and expand its territory, saying, "Dictator Mussolini has repeatedly stated that Italy is determined to cooperate with European countries, especially with Britain and France. As for the 'European Axis' created by Germany and Italy, it will certainly not cause Germany and Italy to become alienated from Britain and France to an irreparable extent. From this, all kinds of rumors will naturally be self-defeating." Referring to the conflict between democracy and fascism, he said, "What we demand is to reduce political terrorism and restore the minimum level of mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual tolerance among European countries." The reporter also said, "The Italian government recently submitted a note to Britain, responding to Italy's attitude towards the new Locarno Treaty issue. The purpose of this note is to restore the unity of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in 1925, which is the most direct guarantee of European peace and stability, it was so in the past, and it is still so now. Moreover, if countries with colonies cannot form a united front to solve the common problems of various countries in Africa in the spirit of justice and benevolence, it will be difficult to create a stable situation among the countries. We have repeatedly said this without hesitating to speak out. As for the Spanish issue, it concerns peace, order, and territorial integrity. The communist movement within Spain is a revolutionary gunpowder magazine in the Mediterranean, and the location of this gunpowder magazine is right at Britain's doorstep, enough to endanger the lifeline of the British Empire. The goal of Italy's policy is only to eliminate this disaster that threatens the welfare of Europe. As for Italy itself, it has nothing to gain, whether in terms of territory or politics, Italy has no ambition. Britain has huge interests in the Mediterranean, involving the fate of the empire and in need of protection. Now that Italy's policy is so frank, it is difficult to see why Britain alone cannot cooperate with it. (Central News Agency, March 20, Havas Dispatch)

### Japan Expands Cotton Industry in North China, Investing Another 35 Million

Six Major Spinning Mills to Be Added in Tianjin, Completing a Plan for 800,000 Spindles, and a Dye Factory Will Be Established to Supply Dyes

Tianjin correspondence: Japan's plan to develop the economy of North China includes projects such as the Cangshi Railway, the Longyan Iron Mine, the Tanggu Port Construction, and the expansion of the cotton industry, all of which are being pursued separately. However, problems such as mining, port construction, and road construction must be negotiated and agreed upon with our side before they can be implemented, so the maturation period will not be as rapid as the Japanese side hopes. However, the expansion of the cotton industry does not require our consent, so the Japanese side has decided to complete it ahead of schedule. It is planned that Japanese business circles will invest another 35 million yuan to add six major spinning mills in Tianjin. They can start operations one after another when new cotton comes on the market next year. The plan is described below. There are currently six existing spinning mills in Tianjin, including Hengyuan, Yuyuan, Yuda, Bincheng, Huaxin, and Beiyang. Except for Yuda, which is a Japanese-owned factory, the rest are purely Chinese-owned. In recent years, due to the downturn in the cotton industry and the lure of large sums of money from the Japanese side, except for Hengyuan and Beiyang, the others have been successively acquired by the Japanese Kanebo and Kanegafuchi spinning companies, and the Daifuku company. Huaxin and Bincheng have been renamed Gongda Nos. 6 and 7 factories. In addition, the Japanese Toyo Cotton Spinning Company has invested 6.5 million yuan to purchase 200 mu of land in Dazhigu, a special area, to build the Yufeng Spinning Mill, which has 50,000 spindles and 1,000 looms. The construction work has already been completed and was originally scheduled to start on April 1, but because the workers recruited from Qingdao needed to undergo considerable training first, it was decided to postpone the start to May 1. This is the first factory of Yufeng. There are also the second and third factories. The second factory is scheduled to start in about August, and the third factory is scheduled to start next spring. Therefore, there are now a total of four Japanese-owned spinning mills in Tianjin, including Yufeng, Yuda, and Gongda Nos. 6 and 7.

Japan's plan to expand the cotton industry in North China was outlined three years ago. Previously, Mr. Funatsu Choichiro, the chairman of the Japan Cotton Textile Industry Association in China, came to Tianjin from Shanghai with this plan and made final contacts with the Japanese military headquarters and the Japanese consulate in Tianjin. He received strong support from the Japanese military headquarters and the Japanese consulate, and they urged him to implement it as soon as possible. The content of the plan is to add six major spinning mills in Tianjin (ten factories including the existing ones): (1) Tianjin Textile Company, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 100,000 spindles, and 1,500 looms; (2) Dai Nippon Spinning Factory, with a capital of 10 million yuan, 150,000 spindles, and 3,000 looms; (3) Kurashiki Spinning Factory, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 100,000 spindles, and 1,000 looms; (4) Naigaiwata Men Kaisha, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 30,000 spindles, and the number of looms is unknown; (5) Kishiwada Spinning Factory, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 100,000 spindles, and 1,200 looms; (6) Wakayama Spinning Company, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 50,000 spindles, and 1,000 looms. The total capital of the above six factories is 35 million yuan, which will be invested by Kanebo, Kanegafuchi, Toyo, and Osaka textile circles. The names are determined as above. Among them, Tianjin Textile Company will be established ahead of schedule. The company adopts a board of directors and supervisors system. The six directors are Mochida Tatsumi, Ito Chubei, Uematsu Manabu, Niie Ryo, Oshishima Soshiro, and Nakatani Shohei. The managing director and representative of the company is Ito Chubei. The four supervisors are Fukumoto Motonosuke, Ito Takenosuke, Tomiyoshi, and others. They have purchased 200 mu of land in Zhengzhuangzi, on the Haihe River in Tianjin, and are actively building the factory, which is scheduled to start operations in July of this year.

After the above six factories start operations, combined with the existing four factories, they will have 800,000 spindles. The cotton industry in North China is undoubtedly under Japanese control. The required amount of dyes for dyeing cloth is considerable, so there is also a plan to establish a dye manufacturing factory in Tianjin. Qingdao Restoration Chemical Society has recently cooperated with Mitsubishi Imperial Dye Company to establish a factory in Tianjin to mainly manufacture vulcanized black, with a monthly production of about 300,000 catties, to meet the needs of various cotton mills in North China, replacing European and American products. They are currently surveying the factory site and ordering machines, and it is expected that manufacturing will begin soon. (19th)

### The New Hunan Finance Director Yin Renxian Takes Office

Director Yin Reveals Several Matters to Encourage Finance Department Staff

Changsha correspondence: The newly appointed Director of the Department of Finance, Yin Renxian, arrived in the province a few days ago. He originally planned to be sworn into office together with the new Provincial Committee member Chen Quzhen on the 16th, but because the central government had not yet appointed a person to administer the oath, he and Chen first went to the Provincial Government on that day to attend the Provincial Committee meeting, and the oath ceremony will be held later. After participating in the meeting, Yin went to the Department of Finance to take office. The former director, He Haoruo, led the entire staff to welcome him. Yin nodded in response to the crowd. After sitting down for a while, the Department held a handover ceremony. All the staff gathered in the auditorium. Former Director He accompanied Yin to the hall. After the ceremony was held in accordance with the prescribed procedures, Yin gave a speech, the main points of which are as follows:

"I am very happy to have the opportunity to return to the province to serve and work with you all. I have been away from the province for a long time, and I am not very clear about the current situation in the province. You are all veterans in the financial world, and you are naturally very familiar with the local financial situation. I hope that everyone will continue to work hard and assist me with the same spirit of assisting Director He. This is also what I am most happy about. During my tenure in the Henan Department of Finance, the use of personnel and administration was completely open. The veteran staff within the Department are not easily changed. When there are vacancies that need to be filled, and accounting personnel and collection personnel from other counties, unless they are sent from the national college entrance examination or the general examination, they are publicly and strictly examined, or selected in order after training. I have never appointed anyone privately. I feel that adjusting personnel in this way is more orderly. In the future, if this Department needs to appoint personnel, it will also follow this method and conduct a completely open examination in order to find true talents. This is the first point I want to say to everyone. The most easily suspected and misunderstood thing is the issue of money, especially for financial personnel whose actual responsibilities and matters are all related to money. Therefore, the most important thing for financial personnel is "integrity." During my tenure in Henan, I paid special attention to the integrity of civil servants during the assessment. Only with honest civil servants can we talk about the efficiency of financial administration. The expenses within the Department are absolutely transparent. In the past, all the surpluses from ticket prices and labor costs, as well as the interest earned from storing public funds, were returned to the treasury. All payments, such as purchasing goods, were made through bidding methods to ensure actual prices and avoid any false statements. This method will also be followed by this Department. Regarding the selection of accounting and general affairs personnel, when necessary, we may also use examination methods to select them. This is the second point I want to clarify to everyone. The finances of this province, under the guidance of Chairman He and the management of Director He, have gradually been brought onto the right track. I am not very talented, but I will abide by Chairman He's intentions, follow Director He's established rules, and abide by the laws and regulations to move forward on the right track. Because the right track of finance is the law. All financial matters should be carried out within the scope of the law, which is naturally orderly and organized. If we deviate from the law, it will be unrestrained, and I am afraid it will inevitably lead to chaos. Therefore, abiding by the law is the only condition for handling finance, and it cannot be ignored in the slightest. This is the third point I want to say to everyone. In addition, there are other things I hope from you. First, we civil servants should put public affairs first and not focus on personal gain. Because the government establishes offices and divides governance to enable each person to do their best and concentrate their efforts to seek the interests of the masses. As long as we conscientiously perform our duties, fulfill our responsibilities, and move forward bravely, we will naturally receive the rewards we deserve based on our merits. If we do not do our best in the tasks we are assigned and only focus on seeking personal gain, such self-interest and advancement are not what modern civil servants should have. I hope you will pay attention to this. Secondly, our financial personnel should revitalize their spirits, bring up their energy, and not be content with the status quo, be lazy, perfunctory, and procrastinate. Because finance is the mother of all governance. If finance is not handled well, then all politics cannot be promoted. Therefore, we civil servants must help each other in everything, not be jealous of each other, but encourage each other, concentrate our spirits, and do our best to carry out our work in order to achieve administrative efficiency. This is also what I hope you will pay attention to. Finally, what I want to ask you to abide by and practice is the New Life Movement advocated by President Chiang, the basic internal work of which is "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame." Not only should our daily life be "clean, simple," as a necessary condition, but also in our duties, especially financial personnel who bear the mission of finance, every move must conform to "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame" as the standard. Because propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame have the deepest meaning. To sum up, propriety is abiding by the law, righteousness is forgetting self-interest, integrity is eliminating greed, and a sense of shame is getting rid of dirt. In the responsibilities of financial personnel, none of them are dispensable. I hope to supervise and encourage each other and work hard."

After Yin finished his speech, former Director He gave a speech, saying that he had been in the Department for 19 months. Although there is still much to be sorted out in the province's finances, compared with before, there are already clues. Fortunately, my duties have not been delayed, so I feel very happy to leave the Department today. During these 19 months, although the province's finances have been reorganized and some achievements have been made, this is all thanks to Heaven and the responsible assistance of my colleagues in the Department. I cannot but express my gratitude to my former colleagues today. Director Yin's morality and knowledge far exceed mine. I believe that he will be able to improve the province's finances. I hope that you will continue to work hard and assist him with the spirit of responsibility you have shown on weekdays under the guidance of Director Yin. This is what I want to say to you as I leave. After He finished his speech, he announced the end of the ceremony and everyone dispersed.

It is said that Yin only brought his entourage Liu Ming'an, Cao Guanru, and Zhang Pengxiang from Henan to Hunan. He ordered that all the existing staff of the Finance Department should continue to work in their original positions to make use of their expertise. It is also said that Liu and Cao, who came with him, were originally secretaries of the Henan Finance Department and will still be appointed as secretaries or section chiefs in the Department. Zhang, who was originally a staff member of the Henan Finance Department, has now been temporarily appointed as a staff member in the Department and will temporarily take charge of accounting and general affairs.

### Chaozhou-Shantou Authorities Improve Treatment of Overseas Chinese

Overseas Chinese Suffered Greatly in the Past, but Future Suffering Can Be Avoided

Shantou correspondence: Every year, more than 250,000 people from Chaozhou and Shantou go abroad and return home. The movement of immigrants has always been closely related to the prosperity and decline of society and has attracted the attention of people from various countries. For example, a few years ago, when the world economy collapsed, the colonies in Southeast Asia restricted the entry of Chinese workers and promulgated various harsh regulations. People from Chaozhou and Meizhou were subject to the restrictions of these regulations and had no way out. The economy and finance in various places immediately showed signs of stagnation and panic, and people's livelihood and society suffered a major blow. Since the winter of the year before last, the prices of local products in Southeast Asia have risen, and the market has become increasingly prosperous. Last year, overseas Chinese remitted 80 million yuan back to Chaozhou and Shantou, a sharp increase from 40 million yuan. The economic recession in various places disappeared with it. Overseas Chinese going abroad and their families also surged like a tide, so that Shantou was waiting to be exported to foreign countries, and the number of ship berths was in excess of supply, and the price of ship tickets soared. The price of a first-class cabin ticket to Singapore, which was originally 35 yuan, soared to 150 yuan, and you still had to wait in a hotel for a long time before you could buy one. Moreover, the ticket prices were controlled by shipping companies and hotels. The Singapore government only allows 6,000 Chinese workers to enter each month. The ticket quota is distributed to the shipping companies in various ports. Women, children, and old customers are not subject to this restriction. Each ticket can be purchased for about 46 yuan, which is a stark difference in treatment compared to newly arrived Chinese workers. It is said that those who controlled ship tickets last year made a net profit of more than 700,000 yuan, which was all squeezed out of the sweat and blood of the Chinese workers.

The Shantou Municipal Government received the "Overseas Chinese Entry and Exit Regulations" issued by the Provincial Government yesterday. Those who register in accordance with the regulations can purchase ship tickets from the shipping company in the order of registration, and get rid of the extra squeeze from those who control the tickets. The main points of the method are as follows: (A) Registration Notice: When applying for registration, overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country should bring a two-and-a-half-inch photo, fill out a form at the registration office. Those going abroad must submit their passports or the return documents from the local government for verification. Those entering the country should submit the credentials from their place of residence for verification. Those who have completed the above procedures can register for free. (B) Registration for Going Abroad: The registration form must be filled in with the applicant's name, age, place of origin, occupation, education, experience, skills, family situation, cohabiting relatives, economic situation, purpose of going abroad, current destination, whether they are a member of the Kuomintang, passport number, and domestic and foreign mailing address, and a photo must be attached. The contents of the entry and exit registration form are roughly the same. After registration, you can get many conveniences and reduce countless unnecessary oppressions, extortions, and sufferings. In addition, the Shantou Port Quarantine Station harshly extracts one yuan for inspection fees from overseas Chinese going abroad, and another six jiao for photo fees. It is found that the number of people leaving Shantou every year is more than 120,000, and if the fees are collected according to the amount, 200,000 yuan can be obtained. Various hometown associations and overseas Chinese organizations in Shantou have sent telegrams to protest, organized committees, and actively worked with the quarantine station. The trend is expanding. The Fifth District Administrative Office, according to the petition of the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society and the Hotel Industry Association to abolish the abuses against sick overseas Chinese, has forwarded the petition to the Provincial Government for verification. It seems that they are aware of the need to improve the treatment of overseas Chinese.

Director Yan of the 11th District of Dongshan said that because transportation there is inconvenient, relying only on ships, and that the district produces white sand loquats, Biluochun tea, etc., with a very large annual output, but development is difficult due to inconvenient transportation, he specially united with Director Wang of the 5th District of Hengjing and others to discuss the preparation of a Suzhou-Zhongshan long-distance bus company (i.e., Suzhou to Dongshan).

### Wuxi Inspects All Sales and Smoking Establishments

The County Anti-Smoking Association of this county believes that the number of smokers in various sales and smoking establishments is gradually decreasing, and their business is insufficient to maintain them, resulting in the supply of private smoking to unlicensed smokers, etc., which is detrimental to everything that is happening. Yesterday, the County Government was specifically notified by public letter to inspect all sales and smoking establishments in the county. If it is found that the number of smokers is decreasing and the operating profit is insufficient to maintain expenses, they will be ordered to close down immediately to avoid the private sale of opium paste, which is detrimental to the promotion of anti-smoking policies.

### Jiaxing Decides to Build the Fengcai Road

The United Office of Townships and Towns in Fengqiao District, Jiaxing, recently resolved to build a section of road from Fengqiao Bridge to Caijia Bridge, named Fengcai Road, to facilitate transportation. However, the route requires requisitioning farmland and land from the people and demolishing houses, resulting in significant losses. After local residents Mei Jiying and others expressed objections and petitioned the Party and government authorities to exempt them from construction, the County Government specifically dispatched Zhu Yisheng, the head of the Construction Section, to convene a meeting of the township heads concerned at the township yesterday to discuss the matter for a long time. It was decided to build the road and specific measures were determined: (1) Narrow the road surface and restrict the scope of land acquisition to reduce losses to the people (the entire road only needs 150-60 acres of land); (2) It was decided not to demolish houses in places such as the bridge; (3) In addition to using the original bridge as much as possible, the 5-6 new bridges to be built will be wooden bridges built with pine and cypress; (4) Construction of the road must begin before the 27th of this month.

### Beijing-Shanghai Basketball Showdown: Zhonghua Team Retaliates with a Crushing Victory Over Military Academy

The score difference once reached 16 points, resulting in a final score of 47 to 32. Feng Nianhua's arrival had an unexpected impact. The Zhonghua team will play against the Military Academy and amateur teams again next month.

▲ Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st. The second match between the Shanghai Zhonghua basketball team and the Military Academy team took place at the Amateur Athletic Association on the afternoon of the 20th. Two thousand spectators attended. Feng Nianhua's arrival boosted the Zhonghua team significantly, and his performance was extremely lively. Wang Nanzhen and Cai Yanxiong, the two guards, provided excellent defense. The Military Academy team appeared disorganized, and Wang Yuzeng, still recovering from a cold, lacked leadership. Apart from the first five minutes when they briefly led with scores of 3-0 and 7-5, they remained behind for the entire game. At halftime, Zhonghua led 19-12, with a seven-point advantage. In the second half, Feng Nianhua and Zhou Dayun, the two forwards for Zhonghua, were extremely active. Feng Nianhua was relentless, and Zhou Dayun's shots were consistently accurate. In the final ten minutes, they created a significant score difference of 41-16. Despite the Military Academy team making numerous substitutions, it was to no avail. The final score was 47-32, with Zhonghua winning. Apart from coach Li Baojun, who returned to Shanghai that evening, the entire Zhonghua team remained in Nanjing for sightseeing and returned to Shanghai on the express train on the afternoon of the 20th. It is reported that Zhonghua will come to Nanjing again next month to play against the Military Academy and various amateur teams once more.

▲ Recap of the First Match

The first match between the Shanghai Zhonghua team and the Military Academy team was held at the Amateur Association court on the afternoon of the 20th at 4 p.m. The weather was pleasant after a spring rain, and nearly a thousand spectators flocked to the venue. Wang Yuzeng of the Military Academy played despite his illness, while Feng Nianhua and Chen Qunlong of the Shanghai team were unable to participate due to work commitments. Both sides suffered losses in strength, but the competition was intense. As a result of the fierce battle, the Military Academy won 55-48. The entire game proceeded under the control of the Military Academy, and the Shanghai team was unable to surpass them. The Military Academy's victory was not accidental.

Yin Guiren was exceptionally active, leaping and scoring. Bi Guozhen scored under the basket, and Yin retaliated in kind. The back-and-forth play was relentless, with neither side yielding. The Military Academy ultimately held the advantage. Wenpei attacked the opponent's basket, and Cai Yanxiong committed a foul out of anxiety. Bao scored three consecutive points, soaring high above. Wang Nanzhen's counter shot was exceptionally accurate, and after scoring one point, the situation took a sharp turn. Yuzeng and Guozhen scored consecutively, creating a surge of 14-6.

▲ Shanghai Team's Counterattack

The Shanghai team requested a timeout and substituted Chen Zongqi into the game. Kuang, Cai, and others worked hard to narrow the gap to 13-16. At this time, Wang Shixuan left the court due to committing two consecutive fouls. Zhou Dayun of the Shanghai team replaced Chen Zongqi. Upon entering the game, Zhou immediately scored three points, making it 16-17, with a difference of only one point. This was the most intense moment of the first half. Subsequently, the Military Academy became active again. Yuzeng, weakened by illness, focused on passing, with Guo and Bao, the two forwards, coordinating in front and behind with extremely swift tactics, making it difficult for the Shanghai team to grasp. They scored seven consecutive points. The Shanghai team relied on Dayun's skillful play to keep pace. The first half ended with the Military Academy leading 29-25.

▲ A Tie

After switching sides, Yuzeng was replaced by Li Shengchun (i.e., Ma Qinghe). After ten selections, he scored nine points alone. Dayun responded with a point, making it 24-27. Yuzeng re-entered, and his momentum increased. The Shanghai team worked hard to defend and closely followed the score, with the difference fluctuating between six and seven points. When the score reached 40-20, Shixuan was dismissed for committing his fourth foul and was replaced by Yi Zhao. With ten minutes remaining until the end of the game, spectators felt that the Military Academy was in danger. The Shanghai team seized the opportunity, launching a full-scale attack. Their offensive efforts were highly successful, and they quickly tied the score at 40-40. The audience felt that the Military Academy was in danger.

▲ Sudden Slump

Both sides responded cautiously, maintaining the stalemate. Yuzeng displayed his unique skills, exerting all his strength to fight back, sneaking into the opponent's formation, waving his arms to reverse the situation and regain the upper hand. The team's morale rose, and they scored two more consecutive points. Bao and Guo, the two forwards, also found success, and the score soared, creating a surge of 55-42, establishing the overall situation. At this point, the Shanghai team had no ability to counterattack. Wenpei added two more points, and Dayun and Zude also scored. Finally, Wang Yuzeng scored two more points at the end of the game.

### Yesterday's Jiangwan Six-Mile Cross-Country Race: Wuhe Team Wins Double Championship

▲ Individual Champion Wu Wenlin Sets Excellent New Record

The Jiangwan six-mile team cross-country championship, organized by the Shanghai Sports Association, started at 11 a.m. yesterday at the west gate of Hongkou Park. A large number of people participated, jostling and shoving, making it a grand occasion. Thousands of spectators watched, causing traffic congestion on Jiangwan Road. As a result, the team and individual championships were won by the new force Wuhe team. Wuhe defeated the Shanghai Sports Association A team by one point with a score of 116, ranking first to 117 respectively. The individual champion was Wu Wenlin of the Wuhe team, breaking the previous record of 29 minutes and 34.4 seconds held by Wang Zhenglin of the Yimi team (formerly Wuhe) with an excellent time of 29 minutes and 34.3 seconds. Long-distance running star Wang Zhenglin lost his running shoe in the mud, making it difficult to walk on the cinder path, and ended up finishing in twelfth place. The prizes were awarded by Mrs. Westphal, concluding a grand cross-country race. The detailed information is as follows:

▲ Competition Process

All athletes lined up in front of the side gate of Hongkou Park. At 11 a.m., the starting gun fired, and the Chinese and Western athletes surged forward, crowding together. After three minutes, they gradually separated and formed a straight line. The first to take the lead was Wan Jinsheng of the Hongkou team. Wang Zhenglin, Niu Hongquan, Wu Wenlin, and others, who attracted the most attention, followed closely behind Wan. Ling Xuewen, Ma Riji, and Zhang Liang lagged about ten meters behind, turning right onto a small wooden bridge. Wang Zhenglin suddenly increased his speed, slightly outpacing the others and taking the lead. Wu Youlin and Niu Hongquan remained close behind. Wan Jinsheng, Ling Xuewen, Ma Riji, Li Duan, and Zhang Liang also followed closely. However, after several days of spring rain, the rural mud roads were still flooded, making it difficult for the athletes to traverse. Wang Zhenglin accidentally lost one of his spiked shoes in the mud, causing him to fall behind. After passing the Livestock Company, he exited the mud road and entered the Dong Sports Association Road. Ling Xuewen suddenly stepped forward, taking a remote lead. Wu Wenlin and Niu Hongquan moved forward, side by side, neck and neck, unseparated. Ma Riji and Zhang Liang followed closely, unwilling to let go. The original leader Wang Zhenglin had fallen back to fifteenth place. Turning left again onto a cinder road, Ma Riji surged forward, suddenly surpassing Wu, Niu, and Ling. Zhang Liang, Gao Basheng, and Guan Youwen followed closely behind. After Wang Zhenglin lost his spiked shoe, he found the cinder road more difficult, dashing his hopes of winning the championship. After crossing the small wooden bridge at the outpost, Niu Hongquan accelerated, and Wu Wenlin also pursued fiercely. Ma Riji and Ling Xuewen gradually fell behind. By the time they reached the Hongkou Swimming Pool, the finish line was not far off. Wu Wenlin had plenty of energy, sprinting like a flying arrow, surpassing Niu Hongquan and reaching the finish line first, in a time of 29 minutes and 34.2 seconds, setting a new excellent record. Niu finished ten meters behind and ranked second. Third was Ma Riji, fourth was Ling Xuewen, and the others followed in succession.

### China Will Not Officially Participate in the International Volleyball Tournament

—The China United Team Will Join Unofficially—

The International Volleyball Tournament, organized by the YMCA, is scheduled to start on the 20th of this month. It is understood that the All-China Athletic Federation only received an invitation letter from the YMCA on the 19th and felt that the time was too short and inconvenient to immediately select a Chinese representative team. Furthermore, few Chinese people have joined the YMCA competition this year, and the players are not familiar with the American competition rules and playing styles. For the above reasons, they will not form a team to participate in the competition this year. As for the current participants, they are the China United Team, and not the official Chinese team.

To the Editor, I recently read the news about the International Volleyball Tournament in your column, which mentioned that the Chinese team would be organized by Zheng Yiquan and others. The organization and selection of the Chinese team is related to international honor and should be presided over by the sports authorities. I do not dare to initiate or have the authority to organize. I am afraid it will cause misunderstandings, so I specifically request that you publish a letter to correct the error. Sincerely, Zheng Yi, March 18.

### 1936 World Tennis Rankings

Since it is uncertain whether the World Open Tennis Championships for both professionals and amateurs will be held in the near future, the following rankings include both professional and amateur tennis players, based on their performance last year.

Most experts agree that Vines is the most graceful player in the world today, with Perry being the closest second. Vines, when still an amateur, possessed a skill that was clearly superior to Perry's, and there is no reason to believe that his experience competing against players like Tilden would make his competition dull.

Due to his excellent performance in the Davis Cup and his qualification for the Wimbledon final, Kramm should be ranked third. German Hans Neussein is one of the most underestimated players, ranked fourth. He has repeatedly made it difficult for Tilden to parry, as Tilden himself can attest. Last July, at Southport in England, Neussein defeated Cochet in straight sets to win the championship. This competition included outstanding professionals, with the exception of Vines. Budge is ranked fifth due to his excellent competition results both domestically and abroad. In the national championships, he almost defeated Perry, and in their last match, before Perry became a professional, Budge defeated Perry.

Ranking Tilden sixth is inviting a lot of criticism. Tilden, at his peak, displayed the most graceful tennis technique the world had ever seen, and can still defeat Vines in an occasional match today. However, although this veteran's shots are sufficiently sophisticated, his legs and energy are not enough for a five-set match.

Austin is ranked seventh. Except for his loss to Quist in the Davis Cup, he has a rare Davis Cup record that is enough to list him above his conquerors. Quist is the Australian champion, close to Austin. Last season, he repeatedly defeated his partner Crawford. His skill is constantly improving. In the Wimbledon final, he defeated Aram 11-9 in the fifth set to win the Davis Cup for Australia.

Rounding out the top ten are Crawford in ninth place and Frenchman Cochet in tenth place. There are three or four outstanding professionals who can defeat Budge, Austin, Crawford, or Quist, but these players (such as Karelozeluh, Martin Pala, and Vinnie Richard) have not often participated in important competitions in recent years, competitions that every famous player must attend.

### Shanghai Library Association Held its Ninth Annual Meeting Yesterday

Chairman Zha Xiu Gave the Opening Speech; Zha Xiu, Hong Kui, and Others Were Elected as Committee Members

The ninth annual meeting of the Shanghai Library Association was held at the Shanghai Central Library at 2 p.m. yesterday. Over one hundred members attended. Chairman Zha Xiu gave the opening speech. Zha Xiu, Hong Kui, and others were elected to the executive and supervisory committees. A visit to the city library was also conducted. The details are recorded as follows:

### Attendees

Zha Xiu (Fu Da), Hong Da, He Jiyu (City Library), Ouyang Jing (Hongying), Zhang Darui (Mingfu), Qin Xibei (Shanghai Business), Tang Menggao (Guanghua), Xia Zonghu (Liangcai), Gao Zhisheng (Daxia), Xu Huairen (Tongji), Qian Cuncun (Jiaotong), Weng Xuanxiu (Dagongbao), Wang Jiashu (Minli), Cui Dexi (International), Li Weiyue (Yuedong), Yang Xizhang (Shanghai University), Yu Youxin (Soochow), Song Bingqin (Province), Wei Yixin (Tongji), Lü Shaoyu (Ying), Tang Zengxuan (Minguang), Li Qingfan (Minli), Feng Xian (Shanghai North), Huang Jingwan (Shancun), Lin Side (Shanghai Business), Chen Hongfei (City Library), Cao Peizi, representative of the City Party Department, and Xu Manxin, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau. Chairman Zha Xiu, master of ceremonies Huang Jingwan, and recorder Chen Hongfei performed the ceremonies as required.

### Chairman's Speech

He briefly stated that the Shanghai Library Association had been established for thirteen years, during which time everyone had worked hard to advance the association's affairs. Today, it is a great honor to hold the ninth annual meeting at the City Library and to visit the various facilities of the City Library. He felt particularly interested that today coincides with the Shanghai Festival to discuss the progress of the Shanghai Library Association, and he thought that the advancement of the Greater Shanghai Plan must have the establishment of excellent libraries. Foreign cities have very complete libraries. To develop Greater Shanghai, we must all work hard to build extremely complete libraries so that citizens of all levels can have a place to seek wisdom. For example, the libraries in Beiping focus on two types: one is focused on workers, and the other is focused on citizens. They have a spirit of mutual assistance in all aspects of the library. If one party focuses on workers, then the other parties will contribute books on worker knowledge to the first party for mutual adjustment. It is best that our Shanghai libraries also follow this example. At the same time, it is hoped that everyone will transform the library itself from management-oriented to commercial-oriented. In the past, library staff only knew how to preserve books. Now, it is hoped that everyone must promote the names of books to the outside world. For example, citizens who want to study national defense geography, science, and other books should be introduced and promoted, so that the "goods" in the library can be "sold" to citizens, and not just stay in a dull working environment. This would be fortunate. Then, Director Hong delivered a welcome speech, followed by speeches from representatives of the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Re-election of Staff

Lin Sde, Hong Kui, Yang Xizhang, Cha Xiu, Lu Shaoyu, Xu Ze, Weng Xuanxiu, Huang Jingwan, Yu Youxin, Song Bingqin, and Chen Hongfei were elected as executive committee members. Guo Sumin, Peng Mingjiang, and Qian Zixun were elected as supervisory committee members. Finally, tea and refreshments were served, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned.

### Zhejiang Library Adds Books

The Zui Li Series and Shi Yuan Series have been collected by the library one after another.

The printing department attached to the Zhejiang Provincial Library in Hangzhou was reorganized from the former Zhejiang Official Book Bureau and has a history of seventy years. The current collection of official bureau and subsequent carvings, as well as various academic masterpieces donated and deposited by various parties, has reached more than 175,000 blocks. The printed books exceed 200 kinds (counting the sub-items of the series, it has reached more than 500 kinds), which are circulated at home and abroad and are well-known in the book forest. In the past four or five years, the museum has been committed to preserving local literature and assisting in academic advancement, and has devoted considerable efforts to collecting old engraved blocks and has formulated reward donation deposit measures. Since 1932, those who have donated to the museum successively include the Wulin Anecdotes Series and the posthumous works of Wulin philosophers donated by Ding's Eight Thousand-Volume Building, the Continued Jinhua Series donated by Hu Jiqiao of Yongkang, the Yongjia Series deposited by Sun's Yuhai Building in Ruian, Sun of Anhui's reprinted Song Dynasty Four Books, and Feng of Cixi's deposited Jiang Ximing's Complete Works are all famous national studies, and other scattered donations total no less than 20,000 blocks of books. It is known that when the museum held the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition last winter, all parties expressed their sympathy and knew that the museum's method of preserving books was very secretive. For several months since the news of the wide printing and the return of famous book plates, there have been three more cases: ㊀ The Zui Li Series was compiled and published by Jin Rongjing of Pinghu, and his younger brother Qian Sun (named Zhao Fan) continued to publish it. The museum had been seeking it for many years, and at the end of last year, it was consulted by Lu Zhongxiang and Lu Qingcheng, and all the more than 600 picture plates have been deposited. ㊁ Shi Yuan Series is a painting compiled and published by Zhang Shiming (Junheng) of Wuxing. The collection includes the posthumous works of the former sages of the lake. It is now in the Shanghai residence of Zhang Qinbo, the son of the philosopher. Zhang wrote a letter voluntarily donating it. The museum sent staff to collect it. A total of 8,187 book plates were also transported to the museum for printing and sale in March. The transmission of sparseness is particularly rare and is highly valued by the book forest. ㊂ The Six Records of Siming in the Song and Yuan Dynasties also belonged to the museum at the beginning of this month. The Siming Song Records include the Qiandao Siming Tuji, Baoqing Siming Zhi, Kaiqing Siming Continued Zhi, and the Yuan Records include the Yanyou Siming Zhi. To Zheng Siming Continued Zhi Dade Changguo Prefecture Tujia, Xianfeng Jian Yong Confucian Xu Liuquan (Shi Su) visited and obtained a lone copy, proofread and published it into a book, a total of eighty-three volumes, which were regarded as treasures by the people at the time, but it was a pity that the printing was very scarce. The museum tried to find a way to consult with the philosopher Xu Fusun and agreed to deposit 1,349 of his book plates in the museum and sent staff to Yong to collect them. The above three types have been established by the museum and the original owner to sign an agreement and each hold a copy. The first two types can be printed immediately, but the Siming Six Records plate has been sealed for a long time and there are many missing plates and damage. The construction and repair are now underway. Among them, the Baoqing Zhi originally had ten pages of maps. At that time, Xu did not see it, so it was not engraved. This time, ten pages of the original map of the lone copy were also found and engraved, so that it is more complete than Xu's publication. It is heard that it will be sold at a special price as soon as the plate repair is completed. The method has now been determined and can be prepared for archiving. I think public and private collectors pay attention to local chronicles and extravagant and will want to recruit them. It is heard that the museum is currently seeking old engraved book plates in many ways, especially paying attention to the works of local sages and county series in Zhejiang Province. Donations and deposits are welcome, with a view to widely printing and disseminating them to benefit scholars.

### The whole city celebrates "Shanghai Festival"

Public places are open for people to visit. The labor exhibition of primary and secondary schools opens. The Civic Education Center holds an expanded commemoration.

Yesterday was the anniversary of the recovery of Shanghai by the National Revolutionary Army, which was designated as Shanghai Festival by the Municipal Government. "All circles in the city celebrated by raising flags. Civic Education Centers held commemorative meetings separately. All agencies in the central area of the city were open. The labor exhibition of primary and secondary schools sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau also opened yesterday morning. The Municipal Government is also preparing to expand the celebration next year. The details are recorded as follows:

Public Places Open All Day

In order to commemorate Shanghai Festival, the Municipal Government specially built a colorful archway with "Celebrating Shanghai Festival" in front of the government building, and the Party emblem and national emblem were hung all around the stone steps, which attracted the attention of tourists. However, no ceremony was held. All agencies in the central area of the city, such as the Municipal Government and its subordinate bureaus, as well as libraries, museums, and aviation associations, were all open. The Nanshi Confucian Temple Park is even more a place where tourists gather. The zoo there is also open all day for people to visit. China General Omnibus Company temporarily increased the number of buses in Nanshi Zhabei, and in Zhabei, discount round-trip tickets were sold to facilitate citizens to travel back and forth.

Municipal Museum Unprecedentedly Crowded

In the first Shanghai Festival carnival, the Shanghai Municipal Museum, under the command of Mayor Wu, was open for free all day. After the news spread, the weather was excellent that day, and because the whole city was on holiday, after the opening at 9:30, the audience continued to flock in. By 1:00 PM, the number of people in the museum reached more than 3,000 people, and the entire museum was packed. The museum had to put the audience in in batches, but the order was excellent. In addition, because the museum had made preparations in advance, the Central and Shenjiahang police substations of the city also sent police officers to the scene to maintain order and prevent temporary incidents. It was found that the number of visitors to the museum on that day was 8,852 Chinese and 1,029 foreigners, which is the highest record since the museum opened in January this year. It is heard that the museum will hold a second special exhibition at the end of the month, and there will be another grand occasion at that time.

Labor Exhibition Opens Yesterday Morning

The labor exhibition of public and private primary and secondary schools sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was held at Xicheng Primary School on Penglai Road yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. At the same time, the exhibition was opened to the public for three days. A total of 53 schools participated in this exhibition, with more than 12,000 works. The details are recorded as follows:

Opening Situation

The venue is located in Xicheng Primary School, at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Penglai Road. There are large banners. The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM yesterday. Director Pan of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Section Chief Jiang, Zhang Yongchun, Yu Jifan and other guests, and more than 300 representatives of teachers and students from various schools attended. Chairman Director Pan, Master of Ceremonies Yuan Zengyu, Recorder Wang Gongxia, performed the ceremony as usual. First, Chairman Director Pan delivered a speech, followed by speeches by Section Chief Jiang Yu Jifan, etc., and then the meeting adjourned immediately. The exhibition opened to the public at 9:30, and the audience was very crowded.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Director Pan delivered the opening speech, which briefly stated that today is Shanghai Festival, and it was also decided by the Shanghai Municipal Mayor according to the suggestion of the Municipal Council that March 21st every year is Shanghai Festival. The meaning is to hope that on this day, regardless of occupation or region, all citizens of Shanghai will show the enthusiastic spirit of unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance. At the same time, this festival is used to encourage industry, agriculture, commerce, and learning, such as holding exhibitions of agricultural products, handicrafts, horticulture, potential works, and other various exhibitions. The mayor's intention is to promote the improvement of customs on this festival, because the transformation of social customs is very important. To have a new country, there must first be a new society. To have good politics, there must first be a good society. Therefore, reforming social customs is an important task. On the one hand, we must eliminate bad and outdated things, and at the same time, we must come up with new things that are in line with the times to replace them. In terms of form, we must reform them, and in terms of spirit, we must purify them. In this way, we can achieve the purpose of transforming customs. For example, the welcoming of gods and festivals in Shanghai is superstitious and contains feudal colors, and should not be held in modern times. However, in the past agricultural economic era, after the farmers completed their annual work, they thought of thanking the gods, and at the same time, after a year of hard work, they thought of finding a day to be happy, so there was the matter of welcoming gods and festivals, so it also had considerable significance at that time. The mayor's intention is to ban all such festivals, and on this day of Shanghai Festival, everyone should do meaningful festivals. Festivals do not necessarily have to welcome gods, such as the parade of national goods, and the sports parade of the Soviet Union, which can also be competed. Therefore, we must take the good things that can encourage progress in knowledge, physical strength, industry, agriculture, and commerce, and think of ways to hold them on Shanghai Festival. If one day is not enough, even a week is possible. However, because preparations were not enough this year, it can be used as a propaganda year to let the citizens know, and it will be lively next year. The labor exhibition held today is one of the various exhibitions that the mayor hopes to hold on Shanghai Festival. If preparations are not enough, of course, it cannot meet the ideal. A total of five municipal middle schools and normal schools and thirty-six municipal primary schools, four private middle schools and normal schools, and eight private primary schools participated in the preparation from the 16th to notify the schools. Vocational schools did not participate, so there were a total of 53 schools. The number of products, 2,407 from municipal middle schools and normal schools, 8,304 from municipal primary schools, 734 from private middle schools and normal schools, 1,287 from private primary schools, totaling 12,732. The order of display, first primary school, then middle school normal school, a total of ten rooms for municipal primary school, one large room for private primary school, four rooms for municipal middle school normal school, two rooms for private middle school normal school, a total of nineteen rooms. Finally, everyone should pay attention to why the education exhibition is held first. Labor, because we now feel that education must be in line with life, and we hope that the education given by the schools and received by the students must be in line with the skills needed for their future practical life and the skills to obtain their original life, such as knowledge and physical strength are important, but labor is particularly important. Labor is a necessary condition for life. A few years ago, we heard the sentence "He who does not work, neither shall he eat", the meaning of which is that to live, one must first labor. This theory comes from abroad. China has "Those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others." This concept has been passed down, thinking that it is not necessary to labor, but there is a folk saying that whether it is agriculture, industry, or handicraft, going out to work is called making a living, which can prove that living requires labor. China is also the same. The so-called work is labor work, abbreviated as labor. So labor is life, life is hard work, so the labor exhibition is held first to check whether students have learned life skills in addition to book knowledge. If so, it is education that meets the needs of modern times. We now attach importance to labor, that is, to change the idea of ​​only emphasizing book knowledge in the imperial examination era. Therefore, in the first year of the Shanghai Festival, holding this conference is to instruct the general society to know the new meaning of education. After everyone visits, how to encourage and supervise progress will not lose the significance of holding it.

Speeches Summary

㊀ Section Chief Jiang's speech briefly stated that today is Shanghai Festival, and it is also the day when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai. Because of the arrival of the revolutionary army, obstacles have been cleared, so we are here today to hold a gathering, and do not forget to clear obstacles and seek national equality. Education is life, it is realistic education, and education cannot be separated from reality. If there is a major enemy in front of us, we have a hypothetical goal in front of us, and labor should also have a hypothetical goal. We must have front-line education and rear-defense education, so that students are not on the front line, but in the rear. ㊁ Yu Jifan's speech briefly stated that now everyone is talking about the economic recession of the country and the depression of social phenomena. Under this status quo, the education sector should pay attention to production education, which can be remedied by production. However, production cannot be separated from labor. Therefore, today's conference is to pay attention to saving the social depression. Everyone must work hard. The purpose of labor education is to first cultivate children's labor, skills, and cooperative spirit, second to develop children's design ability, third to inspire children's interest and ability in production, and fourth to enable children to have the knowledge and ability to improve their own lives.

A Glimpse of the Works

All the works are displayed in nineteen rooms. The categories are roughly divided into gold, wood, rattan, bamboo, sewing, embroidery, weaving, science, instruments, biology, agronomy, specimens, and labor sports teaching aids charts, etc., with a total of more than 10,000 pieces. Among the products, there are not a few labor works for national defense, many labor works for consumer tools, and fewer labor works for production tools. The national defense line of Xunyu Primary School is the most magnificent, the agricultural specimens of Xinlu Normal School are very rich, and the work method diagrams are particularly detailed. The physics and chemistry teaching aids of Jingye Middle School, the specimens of Xiaosong Middle School, the weaving and embroidery of Wuben Aiqun Nanyang and other girls' schools, the unified national salvation map of Shanghai Preschool Teachers' Training School Shangwen, He'an's bamboo carvings, Wanzhu's clay work, Tangwan's sports field zoo, Zhenxi's national defense unit, etc., all have profound meaning, or are exquisitely made, and are rare works.

Unprecedented Grand Occasion at the Civic Education Center

The Municipal Civic Education Center held an expanded commemorative meeting yesterday for Shanghai Festival, in order to vigorously improve the lives of citizens and transform bad customs. The lecture hall was colorful and brand new, with about a thousand people participating. Chairman Xu Zexiang, recorder Wang Chunxi, Liu Ruichang, after leading the ceremony, gave a brief and concise report, briefly stating that today is the first year, the first day, the first Shanghai Festival, and it is also the first day when the National Revolutionary Army recovered Shanghai. In order to commemorate Shanghai's revolutionary baptism and to improve the lives of Shanghai citizens and transform customs, Shanghai Festival was born in response to this. Today we commemorate Shanghai Festival, and we should follow the instructions of Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government, encourage agriculture, encourage industry, encourage commerce, and encourage learning. Everyone should be loyal to their duties in the future, in order to improve their lives, be enterprising, and be promising, full of vigor, and reform the bad customs of welcoming gods and festivals in the past, grasp the times, stand on the line of the times, and embark on the bright road of a new era and a new China. After the report, Dr. Zhang Yuanruo, a celebrity in this city, gave a speech (detailed words are being sorted out), briefly stating that we commemorate Shanghai Festival, which has four major meanings: 1. The meaning of seeing revolution, the content includes the commemoration of recovery, the starting point of building a new China, and the beginning of modernization progress. 2. The meaning of society, such as the social construction of the Municipal Government in recent years, changing politics must first change customs, improve customs, promote new life, etc. 3. The meaning of education, the content includes, first, entertaining education in happiness, second, the national life of boredom, third, breaking superstition, fourth, enlightenment movement of lively, energetic, optimistic and upward, etc. 4. The meaning of self-reliance, the general idea is that welcoming gods and festivals are all worship of divine power, relying on the psychology of relying on heaven. In the future, we must awaken the spirit of self-reliance, such as Mayor Wu's announcement to us to encourage agriculture, encourage industry, encourage commerce, and encourage learning, etc. All our citizens should follow them consistently, in order to improve bad lives as soon as possible and transform bad habits as soon as possible.

### The whole city celebrates by raising flags

Due to time constraints this year, a large-scale celebration could not be held, but the Municipal Government had issued a notice to the whole city in advance to raise flags to celebrate, in order to arouse the attention of citizens. Therefore, yesterday, all agencies, schools, groups, industrial and commercial firms, and residents along the street all raised net flags to celebrate enthusiastically.

Expanding the Celebration Next Year

The method of celebrating "Shanghai Festival" was previously discussed by the Municipal Government convening representatives of various groups, and it was decided to hold six exhibitions in separate areas: agricultural products, handicrafts, labor, hygiene, horticulture, and commemorative events for the restoration, as well as other celebrations such as competitions and airplane performances. However, because preparations were not enough, all of them could not be held. However, Mayor Wu believes that promoting Shanghai Festival is enough to eliminate bad habits and achieve the effect of transforming customs, and plans to organize the Shanghai Festival Committee from this year, gathering all relevant parties, and actively preparing in accordance with the purpose of encouraging agriculture, encouraging industry, encouraging commerce, and encouraging learning, so that Shanghai Festival will have a grand celebration next year.

The German government, in recognition of Mayor Wu's assistance to German nationals in Guangzhou during his tenure as Commissioner of Public Safety in 1925, and in gratitude for his efforts to maintain order during the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, which ensured the safety of German residents and their property, has awarded Mayor Wu a First-Class Red Cross Decoration of Honor, along with a certificate. The award ceremony, conducted by the German Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Kriebel, on behalf of the German government, took place at his official residence yesterday at 1:00 PM. Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, and Secretary Tang were invited to a luncheon, accompanied by senior consular staff and prominent members of the German community in Shanghai.

After the luncheon, the German Consul General delivered an address before presenting the medal to Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu also gave a reply. The guests departed in high spirits. The text of both addresses is recorded below.

Address at the Bestowal Ceremony

Consul General Kriebel, in his address, stated: "Ten years ago today, namely, March 21, 1927, corresponding to the sixteenth year of the Republic, at a time when the cause of the Chinese National Revolution, under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chiang, was sweeping across the country with victories everywhere, the Chinese National Revolutionary Army entered Shanghai on that very day. We, the German people, wish on this day to commemorate the benevolent policies Your Honor implemented towards the German community during your tenure as Commissioner of Public Safety in Guangzhou in 1925. At the time of the Shameen Incident, labor unrest was rampant, boycotts were fierce, and local disturbances lasted for several years. Your Honor, without shirking difficulties, resolutely took responsibility to protect the lives and property of German nationals residing in Dongshan, Guangzhou. The German community remains grateful for this great achievement. On January 6, 1932, amidst the exigencies of the situation, Your Honor was appointed Mayor of Shanghai. On January 7, you were sworn into office. Our German residents in Shanghai were greatly pleased and encouraged, as recalling the events in Guangzhou, they could not help but feel even more gratified. The difficulties Your Honor has encountered in Shanghai, a city of great international character situated within Chinese territory and existing in a uniquely special situation, are well-known. However, Your Honor has been able to ensure security, maintain order, and organize matters in a systematic way. I, on behalf of our head of state and our government, wish to express our gratitude and admiration to Your Honor. After the January 28th Incident, German merchants, scholars, and residents of all occupations in Shanghai were spared from major disturbances and were able to live and work in peace, all thanks to Your Honor's protection. Your Honor's guarantee of security, maintenance of order, and systematic approach enabled the preservation of the lives and property of our German residents in Shanghai. Your Honor's great achievements are exceptionally admirable. Today, I am deeply honored to present to Your Honor our First-Class Red Cross Decoration of Honor and its certificate. I wish Your Honor a long tenure as Mayor of Shanghai, where you may fully realize your grand ambitions. As I am about to return to my country, I take this opportunity to bid Your Honor a temporary farewell. I previously served as a military advisor in Your esteemed country, and now, for several years, have been Consul General in Shanghai. Your country's enduring civilization and the construction of a new China have filled me with longing and admiration. I hope to return to Your esteemed country after my leave. This is my sincere hope and prayer."

Mayor Wu's Reply

"Today, I am deeply honored and grateful to receive the First-Class Red Cross Decoration of Honor and its certificate from Consul General Kriebel on behalf of the German government. Furthermore, I am deeply humbled by Consul General Kriebel's generous praise. This decoration symbolizes the friendly relations between China and Germany. I hope that Consul General Kriebel will convey my sincere gratitude to the head of your country and your government for their kindness. China is in the process of revolutionary construction. As evidenced by the experiences of various countries in their revival, there is much need for the cooperation and assistance of friendly nations. Consul General Kriebel previously served as a military advisor in our country, assisting our leader, Chairman Chiang, with outstanding achievements. I deeply admire him. Consul General Kriebel has been in Shanghai for many years and has contributed greatly to the promotion of Sino-German relations. His cooperation and sincerity towards me will be remembered forever. As Consul General Kriebel takes leave to return to his country, I am filled with reluctance. How can I express my feelings? I can only wish him a safe journey and sincerely hope that he will return to our country soon, so that we may continue and develop our past cooperation and friendship."

### Customs Anti-Smuggling Personnel Issue Declaration Yesterday

Japanese Ronin Smuggle and Commit Violence; Hope Government Will Provide Armed Force and Expects Enthusiastic Assistance from All Circles

According to the Central News Agency, Japanese ronin secretly loaded copper coins worth ten thousand yuan for export on the morning of the 20th. Because customs officials prevented it, they committed violence and injured seven customs officials on the spot. It is now known that the ship carrying the goods was the "Taiyo Maru", not the "Shanghai Maru". In view of the escalating smuggling and violence by Japanese ronin, the Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling personnel held a meeting yesterday to discuss solutions and issued a declaration stating: "In the past year, customs officials have clashed with Japanese ronin more than a dozen times over smuggling incidents at the Japanese wharves in Shanghai. In these dozen or so clashes, some of us have been beaten until our heads were broken and bleeding, and some have had our fingers broken. Now it is getting more and more serious every day. Almost customs personnel can no longer perform their duties at Japanese wharves. For example, in several incidents that have occurred this month, two or three times the smuggled copper coins that had been seized by the customs were forcibly taken away at the wharf by personnel from the Japanese consulate. On one occasion, a small number of customs officials were surrounded by a large number of ronin, losing their freedom of movement. On one occasion, a tax police officer, along with the smuggled goods seized, was kidnapped to the police station by the ronin, and the smuggled goods were taken away by the Japanese consulate. We now feel that the Japanese wharves in Shanghai are no longer Chinese territory. Since April of last year, in order to strengthen the management of imported goods and improve efficiency, the customs implemented a new system of wharf warehouse management. Merchants from Britain and the United States, as well as wharf companies, have sincerely accepted the customs' measures and implemented them one after another. This new system is a major blow to professional smugglers. However, Japanese merchants and various wharf companies, under the pretext of unfounded reasons, refused to obey orders. As a result, the new system of tens of thousands of yuan in annual administrative fees for customs has been completely destroyed and nothing has been gained. We sincerely feel that it is necessary for China and Japan to have economic cooperation, but we believe that the premise of economic cooperation must be that Japanese people can respect the sovereignty and integrity of the Republic of China. We hope that our business community and people from all walks of life will not forget these customs officials who are struggling daily under the iron rulers and short daggers of the ronin, and give formal advice to the economic delegation from Japan this time. We further hope that Mr. Kodama Kenji and his companions, who are coming to China this time, will go to the Huishan Wharf, where Japanese ronin are rampant, when they take the boat back to their country, and inquire about the truth of the unbridled behavior of Japanese ronin at the wharf. At the same time, we should use the Eastern maxim quoted by Chairman Chiang, 'Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself,' to pay tribute to Mr. Kodama Kenji and his party. If Japan is willing to consider international integrity, accept our advice, and automatically deal with the organized behavior of these ronin, we will have no objection to economic cooperation between China and Japan based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. Otherwise, in order to protect national sovereignty, to protect the lifeline of finance, and the tax revenue of national industry and commerce, we can only give a head-on blow to this shameless smuggling. We are willing to sacrifice, we are willing to go to the front line of anti-smuggling and fight to the death, but we cannot fight like this with bare hands. We hope that the government will arm us. This is an issue for the entire nation. We hope that people from all walks of life across the country will give enthusiastic assistance to our wishes and demands. This is hereby declared."

### Japanese Economic Mission Member Fujiyama Hosted Banquet Yesterday to Exchange Views on Sugar Industry

The mission has formally completed its banquets in Shanghai; Kodama is scheduled to return home on the 26th; Discussions over the past few days have not yielded any concrete results

According to Xin Sheng She, apart from attending the banquet hosted by the Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying yesterday noon, the Japanese Economic Mission has formally completed its banquets in Shanghai. The members of the mission began to act freely from yesterday onwards. Fujiyama Aiichiro invited Chinese sugar industry leaders Zhou Zuomin and Qian Xinzhi, among others, to a banquet, while others hosted a banquet for the mission in a private capacity last night. The details are as follows:

Mr. Xu's Reception

The Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying hosted a banquet for the Japanese Economic Mission at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road at 12:30 PM yesterday. The attendees included the head of the mission, Kodama Kenji, and all the members of the mission. In addition, there were the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai Kawai, Secretaries of the Japanese Embassy Tajiri and Soga, Commercial Officer Iwai, Consul Fukui, leaders of the Japanese industrial and commercial circles Funatsu, Yoshida, Yamamoto, Boku, Ueda, Hatsuzuka, the Mayor of this city Wu Tiecheng, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhou Jue, Deputy Director Zhao Tiezhang, leaders from all walks of life Yu Qiaqing, Zhou Zuomin, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xiaolin, Liu Hongsheng, Yu Yefeng, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Xiuzhi, Shao Yulin, Tang Shoumin, Yu Zuoting, Wu Yunzhai, Zhou Wenbin, and others, more than fifty people. Wang Pengsheng, former Counselor of the Embassy in Japan, Secretary Huang Bodu, and Zhou Jue, Zhao Tiezhang, and others were responsible for the reception. Short speeches were made to show welcome, and toasts were raised to each other. There were no speeches. The banquet ended in high spirits at around 2:00 PM.

Fujiyama's Banquet

Fujiyama Aiichiro, Director of the Japan Sugar Industry Federation, hosted a banquet for Chinese sugar industry leaders Zheng Zenan and others at the International Hotel at 12:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on increasing sugar trade. During the banquet, Fujiyama said in his speech: "Today, I am hosting this banquet for you, and I am very honored and happy that you have all come together in your busy schedules. Furthermore, I have been very busy in China, seeking friendship between the two countries, so I went to Nanjing and other places in your esteemed country, and I have not yet had the opportunity to visit you. I sincerely apologize. I am very grateful for your kindness over the years in promoting the products of our factory. I hope that you will continue to work hard in the spirit of past promotion. This is my hope, and I hope that our sugar merchants from both countries will work together to promote friendship and increase profits. I offer you a glass of wine and wish you all the best in your business development and health." Zheng Zenan, a representative of the sugar industry, replied: "Today, we, the sugar industry colleagues in Shanghai, are greatly grateful to Mr. Fujiyama from the Japan Sugar Manufacturing Factory for inviting us here and treating us to a grand banquet. At the same time, we are honored to hear your guidance and many great opinions. We also have great sympathy with the various points expressed and hoped for by Mr. Fujiyama, and we should work together to strive to implement Mr. Fujiyama's expectations. However, we feel that in order to achieve the goal of realizing our hopes, we must first seek a basis for our own goals. The so-called basis is that the existence of good feelings is an element of international trade, which need not be said. Mr. Fujiyama has long known this, but since the September 18th Incident, the people of our country have had no good feelings towards your country due to the enthusiasm of patriotic sentiments. However, our sugar industry colleagues, because of their long and deep relationship of 30 years of trade with sugar merchants in your country, have still restored old relations even though there have been occasional interruptions in business for a short time due to the sanctions of our people. This is nothing more than our repayment of the good friendship of your country's sugar merchants, and it is also our actual expression of love for your country's sugar merchants. Unexpectedly, in recent years, some of the measures taken by sugar merchants in your country have greatly disappointed us. That is, selling the produced sugar to smugglers in your country and promoting it in China through improper methods of dishonesty. This has caused great damage to our business. The agents of sugar merchants in your country, such as Mitsui, Fuhoyu, etc., have also been affected. Therefore, if such a trend is not stopped, it is tantamount to killing our business. Therefore, our good feelings towards sugar merchants in your country have been somewhat diminished. If feelings can become deeper with each passing day, then trade is easy to increase. If you go against this, it is tantamount to trying to find fish in trees. I have heard people from your country say that this is due to the high sugar tax in our country. We have no objection to this, but the current tax rate in our country is at a low-to-medium level compared to the sugar taxes in various countries around the world. There are even countries with tax rates that are six or seven times higher than ours. I have never heard of any neighboring country smuggling and reducing tariffs, but the tariff is still over seven yuan if half is deducted, and there is still a huge profit from smuggling. Furthermore, no countries in the world have ever heard of reducing taxes to avoid smuggling because smuggling cannot be suppressed. Therefore, this statement is certainly wrong, and it is definitely not what we want. I think that Mr. Fujiyama is not only a leader in the sugar industry in Japan, but also bears the heavy expectations of society and the government. One word is heavier than nine tripods. This time, when he came to China to seek true economic cooperation between the two sides, we should not use empty words of communication to perfunctorily treat him, failing to live up to Mr. Fujiyama's good intentions of traveling across the ocean. I would like to take this opportunity to frankly inform you of what we want to say, so that it can actually achieve results. At the same time, we have great aspirations and are prepared to be taught by Mr. Fujiyama, who is knowledgeable and insightful, to discuss how to avoid smuggling, and we hope that Mr. Fujiyama will consider our plea. Hopefully, Sino-Japanese trade, not only in sugar products, but also in other goods, can be increased and developed. I would also like to borrow a glass of wine and toast together, wishing Mr. Fujiyama a smooth journey and happiness."

Private Receptions

Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, Tang Shoumin, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Zhou Zuomin, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others hosted a public banquet for the head of the mission, Kodama, and others at Liu Jisheng's residence at 675 Julada Road to show their friendly relations. The Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhou Jue, and all the directors of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association also participated. The banquet ended at around 10:00 PM.

About to Leave Shanghai

Furthermore, mission members Shoji Otsukichi, Iio Ichiji, Toyota Risaburo, and Funatsu Tatsuichiro are scheduled to host a banquet at the Six Three Garden at 7:00 PM tonight to thank the Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying. According to the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, the economic problems discussed by the Japanese mission and the association in recent days have all been abstract discussions and have not yielded any concrete results.

### Formal Tibetan Representative Arrives Today

Westan Gyatso

According to Shen Zhou She, since the central government sent Huang Musong as a special envoy to Tibet, the local government has been sending people to Beijing, but they have all been unofficial representatives. Now, in view of the fact that the central government and the border region are far apart, transportation is inconvenient, and estrangement is inevitable, Reting Rinpoche, the leader of the Tibetan local government, specially dispatched Westan Gyatso, the Great Khenpo of Lhasa, as a formal representative to Beijing to pay respects to the central authorities. Mr. Westan is from Qinghai and went to Tibet to study at a young age. He is a profound scholar and is especially proficient in sutras. He is now in his fifties. Many of his disciples work in Beijing. Mr. Westan set out east last month and will be able to pass through Shanghai and transfer to Beijing this morning. He does not intend to stay. The Central Party Headquarters specially dispatched section chief Li Yongxin, staff member Li Jinfu, head of the Tibetan Affairs Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Kong Qingzong, along with key members Ji Guoyi, Shen Ziyi, representative of the Ministry of Education Wang Kuiwu, and the Tibetan representative stationed in Beijing and Director of the Tibetan Office in Beijing Tudan Sangjie, along with their attendants, all came to Shanghai yesterday morning to welcome him and will accompany Mr. Westan to Beijing. It is also learned that the supervisors and commissioners Li Dan and Secretary Yang Zhifu, who were sent by the central government to welcome him, will also come today. It is also learned that Nanjing is also preparing to host him.

### 工部局 Letter Responds to Real Estate Association Regarding Water Price Increase

Based on the company's repeated requests and careful consideration, a decision was made. The Real Estate Association will hold a meeting in the coming days to continue their opposition.

The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Municipal Council of the Public Concession recently responded to a letter from the Real Estate Association of this city, which inquired about the reasons for the water price increase. The letter stated: "Dear Sirs, We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 17th of this month regarding the issue of water price increases. This Bureau has studied the matter with the Water Company on several occasions and has repeatedly considered it. The Public Utilities Committee of this Bureau has put forward a discussion and decided to implement it. The process and reasons for the price increase are as follows:

Water prices within the Public Concession

Calculated at 75% of the original price. The Public Utilities Committee of this Bureau recently put forward the question of this discount for consideration. It was found that the 75% discount was implemented from April 1935. By the end of that year, both this Bureau and the Water Company believed that the local economy was depressed and that water prices should not be increased. The Company also intended to postpone the modification of water prices for one year and wait until the currency system promulgated by the Chinese government was more effective before re-examining the matter. Therefore, the water prices for 1936 were the same as those for 1935. However, it was mutually understood at the time that if the situation required a modification of the 75% discount, this Bureau and the Company would negotiate a change. Near the end of 1936, the Company submitted a request to this Bureau to change the water price to 85%. The Public Utilities Committee and this Bureau then

Considered in Detail

Afterwards, the Company submitted details of its estimated expenditures for 1937. The Company replied on December 29th of the previous year, stating that the directors of the Company believed that if expenditures were reduced, the continued and safe supply of water would be jeopardized. It also stated that the Company had previously declared that in many areas, savings in water supply had often resulted in epidemics, causing loss of life, and fires, causing property damage. On January 11th of this year, the Public Utilities Committee held a meeting and discussed this matter again. The Chief of the Finance Department suggested changing the Company's proposed 85% to 80%. The Chief believed that even with the 80% change, the Company's business would still be in deficit and should be compensated from the Company's reserve fund. Mr. Bielson, the Company's Chief Engineer and General Manager, attended the meeting and answered questions regarding

Company Expenses

Mr. Bielson stated that the main reason for the increase in budgeted expenses was the lower exchange rate compared to 1935, as well as the recent installation of a large number of water meters. Furthermore, a new machine would have to be installed this year. One committee member stated that the average water price currently paid by users within the concession was lower than that in the city of Shanghai or the French Concession. Mr. Bielson said that if calculated at 80%, the water price in the Public Concession would be almost the same as in the Chinese area, but still much lower than in the French Concession. Finally, Mr. Bielson stated that it would be best to revise the water price before the end of this year because the Shanghai Real Estate Owners Association had strongly requested the Company to install individual water meters for Chinese-style houses. This would reduce water usage, and the cost per unit of water used would increase. Furthermore, the Company would have to incur additional expenses for installing water meters, so the water price paid by users would inevitably increase somewhat. If it is now agreed to change the water price to 85%, it may not be increased again in the future. However, this would benefit future users, but would inevitably cause some losses for current users. After discussion, the Public Utilities Committee

Recommended to the Board of Directors

As follows: (1) Approve the Shanghai Water Company to charge users based on water meter readings at 80% of the original price, starting from February 1st of this year. The Company promises to strive for thrift within the realm of possibility. (2) When the situation changes and the discount rate needs to be modified, it may be appropriately modified with the consent of this Bureau. (3) The Company's expenditures between 1931 and 1937 have increased sharply. This Bureau, seeing this, has not approved the Company's proposed change to 85%. (4) The issue of future water meter installation should be studied in detail by the relevant departments of this Bureau in conjunction with Company staff. The Board of Directors approved the Public Utilities Committee's previous recommendations at a meeting on January 20th of this year. The Company also expressed its agreement.

Meeting to Oppose

After receiving the reply from the Municipal Council, the Real Estate Association believes that the reasons for the price increase proposed by the Water Company and the reasons recommended by the Public Utilities Committee to the Board of Directors are insufficient at a time when the market has not yet recovered. It has now been decided to continue the opposition and a meeting will be convened in the coming days to discuss the next steps.

### China Merchants Electric Company to Increase Capital by Four Million

Shareholders' meeting decided yesterday to increase the amount fully in the next two years, expanding business area to Caohejing, Pu Song

Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company held its 20th shareholders' meeting at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road, Beijing Road, at 2:00 PM yesterday, and immediately passed a resolution to increase capital by four million yuan. The Datong News Agency reporter investigated and recorded the details as follows:

Shareholders Present

Shareholders present yesterday included Du Yuesheng, Gu Xinyi, Lu Bohong, Kuang Zhongmou, Wang Zhen, Huang Hanzhi, Liu Pinsan, Yao Yinpeng, Li Fengyi, Wang Zhicui, Wang Tiqun, Xu Fuhua, Chen Ligou, Shao Daren, Zhang Wenbin, Zhang Jingwan, Zhang Baoji, Li Feiqing, Li Shi Wan Shan, and more than one hundred others, accounting for 360,730 shares. Wang Yiting presided over the meeting.

Business Report

After the formalities, Manager Lu Bohong first reported on the general outline of the 19th session, roughly saying: "Previously, the company's business had been gradually developing, resulting in insufficient power supply from the original power plant. Purchasing electricity from other companies and reselling it to users was not only restricted by others but also uneconomical. Therefore, at the shareholders' meeting in the 22nd year of the Republic, it was decided to build a new power plant on a self-purchased site in Pubin and order the latest boilers and larger capacity steam turbine generators in order to provide as much as possible to the needs of society without any shortages. However, since the new plant is under construction, it is urgent to prepare for sales. The company's business area is only in the South Shanghai area, and the scope is narrow, so there is no room for development. Therefore, on the one hand, we tried to sell to peer companies outside the business area. On the one hand, the whole area of Caohejing and half of the Pu Song area were submitted to the government to expand into the company's exclusive business area. The above plan has been reported last year. Subsequently, the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau transferred the order from the Shanghai Municipal Government to pay 130,000 yuan in national currency to the city treasury as the price for the exclusive operating rights for the expanded area. The company's board of directors authorized the manager to negotiate repeatedly, and the municipal government finally agreed to reduce it to 70,000 yuan. A franchise contract was signed with the municipal government in November, and the expansion of the area was announced." Lu reported to this point, and then divided the business conditions of the past year into two parts: electricity and transportation. The electricity part was divided into (A) the general situation of the new plant project, (B) poles and lines, (C) power distribution, (D) power generation, (E) power purchase, (F) power sales, and other six items. The transportation part was divided into (A) engineering and (B) business, and detailed reports were made separately. Then, Supervisor Zhang Wenbin reported (1) the balance sheet, (2) the property catalog, (3) the profit and loss statement, (4) the profit distribution, and (5) the comparative table of economic business and industrial conditions in the past two years.

Discussion of Proposals

After the reporting matters were completed, the discussion immediately followed. (1) The proposal to increase capital was attached with an explanation: "The company's number of electricity users has been increasing year by year, and the power generation capacity has continued to increase, resulting in the original generator capacity being unable to meet demand. Purchasing electricity from other companies for resale to users is not only restricted by others but also too uneconomical. At the 17th shareholders' meeting in the 23rd year of the Republic, it was proposed to build a new power plant, and at the 18th shareholders' meeting in the 24th year of the Republic, it was reviewed to change the plan for building a new plant, and both were approved. However, since the construction of the new power plant began, the pound price has been rising without falling. It is estimated that the equipment such as turbine generators, boilers, and coal conveying pumps, steam pipes, and water pipes will cost more than 2,110,000 yuan in national currency. The construction projects such as pile driving, foundation factory buildings, and steel frames will cost about 400,000 yuan in national currency. This is the machinery that has been purchased and the construction that has been carried out, totaling 3,510,000 yuan in national currency. The machinery that has not yet been ordered and the construction projects that have not yet been carried out, such as the connection between the new and old plants, the new plant's cement engineering pumping room, water inlet equipment, installation of machine cooling and heating water equipment, and other expenses, will cost about 500,000 yuan in national currency. In addition, after the establishment of the new plant, in order to extend electricity to the expanded area, it is necessary to add a 33,000-volt high-voltage transmission line, including power distribution equipment, transformers, underground lines, electric poles, white materials, etc., which will cost about 500,000 yuan in national currency. In total, the completion of the new plant plan will cost more than 4,500,000 yuan. Based on the company's business development in recent years, it is estimated that the equipment such as various power distribution lines will need to be expanded at any time and place, all of which require funds. Although 2,000,000 yuan in equity has been increased in the 23rd year, it is still not enough for more than 1,500,000 yuan. Moreover, the company's fixed assets have exceeded the total capital by more than 2,500,000 yuan. The two funds require a total of hundreds of thousands of yuan in national currency, which urgently needs to be supplemented and consolidate the foundation. However, raising funds through branches is more complicated and difficult. It is now planned to recruit 400,000 shares at one time this year, totaling 4,000,000 yuan in national currency. Is it feasible? Please decide publicly." It was then resolved that 2,000,000 yuan in equity would be increased in the 16th year and 2,000,000 yuan in equity would be increased in the 27th year, totaling 4,000,000 yuan. (2) The proposal to amend the articles of association was attached with an explanation: "The company's original articles of association have become unsuitable for use due to the changes of the times, or the original articles must be supplemented in terms of wording and tone, or there is an urgent need to add special repairs due to the needs of the facts, so that the principals have something to rely on. All of these have been drafted by the board of directors to draw up a draft plan. Now the draft plan is read out item by item (read by Dong Gu Xinyi, and then revised and passed item by item."

Election of Supervisors

Before starting the vote to elect supervisors, the results of the vote showed that Zhang Wenbin, Li Zuhua, Jia Jiying, Jiao Xianglin, Zhuang Zhenjia, and other five people were elected for joint reappointment. After the election, the staff of the venue invited the shareholders to the second floor for tea and refreshments, and dispersed happily at 6:00 PM.

### American Helen Keller Will Come to China at the Invitation of the China Children's Welfare Association

Foreign Commentary Agency in this city. This newspaper learned yesterday that American Helen Keller will come to China at the invitation of the China Children's Welfare Association. Ms. Keller was originally scheduled to depart from the United States in mid-April to Japan, where she is scheduled to stay for two months. The China Children's Welfare Association authorities decided to wait for Ms. Keller to arrive in Japan and then invite her to China. Currently, a special organizing committee is set up by Mrs. Freian and Mrs. Hanermilk, Mrs. New, Ms. Inter, etc., to be responsible for handling. According to Helen Keller, she was born in Alabama in 1880. After nineteen months, she became blind due to scarlet fever, and her hearing was also destroyed at the same time. Afterwards, with the help of teachers using the Braille system, she was able to read and type with care. After eight years of training, she was gradually able to speak. After that, she graduated from Radcliffe College and obtained a degree. Soon she became a writer and speaker. Her progress in speech and blindness is unprecedented in history. Even her literary achievements are superior to those of ordinary people. According to a survey by the International Association for the Prevention of Blindness, there are currently 3 million blind people in China, and an estimated 20 million people will become blind. There are an estimated 12 million people suffering from trachoma. Corneal disease is the biggest cause of blindness. Secondly, smallpox and venereal diseases also lead to blindness.

### Using Fake Checks to Swindle Huge Sums of Money

Totaling more than 20,000 Gold, Xu Houyi is Accused

Xu Houyi, who lives at No. 42 Wufu Lane, Pudong, has been working at the British American Tobacco Company. He has some savings. Huang Yongchang, who lives at No. 17 Yuanfuli, Baoding Road, Tangshan Road, and is engaged in the business of selling yellow sand and stones, had a close friendship with Xu. Around May of last year, Huang used 26 checks from banks such as Jiaotong, Kengye, Siming, Nonggong, and China & South Sea, with a total face value of 23,301 yuan, to discount them to Xu, saying that the checks were issued by major commercial firms. At that time, Xu refused because the amount was too large. After Huang repeatedly requested, Xu gave him the cash according to the amount. After the checks were due, Xu went to various banks to withdraw the money, but they were all returned by the banks because there were insufficient funds and the accounts had been closed. Xu then investigated and found that the account names on the checks were all Huang's aliases and were intended to defraud money. He then negotiated with him, but Huang did not show up and his whereabouts were unknown. Xu had no choice but to hire lawyer Zhang Fukang to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Zhang for the crime of defrauding money, requesting that he be punished according to Article 335 of the Criminal Law and ordered to repay 23,301 yuan. This case was heard yesterday by Judge Zhan Liangce in the Second Criminal Court. Huang Yongchang was not summoned. After Judge Zhan questioned the plaintiff, he ordered a rescheduling and instructed the plaintiff to summon Huang Yongchang to court for further questioning.

### Bei Runsheng's Bodyguard Li Jinlong Commits Suicide

Unskilled in Flattery and Losing Favor with the Young Master, Further Stimulated and Committed Suicide

Li Jinlong, from Shandong, was 45 years old and worked as a bodyguard at the home of wealthy businessman Bei Runsheng, a Suzhou native, at No. 5 Baogongfang, Beiler Road, French Concession. He served as a gatekeeper and has been working for more than ten years. His home is at No. 38 Daodeli, Beile Road. His wife, Zhang, is 45 years old and from the same hometown as Li. They have a son, Gengrong, who is 7 years old.

By nature, he was bold and straightforward.

Serving in the Bei family, he was not good at flattery. Recently, he was treated coldly by the second young master because he was played with by his colleagues in front of the master, which made Li depressed. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Li returned home after leaving Bei's house. He saw that his wife Zhang was not at home. He asked his neighbors and learned that his seven-year-old son, Gengrong, had been lost while playing outside, and his wife was looking for him outside. Li learned the above situation and

Felt Stimulated

Sat in the room in a daze, speechless. Then, he took the cage out of the cage, threw it on the ground, and trampled the bird to death with his feet. In an instant, Li's wife, Zhang, found her son and returned home. Seeing Li's appearance, she knew that he must be upset and did not talk to him. Unexpectedly, Li had a moment of short-sightedness. He got up and went out. His wife was afraid that something would happen and followed him. He saw Li go straight to the master

Bei Runsheng's House

Zhang didn't take it seriously and went home to cook lunch. Unexpectedly, after Li arrived at Bei's house, he took the pistol he carried in his duties, went to the garden, and fired a shot at his right temple, committing suicide. The bullet entered his brain and he fell into a pool of blood. At that time, no one noticed. After half an hour, the servants of the Bei family suddenly did not see Li's trail and searched everywhere, and only then

In the Garden

Found Li lying wounded on the lawn in a pool of blood, couldn't help but be shocked, ran to tell the master, and reported to the French Patrol House by telegram, and immediately summoned an ambulance to rush to the scene and sent Li to Guangci Hospital, because the injury was in a critical part, it was too late to rescue him upon arrival at the hospital, he died of his breath. The Patrol House was notified, and the investigator investigated the cause of the death. One side sent the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch, waiting for the Second Special Court to send personnel for inspection today.

### Private Electricity Industry Federation Holds Diesel Users Meeting

Plans to Form a Consumer Cooperative and First Set Up a Preparatory Office. Presume Shen Sifang and Other 25 People as Preparatory Committee Members

The National Private Electricity Industry Federation held a diesel user meeting yesterday to discuss the organization of a consumer cooperative and the establishment of a preparatory committee. The preparatory office will be set up in the Shanghai Communication Office of the Electricity Industry Federation to plan and proceed. The details are as follows:

Number of Attendees

The number of promoters who attended included dozens of people such as Shen Sifang, Yu Qihan, Wu Shuying, Ye Yangwu (Tom Chengxin representative), and Han Yimin.

Chairman's Report

Shen Sifang was publicly elected as the chairman and Tom Chengxin recorded. First, the chairman reported on the reason for initiating the organization, roughly saying: "Since the two oil companies Asia and Meifu have been promoting diesel, the industry has seen it as cheap and simple, so they have switched from the original water-Ting engines to diesel engines as a substitute. However, the oil companies suddenly discovered that some people were using diesel to refine kerosene, so they had to deliberately increase the market price of diesel, and at the same time, they tightened sales quotas to crack down on it. I don't know that this policy is used by local managers, and diesel is regarded as a rare commodity. The daily needs of each power plant are often rejected, and it is comfortable and exhausted. The power plant is one of the national public utilities, and its responsibility is huge. If a proper plan is not made early, it will inevitably suffer great difficulties one day when the situation is urgent. Therefore, we initiated the establishment of a consumer cooperative to unite all power plants that use diesel as fuel and act in unison to seek a satisfactory solution." Then, Yu Qihan, Wu Shuying, Tom Chengxin, etc. reported,

Business Plan

As for the surplus income in the cooperative, it will be proportionally divided according to the amount of transactions made by the members in the cooperative.

Resolutions

(1) Publicly elected Shen Sifang and Tom Chengxin as the main and deputy directors of the preparatory committee, and all the representatives present were members of the preparatory committee. (2) The address of the meeting will be temporarily set up in the Shanghai Communication Office of the Electricity Industry Federation. (3) Hire experienced people to guide everything.

### Water Rats' Life

Specializing in Stealing from Foreign Merchant Ships, Da Baozi and Others Will Eventually Escape the Law

Ji Thief Da Baozi is a Haizhou native who usually dresses up as a worker and specializes in prying open rooms on foreign merchant ships to steal property. He has a large number of followers, all living what they call the "water rat life." They have committed numerous crimes and have been dealt with by the authorities of the Chinese Concession more than ten times. After being unable to gain a foothold in Shanghai, they sneaked to Hong Kong to use their old tricks, and settled in two places, Xianghai Street and Yuanmao Street in Hong Kong. Recently, several of his accomplices committed crimes in Hong Kong and were imprisoned. With the wind tightening, Da Baozi and a few others had no choice but to sneak back to Shanghai to avoid the storm. However, due to the pressure of life, they colluded with four or five accomplices again on the afternoon of the 7th and 8th, took a boat to the British HAttunrgals berthed in Puxin, Yangshupu, pretended to be working, and took advantage of the crew's lunch to steal a telescope worth 300 yuan and a silver watch worth 20 yuan from the captain's room. They went ashore and fled. Da Baozi and others were greedy and insatiable for the theft of the ship. On the next day (19th) noon, they increased their party by three members and still went to the Xizai room door of the ship to pry the lock to open the door. It happened that the Xizai arrived and several criminals held up umbrellas to avoid the sight. Their contact skills were extremely agile and adaptable. The Xizai was questioned the day after the theft, and the bandits saw that things were exposed, so they got off the ship and fled. Three people, including Da Baozi, He Bingsheng, and Kong Zhaofa, were arrested on the spot and reported to the Customs Water Patrol House, and then sent detectives Wang Haiquan and Shi Ajin to take them back to confess that they had done this magic dozens or hundreds of times. A telescope worth 40 yuan was recovered at a pawnshop in Hongkou. After two days of chasing and arresting the remaining party members, they were not caught, and it was decided to send them to the local court today for questioning.

### Fire at Jihuatang Pharmacy Claims One Life

Other Employees Safe and Sound

The Jihuatang Pharmacy on Yunnan Road caught fire on the night before last at 11:45 PM. The fire originated in the rear buildings, causing extensive damage. Upon receiving the alarm, all fire engines from the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and worked tirelessly to extinguish the blaze. The fire was discovered only five minutes prior. However, by then, the fire had already spread rapidly, far beyond expectations. As reported yesterday, only six people were rescued. The whereabouts of the other employees were unknown, leading to fears of a tragic outcome. However, by yesterday morning, firefighters searching through the debris found only one body under a bed on the upper floor of number 47. After identification, it was confirmed to be Gu Benjun, a 19-year-old apprentice from Zhenjiang employed at the pharmacy. No other bodies were found, indicating that the remaining employees had safely escaped the fire. The estimated value of the stock was 200,000 yuan, with a fire insurance coverage of 110,000 yuan. The cause of the fire is suspected to be an electrical fault, and the police are conducting a thorough investigation.

### Ningbo Native Association Writes to Fish Market Requesting a Branch at Xiaodongmen

Expressing Fishermen's Suffering and Requesting Improvements

The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai sent a letter yesterday to the board of directors of the Shanghai Fish Market, stating: "We are writing to you based on a letter from Lou Guren and He Jiong, representatives of the Dinghai County Fishermen's Association, which states, 'The establishment of the Shanghai Fish Market was originally intended to promote Premier Sun's industrial plan. However, the relief of the fishing industry and the adjustment of production and sales are also essential principles. Since its establishment, the suffering felt by fishermen has become undeniable. We would like to briefly explain this and hope for your consideration: ❶ The unsuitable location of the fish market has resulted in weak sales. In the past, fish boats arriving in Shanghai would sell out in two days. Now, it takes five days. During these three extra days, the fish lose freshness, the cost of ice and salt increases, and the boat's expenses amount to dozens of yuan per day. Those who used to return to the fishing grounds two days later must now delay for three days. Consider the annual losses, and the numbers are staggering. ❷ Fish prices are unregulated and depend solely on supply and demand. Currently, supply exceeds demand, sales are sluggish, and prices are falling. The lack of freshness further contributes to the price decline, severely impacting the livelihoods of fishermen. ❸ Ice-preserved fish in barrels benefit from quick sales. Traditionally, they were sold immediately upon arrival. Now, they must be transferred from the docks to the fish market and can only be sold the next day. Despite the increased ice costs, it is difficult to maintain freshness. As a result, the business of barrel merchants in Dinghai has decreased by two-thirds compared to previous years. ❹ The number of fish vendors has gradually decreased due to various reasons. This is a definite fact. The imbalance between supply and demand is intensifying. Even those still in the trade must add the cost of transportation to the price of the fish, which effectively raises the cost of living for Shanghai's three million residents. The above points are just a brief overview. We are not criticizing the fish market but standing with the fishermen, we must emphasize the advantages and disadvantages in order to promote adoption. After discussion by our association, we believe that establishing a fish market branch at Xiaodongmen is a necessary requirement to benefit society and the people. Most importantly, the spring fishing season is approaching, and little yellow croaker boats are heading out to sea. If no measures are taken immediately, the production will increase, but the sales will be limited, and the catch will be useless. The little yellow croaker season is short, and production is high. Within twenty days, the catch of Dinghai alone will be over 200,000 dan (a unit of weight). After deducting the one-third sold in the province, the rest will be dumped in Shanghai. Compared to the current sales capacity of the fish market, it is impossible to handle such a large amount of fish, which will inevitably lead to a drastic drop in prices. Next year, the fishermen will be exhausted and unable to go to sea, which may lead to the collapse of the entire fishing industry. This is a crucial matter for the future of the nation. We were sent by the association as representatives to Shanghai to present the advantages and disadvantages to leaders from all walks of life. We also hope that your association will provide assistance to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of fishermen and benefit both the nation and the people.' Based on this, we hereby request that you investigate and respond promptly."

### Chinese Buddhist Association Amends Constitution to Resolve Issues

Having received these instructions, we have amended the association's constitution accordingly and instructed the eighth session of the joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors to revise and approve the organizational rules for branches, membership rules, and rules for electing representatives according to the provisions of the amended constitution. We are submitting all documents together and request that your ministries review them and provide instructions for compliance. This is a public matter.

### Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Guild Notice Refusing Adulterated Grains

In Response to the Request of the Oil Pressing Industry Guild

The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Trade Guild has issued a notice to its members, urging them to carefully receive and unload shipments due to the recent adulteration of soybeans with heavy mud and sand from various regions: "According to a letter from the Water City Oil Pressing Factory Trade Guild, 'The practice of adulterating soybeans with mud has been addressed to your guild before. If it is not rectified, it will severely affect the operations of our industry. Therefore, we are writing to you again to promptly develop effective methods to eliminate this malpractice.' We agree that as the market price of soybeans and other miscellaneous grains rises, vendors are trying to maximize profits through fraudulent means, such as adulterating with sand and soil. This practice is rampant, and our members are suffering losses. It has been resolved in our meeting that henceforth, the purchase and sale of soybeans and other miscellaneous grains must be handled with care, and vendors who excessively adulterate them with mud and sand should be refused. We will also send a letter to relevant organizations in the production areas, urging them to supervise farmers to rectify this practice locally. This is hereby notified for your information."

### Domestically Produced Electrical Appliances Expected to Increase Prices

Hu Xiyuan Discusses the Current Situation of the Industry

Hu Xiyuan, of the Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Trade Guild, told reporters yesterday that the guild is composed of domestically owned electrical appliance manufacturing factories. It is one of the industry guilds recently established by the Ministry of Industry. The addition of the word "manufacturing" is to distinguish it from commercial trade guilds. The guild is divided into ten groups, including motors, flashlights, light bulbs, and electric fans. Since the beginning of the year, members of each group have been very active, and new members are constantly joining, which is a positive sign for China's industrial sector. However, the prices of raw materials such as copper, iron, lead, and tin have been rising continuously, leading to increased production costs. Therefore, domestically produced electrical appliances are expected to increase prices in the near future.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (16)

Q: Mr. Liang Yanping from Guangzhou asks: Can a letter sent to a foreign country be re-sent back to the original sending location after arriving in that country (i.e., if a letter from Guangzhou to England is sent back to Guangzhou after arriving in England)? If it can be sent back, should the sender indicate this on the envelope, should additional postage be paid, and if so, how much? Also, after it is sent back, will it be delivered to the sender's address by the post office, or must the sender go to the post office to pick it up? If the latter, will the post office provide notification?

A: The question of whether a letter arriving in a foreign country can be re-sent back to the original sending location depends on whether the letter could not be delivered in the first place, or whether it was delivered as addressed and is being returned. The question is somewhat unclear. If it refers to a letter that could not be delivered (e.g., the recipient refuses to accept it, the recipient's address cannot be found, the recipient has left the country, or moved elsewhere, etc.), then any letter sent to any country can be returned by the destination country to the originating country. When the originating country's post office receives it, if the sender's name and detailed address are on the envelope, it will be delivered accordingly without additional charges. If there is no sender's name and address, the post office will post a notice for one month. If no one claims it within one month, it will be sent to the designated undeliverable mail office for processing. As for letters that have already been delivered as addressed or show signs of having been opened after delivery, if they are to be returned to the original sending location, the recipient must affix stamps according to the local international postage rates and treat it as a newly posted item. For example, a letter from England to Guangzhou weighing no more than twenty grams requires an additional stamp of one and a half pence.

Furthermore, for letters sent to various countries, before they have been delivered to the recipient, the sender may apply to the original post office to withdraw the letter according to the prescribed procedures. For details, inquire at the local post office. However, letters sent to the United Kingdom and its territories cannot be withdrawn once they have left the jurisdiction of the Chinese postal service.

Q: Mr. Jian from Shanghai asks: ❶ The domestic postage for ordinary letters is five cents for every twenty grams. If the letter weighs less than twenty grams, is it still five cents? If it weighs twenty-one grams, should one dime be paid? Is the difference of nineteen grams considered a voluntary waiver by the sender? ❷ For third-class bulk newspapers, each bundle must contain at least fifty copies. According to the postage rates, if each copy weighs ninety-eight grams, the entire bundle only needs to be stamped with five cents. If each bundle only contains twenty-five copies, and the sender is willing to pay five cents, can it be accepted according to the example above of a letter weighing less than twenty grams but being charged as twenty grams?

A: ❶ The standard for calculating letter postage is based on units of twenty grams. Any fraction less than twenty grams is calculated as twenty grams. Therefore, letters exchanged between post offices, not exceeding twenty grams or forty grams, require stamps of one dime. The rest can be deduced by analogy. ❷ The conditions for constituting third-class bulk newspapers are detailed in Question and Answer No. 8. Having at least fifty copies per bundle is one of the conditions. Newspapers with fewer than fifty copies do not meet the specified conditions and cannot be posted as third-class newspapers.

### Grand Opening of China Trading Company

### Robbery on Damuqiao Road Leads to Victim's Death

On the 13th of this month, Huang Runzhou (24 years old), a native of Pudong who worked at Huie Bank in Shanghai, was robbed at his home at No. 458 Damuqiao Road, in the new southern district of Shanghai. Six robbers speaking the Anhui dialect broke into his house by digging a hole in the wall from a vacant house next door and sneaking in. When Huang Runzhou shouted for help, he was shot once in the lower left abdomen, and the bullet pierced his intestines and stomach. The robbers stole valuables and fled. Afterwards, Huang's family took the injured man to the Guangci Hospital on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession for treatment. However, his injuries were fatal, and he died yesterday morning due to excessive blood loss. The police station in charge received a report and immediately ordered the local bailiff to report it to the court for an autopsy. It was determined that he had died from a gunshot wound sustained during the robbery. The police will rigorously investigate and arrest the robbers and bring them to justice. The family has been instructed to prepare a coffin for burial.

### Jixi Fellow Villagers Association Held Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai Jixi Native Place Association held its 25th Joint Executive and Supervisory Committee meeting at 3 PM on March 20th. Chairman Cheng Kefan presided over the meeting with due ceremony. The following matters were discussed: ㊀ A letter from the Dunxu Hall in the South Gate of Jixi and a telegram on behalf of the Xuancheng Native Place Association regarding the case of Chen Yingshen (Hushan), a prison warden in Jixi, who, under the pretext of procuring railroad ties for the Ministry of Railways, was privately cutting down trees and planks from the ancestral graves and wooded areas of Xiaozi (Filial Son), intending to sell them for profit, requesting assistance. It was resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Anhui Higher Court, urging them to promptly remove and punish the Jixi prison warden as a means of relief. In addition, a telegram was sent to the Jixi County government, urging them to issue a public notice prohibiting the private felling of ancient trees and forests, and stipulating that no felling should be allowed without the unanimous consent of the owners. ㊁ A letter from the Anhui Native Place Association, announcing that Ambassador Xu would return to China and a public banquet would be held at the Atlantic Hotel on the 22nd of this month, inviting participation. It was resolved to comply. ㊂ Regarding the association's financial difficulties, it was resolved to promptly collect outstanding dues and to print and distribute the report for the 25th year. The meeting adjourned with other minor matters briefly discussed.

Circumstances Very Tragic

At approximately 7 AM yesterday, at the 102-kilometer mark between Wangdian and Jiaxing stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the body of a rural man, approximately three years old, was discovered on the tracks. He had apparently been run over by a train the previous night, with his head and feet separated in a gruesome sight. The Jiaxing station master immediately dispatched railway police to guard the scene and instructed the local bailiff to report the incident and seek out relatives of the deceased to come to the station to identify the body and coffin. If the deceased is found to be impoverished, the railway will provide 20 yuan as a gesture of compassion.

Ms. Xuejiu's landscape paintings are vigorous and follow the ancient styles, sweeping away the weak air of boudoir paintings. Ms. Jizhen's Western paintings are fresh and lively, full of natural charm. Ma Gongyu inscribed on Xuejiu's painting, "Good water, good mountains, with ink and brush. Her spirit overwhelms the male eyebrow, and light shines from the female headscarf." He inscribed on Jizhen's painting, "Captures the spirit vividly, skillful in depicting objects, masters Western methods, and possesses Eastern style." Wang Yachen, Wang Yiting, Yankechang, Liu Linsheng, and others also wrote inscriptions, expressing their admiration.

### Penguin Society and Qingying Society Jointly Hold Photo Exhibition

The joint photo exhibition of the Qingying Society and the Penguin Society, which opened yesterday, the 19th, on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company, has been exceptionally crowded with visitors. The two societies have contributed no less than 200 works, and their photographic techniques are also better than in previous exhibitions. The works are mostly able to express the most faithful realism. Among them, more than ten are colored, such as "Yang Feixu's Secluded Feelings," "Bell Milk Stalactites Competing for Beauty," Tan Zuomei's "Birds Tired of Flying Know to Return," etc., are all carefully crafted and very popular with most visitors. It is heard that the exhibition still has several days left, and the tickets are only two dimes.

### Publishing World

"Industrial and Commercial Beauty Selection" Collection Pre-Orders The second collection of the "Modern Chinese Industrial and Commercial Art Selection," compiled by the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Art Writers Association, contains 50 categories, with colored, monochrome, and copper images, totaling 160 pages and tens of thousands of words of commentary. More than 90 industrial and commercial art experts participated in the production. The actual price per book is 1.4 yuan, and the pre-order price is 9 dimes. An additional dime is charged for registered mail for out-of-town orders. It has been noted in this newspaper that since the pre-order for the collection began on March 10th, more than 640 copies have been pre-ordered from Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, and other places, as well as from this port. It is heard that the cost of compiling and printing each copy of the collection is 1.2 yuan. During the pre-order period, the low price is purely for the sake of promoting industrial and commercial art, even at a sacrifice.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the area around Shandong is cloudy but mostly clear, with drifting sand and strong southwest to north winds. The Yangtze River basin is cloudy, with some areas clear, and with strong southwest to southeast winds. The East China Sea has gentle cyclones, rain, or fog, caused by a small low pressure system passing through Fujian and moving northeast-east. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 54.7 degrees, and the lowest was 42.1 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 54.9 degrees, and the lowest was 24.3 degrees.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Junshan

Reasons for the Evolution of Modern Politics.

There are three main reasons for the evolution of modern politics:

㊀ Emergency Measures for Special Changes - Internal Troubles - Class Struggle; Foreign Threats! - National Struggle.

㊁ Improving Work Efficiency - (1) Increased Specialization of Responsibility, (2) More Detailed Planning, (3) More Experience, (4) More Refined Technology, (5) Faster Time.

㊂ Eliminating the Harms of Checks and Balances - Dispersed Power - Counteracted Power - Prevented Power.

These three are the main reasons. There are many other reasons, and now I will explain these three main reasons separately:

The circumstances faced by various countries in recent times are very different from before. Any country has internal and external troubles from time to time, because the so-called class struggle now is internal trouble, and the so-called national struggle is external threat. These two forms constitute the emergency events of various countries today, so emergency measures are necessary. In the past, the regulations of democratic countries were: when an urgent special change occurred, the head of state was authorized by the group; but this is impossible today, because today's aspects, such as diplomacy, military affairs, culture, and economy, are constantly in struggle, not to mention politics. How can we authorize processing anytime, anywhere in this state of struggle anytime, anywhere? Therefore, countries understand this point and should prepare for struggle anytime, anywhere. What is the way? It is to get rid of the old problem of much discussion and little success, that is, to authorize one party, to authorize a leader of one party. This reason is the most important of the three reasons, because if the urgent requirements cannot be met, the country is in danger, society is chaotic, and there is no talk of anything else.

### Tragic Incident of Cutting Off a Sick Child's Finger Due to Superstition

Police File Charges of Abandoning a Corpse; Jiang Erqun and His Wife Still Trying to Shirk Responsibility

Jiang Zhang, the wife of Jiang Erqun, a rickshaw puller from Tongzhou, resides at No. 9, Lane 29, No. 1029, East Xihua Road. Recently, their newborn eight-month-old child, named Xiaogou, became critically ill. Prayers to the gods and medical treatment proved ineffective. There is a superstition among the people of Tongzhou that Jiang Zhang had previously given birth to two children who died one after another. She believed that this child was the reincarnation of a debtor and that the debt had to be broken with a ritual. At 7 PM on the 10th of this month, while Xiaogou was still alive, she agreed with her husband. She took a pair of scissors and cut off one of the child's right thumbs, causing a lot of bleeding, soaking his body. She wrapped it in straw paper with four dimes, summoned a beggar named Jia, and instructed him to take the child to the barren land of Gaolang Bridge and abandon him. However, after obtaining the money, the beggar actually abandoned the child next to a trash can in a nearby alley and fled. At 8:30 AM the next morning, Jiang Zhang passed by Kunming Road and suddenly saw that the child was not dead. Saddened by the sight, she picked him up and placed him in a sleeping bamboo basket to observe his condition. The incident was reported to the Huishan Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Li Zhaogeng to investigate and confirm the facts. The police took Jiang Zhang and her husband, along with the child, to the police station. The child was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital, where he soon died. The body was then taken to the corpse examination site on Feilun Road, where the prosecutor of the Special First Court confirmed that the cause of death of the child Xiaogou was illness and blood loss. Jiang Zhang and her husband were sent to the Third Criminal Court for interrogation and detained. Yesterday, Judge Jing Bianfen presided over the continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that in recent years, in the desolate and remote areas around Yangshupu Huishan, numerous abandoned infant corpses have been discovered, too many to count and impossible to investigate. They may be similar to the cruel and superstitious people like the two defendants. He filed a public prosecution based on Article 295 of the Criminal Law for abandoning a corpse, seeking severe punishment. When questioned, the defendants claimed that the child's right thumb was cut off by the beggar and pleaded for leniency. Judge Xiao ordered that they be remanded in custody separately, awaiting sentencing.

### Bank Rural Investment Inspired by the New Monetary System

— Mu Jie

——Total Liquidation of the 25th Year——

(1) Introduction

(2) An Overview of Investment

(3) Investment Statistics

(4) Reasons for Activity

(5) Review of Investment

(6) Conclusion

(1)

Since the formation of capital in the banking industry has led to urban expansion and rural decline, there has been a stream of bank funds irrigating the countryside. Of course, the unbalanced distribution of funds between urban and rural areas has resulted in an overabundance of cash in cities, with falling interbank lending rates and rampant speculation, while rural areas sometimes lack even a single yuan. Therefore, the ability of banks to return funds to rural areas is a wonderful way to diagnose the most serious pathology of rural decline - the depletion of funds.

But when did the banking industry's rural investment begin to show significant signs? Looking at the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, which were the earliest to invest in rural areas, the Bank of China's large-scale rural lending began in the 21st year (Note 1), and the Agricultural Cooperative Lending Department of the Shanghai Bank was established in the 22nd year (Note 2). Looking at the government's measures, after the Rural Reconstruction Committee, established in April of the 22nd year, sent a letter to the Shanghai financial community to provide relief to the countryside, the call for investing in rural areas swept the country for a time. Therefore, we can say that the 22nd year was the year when the banking industry officially established contact with rural areas, that is, the year when it openly invested in rural areas.

From the 22nd year to the 25th year, the history of the banking industry's investment in rural areas has been four years. Without asking what responsibilities it has fulfilled in terms of relieving the countryside, its position in rural finance is still very low. According to the Agricultural Information Report of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry (November of the 23rd year), bank loans account for an average of 2.4% of rural borrowing sources. Of course, this is not enough to explain the current status of the banking industry's rural investment in rural finance, but it can be asserted that it still does not have an important position.

However, since the implementation of the new monetary policy on November 3 of the 24th year, we can clearly see that the government intends to use it as the driving force for rural revitalization. The government not only gave the Farmers Bank of China the right to issue 100 million yuan of banknotes and the obligation to handle 50 million yuan of agricultural loans, but also vigorously encouraged commercial banks to invest in rural areas, and the joint lending funds of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank were also subscribed by various banks. Therefore, it can be predicted without any doubt that since the 25th year, the banking industry's rural investment will occupy an important position in rural finance due to the stimulation of the legal tender policy.

Because of the promotion of the government's legal tender policy mentioned above, the banking industry's rural investment in the 25th year was quite active. The 25th year was also a year of bumper harvests, and rural warehouses were built in various provinces, which required even more investment from the banking industry. Compared with the situation in previous years, there must be a leap forward. We will know by investigating the situation of the banking industry's rural investment in the first year after the legal tender travel - the 25th year.

(2)

Regarding the actual situation of investment, anyone who pays a little attention to newspapers and magazines knows that it is countless. In terms of region, which province, except for the too remote border provinces, does not have the irrigation of bank funds! In terms of the banks engaged in, which commercial, industrial, professional, or savings bank, apart from those specializing in agriculture, does not have at least some!

First, let's look at the Farmers Bank of China. Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, the bank has been specially approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue 100 million yuan of circulating notes, with half of them used for agricultural loans. The content of agricultural loans: First, the types of loans are divided into land mortgage loans and rural loans; the former should be based on rural land as a principle, and loans for improving soil and consolidating farmland are also included; the latter should pay special attention to the relief of owner-farmers and organized and sound cooperatives to invest funds. Second, agricultural loans should be handled in places with convenient transportation to establish agricultural warehouses to facilitate the transportation and sale of agricultural products. Third, promote agricultural bills to circulate farmers' funds. According to the loan amount published by the bank in late August of the 25th year, the total loan amount was 11,680,000 yuan, including 7,282,000 yuan for cooperative loans, 1,728,000 yuan for movable property mortgage loans, 2,293,000 yuan for agricultural warehouse loans, and 377,000 yuan for special loans. In the news in mid-December, the bank's rural cooperative loans were nearly 80 million yuan.

The Bank of China's rural investment has a history of five years, and the amount of rural loans in the 24th year accounted for about 6% of the various loans. The situation in the 25th year can be simply said to be an investment of 500,000 yuan in Henan Province to promote American cotton seeds, production loans in Jiangxi Province, production and marketing loans for tea, cotton, rice, wheat and other agricultural products in Anhui Province, 500,000 yuan of rural loans in Hunan Province, and 100,000 yuan of spring plowing and silkworm cocoon drying loans in Zhejiang Province, and a plan for agricultural warehouse investment of 10 million yuan. Although the Bank of China is a national chartered international exchange bank, it has a very strong commercial nature, so it is regarded as the representative of commercial banks.

From the above description, we can get a glimpse of the investment status in the 25th year, and other situations are also comprehensively introduced in the next chapter, which is omitted here. Now, let's describe two more organized and planned investment situations.

Because rural funding is declining day by day, the rural investment of various banks is not only a drop in the bucket, but also does not help, and each bank mostly operates independently, without an organization with a whole organization to engage in under a comprehensive plan, as a result, it still does not have much benefit for the countryside. Therefore, in order to achieve one of the goals of the new monetary system (relieving the countryside), the government specially established the Agricultural and Commercial Bank jointly with various banks to rescue the circulation of agricultural funds, adjust agricultural products, and develop the countryside. The funds of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank are divided into fixed, joint lending, and circulating funds. In addition to the fixed funds of 30 million yuan borne by the government, the joint lending funds of 30 million yuan and the indefinite amount of circulating funds are all subscribed by the banks. The joint lending funds are paid up in five years, and the 6 million yuan payable in the 25th year is borne by 30 banks, savings societies, and trust companies. The distribution is as follows: 12 with less than 50,000, 4 with 50,000 to 100,000, 9 with 100,000 to 500,000, and 5 with more than 500,000. The detailed numbers are as follows (unit: 10,000 yuan):

The loans of the Jiangzhe spring cocoon collection failure silver group, although it is said that the borrowers are manufacturers, directly benefit the cocoon farmers, and have a regulatory function for rural finance, and of course, it is also one of the rural investments. In the past, each bank carried out the loans for spring cocoon collection independently. In the 25th year, an organized and planned silver group was established to handle this matter. The participating banks include 19 major Shanghai banks such as China Communications Bank and Fuyuan Qianzhuang. The amount of loans was originally set at 30 million yuan, and the result was about 13 million yuan. Jiangsu Province accounted for 80% and Zhejiang Province accounted for 20%. In Zhejiang, because the Provincial Silkworm Silk Control Association borrowed another 5 million yuan from China Communications Bank to purchase the remaining cocoons, the amount was very small.

In short, there is no doubt that the banking industry's rural investment at the end of the 25th year was active, and the word active in front has this very good fact as its report. Now, in order to make the above more based, we will further sort out the investment situation statistically to the extent possible.

(3)

It is really difficult to sort out the banking industry's investment in rural areas in a statistical way and make it a systematic posture. First, most of the information on which this article is based is recorded in daily newspapers, but the same matter has great discrepancies before and after, and the reports of various newspapers are sometimes different, and it is difficult to judge the actual situation of some news. Second, the newspapers on which this article is based are only in Shanghai, and the information is not very rich, and those that cannot be used are also rejected. Therefore, only a simple sorting and analysis can be done as follows:

First of all, regarding the analysis of investment types and regions, this "type" is worth studying. First, if we talk about the process from farmers' cultivation, harvesting to sales, there are green seedlings, storage mortgage, and marketing loans; if we talk about the object of investment, there are loans for major agricultural products and sideline products; if we talk about the lending agencies, there are various cooperatives, agricultural loan offices, agricultural warehouses, and rural committee loans; if we talk about the realizability of the investment target; there are loans for movable property and immovable property; if we talk about the existence or absence of collateral, there are mortgage loans and credit loans. However, this is not an absolute classification. A certain type of loan can have two or more classifications. For example, agricultural product storage mortgage loans in agricultural warehouses can be regarded as mortgage loans, agricultural product loans, movable property loans, or storage mortgage loans. Second, if we say that rural investment is divided into land mortgage loans and rural loans (Note 3), then there are very few banks operating land mortgage loans now, and all loans can be classified into rural loans, which is too complicated. The investment types in the table below are filled in according to what is recorded in the newspaper, and are not completely classified according to the first method.

Secondly, the statistics on investment amount, period, and interest rate can be divided into two forms, one with complete period and interest rate, and one with only the name of the loan and the bank. In the table below, ‰o represents the monthly interest rate, and % represents the annual interest rate.

From the above two totals added together, the rural investment in the 25th year has been 57 million yuan, but this is not enough to see the amount of rural investment in the 25th year. Now I will try to estimate it.

According to the agricultural bank loans recorded in the Bank Yearbook (25th year), the most should be the Farmers Bank of China, followed by the Soviet Farmers Bank, and other agricultural banks account for a very small amount, which will be omitted here. The various loans of China Farmers in the 24th year were 25,780,000 yuan, about twice as much as in the 23rd year, so the increase in the 25th year is also considered to be within two times, which should be 50 million yuan, but the Ministry of Finance stipulates that 50 million yuan of circulating notes should be used for agricultural loans, so it should be a number of 100 million yuan (the above statement has nearly 80 million yuan of loans). The loans of Su Farmers in the 24th year were 10,350,000 yuan, an increase of 30% compared with the 23rd year. The increase in the 25th year is also considered to be 30%, which should be 13.5 million yuan. The investment of various commercial banks is estimated based on the reports of various banks. It was 50 million yuan in the 23rd year and 65 million yuan in the 24th year. The increase in the 24th year was 30% higher than that in the 23rd year, so it should be 84.5 million yuan in the 25th year. Estimated in this way, the banking industry's rural investment in the 25th year should be 198 million yuan. Try to list it again as follows: (unit: 1,000 yuan)

The authenticity of this number will be left to the proof of the facts.

(4)

Whether from the overview of investment or the statistics of investment, it is enough to prove the activity of rural investment in the 25th year. Now analyze the reasons for its activity.

(1) For the banking industry's investment in rural areas, the previous few years were just a plan to expand business and solve the way out for funds, which was completely a risky trial business. But unexpectedly, almost all of the loaned funds can be recovered, with only a small part extended, and the stipulated monthly interest rate for loans is 1%, which can also be determined according to local conditions (see the Shanghai Bank Agricultural Loan Regulations). The profit is certainly not as rich and easy to obtain as speculation, but it is quite superior to general investment, and the degree of safety is very high. Therefore, in the past, only one or two banks operated, and now other banks have also invested in rural areas one after another as a way to expand business, solve the way out for funds, and obtain profits. What's more, it can win the good reputation of following government laws and regulations and sponsoring government relief in rural areas!

(2) Articles 7 and 8 of the Savings Bank Law promulgated by the government in the 23rd year stipulate that the pledge loans of savings banks to rural cooperatives and the loans with agricultural products as collateral shall not be less than one-fifth of the total amount of deposits. There are very few banks specializing in savings business now, but all major commercial banks have savings departments, which are also regarded as savings banks according to the interpretation of the law. Therefore, even though the original intention of each bank to establish a savings department is not because the nature of savings banks is suitable for investing in rural areas, each bank has to operate it because of the constraints of laws and regulations. The banking industry invests in rural areas for its own interests and seeks to comply with laws and regulations, which is not without the enlightenment of laws and regulations; and the activity of investment in the 25th year is not without the effect of laws and regulations in addition to other reasons.

(3) In recent years, the construction of agricultural warehouses in various places has also been an end of the government's relief in rural areas. In the 25th year, the trend of establishing agricultural warehouses was really surging. On the one hand, it is one of the key points to relieve the countryside, and on the other hand, because the agricultural investment of banks in rural areas has been handled with excellent results and they are happy to invest, the source of construction funds is not very difficult. Therefore, they were established one after another. In addition, the 25th year was also a year of bumper harvests. Under the slogan of preventing low grain prices from hurting farmers, the construction of agricultural warehouses was particularly necessary, and therefore the demand for funds was even more urgent. - The establishment of agricultural warehouses has its own reasons, but the promotion of construction by banks' willingness to invest, and the promotion of banks' investment by the establishment of agricultural warehouses, are at least somewhat related. - Therefore, it is also an element of the active rural investment of the banking industry in the 25th year.

This is in terms of the achievements of bank investment, the regulations of laws and regulations, and the construction of agricultural warehouses. If we talk about the impact of the implementation of the new monetary policy and other reasons, then:

Obviously, the government's new monetary policy has had a considerable impact. Because since the new monetary system implemented by the government on November 3 of the 24th year stipulated that the exchange notes of the three national chartered banks, Central, China, and Communications, were issued centrally as legal tender, the profits of issuing exchange notes of the banks that had the right to issue exchange notes before were deprived. This is one of them.

The new monetary policy not only deprived commercial banks of the profits of issuing exchange notes, but also gave the three banks of Central, China, and Communications the unlimited right to buy and sell foreign exchange. Therefore, the foreign exchange business of various commercial banks was of course greatly affected. Moreover, due to the reason that the three banks have unlimited buying and selling of foreign exchange, the speculation of foreign exchange has been banned invisibly. This is the second.

Following this major reform, in February of the 25th year, the government used unified government bonds to exchange old bonds and used a part of the reconstruction government bonds as a fund to balance the bond market. Therefore, the speculative activities that could make a lot of profit in an instant, which used to be the main business of various banks, became difficult to speculate due to the stable market price after the exchange. Therefore, whether from the perspective of capital operation or profit acquisition, it always suffered the greatest loss. This is the third.

Speaking only of speculation, not only government bonds and foreign exchange cannot be speculated, but also the Shanghai standard gold, which has the title of the world's largest speculation, is also banned invisibly because the new currency value is separated from the silver price and there is no connection. In addition, although there is a policy of preparing for the establishment of real estate banks in the new monetary policy, the real estate industry, which was attacked by the economic panic, is still sluggish, and this way of speculation is also impossible. This is the fourth.

It is difficult to say that a few percent or a few dozen percent of these four reasons promoted the banking industry's advancement of rural investment, but speaking from the fact that the scope of business (referring to improper business) is gradually narrowed, the operation of funds is difficult, and the source of profit is cut off, the above four reasons are undoubtedly the factors that the banking industry's rural investment was active in the 25th year in order to expand the business scope, solve the way out for funds, and seek the source of profit.

(5)

The banking industry's rural investment in the 25th year was not only active, but also had very strict regulations on the method of lending in order to ensure the safety of funds. Let's review the situation in this year:

There are precise restrictions on the use of funds. For example, in the loan method signed by the Bank of China and the Hunan Provincial Construction Department. The use of credit loans is limited to the purchase of seeds, fertilizers, livestock, other necessities for operating agriculture, and equipment for transportation, sales or refining, and other things needed for agricultural production.

There is an appropriate allocation for the use of funds. For example, the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Warehouse Loan Method of the Farmers Bank of China stipulates that the construction or repair of warehouse buildings shall not exceed 60% of the total cost of labor and materials; the purchase of processing equipment shall not exceed 70% of the total cost. For example, the Qicha production loan of China Communications Bank is particularly detailed; it stipulates that each box of refined tea shall not exceed 25 yuan, the first phase shall prepay 5 yuan per box as a prepaid tea worker, and purchase firewood, charcoal and box materials, the second phase shall be 8 yuan to 12 yuan for the purpose of purchasing tea making tools, etc., and the third phase shall be 9 yuan to 11 yuan for the purpose of paying wages.

Looking at the lending method, it can be divided into: 1. Cooperate with the Rural Cooperative Committee or the Construction Department, invest in cooperatives, 2. Cooperate with local governments or local banks, invest in agricultural warehouses or agricultural products, etc., 3. Directly run it yourself or lend to local governments to run it. However, in order to ensure the safety of loans, there is a trend of increasing the responsibility of cooperative agencies in the 25th year. For example, the main points of the 16 articles of the adjustment of cooperative loan methods negotiated by Su Nong and the Construction Department are: When a cooperative borrows from the bank, it should be introduced by the cooperative instructor in charge, and the bank directly lends to the cooperative, it should notify the cooperative instructor afterwards; however, the cooperative instructor should review the agricultural loan in advance and sign the opinion, and be responsible for the use and safety of the loan.

Looking at the situation of loans from various banks in the same province, there is a trend of district activities. For example, the principles of the agricultural warehouse loan specially agreed by various banks in Anhui Province stipulate that the China Banking Group is responsible for 24 counties such as Qimen Fengyang, the Bank of China is responsible for 12 counties such as Xuancheng Dangtu, and the Farmers Bank of China is responsible for 12 counties such as Wuhu Hefei. The same is true in Zhejiang.

However, this state is the progress of the banking industry's own investment methods. It is difficult to say how much actual benefit it has for farmers. The bank authorities may think that it is perfect, while the farmers may think that this restriction is difficult. And aren't the bank's regulations still set up for the safety of their own funds! There is nothing wrong with the bank having various restrictions for the safety of investing funds, but it is not difficult to imagine the feelings of the farmers. Let's talk about the district investment again. Isn't it just to avoid investment competition between each other (in prosperous areas)! Where is the benefit for the farmers? Let's look at the interest rate of the loan:

According to the previous statistics, the highest monthly interest rate is 1%, the lowest is 8%, the highest annual interest rate is 1%, and the lowest is 9%. On the banking side, it can be said that it is already very low. However, in reality, the lowest interest rate that farmers can enjoy is 1.2% per month, the highest is 1.8%, and 1.5% is even more common. For example, the provisional measures for Qicha loans of China Communications Bank stipulate that the monthly interest rate is 8%, and the interest rate for cooperatives to transfer goods to their members shall not exceed 4% of the original loan interest rate to the cooperative (that is, it shall not exceed 1.2% per month). The monthly interest rate for miscellaneous movable property mortgage loans of Zhejiang Local Bank is 1.5% (according to the bank's report, including custody fees, etc.). The monthly interest rate in the agricultural cooperative grain mortgage method set by the Fujian Rural Cooperative Committee is 1.7%. The interest rate of the farmer mortgage loan office established by China Farmers Bank in Wuhu, Anhui Province is 1.5%, plus 3% for custody, totaling 1.8%. We can only say that this monthly interest rate of 1.5% to 1.7% is lower than that of high-interest loans, but if compared with the highest monthly interest rate of 1% and the lowest annual interest rate of 9% in the above statistics, wouldn't this be regarded as a high-interest loan?

The benefits that farmers can receive from bank fund irrigation are as mentioned above. Now, in terms of the investment area, there is still a concentrated situation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, followed by Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi, and then Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan provinces. Although the three southeastern provinces are the most declining in rural areas, they are rich areas. Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi have greatly increased cotton production in recent years. No wonder bank funds are attacking!

(6)

In short, the banking industry's rural investment after the implementation of the new monetary policy is of course an epoch-making year in the 25th year compared with the past situation. For commercial banks, due to the improvement of the monetary and banking system, improper business is gradually being banned or voluntarily abandoned, making a normal expansion in order to stabilize their foundation. There is no doubt that investing in rural areas is the current normal expansion. For farmers banks, the government's monetary policy promotes land mortgage and agricultural loans with 50 million yuan of circulating notes. Speaking from the investment process of farmers banks, it is a leap forward. - For example, in terms of the allocation of investment amount, commercial banks accounted for about 28% in the 23rd year and about 36% in the 24th year, accounting for the largest part, while in the 25th year, it has accounted for 57% (according to the aforementioned estimate).

The situation in the 25th year is like this. If we make a prediction for the 26th year, there will be at least a normal development. For example, it is reported that China Communications Bank will double the number of loans that were loaned last year - 8 million yuan for the Bank of China and 3 million yuan for the China Communications Bank. However, for the interest rate of the loan and the investment area, the former hopes to be reduced again, and there should be a maximum restriction on the interest rate of the transfer agency; the latter hopes to develop evenly in all provinces and regions.

The information on which this article is based is not rich, and the author is ignorant. The statistics in the third section may be too simple, the estimation may be inaccurate, the analysis of the reasons in the fourth section may be inappropriate, and the review of the investment in the fifth section is only based on the investment itself. I hope the readers will understand.

The Bond Market Fluctuated Sharply Last Week

A Sudden Prosperity on the Silent Trading Floor

A Vigorous Market Situation is Quite Rare

The government bond market last week, after a long period of hovering, suddenly fluctuated sharply, and the market situation suddenly soared. At the beginning of the week, because the bulls and bears held each other, the market price still rose and fell by only a few cents in the dullness. By Thursday, there were suddenly favorable rumors, and the market atmosphere suddenly became excited. The financial community absorbed it like bees, and then the gold industry and yarn cloth gangs also raised it fiercely. The silent trading floor changed into a vigorous market situation, and the market price stepped up sharply, and each bond repeatedly created new highs and exceeded the 70 yuan mark. The prosperous state is quite rare. Although the trend has reached its peak, there is no sign of fatigue due to the strong support of the people and the stability of the situation. There are only two days of trading left in this month's futures. Under the consolidated strength of the bulls in the boom market, there is a great risk of squeezing the short position in the future. The whole week's experience is as follows. The trading floor was extremely silent on Monday, and large investors were nowhere to be seen. The market price hovered by only a few cents. The trend to Guangdong became more and more sluggish on Monday. There was a lot of absorption on the 4th, but the market situation still did not rise or fall. The confrontation between the bulls and bears was even stronger on Wednesday, and the dullness had not yet been lifted. In the early morning of Thursday, the market situation was still chaotic and inconsistent. Until the after-market, due to favorable rumors, the 10.77.34 and other generations of the financial community rose to buy, and the market price suddenly soared by more than one yuan. On Friday, there was a decline in the early market due to the emergence of retail investors. However, due to the strong popularity, the 4.11.5 and other generations of the gold and yarn gangs absorbed vigorously. The unified bonds all soared again by one yuan to one yuan and a half. The upward trend did not diminish on Saturday. The 4.43 and other retail investors emerged to sell, but the 11.50 and others still had a large number of purchases. The market price still rose by half a yuan, the E species rebounded by one yuan, and the gold leader rose by two yuan. The 96 broke through the 10 yuan mark due to the purchase of 14.50 and 5. The result of the whole week was that all soared by 3 yuan, 5 cents to 3 yuan, 6 cents and a half, and the A species and the gold leader rose by 2 yuan and 2 yuan, 4 cents and a half. The total number of transactions was 53,660,000 yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

American Cotton Market Watch

Indian and British Cotton Continue to Fall

Yesterday, American cotton opened with mixed market conditions. Prices for various months fell by six points or rose by one point. Soon after, trading firms bought near-month contracts, and market prices recovered. Opinions on government actions were highly divided. Later, much had to be settled. The market encountered buying from Wall Street, and the closing was strong. Spot prices rose by five points, and futures prices rose by one to eight points. British cotton spot prices fell by nine points, and futures prices fell by nine to ten points. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying from trading firms and bullish positions, but later fell due to profit-taking by long positions and a weak stock market. Bengal fell by 3.5 to 3.75 rupees, Oomra fell by 3.5 to 4.25 rupees, and Broach fell by 3.75 to 4.25 rupees. (Recorded by telegraph, 20th)

According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 22nd: Broach at 244 rupees, Oomra at 233 rupees, both up 3.5 rupees; Bengal at 195.25 rupees, up 3.25 rupees.

Owners of Inferior Rice Lower Prices to Unload

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various regions surged in, totaling over sixty firms, with a total of 12,120 piculs of goods arriving. Among them, inferior rice accounted for nearly fifty firms. As a result, those with inferior rice felt disheartened, and merchants were wary in the early market. Sellers had no choice but to lower prices to unload. Initially, merchants from Xi'an made moves, followed by those from Qingdao. Consequently, a total of over 4,000 bags of inferior rice were sold, and prices fell by half a dime. Although the arrival of thick japonica rice was limited, stores in rural towns initially did not take it in, and prices still fell by one dime. Only Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan Lai rice, due to their scarcity, could still maintain their prices, but the situation already showed signs of weakening.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about thirty ships arrived from various regions downstream. The market for various goods was slow, with prices for white japonica rice falling by a small fraction of a dime to one dime. Inferior rice also softened by five to six cents. The price of Yang Du Bu Xian rice also weakened. Ke Jian and Heping rice sold well in small quantities, and prices remained firm. All other goods showed signs of weakening.

### Spring on the Battlefield

— (Yan Chonglou)

Spring has come to the world, but the battlefield sees no spring. The battlefield's dark sky does not shine with warm sunlight; the battlefield's dense clouds do not reveal clear skies; the battlefield's howling winds do not bring a hint of gentle intoxication; the battlefield's miles of flat sand do not sprout tender green shoots, let alone red peach blossoms or swaying green willows. On the battlefield, only the sound of bugles is heard, not the songs of orioles or the chirping of swallows. The soldiers on the battlefield spend their days lying in muddy trenches, firing guns and using bullets, working hard with their hands and feet, not thinking about spring outings or picnics. Spring does not come to this border battlefield, but they must go to that border battlefield where there is no spring. Do they not love this beautiful spring? Do they want to abandon this bright spring?

No, they also know how lovely spring is, but they feel that now is not the time to enjoy it. This spring still contains many painful histories! Look, those compatriots cannot return home! Those lands have been seized by others to cultivate! And if our compatriots do not know how to invigorate themselves, and instead indulge in the embrace of spring, this great land will be completely lost to the enemy! Therefore, the soldiers on the battlefield do not hesitate to sacrifice their flesh and blood bodies and fight desperately with the enemy, sacrificing for the freedom of the entire nation. They want to wrest our own spring from the enemy's hands.

The battlefield sees no spring; spring is only deeply hidden in the hearts of the soldiers.

### Wax Tigers by the Mekong River

— Jun Yi

In the eyes of local hunters in Southeast Asia, wax tigers are simply regarded as treasures among beasts. Often, obtaining a wax tiger can provide a comfortable life for several months without having to hunt in the mountains. These wax tigers mostly appear in the area of ​​Arra Sueed on the northern bank of the Mekong River. Due to over-hunting in recent years, they have gradually become scarce.

The shape of the wax tiger is similar to that of a regular tiger, but its body is slightly smaller. There is a type of wax tree here, and their only food is the raw wax on the trees. Because these trees are thirty to forty feet tall, when wax tigers climb to the top of the tree to forage, they occasionally fall straight down from the tall tree if they are not careful. Strangely, they never faint or get injured as a result. Once they fall to the ground, they lose consciousness and fall into a deep sleep. Even if there are loud noises nearby, they will not wake up. They gradually wake up after about an hour. Hunters often take advantage of their sleeping opportunity to capture them effortlessly, but some spend many days guarding under the wax trees and get nothing. Naturally, it depends on the hunter's luck.

The most valuable things on a wax tiger are its gall bladder and skin. The gall bladder, after being soaked in medicinal water, can cure all kinds of bruises and injuries. In the past, doctors in Southeast Asia often traveled to the homes of hunters to buy them, and each gall bladder was worth as much as three to four hundred gold coins. Even local hunters, if they accidentally fought with wild animals and were injured, could apply this gall bladder water and recover quickly. Unfortunately, in recent years, hunters have been blinded by greed and sell fake goods, so sales have gradually decreased. As for tiger skins, they are used to make vests, which are worn close to the body and can resist bullets. Therefore, a tiger skin can also be bought for about a hundred gold coins!

### Pink Envelope

— Zhu Ying

"Pink envelope," was a female colleague of mine. Although she was not a graduate of a famous school that specializes in cultivating social butterflies, and she did not possess the beauty worthy of wearing a queen's crown, she was still a high school graduate, and she still possessed the lines and contours that a young woman should have. Therefore, when she first arrived, many colleagues were quite enamored with her. However, because of her lack of smiles and icy demeanor, everyone's excitement cooled down.

This was a young woman who had graduated and come to work three years ago. It was said that she was still a maiden with no suitor. But what surprised me was that since she came to work, except for Sundays, among the large pile of letters that the postman delivered every morning, there was always a pink letter addressed to this woman. On the envelope, besides the address written in ink and her name, there was only the surname of the sender. But the strength of the handwriting was obviously from a man's hand. Sometimes, although this pink letter did not arrive in the morning, it would arrive promptly at 2:30 in the afternoon. After three or four months of this, everyone gradually began to pay attention. Although no one had the courage to secretly open it and peek at the secret, it was undoubtedly a love letter filled with honey-like sweetness. Therefore, some busybodies gave this woman a nickname, "Pink Envelope." When referring to her behind her back, everyone unanimously abolished the title of Miss and called her Pink Envelope.

Year after year, the delivery of pink letters could be said to have never been interrupted. Although no one ever knew who was sending the pink letters, everyone had an inexplicable envy for the sender. And on weekends, everyone who went to the park, watched movies, or went to the dance hall, kept an eye out, wanting to discover her whereabouts and catch a glimpse of the true face of the Pink Envelope's lover. But the result was nothing. Therefore, Pink Envelope became a mysterious puzzle among colleagues.

However, just three months ago, the delivery of pink letters had only stopped for half a month, when Pink Envelope suddenly resigned. Everyone thought that her love had matured and she was getting married. Unexpectedly, a week after she resigned, news suddenly came that this woman was involved in a pink lawsuit. It was said that the other party had been pursuing her for three years, that the number of love letters had reached one thousand, and that several kinds of relationships had occurred in between. As a result, it was discovered that her lover was actually a married man and the father of three children. During the lawsuit, she further presented evidence that she was still under the age of twenty.

Although this lawsuit was delayed for more than two months, it was finally settled under certain conditions. But to what extent has the Pink Envelope faded?

### Rats Eat Cats

— Nuoxia (Cowardly Hero)

Recently, the "Domestic News" section of this newspaper published a piece of news about "rats eating cats" in Lin'an, Zhejiang, which was quite amusing. This reminded me of a similar incident that I had previously encountered in Guangzhou. Now I will write it down to join in the fun. The fact is this:

In the Wuxiandong area of ​​Guangzhou, there was a general store. Every two or three days, a bundle of loaches would go missing. At first, the shop owner thought that the employees were stealing them to sell, but there was no evidence, so he did not say anything. Later, after closing the shop, he spied from the cracks in the floor upstairs. After everyone had fallen asleep, he suddenly saw a black rat as big as a pig jump onto the counter, stand up, drag away a hanging bundle of loaches, and escape. After several observations, he realized that it was coming in from the water pit in the kitchen. The nest was in a hole under an old city wall nearby. The shop owner could not catch it, so he offered a reward. Anyone who brought their cat and could kill the rat would be given fifty dollars, and he would be willing to pay two hundred dollars to buy his cat. Before long, a Tanka (a boat dweller) led a male cat weighing about thirteen pounds that looked like a tiger to respond. Who knew that that night, the huge cat would be eaten half way by the rat. In the end, a farmer brought a female cat that he had raised for more than twenty years and weighed more than nineteen pounds from his hometown of Zhongshan County. However, in the fight, the cat bit the rat's throat tightly, and the rat pressed down on the cat's body. As a result, both of them died. This matter spread throughout the city. At that time, someone weighed the dead rat, and it weighed as much as thirty-seven pounds. In the hole where it was hiding, countless leftover loaches were also found.

### A Record of Visiting the Jade Exhibition Preview

— Sun Choucheng

The items collected for China's participation in the Paris International Exposition this time were mostly jade, so a preview was held on the fourth floor of the Great New Company from March 5th. Eight wooden tables were specially set up in the exhibition hall, covered with tablecloths, and various products were placed on them separately. A palace-style pagoda and palace lantern archway were located in the center. The pagoda was one meter and twelve centimeters high, with seven levels, similar to the Longhua Pagoda. It was exquisitely detailed. The window railings on each level were carved with openwork patterns. The jade was lustrous, with mottled emerald green. The bells hanging on each of the eight corners were hollowed out from whole materials. The jade chains on the pagoda's top were as thin as lines, and the door stubs of each layer were precise to the millimeter. Electric torches were installed in the middle, emitting a faint, slow light, sometimes bright and sometimes dim, with switches for management. There were three layers of steps around, all decorated with round "longevity" character railings, connected by steps. To the left and right in front of the pagoda stood turtles and cranes facing each other, in the style of the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity in the old capital. The two palace lanterns were one-quarter of a meter in diameter, covered in green, without any flaws. They were engraved with four stories: Heavenly Maid Scattering Flowers, Magu Offering Longevity, Chang'e Flying to the Moon, and Magpie Bridge Meeting. The scenery was arranged according to the color of the jade, and the figures were vivid and lifelike. The archway was 41% of a meter high and more than half a meter wide. In the middle was the seal "First in Heaven and Earth," and on the left and right were carved the four characters "Overlapping Greens" and "Hollowed Greens." The surrounding areas were carved with double dragons playing with pearls and cloud cranes and other patterns. The materials were uniform, and the colors were bright and beautiful. It is said that these raw materials were obtained in 1915 by two miners, Li Benren and Liu Baochen, deep in the jadeite mountains of Burma. They weighed 8,000 kilograms and were dissected over several years into thirteen pieces of various sizes. Zhang Ruihua purchased five pieces, weighing 3,000 kilograms, obtaining 0.4 cubic meters of pure emerald. He believed that such extraordinary materials should be tested with extraordinary craftsmanship to create extraordinary treasures. Therefore, he recruited skilled craftsmen, obtaining 110 people, and spent eight of the ten years to carve the above three rare treasures. Jadeite is not comparable to gold, silver, or ivory. Knives and saws cannot penetrate it, and carving is very difficult. It requires delicate workmanship in polishing. One careless mistake can lead to immediate failure. Therefore, when the above three items were exhibited at the New York Exhibition in 1933, visitors were amazed and speechless, all praising the superb Eastern art. Other items, such as the crystal Queen Mother Longevity Star vase, the amber Cowherd and Weaver Girl screen, the emerald Eight Oddities in Water jar, and the coral Guanyin on Ao Fish statue, were all carved with great realism and spirit. There was also a pair of emerald magnolia pendants, only two inches long, one red and one green, carved with a picture of Mulan in military attire, holding a horse and wielding a spear, with a majestic and charming posture, lifelike, admired by all the viewers. Next to it was a place for inscriptions, with cold gold Xuan paper mounted into albums, signed by Liang Hancao, inviting celebrities to inscribe. Huang Renzhi wrote sixteen characters: "Heaven or man? A rare treasure. As cut, as polished. Not precious, but clever." Xiao Mo wrote a quatrain: "Bright crystal emerald is exquisite, jade pagoda and coral gain artificiality. Competing to see ten thousand families in awe, who can compare with treasure mountains and golden valleys?" Pan Gongzhan heard that the pagoda, palace lanterns, and archway were said to be sold after being exhibited in Paris this time, and was afraid that they would be acquired by foreigners. He advocated inviting comrades from all walks of life to donate 2,000 national currency units per person, raising funds to purchase them and display them in the Shanghai Museum.

### Cherry Blossoms and Japan

— Ji Yun

Cherry blossoms are the national flower of Japan, blooming in mid-April, a crimson haze, exceptionally beautiful. The Japanese love them like their own lives. Wherever the Japanese set foot, there are cherry blossoms. Other emblems, trademarks, advertisements, decorative patterns, etc., all use cherry blossoms. Cherry blossoms bloom from budding to falling petals in less than half a month. Taiwan is close to the tropics, and flowers bloom the earliest. Cherry blossoms appear in mid-January, while in Hokkaido, Japan, mountain cherries are only seen in July and August. Therefore, Britain has the bold saying, "There is not a time on the flag when the sun does not shine," and Japan has the saying, "There is not a season in a year when cherry blossoms cannot be seen."

According to the research of Japanese botanist Dr. Makino, cherry blossoms are not unique to Japan. They are also distributed in southwestern Asia. The Himalayan cherry blossoms on the Himalayas are also quite beautiful. There is also Jeju Island in Korea, a small mountain. Fifteen years ago, it was discovered that there were also Tokyo Somei-Yoshino cherries there. So it is possible that Japanese cherry blossoms were imported from Korea. The original Japanese cherry blossoms were all wild mountain cherries, which are dark red with single petals. Later, they gradually mutated into double and double petals, and the color also faded to the same as light red.

Japan believes that cherry blossoms symbolize their samurai, but no one can explain the reason clearly. People who have been to Japan all believe that cherry blossoms and Japanese women harmonize well, and their enchanting lightness contains extremely tempting magic. Among the three elements of color, aroma, and taste, cherry blossoms lack aroma. They bloom quickly and fall quickly, and are probably more short-lived than peach blossoms. Their bright and lush appearance during full bloom is unmatched by other flowers. But after reaching their peak, their withering is imminent.

Once a year, when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, people carry wine to enjoy the flowers, as if crazy, doing their best to enjoy themselves. Foreigners who come to Japan for sightseeing also come during this period. Therefore, the next World Games will be held in Japan, and the meeting period must be in mid-April. Because Japan has the most cherry blossoms, maple leaves, and pine trees, and the interest in viewing maple leaves and pine trees is not as good as enjoying cherry blossoms. The most popular places for cherry blossoms in Tokyo are Asukayama and Koganei, and other parks and shrines also have them. The most common cherry blossom in Tokyo is the Somei Yoshino cherry. Somei is the name of a suburb of Tokyo. During the Tokugawa era, there were flower gardens there, but now there are no traces left. Yoshino is a mountain name, and it is still a famous place for cherry blossoms. Before Emperor Jinmu of Japan, he loved cherry blossoms. There was a goddess named Konohanasakuya-hime. The two characters "Konohana" probably refer to cherry blossoms.

The Taiwan cherry blossoms in Atami bloom in mid-January, and the color is very strong. They were transplanted from Taiwan. Taiwan used to belong to our country, but we have not heard of cherry blossoms in the Chinese mainland. This is very strange. Our cherries are very similar to cherry blossoms, and they may be a type of cherry blossom. Botanists may be able to investigate the process of their transformation. In the three northeastern provinces, Qingdao, Suzhou, Qingyang, and the Hongkou area of ​​Shanghai, countless beautiful cherry blossoms are planted. When they are in full bloom, many idlers also wander among the geta crowds to admire them. And a few cold plums on Gushan Mountain that have endured wind and frost are still waiting for next year's plum-blossom tour bus.

### Swapped Phoenixes

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Twelve (White Paper Red Letter Empty Return Two Lines of Tears Reed Flowers and Maple Leaves Walk Alone Half the City in Autumn)

Looking at enthusiastic people with a cold eye, one probably sees more and more clearly. Conversely, for enthusiastic people to escape cold eyes, the more they escape, the more hesitant they appear. At this time, Guoji and Zhu Xiaosong were sitting opposite each other in silence, and a bit of unnaturalness was revealed on their faces. Xiaosong smiled: Guessing based on the words in the poem, I feel that I am not wrong. Even if I am wrong, I will ask you how the novel is structured if these poems are to be inserted into the novel? Guoji said: You can see it in the poem, why ask me again? Seeing that he didn't reveal anything, Xiaosong held the manuscript in his hand and read it again in a low voice, then said: I guess it's like this, right? A young man accidentally meets a young woman and falls in love at first sight. So from that day on, he has to wait for that young woman to pass by every day, no matter how busy he is, he can't forget this. But that young woman doesn't pay attention to this young man. From spring to autumn, no matter how much this young man pays attention to her, she ignores him completely. And this young woman is a little angry, so... Guoji quickly stopped him, raising his hand, and said: Wrong, wrong. If that woman is angry, this man will still go to see her (that is equivalent to a rascal behavior. These two people don't know each other, but it is the woman who admires the man's literary name first. Xiaosong said? According to the poem, it is clear that the two people have never spoken. How does that woman know that the man she met is the one she admires in her heart? Guoji said: That is known through correspondence. Xiaosong's face did not show any smile, and his eyes were still focused on the manuscript. Then he asked casually: But I don't know whether the man first communicated with the woman, or the woman first communicated with the man? (147)

### Flying Kites and Kicking Shuttlecocks

— Luo Caiqing

Reading the news about promoting kite flying and shuttlecock kicking competitions, I can't help but recall my precious childhood. In the countryside, these were the two most suitable sports in spring and winter. (Or rather, games.) In spring, before the busy farming season began, many children gathered, and adults were sometimes happy to join in, competing to fly kites on the high hills. The sound of shouting would often drown out the cuckoo's "Every family cuckoo." In winter, after the rice had just been harvested, the farm was full of sunshine. The golden chicken feathers from chickens slaughtered by families for ancestor worship were snatched by the children to make shuttlecocks. So while the adults talked about this year's harvest under the sun, the children were happy for the shuttlecocks again.

That kind of situation seems to have passed very far away, and having escaped from the countryside into the living circle of Shanghai, everything I have witnessed is disappointing: Even if it's kite flying and shuttlecock kicking, the children who live in the concessions (of course, another generation) don't have that kind of blessing, because there are "electric wires" in the concessions, and kite flying is prohibited. Occasionally, some children still buy a small kite and fly it on a secluded road, but the lovely spring breeze is blocked by the roofs of tall buildings. The kite only twitches twice in their hands before hitting the gutter, either shattered to pieces or riddled with holes. Instead of spending the money begged for candy on nothing, it is better to go to the candy stall at the alley entrance to play "civet cat swapping for crown prince."

Shuttlecocks don't seem to have been banned, but there are too many games that tempt children in Shanghai. Playing "civet cat swapping for crown prince" is one example. And in those high-end alleys (mostly called "villages" or "villas"), there are rubber-wheeled cars and roller skates. The shuttlecock has been eliminated too far.

However, there are adults kicking shuttlecocks in Shanghai. They make a living in entertainment venues, kicking a shuttlecock in many fancy ways to win the favor of the money-spending bosses. He often kicks so hard that he is covered in sweat on stage, and when the audience shouts "One more!", he has no choice but to "Do one more." This seems to be far from the original purpose of "exercise."

This is one thing. Shanghainese seem to never pay attention to exercise. To take a walk in the park, you have to spend a dollar to buy an entrance ticket called a "pass." They listen to the whistles in the factories or the alarm clocks at home! They are only reminded of the time to wake up when they are sleeping! They only remember "how to work" and "how much to pay," and simply don't have the extra time to study what kind of exercise to do.

So there was a time when I even wanted to "return to the countryside" so that I could enjoy a little of the freedom that had been taken away from me in the concessions. But the children in the countryside have also changed. At the same age when we were flying kites and kicking shuttlecocks, they also helped their fathers work in the fields, and my companions of the same age beat their wives at home, as if they had all changed into different people, and could no longer think of such interesting games! Flying kites and kicking shuttlecocks.

Now it is spring again, and many families are preparing "seed money" to bet on the hopes of this year, and in Shanghai? Advertisements for spring tour buses have also been seen in the newspapers early on.

When will we be able to see kites flying freely in the sky again?

### Night at Sea

— Lu Jia

Rocking, drifting into the deep night sea, the small fishing boat has black sails, black gunwales, and a black-kerchiefed fisherwoman sits by the rudder at the stern.

The sea is not tranquil; even the heavy night cannot suppress its churning. Waves, laden with weight, roar against the fragile gunwale. Foam splashes into the boat, onto the old fisherman at the bow, mending his nets.

Cold—

The cold wind, the cold spray penetrate the holes in his cotton-padded coat. Even muscles tempered in wind and waves cannot endure this piercing, cold dampness!

The torn net slips from his hands several times because the old fisherman's hands are frozen; the boat, floating on the wave crest, pitches wildly, preventing him from standing firm on his trembling legs as he used to.

## Page 16

The wind fills the sails; the red lamp at the masthead cannot illuminate the sea's secrets.

Beside the fisherwoman is also a swaying oil lamp, struggling against fate in the wind and waves. In the terrifying angry sea, the lamp, the old fisherman, the fisherwoman, and the small boat offer each other solace and companionship. They share the same fate.

The fisherwoman is motionless, the wind lifting her headscarf and fluttering it behind her head. No matter how the waves leap onto her face, onto the oilcloth covering her, she stubbornly grips the helm. In the light that barely illuminates her face: a face full of water droplets, a face of perseverance and the solemnity of a martyr. Her teeth clench her lower lip, also biting a strand of hair that has fallen from her forehead. Her eyes, petrified, stare at the bow; at the bow, the old fisherman's stooped figure dissolves into the ink-splashed sea and night, making it difficult to discern with the eyes.

The old fisherman looks up to the sky, murmuring, unsure whether he is cursing or praying. But his voice is drowned out by the howling of the wind and waves and the roar of the sea dragon, and the sky is sealed with thick black clouds, so no word can reach the ears of the gods.

Suddenly, a ghastly green lightning flash, like a cold arrow or a shiver, pierces through the accumulated layers of black clouds, stabbing the sea's dark face. The light flashes on the jagged, uneven sea; the waves pile up like lead blocks, from the gunwale to the horizon. Thunder rumbles past.

The lightning causes terror in people's hearts. The fisherwoman sees the sea reveal its dark face—that immeasurable face full of sinister secrets, as if the gaping mouth that had swallowed her husband near the gunwale was opening again, waiting for a second feast.

(Not long ago, her husband had easily ventured out into the furious sea in the tenth lunar month, while she waited on the shore with a lantern, until dawn, when he still had not returned.)

(Her five-year-old son, Liu'er, woke up in the morning and could not see his grandfather or mother.)

Not daring to let her thoughts drift further, she cried out:

"Father-in-law: Let's go back!"

Accompanied by a gust of wind, an aged voice came. Although stubborn, it also suppressed the trembling.

"Look, Liu'er's mother—it's a west wind and the tide is ebbing, how can we go back?"

"But…" The daughter-in-law fell silent, thinking of the empty pot tomorrow, lowered her head, hot tears mixed with water droplets on her cold cheek.

The sea wind continued to roar, the night seemed heavier.

### New Building Completed for the U.S. Department of the Interior

— Te

Everything Works with "Robots"

The newly constructed building of the U.S. Department of the Interior has now been completed, equipped with all kinds of exquisite machinery of the new era, making it arguably America's most unique new building. In a few weeks, when Secretary of the Interior Ickes and his 3,000 staff members move in, almost all tasks, except those requiring brainpower, can be performed by "robots." Every room has an automatic air circulation system, and even when the sun is shining brightly, the air is cooler than in the shade. There are a total of thirty-six air circulation zones, all of which can be automatically controlled. In winter, the air becomes warm and humid, and in summer, it becomes cool. Eight thousand five hundred gallons of water are used per minute to cleanse the air for the workers. The main furnaces that generate heat have automatic on/off mechanisms. Because "robots" are used to regulate the temperature, heating costs can be reduced by 15% to 20%. However, when the weather is at zero degrees, the furnaces still burn 3.5 tons of coal per hour. The base floor of this building has an area of 1.1 million square feet. Because many security mechanisms are installed, only thirty guards are needed to patrol. Wherever an alert occurs inside the building, a "robot" rushes to that location and sends a signal to the security headquarters, ensuring that the lower-level command knows. If the situation is serious, it will also alert the city's fire department to be on standby. Most of the "robots" are powered by heat, but many are connected to complex machinery that can perform various ingenious operations. Currently, only one other government agency has "robots" that are even more cleverly designed, and that is the newly constructed document repository building. The "robots" inside use "electric eyes." The nation's valuable documents are stored in this repository, making it completely secure. The new Department of the Interior building has a "robot" department located on a half-floor between the fifth and sixth floors, looking like an operating room in a hospital, painted white. All heating, electricity, and telephones are installed in pipes, with no visible traces on the outside. The telephones use the latest automatic system. Every piece of equipment prioritizes convenience first, followed by aesthetics. The internal structure is designed in advance for repairs, painting, and cleaning to avoid difficulties later. The main building has a total of two thousand rooms. There are six separate buildings on the left and right sides, and each room faces the outside, with ample air and sunlight. The construction of this building cost a total of US$13 million.

### Sickness

— Luo Zhihua

The sky is pale gray. Looking up through the dust-laden air, you appear like a pool of damp salt grains.

My heart seems to be soaked in this pool of salt grains, feeling numb. My head is dizzy and heavy, not knowing where to place it. Within the dazed feeling, there is sometimes a burst of pain, causing the muscles in my body to tremble and shrink together.

Truly uneasy. Lying in bed, I indulge in wild thoughts. Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage? I heard adults say that several generations in my family died of this disease. Not long ago, the doctor even told me to pay attention to these symptoms. — I am a bit afraid; my heart is racing.

For several weeks, the weather has been erratic. One day it is warm, like spring, but the next day it is terribly cold, and even with several layers of clothing, I cannot withstand the cold wind. But, others say: cerebral hemorrhage has no major connection with this kind of weather, so what's going on?

The street is very quiet; it seems like people have all been blown away by the wind.

I ran to a friend's house; he understands a little bit about medical knowledge. Perhaps he can tell me what I should do.

After I told him about my condition, he pulled my hand, looked at my tongue and throat, and touched my head, acting very much like a doctor. Afterwards, he carefully examined my hand.

"Could it be scarlet fever?"

As he spoke, he pointed to the back of my hand. I don't know when so many small red spots appeared there. After he said that, I couldn't help but furrow my brow, staring at those very small spots, clustered together in groups of several! It seemed like they were holding a meeting, discussing how to kill me.

Thinking about it: almost right! Haven't the newspapers been saying these past few days that there are many cases of scarlet fever in the hospital? And, there have also been many deaths. It probably can't be wrong. It must be!

I stared at those little red spots, feeling unspeakably panicked. If I could, I would bite through the back of my hand and bite those little red spots out, but, there are also some on my body, so what can I do? Should I scrape all the skin off with a knife?

I paced back and forth in my friend's room, feeling somewhat better.

My friend stared at me blankly, his bright eyes covered by a gray net, his hair scratched until it was sadly disheveled, looking like a pile of withered grass in the wilderness, very desolate. He leaned his buttocks against the edge of the table, his two hands supporting his body, his mouth moving awkwardly, arguing:

"How can we get sick? — We!"

### Sai Jinhua (7)

— Chen He

Two years after Hong returned to his country, he fell ill and died. Sai left the Hong family and set down harsh conditions: "In the future, she must return to the South and not go to the North again, in the future, she must not demand anything from the Hong family, and in the future, she must not use her former name for publicity." Under the pressure of official power, Sai had no choice but to leave Beijing for Shanghai.

"It's precisely people like us who get sick."

I said helplessly. I felt even worse than before, simply not knowing what to do. The sky was even grayer, the salt grains tightly enveloping my heart.

Neither of us had any solution.

He told me that I should go to the hospital to get checked as soon as possible, saying that maybe there would be a solution. He heard that there was a hospital in Shanghai that specialized in treating patients with infectious diseases, only charging a small medical fee, and providing attentive care.

"Then you should go quickly! — This is not something to be taken lightly!" After saying that, he paused slightly, let his hands fall down in despair, and shook his head: "Damn it, today is Sunday!" Saying that, his body seemed to be paralyzed. In a weak tone, with a comforting feeling, he said, "You should just go back and rest first, you need to rest well."

Normally, he is always very quiet and steady, but today everything is out of balance.

Although I tried my best to suppress my own feelings, quietly comforting myself, saying: It can't be scarlet fever, and there won't be any danger, but, the more I said that, the more afraid I became, and the more I felt that I was deceiving myself.

The sky was simply covered by a tombstone, as if pieced together from slabs of stone, heavily pressing down on the earth, pressing on my chest.

My body felt so heavy that I didn't want to move. My throat felt hot and itchy. I raised my hands to look at them, the red spots had become even larger, clustering even more densely, as if they were about to break through the skin and jump out.

The night gradually deepened. I didn't want to eat anything, and I couldn't think about anything. Before my eyes, a cartoon-like character, "death," appeared. For a moment, it became as small as a grain of rice, retreated, but then it became large again, so large that it covered everything, the strokes of the character blurring, turning into a pitch-black sky.

I looked at the sky outside the window, which was as dark as "death" had become. The moon and stars were all occupied by it, and I was being caressed by it.

— What am I going to do? Tell me!

White Granulated Sugar

Smuggling is becoming increasingly rampant, and the market towns of Jiangnan are also greatly affected. Therefore, Mr. Li, the owner of the Demao Native Products Store, wants to convene a meeting of his peers to implore everyone to work together to resist foreign white granulated sugar.

At the beginning of the play, Mr. Li's wife and daughter are peeling lotus seeds and lilies, preparing to cook them to entertain guests. The mother complains that Mr. Li is going to spend money again to invite guests. The daughter explains to her mother that the purpose of inviting guests this time is to discuss ways to rescue the sugar market because the price of silk cocoons has plummeted, and the villagers are so poor that they are like dried toads, not having money to go to the market to buy goods, so they buy smuggled goods to save money. But the mother does not believe that smuggling will have any impact on the market.

Mr. Li is an honest man. Because smuggling has squeezed his business, he has become as patriotic as his daughter. But he thinks everyone is as honest as he is, so he doesn't believe that Mr. Wang, the owner of the Yulong Native Products Store, will take the opportunity to buy a batch of foreign white granulated sugar to steal his business! He only wants to cover up the sluggishness of his store's business, telling the clerks to make the sound of coins dropping louder when customers come. But he does not pay attention to the student anti-smuggling team from Shanghai who are going to the countryside.

Li Huaying's classmate comes, saying that the anti-smuggling team will gather at the train station immediately, telling her to go right away.

Guests arrive one by one. Mr. Gao cannot come because of business, so he sends his son Rongtang to represent him. Mr. Wang comes in second; Mr. Liu follows him in. So they sit down to discuss the issue of resisting foreign white granulated sugar. Mr. Li is not very good at speaking, so Li Huaying speaks on his behalf about the relationship between smuggling and saving the country. This wins the sympathy of Gao Rongtang. Mr. Wang also pretends to agree cunningly. Mr. Liu only praises Li Huaying for being eloquent.

Regarding their opinions on anti-smuggling: Mr. Liu believes that Chinese yellow sugar and white sugar do not have good sales appeal, so they cannot resist foreign goods, and that things must be done carefully. Gao Rongtang has a strong personality and wants to immediately establish an anti-smuggling team to inspect households one by one. Mr. Wang, on the other hand, wants to use delaying tactics to slowly organize the anti-smuggling team so that he can sabotage it from within. At this time, an employee of Yulong runs in frantically and whispers to Mr. Wang. Their actions are noticed by Li Huaying, so she secretly runs out to report to the student anti-smuggling team.

When the women want to return the goods to the Demao store and go to buy cheaper smuggled goods, a crowd at the train station injures people while searching for smuggled goods. The crowd also arrests the employee of Yulong and makes him confess that Mr. Wang is a treacherous merchant who secretly sells smuggled sugar.

Finally, Li Huaying returns injured, takes out rayon, and explains to everyone the reasons why Chinese sugar and Chinese silk cocoons cannot be sold at a good price: all because of smuggled goods. Everyone is moved and vows not to eat foreign white granulated sugar anymore. Even Mr. Liu is willing to seal up the small amount of foreign white granulated sugar in his store.

Opening "Pearl Pagoda, Passing the Imperial Examination"

Cassia fragrance divides a branch in the toad palace. Passing the imperial examination, a new scholar enjoys the spring in the apricot garden. Ten thousand selected copper coins present collected scrolls. Judging talent, the emperor's brush first inscribes a name. Three hundred heroes of the Qujiang River generation actually followed me to Pengying. Throwing fruit on the streets is better than An Ren. The beautiful story of the three champions is the same as Shang Lu. Counting the days, descendants rise up in the jade forest. Unexpectedly, a failed scholar harbors injustice. The grass is short and sparse. He strikes the Dengwen drum. He speaks of Sanqiao, Bi Ding, and Fang Qing. In an instant, an imperial edict is declared at the noon gate. Fang Qing cries bitterly in grief. He presents his grandfather's grievances to the emperor. Therefore, he returns to his original home to report the situation. The loyal and good are succeeded by heavenly joy. The ancestral property is returned with a decree. Boundless is the grace of the imperial rain and dew. Especially because he spent his youth in poverty. Golden lotus precious candles are bestowed to complete the marriage. Moreover, embroidered clothes point directly to patrol on behalf of the heavens. Temporarily resigning from the ranks of mandarin ducks and egrets. The Qin generation plays the phoenix in response to the flute. A high carriage and four horses leave the capital.

Opening "Dream of the Red Chamber, Xichun Painting"

Petite and exquisite, I buy Xichun. Painting and identifying, the brush conveys the spirit. The Da Guan Garden draft is infinitely wonderful. He is. Intentionally seeking fine workmanship in every style. Opening up a peach list and adding painting brushes. Pairing all the colors requires a thousand gold. Buying Song silk and grinding it smooth. It takes a month of effort to complete. Look at him. Arranging pavilions and terraces with a fine structure. The chest hides hills and valleys, a good painting of gardens. Let him. Lush flowers and trees waving the brush to paint. Let him. Beasts and birds embellished with refinement. Let him. Grinding ink and tempering glue to paint the mountains and stones. Let him. Pearl curtains and painted beams write layers. Let him. First describe the draft and then re-dye it. Let him. All day long, pondering and imitating, the wrist does not stop. It tires Xichun to often cry out in pain. I can only. Close the boudoir deeply and focus all my attention. It makes. The busy Baoyu without anything to do thinks about painting. Searching a dry stomach, I am humming in detail. Suddenly, I hear. The inscription is completed and the locust is offered for a big chew. For a time, the boudoir is filled with laughter. It is said that. Only Pin'er chews her tongue.
