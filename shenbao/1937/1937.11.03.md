### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Opens This Morning; British Foreign Secretary Declares Determination to Cooperate with the U.S.

With Resolve to Protect Interests and Fulfill International Obligations; Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon Also States Chinese Territory Inviolable

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden, in a speech in the House of Commons today, responded to opposition party attacks on the government's policy regarding the League of Nations and the Far East. Eden stated, "Whatever action is taken regarding the Far Eastern dispute depends entirely on the full cooperation of the United States. I can say without any doubt today that if American cooperation can be obtained on an equal footing, and an international conference is convened, I am willing to go not only from Geneva to Brussels, but even from Melbourne, Australia, to Alaska, and will never shrink from the labor. Under the current international situation, I hold this determination even more strongly." The Foreign Secretary further stated that all those who attack the government fail to understand that the position of the United States in Geneva is different from its position in Brussels, adding, "Of course, this difference is of utmost importance." Eden further responded to other criticisms, saying, "Although there are diplomatic secrets that cannot be disclosed, in the current situation, I should state clearly that the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was not Britain, but the United States government." Eden then reiterated a remark made by a certain opposition leader, who recently expressed a fervent desire to cooperate with the U.S., and earnestly inquired, "In this dangerous and difficult Far Eastern situation, if Britain cannot move forward as the United States does and fully cooperate with the U.S., can Britain, without surpassing the U.S., at least follow closely behind without being left too far behind?" Eden stated, "I now fully accept this definition as a guiding principle for the future."

Regarding the League of Nations issue, Eden stated that he could not disregard the practical difficulties arising from the current weakness of the League of Nations, nor did he wish to debate who was to blame. Of the world's seven major powers, only three are members of the League. How can we say, then, that if you sincerely trust the League of Nations, the League's supreme power will be your backing? Eden himself deeply regrets this point, stating, "If all nations cannot uniformly accept the constraints of international law, as we have already accepted, then we cannot speak of lasting peace until the power opposing powerful aggressors is invincible."

Eden further stated that while Britain is willing to discuss the difficulties of any country, it will never be intimidated by the rising tide of brutality, such as those who speak of peace but in reality declare nothing less than an ultimatum. Eden then explained the basis of British foreign policy as follows: "While we are determined to protect our vital interests and fulfill our international obligations when necessary, we will never take actions that contradict the terms and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant or the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We firmly believe that disputes should be resolved through peaceful means and are willing to do our utmost to ensure that this principle is universally accepted and observed. Furthermore, while we acknowledge that the current League of Nations is significantly affected by the incompleteness of its membership, we still firmly believe that the League is the best way to achieve results. We should listen to any suggestions for reforming the League, but only to the extent that they can strengthen international trust and enable the League to fulfill the purposes stated in the Covenant. Therefore, we should not join anti-communist or anti-fascist groups, as our concern lies solely with other countries' foreign policies, not their internal affairs. We offer cooperation to all countries but cannot accept the command of other countries."

Opposition party leader Major Attlee rose to question, "Will the British government, at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, take the principle of the Nine-Power Treaty, namely guaranteeing the territorial integrity of China, as its stance?" Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon replied, "Yes, we should." Simon further stated, "According to the Nine-Power Treaty, each signatory country has undertaken not to infringe upon the territorial integrity of China and agrees to consult each other to seek a solution when the treaty is violated. This is why the Brussels Conference is convened, and how these promises are to be implemented is the purpose of our participation." Attlee then inquired whether the government would never enter into agreements with any country that infringes upon Chinese integrity or accept any measures. Simon replied that he did not wish to elaborate, saying, "This is what I can declare to the fullest extent. What the United States has already done is no different. In this matter, we and the United States are on the same side." (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters)

Lisbon: The Portuguese government has appointed its Envoy to Belgium, Gastão de Castello Branco, as Chief Delegate to the Nine-Power Conference, with the Envoy to the United States, Helder Ribeiro de Queiroz, as Deputy Delegate. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)

[Moscow] Well-informed sources recently stated that the Soviet delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will re-propose the theory of forming a united front of democratic countries to oppose aggressor nations, as this theory complements the strategy of people's fronts in various democratic countries. However, the Soviet delegation will avoid proposing this theory alone, as although U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have successively issued declarations advocating joint action by democratic countries, the actual results of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have not yet fully inspired confidence. In addition, political circles have expressed optimism about the general situation in the Far East, believing that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the number of Japanese troops heading to China to join the war to break the Chinese resistance has gradually increased. As a result, border disputes between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" and conflicts between Soviet and Japanese/"Manchukuo" border guards, which were once frequent, have now ceased. Japan has also abandoned its unilateral attempt to demarcate the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border, indicating that it no longer intends to exert pressure on the Soviet border. As for the widespread rumors that the Soviet government intends to abolish the mutual assistance pact between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, so that Outer Mongolia can supply China with arms and other goods without involving the Soviet Union, responsible officials here have firmly denied these rumors, calling them absurd and unfounded, and stating that such absurd rumors are common. For example, as relations between the Soviet Union and Germany deteriorate, rumors claim that the Soviet Union is seeking to approach Germany, and so on. In short, the purpose of these rumors is nothing more than to shake the trust of the Soviet Union's friends in the Soviet Union. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)

[London] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, responsible parties have stated that the British delegation must seek a "way" to mediate between China and Japan. However, British political figures believe that China can only accept an honorable peace, while Japan will refuse to comply. Therefore, mediation efforts may be futile. In addition, negotiations on the Anti-Comintern Pact among Italy, Germany, and Japan have been successful and are about to be signed. Therefore, Italy will support Japan's views at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Furthermore, political figures also stated that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will discuss the issue of safeguarding the interests of various countries in China. The U.S. delegation will raise the issue of protecting the territories of all countries adjacent to China and Japan. Britain's attitude is to follow closely behind the United States. However, whether the United States will propose practical suggestions to resolve the dispute between China and Japan, or to ensure that the security of the interests of various countries in China and all territories near China are not affected, is what British political figures are eager to know. It is now known that Foreign Secretary Eden will only stay in Brussels for a few days before returning home, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald will take over as Chief Delegate.

### Italy to Join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact

[Rome] Authoritative sources here announced tonight that Italy is scheduled to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact within this week. This pact was signed on November 25, 1936, in Berlin by the German Envoy to the United Kingdom, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and the Japanese Envoy to Germany, Kōji Mushanokōji. Italy's accession at this time involves only signing the pact without drafting separate articles. The content stipulates that Germany, Italy, and Japan agree to inform each other of news regarding international communist activities and to discuss close cooperation in countermeasures, while also inviting other countries to participate. (1st, National Maritime Telegraph)

[Berlin] Yesterday, official circles denied the claim that Germany and Italy had an understanding to assist each other militarily in certain situations, stating that it can now be clearly stated that Germany has no military alliance with Italy. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)

### London Times Explains the Significance of the Brussels Conference

Related to Joint Action by Various Countries to Restore Peace; Anglo-American United Front Now Indestructible, London

[London] The Times commented today, "If reason in the Far East is to return sooner rather than later, then both East and West must truly understand what the Brussels Conference is. The Brussels Conference is not a court endowed with punitive powers but rather a gathering of responsible nations, some of whom are extremely concerned about life in the Far East and must gather to discuss what joint diplomatic action should be taken to promote the restoration of peace." The newspaper further stated that the war occurring within China is indeed within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly has adopted a practical approach, allowing each signatory country of the treaty to gather and discuss response methods on its own. Therefore, the League of Nations has no suspicion of interference, as used by the Japanese government to deceive its domestic populace. Furthermore, the U.S. President's speech in Chicago has further increased the importance of the League of Nations' advocacy and the scope of its agenda, but has not changed the original intention. President Roosevelt's remarks have clearly pointed out the goal, without any doubt, and are completely consistent with the British position. Therefore, the United States' attendance at the Brussels Conference is a fact of utmost value. Thereafter, at any time during the conference, any action taken will definitely receive the full response of the British representative and his government, and the people in the rear. This has already been determined as an unwavering compass, as this Anglo-American united front is not damaged or hindered by any doubts or concerns. The Western countries, just like Japan, deeply feel that the stability of the Far East depends on the two relevant countries having a normal relationship. As for meaningless hostility, whether it comes from this side or that side, bullying or despising the Chinese people, regarding them as politically inferior people who only deserve to be slaves of puppet governments, is insufficient to speak of stability. And the fact that Japan is exposed to China's inevitable resistance and the financial exhaustion that this war will cause after mediation fails, offers no guarantee. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)

[London] The Times recently commented on the Far Eastern issue with mockery, stating, in brief, that Japan, under the pretext of pursuing a "self-defense" policy, is fulfilling its plan to expand its territory, starting with the Korean border and invading Mongolia and Siberia, and is about to reach the Yellow River in China. "The goal of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to use peaceful means to facilitate an early end to the war between China and Japan. There is a simple fact here that urgently needs attention, namely, that Japan's actions have already raised the issue of the practice of treaty obligations. Concerned countries, for the sake of maintaining peace, have invited the United States to cooperate within a certain area and to a certain extent, and the United States has accepted. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese dispute has become a major international issue. If the Nine-Power Treaty Conference fails, it will inevitably create a new situation that we urgently need to address, which Foreign Secretary Eden has already pointed out some time ago, and should be avoided by all politicians in East Asia and Western Europe."

### British-Japanese Discord Increasing

Major Company Shareholders Plan to Boycott Goods Automatically; Japan Apologizes Again for the Shelling of British Soldiers

[London] Regarding the case of three British soldiers in Shanghai being killed by Japanese shells on the evening of October 29, the Japanese Embassy here originally stated that the Japanese army had not fired at the time. Now, a public statement has been issued stating that according to the results of the investigation, the soldiers were indeed killed by Japanese shells. The Japanese military authorities have taken appropriate measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The Japanese government is willing to provide appropriate compensation to the families of the deceased. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)

[London] Regarding the matter of Japanese shells killing three British soldiers in Shanghai, official sources have confirmed that the Japanese government has formally apologized to the British government and promised to compensate for the losses. Therefore, it is generally believed that this dispute has come to an end. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)

[London] Regarding the incident in which British Air Attaché Murray and others at the British Embassy in China were shot at by Japanese aircraft near Shanghai on the 12th of last month, Conservative Party MP Astor asked Foreign Secretary Eden during the House of Commons meeting today whether the Japanese government had responded to the British protest. Foreign Secretary Eden declared, "The Japanese government sent a note to British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive, informing him of the results of the investigation, expressing regret, and stating that appropriate measures would be taken to punish those responsible. After receiving this note, the British government immediately instructed Ambassador Clive to notify the Japanese government that the British government considers this case to be closed, but that the British government should be notified at any time of the measures taken by the Japanese government to punish those responsible. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)

[London] According to news from Tokyo, some Japanese Diet members held a meeting yesterday and resolved that if Britain does not change its current attitude towards the Far East issue, Japan should decide on serious measures to deal with it. This news shocked British people. Later, it was learned that the so-called serious measures only refer to severing relations with Britain in spirit and morality. Anxiety has eased slightly. Currently, British financial figures are eager to preserve the achievements made by Sir Otto Niemeyer in assisting China's financial recovery. It is believed that the repeated killings of British soldiers by Japanese shells in Shanghai may result in a strong reaction in Britain, the intensity of which may exceed the spiritual rulings that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can pass. In addition, the movement to boycott Japanese goods in Britain, which had once subsided due to government opposition, is now being advocated by many British people in the form of individual actions. It is reported that the majority of shareholders in certain major companies plan to propose to stop trading with Japan at the shareholders' meetings of their respective companies at the end of this year, especially major oil companies will take this approach and stop supplying Japan with oil. If so, the issue of Japan's fuel supply will become a problem. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)

[Tokyo] The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun today published a commentary entitled "Britain Losing Impartiality," stating that Britain, whose sphere of influence is in the Yangtze River area, has unexpectedly witnessed the outbreak of a major incident in Shanghai. It would not be surprising to Britain, but rather that there is some reason for it. Britain is acting excessively, desperately cooperating with China on anti-Japanese issues. British officials and those related to the garrison in Shanghai, as well as the press, and even businessmen, are all acting rashly. This is evidenced by facts. This is Britain's loss of impartiality in its tone and attitude toward Japan. Britain has not gained a proper understanding of the Sino-Japanese Incident. British public opinion is dominated and mobilized by a one-sided anti-Japanese sentiment. The Times has sunk to this low level, and others can be inferred similarly. (2nd, Allied News Agency)

### British House of Commons Rejects Labour Party's Impeachment Motion

International Major Issues: Eden Explains Response Strategy

[London] The British Labour Party's motion of censure against the government, concerning issues such as the League of Nations, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Spanish situation, was rejected in the House of Commons today by 363 votes to 142 after impassioned speeches by Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. The motion of censure was proposed by Labour MP Morrison, stating, "His Majesty's advisors, in their foreign policy, have been weak, indecisive, and have endangered lasting peace and national security, violated the principles of the League of Nations, and diminished Britain's prestige. Moreover, due to their lack of constructive and fundamental preparation to improve the standard of living of the people on a proper and permanent basis, they have forfeited the confidence of this House." (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters dispatch)

[London] During the debate on the address draft in the House of Commons a few days ago, opposition party members had criticized the government's current foreign policy. This afternoon, Foreign Secretary Eden, before departing for Beijing to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, made a lengthy speech in the House of Commons to respond to these criticisms. He addressed the Sino-Japanese dispute, Germany's request for the restoration of its former colonies, and the Spanish situation. Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, he stated, "Members of the opposition parties have raised questions, asking whether we are cooperating fully with the United States in this difficult situation in the Far East, following closely but not seeking to stand out, yet not lagging behind. I answer that I fully accept this view and will take it as our goal."

Regarding the transfer of negotiations on the Far Eastern issue from Geneva to Brussels, this was because the United States, not being a member of the League of Nations, required a meeting outside the League to participate on an equal footing. Any action concerning the Far Eastern dispute, regardless of its nature, requires the joint cooperation of the United States to be effective. (Applause) I declare without hesitation that, in this tense situation, to enable the United States to cooperate fully with us on an equal footing in addressing international disputes, I am willing to travel not only between Geneva and Brussels but also to Melbourne, Australia, and the Alaskan Peninsula." The rumor that the British government had put pressure on former Belgian Prime Minister Janson to convene the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is untrue. The choice of Beijing as the conference venue was originally initiated by the United States government. Furthermore, former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George's criticism of the government's passive attitude towards the Far Eastern dispute since 1931 is not true. I have reviewed the files extensively and can confirm that no one in the League of Nations has ever proposed economic sanctions against Japan. The blame cannot be solely placed on Britain. Regarding Germany's demand for the restoration of its former colonies, there is a certain country that, after the war, acquired vast territories in Europe and received a portion of the African territories formerly belonging to its allies as compensation for participating in the war. This country now supports Germany's demand. On this matter, we must clearly state that as long as a certain country's government is not prepared to relinquish its own land to satisfy Germany's demands, we cannot recognize any government's right to demand the cession of colonies from our country. (Applause)

Regarding the Spanish situation, former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George stated that the current non-intervention policy only benefits the Nationalist forces in Spain. This statement is not entirely accurate. The Republican government in Spain has a long coastline in the western Mediterranean, allowing it to import various goods and munitions from other countries, especially the Soviet Union. Since the establishment of the Nyon Agreement and the disappearance of piracy in the Mediterranean, this method of importing goods has become even more convenient. The effectiveness of Soviet-made tanks and aircraft in the Spanish Civil War is well known. Regarding the recognition of belligerent status, without foreign intervention, the Nationalist forces in Spain would likely have already obtained belligerent rights. The naval strength of the Nationalist forces is superior to that of the government forces. Once the Nationalist forces are recognized by other countries as belligerents, they will inevitably have an advantage. In essence, although the Nationalist forces have received assistance from foreigners on land, they have paid a heavy price in that they cannot obtain belligerent rights at sea because of this. I dare say that if the details of how the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War receive weapons and other assistance from abroad were revealed, members of this House would be amazed. Foreign Secretary Eden then stated that even if the Nationalist forces in Spain achieve final victory, the future government of that country may not adopt an anti-British policy. "Regardless of the outcome of the Spanish Civil War, we are willing to establish friendly relations with that country, and I believe that the authorities in that country will feel the same way."

Concluding his remarks, Foreign Secretary Eden stated, "We will resolutely defend all interests vital to the survival of Britain. We will also fulfill all international obligations stipulated by the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris. The League of Nations is currently facing some obstacles, but it still provides the best tool for resolving international disputes through peaceful means. Any proposal that strengthens the League of Nations' structure is welcomed by Britain. Britain will not participate in anti-communist or anti-fascist blocs. We are willing to work hand in hand with all countries but will not be dictated to by anyone. Regarding the Far East issue, we must recognize the various difficulties of the Far Eastern situation. I am departing tonight for Beijing to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference with this spirit, and I will do my best to contribute. This is what I can report to the members of this House before my departure." (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Cabinet Meeting

[Tokyo] Today's routine cabinet meeting convened at 10:20 a.m. First, Foreign Minister Hirota reported that due to difficulties in forming a successor cabinet in Belgium, which had initiated the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it was uncertain whether the conference would convene on the 1st. Then, Navy Minister Nagai and Army Minister Sugiyama exchanged views on security work in North China. The Foreign Minister also reported on the signing of an important diplomatic matter, and it was decided to consult the Privy Council. The meeting adjourned at 11:45 a.m. Regarding the agreement to abolish extraterritorial rights in "Manchukuo," it was also formally decided that day to proceed with the imperial sanction procedure.

### Japan Plans to Establish Wartime Headquarters

Major Personnel Shifts in the Army: Hata and Koiso Promoted to Generals

[Tokyo] Important opinions have arisen within the Japanese government following the development of the Sino-Japanese war, advocating the establishment of a wartime headquarters to achieve the goals of the China Incident as soon as possible and to ensure no regrets in handling the situation. Prime Minister Konoe has been soliciting opinions from various parties, mainly the army and navy, and the result is that all parties unanimously agree with this plan. The government has therefore decided to apply the wartime headquarters ordinance promulgated during the Russo-Japanese War to establish a headquarters in Tokyo and realize a wartime system with comprehensive preparations. The timing will be decided after considering the development of the war situation in the Shanghai area and the attitudes of the countries at the Nine-Power Conference, approximately in mid-November. The staff of the headquarters will likely be composed of the Chief and Vice Chief of the General Staff, the Chief and Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Army and Navy Ministers, and the Prime Minister. (2nd, Domei News)

[Tokyo] Major personnel changes and promotions will occur in the Japanese Army. Hata Shunroku, Inspector General of Military Education, and Koiso Kuniaki, Commander of the Korean Army, will be promoted from lieutenant general to general. (1st, Domei News Agency)

### U.S. Building Six Large Airships

Each Capable of Carrying 75 Passengers: Future Flights to the Far East

Seattle: The United States is currently building six extremely large airships, with a carrying capacity of over 42 tons, capable of carrying 50 passengers, with a speed of approximately 200 miles per hour, powered by four 1,500-horsepower engines. The range is over 3,200 miles. If the range is slightly shorter, it can carry up to 75 passengers. If there are fewer than 50 passengers, the route can exceed 5,000 miles. Test flights will first be conducted between Europe and America, and then they will be used in the Pacific Ocean to the Far East and Australia. The ships will be equipped with various facilities, such as air conditioners and soundproofing devices. The crew will consist of ten people, each with a bedroom. The ship's body is even larger than the ship Columbus first used to cross the Atlantic Ocean. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters dispatch)

### League of Nations Fundraising to Aid China's Epidemic Prevention

Labour MP Raises Questions: Foreign Secretary Eden Explains Misunderstanding

[London] Labour MP Smith inquired in the House of Commons today about the British government's policy regarding the League of Nations' fundraising to prevent epidemics in China. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that at the meeting of the League of Nations Council on October 1st, the British government agreed to request the League of Nations Health Committee to draft a plan to advise and assist the Chinese government in epidemic prevention and medical relief, and agreed to provide technical cooperation to China, and requested the League of Nations Assembly to increase annual subsidies to meet the needs of the current special environment. All of the above suggestions have been adopted by the League of Nations Assembly. Eden further stated that the British government expressed great sympathy for the proposal of voluntary donations but temporarily reserved its decision on donations. Smith continued to raise a supplementary question, and Eden replied that it was inaccurate to say that the external representative and Scottish Affairs Minister Elliot first supported the proposal, but that after the external representative met with the Japanese permanent representative, the British representative was instructed not to support the proposal any further. Eden said, "Regarding the increase in subsidies from the League of Nations, we have not only supported it but also voted in favor of it. The only unresolved point is voluntary donations. However, our attitude is very clear: if other countries can contribute according to their share, we will follow suit." Smith then said, "This is what I wanted to know. Shouldn't Britain take the lead in uniting all peace-loving countries?" Eden replied, "There is a misunderstanding here. I did not personally participate in the discussion at the time. I heard afterward that there was no concrete proposal put forward at the meeting. We have supported all concrete proposals that have been put forward. Our position is very clear." Eden concluded, "We have unanimously agreed to increase British subsidies so that more funds can be available. The British government has fully fulfilled its duty here, and our willingness to cooperate with other countries to ensure the success of international voluntary donations is also very clear." (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters dispatch)

### Our Representative Declares Final Position

Brussels: After arriving here today, Dr. Wellington Koo, China's chief representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, declared that unless the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can establish peace based on the principles of international law, China will fight Japan to the end. Koo also said that China will not accept any peace proposal that is incompatible with the spirit and provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. He further said that today's war in the Far East should be a cause for alarm and vigilance for all peace-loving countries. If countries do not make a concerted effort to achieve a peace that is consistent with justice, then any peace-loving country will inevitably suffer aggression in the future. (2nd, National News)

### Enemy Forces Fleeing Across Suzhou Creek in Multiple Directions, Our Encirclement and Annihilation Not a Concern

Most Have Been Cleared, Remnants Still Being Searched For; Fierce Fighting Throughout the Day Along the Guangfu Town to Hujiazhai Line; Enemy Attacking Xiaonxiang and Wangtangqiao Repelled

This newspaper received a front-line battle report at 3:30 a.m. this morning stating that yesterday (the 2nd), from morning to evening, there were battles along the entire line on the left and right flanks and the front, except for the relatively quiet Shixianggong Temple area, especially fierce battles along the Guangfu Town and Suzhou Creek banks. ❶ On the right flank, the enemy north of Suzhou Creek was urgently attempting to penetrate west Shanghai and pressure the southern city, concentrating strong forces to cross the river in multiple directions. After their first attempt to cross the river was defeated by our forces' fierce attack, they again, from the evening of the previous day (the 1st) to yesterday morning, with twice the number of troops as before, under the cover of heavy artillery, forcibly crossed the river at seven locations, namely Zhongshan Road Bridge, Xujia Bridge, Liujiazhai, Beixinjing, Qujia Bridge, Wujiazhai, and Tingtou. We immediately dispatched corresponding forces to block and strike in different directions, fighting fiercely all night. After several charges, by about 8:00 a.m. yesterday, all enemy troops were finally repelled. However, the enemy at Tingtou and Wujiazhai, numbering about 300, were stronger, and after being fiercely attacked by our army, more than 100 remained, entrenched in the civilian houses there. At 0:00 a.m. this morning, they were still stubbornly resisting, but they had been surrounded by us and their annihilation was imminent, not a concern. In addition, in the Liujiazhai area, around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, approximately 200 enemy troops crossed the river and invaded. They are currently surrounded and engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy artillery on the north bank heavily bombarded the Toyota Mill and Beixinjing line. In the morning, a large number of planes heavily bombed various locations in West Shanghai, but our fortifications did not suffer significant damage. ❷ On the left flank, the enemy southeast of Guangfu gathered more than a regiment of troops, first bombarding heavily with concentrated artillery fire, followed by small tanks as a vanguard, covering their infantry, to attack our line from Guangfu Town to Hujiazhai. We had heavy troops stationed there, and immediately rose up to attack, while also constantly counterattacking with artillery. Until dusk, they were still fighting bloody battles on that line. ❸ On the central road, the enemy in front of Xiaonxiang, starting at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, used a large number of tanks, divided along the new and old highways, to attack our Wangtangqiao position east of Xiaonxiang. However, there were not many infantry. Our army used mortars and small steel cannons to bombard them fiercely. After about three hours of battle, the enemy's tanks were still unable to cross our cordon, so after 7:00 p.m. that evening, it gradually calmed down.

A follow-up report received at 3:00 a.m. this morning stated that around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, more than 300 enemy troops on the north bank took advantage of the smoke screen at Yaojiadu, where the Shenji Canal and Suzhou Creek meet, and secretly crossed the river, invading Yaojiazhai on the south bank. Initially, because our army's strength was relatively weak, the position there was broken through by them. Large forces were immediately dispatched to encircle and attack from the southeast, west, and three sides. After a bloody battle into the evening, more than half were killed by us. The remaining remnants, except for a small part who fled back to the north bank, had several dozen remaining who fled eastward in disarray and are currently being searched for. According to military news, our army has redeployed and strengthened fortifications in the Xujia Bridge to Beixinjing area of West Shanghai, making the positions even more solid.

### Enemy Troops Cross Suzhou Creek Again

Encircled and Attacked by Us, Ultimately Unsuccessful

Enemy troops are urgently attempting to achieve a quick victory, concentrating forces on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek and constantly attempting to cross secretly, hoping to find a foothold on the south bank in order to launch a large-scale attack. However, for the past three days, each attempt has been annihilated and repelled by us. Yesterday morning, enemy aircraft were unusually active, but disappeared in the afternoon due to rain. However, the sound of artillery did not stop all day. Enemy troops continued to cross, but most have been cleared. The Central News Agency's accompanying military reporter reported the war situation on the south bank as follows at 10:45 p.m. last night:

Enemy at Liujiazhai Encircled by Us

After the enemy at Chenjiadu, west of Zhoujia Bridge and Zhai, was repelled twice in their attempt to cross secretly, the enemy used the same trick again at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, erecting a canvas bridge under the cover of artillery and smoke. Although our army knew the enemy's plan, they were forced to retreat temporarily due to the dense artillery fire. About 200 enemy troops swarmed in and occupied Liujiazhai. Just as they were trying to build fortifications, our army launched a fierce counterattack. After a long battle, countless enemies were killed. By 3:00 p.m., the enemy was overwhelmed and retreated westward, fleeing into a certain foreign house. The house had a strong structure, like a fortress. The enemy fought stubbornly, and our army was unable to capture it after repeated attacks, so it was surrounded. In the evening, concentrated artillery fire was used to bombard it, and it should not be difficult to resolve the entire situation.

Severely Attacking and Scattering the Enemy at Yaozhai

The remaining enemy troops at Wujiazhai suddenly broke through to the south at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, attacking our Caijiazhai fiercely. They were once broken through, but our army reinforced and counterattacked, and by 4:00 p.m., the original position was restored, and the enemy was heavily surrounded. As of the evening, fighting was still ongoing. To the west, at Yaojiazhai, about 100 enemy troops crossed the river around 10:00 a.m., but after being intercepted by us, many enemies were killed. The remaining 30 or 40 fled east and west, and our army is searching and clearing them out. In addition, enemy troops were preparing to cross secretly at Lujiazhai, west of Zhenbei Road, but after being bombarded by us, the enemy was unable to cross. The Toyota Mill area was calm and there was no fighting.

Intercepting the Few Remaining Enemy at Tingtou

Military news states that approximately 300 enemy troops on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek secretly crossed to the south bank under the cover of artillery fire the night before and divided to attack Tingtou and Yaojiazhai, our army's positions. Our army was prepared and after a valiant counterattack, immediately repelled the enemy in the Yaojiazhai area. However, the enemy troops in the Tingtou area were stronger and forcibly occupied many civilian houses after a fierce battle until noon, and seemed to have a foothold, so the situation was quite critical for a time. Our army rushed to reinforce the encirclement and annihilation, so the enemy's momentum did not spread. After a day and night of interception, there are few remaining enemies, so it is no longer a concern.

Quickly Resolving the Enemy at Zhujia Bridge

At the same time, enemy troops also crossed at Zhujia Bridge, Beixinjing, Xujiajing, and Xujiazhai, but were quickly driven out and cleared by us. The enemy concentrated artillery fire and mortars to bombard the Toyota Mill, and although the factory buildings were damaged, our army's fortifications near the factory were not affected. Enemy aircraft were unusually active along the Suzhou Creek yesterday morning and dropped many bombs, all of which fell in the fields and did not cause any damage. Enemy aircraft disappeared in the afternoon due to heavy rain.

Thoroughly Clearing the Enemy at Xujia Bridge

For the past three days, enemy troops on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek have repeatedly attempted to cross secretly, attempting to attack our south bank positions. From Xujia Bridge through Beixinjing to Yaojiadu at the mouth of the Shenji Canal, several points on the south bank have been crossed by them. The enemy at Xujia Bridge and Beixinjing has been almost completely annihilated after being fiercely attacked by us. Only a very small number of remaining enemies at Xujia Bridge are entrenched north of Hopeland Road, near Liujiazhai. Yesterday morning, the remaining enemies once broke through to the east, rushing to the Toyota Mill area, but were swept by our army with dense machine gun fire, with the dead and wounded covering the ground, and retreated back to Liujiazhai. The night before, our army strictly surrounded and searched the Liujiazhai area for the purpose of clearing it out. Although the enemy resisted stubbornly, countless were killed, and the rest fled into the water. According to front-line reports, the enemy crossing the river at Zhoujia Bridge and Liujiazhai yesterday morning has been completely cleared, and there are no enemy traces near the Toyota Mill, which is firmly guarded by our army.

Artillery Battle All Night, Infantry Melee

The enemy who secretly crossed from Houjiadai, northwest of Beixinjing, and Chenjiadu, at the mouth of the Shenji Canal, to the south of the river the day before, occupied the two villages of Wujiazhai and Tingtou as strongholds under the cover of artillery fire, attempting to advance south. Artillery fire did not stop all day, bombarding our positions. Although the weather was extremely gloomy and cloudy, and the air pressure was very low, enemy aircraft were still active at an altitude of more than 1,000 meters. Our army calmly responded and closely monitored the situation. In the evening, they advanced to suppress and gave them a severe blow. Our artillery teams concentrated on bombarding the river bank, and the machine gun teams advanced towards Tingtou and Wujiazhai.

### 浦江昨晚炮战甚烈

昨日上午敌图登陆未逞

军息，昨日上午七时许，浦江敌舰，又一度向浦东发炮，企图掩护在春江码头一带敌军登陆，但我军早有充分准备，待敌迫近，即以机枪扫射，敌军见势不逞，遂即狼狈逃去，而敌军企图，终无法实施。至九时半，当敌机在浦东侦炸时，浦江敌舰又频频发炮轰击，在后方海空联合行动后，一时形势颇告紧张，我军全线通令严加戒备，敌舰共开二十余炮，又告沉寂。记者事后趋谒某长官，据谈，浦东阵地，绝对无虞，浦江中虽有敌方小汽艇载运兵士，往来于虹口杨树浦一带浦面，但纯系游弋巡视性质，始终未敢有积极行动，且我阵线巩固，警戒严密，敌艇决难驶近浦滩，更无从登陆一步，总之，浦东全线之平稳，一如往日云。

Scouting teams of the forward infantry crawled forward and threw grenades fiercely. There was artillery warfare and infantry melee all night. At midnight the night before, the enemy hiding in Wujiazhai was tightly surrounded by our army and could be resolved.

Central News Agency's accompanying military reporter reported at 12:00 noon on the 2nd that the sound of artillery on both sides of the Suzhou Creek in West Shanghai has not stopped and has lasted for more than 50 hours. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy made two secret crossings, which were intercepted by us. After a fierce battle until dawn today, most of the enemy at Liujiazhai had been annihilated. The remaining despicable elements, without a foothold, retreated stealthily at dawn, so there was no trace of the enemy there. Those who crossed at Houjiadai were forced westward by our pressure and pursuit. There were still more than 100 people who were surrounded by us in the civilian houses of Wujiazhai. The enemy had no way to retreat, so they were still stubbornly resisting. The enemy suffered heavy losses from multiple secret crossings in the past two days. Therefore, since last night, they have been bombarding the entire line from Zhongshan Road to Shenji Canal on the south bank with artillery, and the rumbling sound has continued all night. After dawn today, multiple enemy aircraft dropped bombs to assist in the battle, and our army also returned fire with artillery. The sound of artillery did not stop until noon.

The Enemy at Chenjiadu Once Annihilated

Central News Agency's accompanying military reporter reported at 12:30 p.m. on the 2nd that around 2:00 a.m. this morning, about 300 enemy troops again released a smokescreen from the Chenjiadu area to cover a secret crossing. Our army advanced from Liujiazhai, approached the bank, and swept the smoke with machine guns. Only a few crossed and landed on the south bank, but after being surrounded in three places, they were all annihilated by 4:30 a.m. The enemy deaths reached more than 130 people.

### Enemy Troops Attacking Wangtangqiao Repelled

Military news states that a large enemy tank unit that was attacking Wangtangqiao along the Nanxiang-Dachang Highway also went south the day before and attacked Wangtangqiao, about two kilometers south of Xiaonxiang. Our army fought valiantly and repelled the enemy. The enemy who attacked the north of Jiangqiao Town was also driven away by our army.

### Fierce Artillery Battle in Pujiang Last Night

The Enemy Attempted to Land Yesterday Morning But Failed

Military news states that around 7:00 a.m. yesterday, enemy ships in the Pujiang River once again fired on Pudong, attempting to cover the landing of enemy troops in the Chunjiang Pier area. However, our army was well prepared. When the enemy approached, they immediately swept with machine guns. The enemy saw that the situation was unfavorable and fled in a panic, and the enemy's attempt ultimately failed. At 9:30, while enemy aircraft were conducting reconnaissance and bombing in Pudong, enemy ships in the Pujiang River frequently fired artillery, and after a joint sea-air operation in the rear, the situation became quite tense for a time. The entire line of our army was ordered to be on high alert. Enemy ships fired a total of more than 20 shells, and then there was silence again. After the fact, the reporter went to visit a certain senior officer. According to the discussion, the Pudong positions were absolutely safe. Although there were small enemy motorboats in the Pujiang River carrying soldiers and traveling back and forth on the surface of the river in the Hongkou Yangshupu area, it was purely a patrol nature, and they never dared to take any active action. Moreover, our lines are solid, and the alert is strict. It is difficult for enemy boats to approach the Pudong beach, and even more impossible to land. In short, the stability of the entire Pudong line is as usual.

At 8:10 p.m. last night, enemy ships anchored in the Pujiang River, led by the enemy flagship Izumo, suddenly launched a fierce artillery attack on the Yangjiadu, Zhangjiabang, and Tangqiao Town areas of our Pudong. Our Pudong artillery positions immediately returned fire. At first, there were few shells, but at 8:30, the artillery fire suddenly became dense, with each other firing two or three shells per minute, or five or six shells at most. The rumbling sound shocked the vicinity. At 8:50, the sound of artillery gradually subsided. Earlier, at around 5:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, enemy ships in the Pujiang River had also bombarded our Pudong once, but we ignored it, and it soon stopped.

### The Enemy Again Announces Many Officers Died in Shanghai

Also, 1,600 Wounded Soldiers Were Shipped Back to Japan, Along With Eight Seaplanes and Many Boxes of Parts Shipped to Shanghai

The enemy has announced another batch of fourteen officers above the rank of naval and army captain who died in battle in Shanghai, including Army Major Kajisako Kageyuki, Captains Yamamichi Toyokichi, Tanaka Mutsuo, Kudo Takeshi, Nomura Hiroshi, Nakajima Heisaburo, Shinkawa Nakazo, Tsukiwazawa Motokatsu, Kawaguchi Joji, Medical Corps Lieutenant Colonel Moriya Shozo, Major Ikeda Genshin, Captain Chida Nishio, Engineer Captain Karasawa Osamu, and Navy Captain Nanbu Yukimori. The number of soldiers who died in battle as reported by the enemy media exceeds one hundred per day, which shows how severely the enemy is being hit.

In recent days, enemy troops have repeatedly attempted to cross the Suzhou Creek by stealth but have been surrounded and annihilated by our forces, resulting in increasingly heavy casualties. Yesterday afternoon at approximately 1 p.m., the enemy merchant ship converted into a Red Cross vessel, "America Maru," arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Osaka Wharf. That evening, it loaded over 600 wounded soldiers in preparation for sailing back to Japan today. Additionally, the enemy merchant ship converted into Transport Ship No. 106, "Tsutsuura Maru," transported the sixth batch of over 3,000 enemy reinforcements to Shanghai in one day, and then reloaded approximately 1,000 wounded enemy soldiers that evening, sailing back to Japan around noon on the 2nd.

Yesterday, at approximately 11 a.m., the enemy's giant transport ship "Haruhisa Maru" sailed to Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf, carrying eight assembled seaplanes, many boxes of unassembled aircraft parts, and over a thousand bombs. Additionally, the enemy destroyers "Umikaze" No. 24 and "Yamikaze" accompanied it as escorts, and they are currently docked at the No. 5 and No. 6 pontoons across from the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf.

### The Enemy Army Uses Poison Gas Again

Military News: (Delayed) In the Luodian-Liuhang area, the enemy army has been unusually active again after receiving reinforcements. On the 28th of last month, the enemy actually used poison gas at Gejiatou and Qingshuitou, but due to unfavorable weather conditions and a sudden change in wind direction, our army seized the opportunity to launch a fierce counterattack, killing several hundred enemy soldiers and capturing many enemy soldiers and a considerable number of rifles.

### Enemy Artillery Regiment Commander Seriously Wounded

Ishida Nagatsugu, the enemy artillery regiment commander who was directing enemy artillery operations in Qianjiazhai, north of the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, was struck by artillery fire from our artillery positions on the 31st of last month, resulting in serious injuries. He is currently being treated at the enemy wounded soldiers hospital on Miller Road in Hongkou. At the same time, six enemy junior officers were killed and five were wounded, and a total of over 250 soldiers were killed or wounded.

### The Astonishing Display of the Isolated Army in Zhabei Fully Demonstrates China's Great Progress

Their loyal and courageous spirit is sufficient to revitalize the declining morale; this matter has made a profound impression on the whole world.

—The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Praises Highly——

Yesterday, the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" published an editorial stating that the whole world was greatly relieved to hear that the isolated army in Zhabei had safely retreated from the ruined warehouses north of the Suzhou Creek to a safe area. Although only 339 unharmed soldiers retreated, if there had been no order from Nanjing telling them not to make this pointless sacrifice, then these 300-plus men would undoubtedly have sacrificed themselves. There seems to be no reason to doubt this. This time, the isolated army's final resistance in Zhabei, even if it had no direct military purpose, their loyal and courageous spirit was sufficient to revitalize the declining morale and was of great benefit to China. China has been ridiculed for many years, and this is because most Chinese people embrace the philosophy of "wise men protect themselves," which has led to this. Ordinary Chinese people dare not harm their bodies and skin unless they see an excellent reason for sacrifice. They often think deeply and consider things to the extreme, which Westerners cannot understand. Now, the stance taken by the isolated army in Zhabei is sufficient to break the concept of "wise men protect themselves" and prove that Chinese people can move forward bravely when there is something worth sacrificing for to the extreme. Only Westerners who are familiar with the situation in China can know this, but they must reside in China for a long time before they can know the inside story. China's population is not as dense as that of the West, so its living conditions are not as focused on the concept of society as those of the West. In the past, the family was the largest unit of its society, and all individuals were immersed in family happiness. All of their mental and physical abilities were consumed by the family. They initially did not know that they also had a responsibility to care for the public outside the sacred small group. They had no feeling for the nation, which is commonly called "patriotism." This does not mean that China does not have this virtue. In fact, China has its own virtues, but it follows a different path. However, it is still easy to feel Westerners' healthy concepts. China is very willing to follow in the footsteps of the West in terms of national unity and patriotic spirit, as it clearly knows the need to adopt this attitude. However, not many people are confident that China has made this great progress. The spirit of the isolated army in Zhabei suddenly made an astonishing display, making people know that Chinese soldiers, who are often criticized, can protect the country with sincerity. If they are ordered, they are very willing to shed their last drop of blood to resist foreign invasion. This matter has made a very profound impression on the whole world and is sufficient to arouse the patriotic feelings of hundreds of millions of people. We and other sympathetic observers deeply believe that if they need to make a serious sacrifice, then these remaining three hundred-plus people will gladly sacrifice themselves. The highest command, therefore, does not want them to do this, as this kind of sacrifice will not achieve any military purpose and will be a pain in everyone's conscience. Only those extremists would want this.

### An American Woman Describes Her Journey From Shanghai to Beijing

Chinese People Everywhere Show Resolve and Courage to Resist the Japanese; Railway Workers Maintain Traffic and Absolutely Do Not Fear Threats; The Number of Injured People Is the Largest She Has Ever Seen

According to the North-China Daily News, an American woman who arrived in the capital a few days ago said that from beginning to end, everything she saw along the way was sufficient to demonstrate the Chinese people's resolve and courage to resist the Japanese. Even those lying on stretchers never groaned or complained. The stretchers were carried by exhausted Boy Scouts. There were several such instances passing by her. She departed from Shanghai on October 23rd. A trip that usually takes five hours by express train took 44 hours this time. At times, it was extremely dangerous. When the train was near Suzhou, there were Japanese planes in the sky. This was two days before the Chinese army retreated from Zhabei. Although the Japanese planes tried their best to bomb and strafe the train with machine guns in an attempt to cut off traffic on the railway, the railway workers still maintained train services. The American woman arrived at the West Station and saw at least 2,000 refugees waiting for the train to depart. The train did not arrive at the station until an hour later. The organization in the station was very complete. All passengers stayed away from the station buildings to prevent Japanese planes from bombing the station and causing casualties. She did not see any assistance or blackmail. She saw black smoke rising from the buildings of the Commercial Press in Zhabei, like a volcanic eruption, as several Japanese planes were bombing the area. Stationmaster Wang was very hospitable and allowed several foreigners to board the train first when it arrived. When the train started, the moon was bright in the sky, making it very easy for bombing. The passengers were all terrified, but it was fairly smooth at first. Each station they passed was somewhat damaged, but they still worked as usual. According to a missionary in Hangzhou, the station there had been hit by bombs and caught fire, but the train still left before the fire was extinguished. Not long after, they suddenly heard the crowd shouting madly about planes. The train stopped abruptly, and the crowd jumped out of the doors and windows to escape. Looking up, they saw four planes flying towards the train. The ditches on both sides of the railway were quite deep and filled with water, leaving nowhere to hide. At that point, they could only wait for death. Fortunately, the Japanese planes did not take any action, probably because they had no ammunition left. The train stayed for thirteen hours, and there was a risk of encountering danger at any time, but the Japanese planes were busy bombing Suzhou, eight miles away, and had no time to look back. Since the American woman had run out of food, she got off the train and went to a nearby village to buy sesame cakes to fill her stomach and drank tea at the ferry crossing to quench her thirst. The water was clear and green, which refreshed her spirit. The shop owner and staff knew that she was an American woman and were very friendly. Later, the train continued its journey, stopping from time to time. Thirty hours after the train left Shanghai, it arrived in Suzhou. The station was almost without lights to prevent air raids. There were several hundred other passengers who crowded in from the windows and crevices, including many women and children. Although they were all exhausted, they felt very happy. The journey from Suzhou to Beijing was fairly smooth. Almost every station they passed had been bombed, and some were heavily damaged. The areas on both sides of the railway line were also victims of air raids. When passing through Changzhou, they saw two passenger cars that were almost completely destroyed. The nearby platform had become a pile of rubble, and there were a lot of bloody cotton pads. Several civilians who had been wounded in the war were bandaged and were able to board the train and continue the journey. After passing Changzhou, there were only a few false alarms. After the train arrived in Beijing, the American woman saw Boy Scouts carrying the wounded down. The American woman said that she had never seen so many injured people in her life.

### Japanese Planes Fly Over Defense Line; British Soldiers Open Fire in Self-Defense

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, at 10:15 a.m. this morning (the 2nd), when Japanese planes were heavily bombing the Chinese army positions south of the Suzhou Creek from Jessfield Road to Beixinjing, British soldiers from the Loyal Regiment, stationed on the roof of a high-rise villa in West Park, fired at the Japanese planes with Lewis machine guns, but did not shoot down any. The British soldiers did this to warn the Japanese planes not to fly over the British defense line. They fired four shots the first time, and then fired two more times because the Japanese planes flew back into the British defense zone. Each time they fired, the Japanese planes turned back. It is now believed that the Japanese planes did not return fire at the British defense positions.

According to the North-China Daily News, four soldiers from the British Royal Ulster Rifles, who were defending the area between Jessfield Road and Rue de Saigon, were killed by bullets and several others were wounded last week. This dangerous defense position has now been handed over to soldiers from the Loyal Regiment. The Ulster Rifles will no longer defend the area and will leave Shanghai on November 25th, to be replaced by the Ninghan Light Infantry Regiment. The infantry regiment will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong on November 23rd. The Loyal Regiment, which is defending the area, is using the West Park Villa as its headquarters.

### The Nine-Power Treaty Conference Opens; Various Groups Have High Expectations

Upholding Peace, Truth, and Justice; Hoping the Conference Will Impose Collective Sanctions

Presidents of Five Universities

The presidents of the five national universities of China, namely Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica; Weng Zhirong, President of Tongji University; Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University; He Bingsong, President of Jinan University; and Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University, sent a joint telegram to the Washington Nine-Power Treaty Conference, scheduled to open in Brussels on the 3rd, urging it to take effective measures to curb Japan's aggression in China and to punish Japan's violations of international law and its acts of destroying China's cultural and educational institutions. The original telegram stated briefly, "We especially appeal to your esteemed conference to take strong and effective collective measures to stop Japan's aggression in China and to punish Japan's violations of international law and international covenants, the destruction of universities and other cultural centers, and the endangerment of world peace and culture."

Educational Organizations

The Shanghai Education Association for National Salvation and the Wartime Service Corps of the Education Community issued a declaration yesterday regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, stating that since the September 18th Incident in Northeast China, Japanese imperialism has been reckless and unscrupulous. It has further bullied and oppressed our country, which has always loved peace and been the most benevolent, attempting to annex and destroy it, and realizing its consistent policy of dominating Asia. Recently, from the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident to the August 13th Shanghai Hongqiao Incident, the provocative actions and the various acts of seizing Chinese territory and destroying Chinese sovereignty not only reveal its ambition to dominate East Asia, but also tear up world peace treaties and threaten peace-loving European and American countries. In particular, this time, Japanese imperialism has used naval, land, and air forces to trample on China's economic and cultural construction, which has been striving for since the National Revolution. Hundreds and thousands of large, medium, and small schools have been bombed and destroyed, and countless intellectuals have sacrificed under enemy fire. This inhumane and civilization-destroying atrocity is intolerable to the world's public justice. We believe that the development of human welfare can only be achieved by guaranteeing world peace, and the most fundamental principle of guaranteeing world peace is to respect international treaties. Any country that destroys treaties and arbitrarily invades is an enemy of mankind. We have always trusted and adhered to the Five-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and we are looking forward to just condemnation and substantive sanctions. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference, convened based on the resolution of the League of Nations Advisory Committee, will be held in Brussels and will undoubtedly be based on the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, we in the education community hope that we can fulfill the obligations of the treaty, promote the spirit of the treaty, and maintain peace, truth, and justice. We are a nation that loves peace and values integrity. This all-out war of resistance against Japanese imperialism is to preserve human survival and international peace, and it can even be said to guarantee the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, this tragic and magnificent, long-term war of self-defense will not be shaken or subdued by any circumstances. However, regarding this conference, which is based on the principles of the treaty, determines that the enemy is endangering human happiness and plotting world peace, we have unlimited hope for the peace efforts of our friendly countries. First, is to "respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China." Second, "to give China the opportunity to develop itself and maintain a strong and stable government." Third, "to maintain the principle of equal opportunity for all countries in industry and commerce." Fourth, "not to seek special privileges in China that would hinder the rights of friendly nations." China's efforts over the past ten years are designed to and what China hopes from friendly countries is only to have the Nine-Power Treaty realized. Japanese imperialism, not only has it failed to abide by it, but it has also inflicted all kinds of cruel aggression on China, destroying these four principles without exception. Therefore, our demands on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference are: First, like the resolution of the League of Nations, declare Japan to be an aggressor and a treaty violator. Second, order Japan to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the treaty, withdraw all naval, land, and air forces in China, and abolish all pseudo-organizations that have undermined China's sovereignty, independence, and administrative integrity since the September 18th Incident. Third, any international treaties between Japan and any country that violate the principles of the treaty should be declared invalid. Fourth, if the treaty-violating country does not fulfill all the resolutions to uphold the treaty, the participating countries should, together with the member states of the League of Nations, impose collective sanctions with the most effective force, and, if necessary, use force to stop Japan's aggression in China. Fifth, the participating countries and the member states of the League of Nations should provide China with substantive assistance. Sixth, the content of the treaty should be expanded at this conference to make it more concrete and effective. Our only purpose is to implement the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, restore the original state of sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity, to establish a collective security system in the Pacific, to firmly establish it for world peace and for justice, and to provide a solid guarantee for the nation. At this conference, friendly countries should give brutal Japan the most effective sanctions, and we also hope that we will join hands with educators across the country, with the responsibility of intellectuals and with the spirit of non-submission and non-compromise, to unanimously advocate and promote the success of the conference and give the enemy a severe blow.

Press Association, etc.

The Shanghai Press Association and three other groups sent a special telegram to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 1st, and translated it into Chinese and Western languages, distributing it to all sectors. The translated text of the telegram is as follows: To the Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels, At the time of the opening of your esteemed conference, our associations solemnly request your esteemed conference to make a practical determination on the responsibility of the aggressor, and to plan practical steps, not only to assist China in continuing its war of self-defense, but also to stop Japan's aggression and thoroughly correct all illegal acts by Japan in China, so that international law and order can be maintained through collective sanctions, and world peace can be preserved on a just and stable foundation. Shanghai Bar Association, Certified Public Accountants Association, Medical Association, Press Association, East India.

### Women's League

The Nine-Power Treaty Conference opened in Brussels today. In addition to jointly sending a telegram to Brussels to advocate justice, the Shanghai Chinese and foreign women's organizations, the Chinese Women's Movement League, specially sent another telegram to the Chinese delegation yesterday, expressing their views. The original telegram stated, "To Dr. Liu Weijun and the representatives Guo, Qian, and Two of the Chinese delegation in Brussels, Please firmly uphold the dignity of the treaty so that the international community does not fall into a state of lawlessness. Shanghai Chinese Women's League."

### Our Army on the Pinghan Railway Crosses the Zhang River and Advances North

Our Army in Eastern Shanxi Counterattacks Vigorously; Several Heights Seized in Mengteng Village; The Enemy Has Been Driven Out of Ningjin City

[Jinan] Military News: (1) The enemy in Fenghuangdian transported barbed wire from Dezhou to build fortifications and plan to occupy it for a long time. (2) On the Jinpu Front, the enemy in Lijizhai scurried out with over a hundred men yesterday afternoon, harassing Majiaqiao, but were repelled by our forces, and many were killed. (3) Over two hundred enemies in Ningjin City were driven by our guerrillas to more than twenty miles north of the city. The enemy set fire before retreating, causing a terrible massacre. (Special Dispatch, 2nd)

[Nanjing] Military News: The enemy and our forces are still engaged in fierce battles near Yangquan and Puding in Eastern Shanxi. The battle situation is very intense. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 2nd)

⊙Xinxiang After the bloody battle on the Zhang River inflicted a heavy blow on the enemy, the enemy troops in Hebei have not dared to invade south again. Most of the enemy forces that harassed Henan have been separately resolved by us. Only in Hongshacun near Fenglezhen and Nanlunzhang, there are still three to four hundred remaining enemies in each place, and they are all surrounded by our large army and can be completely annihilated soon. It is reported that a part of our army crossed the river on the 1st and advanced north. Although the enemy in Eastern Shanxi has recently invaded Niangziguan, there are still heavy troops guarding the dangerous passes on both sides of the pass. Our reinforcements are now counterattacking from Yangquan, and it will not be difficult to eliminate the enemy who entered the pass. Looking at the overall situation on the northern battlefield, the enemy, with limited forces, has to cope with such a vast battlefield and cannot allocate enough troops. Therefore, the units on each line are transferred from time to time, and the enemy soldiers are mobilized all day long, exhausted.

[Nanjing] Military News: After the enemy north of Xinkou in northern Shanxi fiercely bombarded our positions with artillery and air strikes on the 2nd, they followed up with infantry and pounced on our forces.

Our defending soldiers fought bravely, and the casualties were almost exhausted. Reinforcements are now being sent to respond. On the right flank, in the Mengteng Village area, our army's counterattack was very successful. Taking advantage of the victory, we launched an attack and seized several important mountain heights, capturing many guns. The enemy responded with tanks and increased its forces by more than one regiment to counterattack. They are now facing each other. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 2nd)

[Nanjing] The Chinese military authorities are now sending a large number of reinforcements to Shanxi to stop the Japanese army's advance towards Taiyuan. According to semi-official sources here, part of a certain army is now shifting south from northern Shanxi and joining forces with the large army concentrated in Yangquan to launch an offensive. The Chinese army believes that Taiyuan is related to the entire war situation in Shanxi, so the Yangquan line has decided to defend it desperately under any circumstances. The Chinese army on the Pinghan Railway is also preparing to launch a large-scale counterattack near the Zhang River. (National Telegram, 2nd)

### Unshakable Policy is Appropriate

— Yi

The Brussels Conference opens today. The northern and southern battlefields have also reached a very tense moment.

These days. On the northern battlefield. The enemy moved the main force of the Pinghan and Jinpu lines west, launching fierce attacks on Taiyuan. On the southern battlefield. The enemy, braving the fierce artillery fire of our army. Several times. Forcibly crossed the Suzhou River. Obviously, it also wants to occupy all of Shanghai in the short term.

The enemy's intention is very obvious. While the Brussels Conference is discussing the issue of aggression. Quickly seize our country's two major military centers. Show off to the world's peaceful forces. Only then can we wait for an opportunity to put forward bandit-style peace conditions.

We must not fall for the enemy's trick. We must concentrate the national strength on a long-term war of resistance. So that the enemy, no matter when. Does not show much power. As for diplomacy. As long as we hold on to the original position. Be careful to guard against the enemy's conspiracy.

At this important moment. We especially cannot be afraid of the expansion of the war. And have a little bit of luck. In any case. The policy of resisting to the end cannot be shaken in the slightest.

### Korean Revolutionary Party Broadcasts to Concentrate Anti-Japanese Forces

Final Victory Undoubtedly Belongs to China, Korean Nation Should Implement General Mobilization, Violent Japanese Collapse, Weak Nations Liberated

The Propaganda Department of the Korean National Revolutionary Party, in response to our country's war of resistance against Japan, explained the reasons for the withdrawal of our Shanghai troops, detailed the enemy's absurd actions and exaggerated propaganda, and awakened the oppressed nations of the world, especially the Korean nation directly suffering from the pain inflicted by the Japanese enemy, should rise up to resist Japan. Yesterday, it broadcast to Korean compatriots at home and abroad in Korean. The main points are translated as follows:

Dear 23 million compatriots, the Sino-Japanese War, which is now focusing the eyes of people all over the world, "especially our Korean nation, which is closely related to victory or defeat," has begun for two and a half months. In these two months, the sacrifices on the Chinese side have been many, but the sacrifices of the enemy are also considerable. Recently, due to the fall of Dacha, the Chinese army temporarily withdrew from Zhabei and Jiangwan, and the enemy seems to have won a great victory and made frantic propaganda. In fact, this is a shameless and absurd action. Because the Chinese army's withdrawal from Jiangwan and Zhabei is a strategic means and has no impact on the overall situation. Instead, it extends the front line, which is unfavorable to the enemy. The Russian "Daily News" said that the Japanese army's capture of Dacha this time extended the front line and strategically fell for China's trick. A reporter from a certain English newspaper also said that because the Chinese army withdrew from Zhabei and Jiangwan, the Japanese army's front line was extended, and the attack was less favorable than before. He also ridiculed the enemy's fragility and recklessness by saying that it took the Japanese army seventy-six days to occupy the North Railway Station. It can be seen that our observation is very correct. The reason why the enemy spent more than 20,000 casualties and consumed a lot of ammunition to desperately attack Dacha is due to the unfavorable situation in the North China war and the dangerous situation on the Soviet-Manchurian border. It attempts to quickly end the Shanghai war in order to concentrate on North China. However, the Shanghai war will not end until all the enemy troops who came to Shanghai are wiped out. No matter how evil it is, it can only promote its own demise. In any case, as long as China prolongs the time and can maintain it for a year, it is obvious that the enemy will collapse by itself. Judging from the evolution of this war, the internal chaos of the enemy, and the international situation, we can be sure that the fate of Japanese imperialism has come to an end. The time for the liberation of China and other weak Eastern nations has come. The Japanese imperialist's brutal war of aggression against China has made the Chinese nation, which has suffered from violence and oppression for forty years, unable to endure it any longer. It is determined to wash away all the past shame with the red blood of 450 million people and strive for the independent survival of the nation-state. The entire Chinese nation is united like iron, and everyone is determined to sacrifice for the country, regarding death as returning home, and bravely and tragically resisting to the end. We heard that when the Chinese army withdrew from Zhabei this time, more than 20,000 refugees fled into the concession. Someone said that you should have fled earlier. Why did you take the risk in the line of fire? They replied very excitedly, if we all flee, who will help the soldiers fighting in the blood with tea, meals, washing, and all the miscellaneous services? These few words are enough to make the general foreigners who have always looked down on the Chinese people fully understand the awakening and greatness of the Chinese nation. On the contrary, what is the situation of the enemy? Their people oppose the war of aggression, the soldiers do not use their lives, and even quite a few of the enemy's lower-level officers are unwilling to go to war and commit suicide on the way. The warlords and political parties squeeze each other, and the warlords and warlords also have conflicts of opinion. The assassination of Ugin Ichisei and the rumor that Araki Sadao is being monitored are all facts that show that the enemy is bound to perish in this war, and China will absolutely win. What is the reason for this? ㊀ Because this Sino-Japanese War is not a war of opposition between imperialism and imperialism, but a war of aggression in which Japanese imperialism has no end and wants to turn North China and even the entire China into its exclusive colony. ㊁ Following the prolongation of the war, the enemy country's economy is exhausted, and social unrest is becoming more and more serious. The various contradictions within the enemy are becoming more acute, and there is a great possibility of a large-scale civil war breaking out. Moreover, Japanese imperialism owns many colonies. Taking advantage of the opportunity of this war, it is an opportunity for the anti-Japanese revolutionary forces in Korea, Taiwan, Manchuria, and other places to raise their heads fiercely. These forces are all terrible forces that are enough to control the fate of Japanese imperialism. ㊂ Because Japanese imperialism is in the position of an aggressor in this war, the weak nations and peace-loving people of the world extremely hate Japanese imperialism. In particular, Soviet Russia, which has a vested interest, gives sincere sympathy and assistance to China. This is a fact that everyone knows. At the same time, China has no colonies at all. In the past, various parties and factions and military leaders with many different political views have already abandoned all political views at this time. Under the boiling anti-enemy heart and the excited national consciousness, the people are united and vowed to resist to the death. The unity of the Chinese nation is not something that any force can hinder or disperse. China has no worries at home and has international sympathy. Its victory is undoubtedly certain, and China's victory is our victory. The day of the revival of the Chinese nation is the time of liberation for the weak nations in the East. Therefore, all weak Eastern nations suffering from imperialist oppression should make organic connections and actively assist China in terms of material resources and manpower. In particular, we Koreans, who are directly oppressed by Japanese imperialism, must realize the general mobilization of the entire nation with extraordinary awareness and determination, regardless of men, women, old, or young. We must directly participate in the war and fight our enemies to the death. Rise up, compatriots, we believe that anyone with a Korean soul who does not want to live a slave life will not hesitate at this time. Our immediate tasks are: ㊀ No matter what party or faction, we must eliminate all political views and factional concepts, unify under one banner, and concentrate and strengthen revolutionary forces. In the face of such a powerful enemy today, what cannot be sacrificed for the nation-state? ㊁ All unorganized masses are organized and trained at the same time. Workers in factories, farmers in rural areas, students in schools, and merchants in cities should do their best from their respective positions and use various means such as riots, assassinations, and sabotage to disrupt the enemy's front and rear, causing the enemy's abdomen to be in trouble and collapse by itself. The final victory will naturally belong to us. If we are still not aware at this time, act as a pawn for the enemy, or secretly communicate with the enemy, then we are the public enemy of the Korean nation and also the shame of the Korean nation.

### Public Single System Reform for the Money Industry

Elimination of the Names for Large and Small Public Singles, Implementation Set for the 5th of This Month

The Shanghai Money Industry Association held its 49th member representative meeting of the third session yesterday at 2 PM. Present were representatives from 46 firms including Fu Yuan, Fu Kang, Xian Feng, Heng Xun, Hong Sheng, and Tong Yu, as well as over 80 representatives such as Zhang Wenbo, Yan Dayou, and Xu Wenwei. Mr. Liu Wuqiao chaired the meeting and Ge Huaiqing served as the recorder. A. Reporting Items: ① Minutes of the last meeting's resolutions. ② October correspondence. ③ Approval for the National Salvation Public Bond Money Industry Fundraising Team to urge bond payments; it was resolved that members of the association would pay an additional 30% on top of the 20% already paid for the public bonds they had subscribed to. The deadline for submission was set for October 29th, and the funds have already been collected and submitted to Fu Yuan and Tong Yu for collection. The amounts from each firm have been compiled into a report and submitted to the main team for safekeeping and onward transmission. ④ Various reports regarding the reserve fund. B. Discussion Items: ① Proposal for public resolution on the October interbank lending rate, resolved at 4.5%, with interest arrears accruing. ② Proposal from the Executive Committee: The current practice of issuing large public singles for amounts of 500 yuan or more and small public singles for amounts less than 500 yuan for members of the association, and settling them daily with the reserve fund, is considered an unnecessary duplication of effort and a waste of procedures. It is now proposed to eliminate the names for large and small and instead issue one single, regardless of amount, including odd amounts, and settle them daily, which is considered more convenient. Is this feasible? A resolution was sought through discussion and was passed, with implementation set for the 5th of this month. ③ On October 6th, a joint meeting of the Executive Committee of the Association and the Executive Committee of the Reserve Fund was held regarding raising funds for comfort donations. A proposal was made to approve the letter from the Shanghai Municipality's Comfort Committee, which requested that the Association pledge 25,000 yuan in comfort donations for the northward comfort mission. A resolution was passed stating that since the comfort donations would be allocated among various organizations, it would be difficult to decline. Therefore, it was resolved that each member firm would donate 500 yuan, with the Association temporarily covering any shortfall, and a request for ratification was made. The ratification was approved.

### Residents of the Southern City Continue to Move Yesterday

The City Remains Calm and Unalarmed, Moving Vehicles Still Follow One Another Endlessly

Since the enemy declared that they would launch a major bombing campaign against our defenseless Southern City, residents there, "considering the indiscriminate killing and brutality of the rabid enemy army, have temporarily moved to avoid unnecessary sacrifices." However, most stores on various roads have remained open for business as usual, and passersby are not in a state of alarm. Although it rained yesterday, moving vehicles at Laoximen, Xiaoximen, and Laobeimen were closely following one another endlessly. Around 11 AM, all kinds of vehicles became particularly congested, all heading towards the iron gates at the junction of the Chinese and French areas. The French Concession police authorities specially dispatched constables to direct traffic at various iron gates in Xuhui, Fenglin Bridge, Xie Bridge, Malong Road, Ximen, Nanyang Bridge, and Laobeimen. In the Chinese area, police officers, citizen training corps, and security teams maintained order. People carrying clothing bundles, luggage, and waiting in vehicles had to stand by for half an hour or an hour. Some petty thieves, seeing an opportunity, dared to take advantage by offering to help carry things at the iron gates, resorting to robbery and snatching. The French police, realizing the situation, dispatched a large number of plainclothes detectives to patrol and protect the area to prevent incidents.

### Japanese Soldiers Forcibly Seize Our Rice Boat in Shanghai

The United States Protests to Japan

The Shanghai China Press reports that Japanese sailors suddenly crossed the Suzhou Creek under the Wuzhen Road Bridge one afternoon and forcibly seized a rice boat that was unloading rice. Upon investigation, the boat was docked within the U.S. military defense zone. Commander Baumont of the 2nd U.S. Marine Brigade protested to the Japanese naval authorities. The commander of the Japanese naval landing force expressed sincere apologies to the commander of the 2nd U.S. Marine Brigade. According to reports, Japanese soldiers fired a shot into the air when they forcibly seized the rice boat. The Japanese military has not yet indicated that they will return the seized rice boat, so the matter cannot be considered closed. The Shanghai Times also reports that a second Suzhou Creek incident occurred at noon on the 6th. The incident occurred within the U.S. Marine defense zone. At noon on the 1st, several Japanese sailors forcibly seized a rice boat that was unloading rice on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek under the Wuzhen Road Bridge. They forced the boatman to unload the rice there. Subsequently, Commander Baumont of the 2nd U.S. Marine Brigade lodged a formal protest with Hasegawa, Commander of the Japanese 3rd Fleet. Hasegawa expressed sincere apologies for the incident, but the rice boat and rice seized by the Japanese military have not been returned to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. Although the Japanese side has guaranteed that similar incidents will not occur in the future, the U.S. authorities cannot consider the case closed because the rice boat and rice have not been returned to the original owner. Negotiations are ongoing. Furthermore, Japanese soldiers fired a shot at the boatman unloading rice within the U.S. military defense zone. The U.S. authorities have also protested to the Japanese side regarding this point. The Japanese side claimed that the shot fired was not a live round. According to investigations, a Japanese sentry fired a shot at the boatman before the Japanese sailors crossed the Suzhou Creek and forcibly seized the rice boat, taking it to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek.

### Mobilizing All Shanghai Children to Solicit National Salvation Savings

Since the all-out war of August 13th began, the Shanghai YMCA has held a campaign to solicit national salvation bonds, with a goal of 100,000 yuan. It is said that the goal was already fully achieved a week ago. This time, the association has launched a campaign to solicit national salvation savings from 10,000 households. The opening ceremony was held on the 31st of last month (Sunday) at the association. The overall organization is divided into one hundred teams, each led by a team leader responsible for soliciting donations, with the goal of reaching one hundred households. Given the association's organization and fundraising spirit, the goal of 10,000 households should not be difficult to achieve.

Before the campaign even started, it was said that the internal organization had already been completed. Each team leader was selected and appointed. From the list of team leaders, we found a child who was only nine years old, named Li Ersheng. Driven by curiosity, I couldn't help but visit her to see if this young friend could take on this fundraising responsibility.

When I went to visit her, she had just returned home from school, so we were able to have a thirty-minute conversation.

"My parents are very enthusiastic about soliciting national salvation bonds. This time, because members of the YMCA asked us to help, my father asked me to be the leader of a team," she began to tell me as if she were an adult: "But my ability is very small, and I'm afraid it will be difficult to take care of everything, but for the survival of the country, I can't worry about so much."

"So, how are you going to collect national salvation savings?"

"The maids in our house and the maids in our relatives' houses can all be solicited. Fortunately, it is one yuan per household, and a few cents a month can be saved from then on. As for our young friends, there are many, they can all participate in savings, and they can also help me to solicit donations."

"What do you say to them?"

"That's easy. This money isn't a donation. The savings are still our own. We can save money on the one hand and save the country on the other. This reason couldn't be better."

"Moreover," she continued, "my father allows me to buy savings every month. My own candy money is also included. This money will be my education expenses in the future."

"Do you go to solicit alone? Wouldn't your strength be too small?"

"My strength is certainly too small to go to solicit alone, but my father helps me a lot and goes to solicit everywhere. Also, my young friends can also help me to solicit donations. I think their parents will definitely help them and go to solicit donations in all directions."

"I think if all the children in Shanghai can work hard for this matter, maybe in the near future, it can spread everywhere. Wouldn't that be very effective? These things depend on the adults in society to lead us, to mobilize all the children in Shanghai, and to work hard to solicit national salvation savings."

From her remarks, we can see that we should mobilize all the children's parents in Shanghai, hoping that these parents will come out and lead their children to take on this urgent task, and promote national salvation savings to the upper and lower classes of people throughout China. This is the best way to cultivate children's national consciousness, and it is the only new force to create a new China.

### A Female Worker Dedicates Her Family to the Cause

Comfort Art Exhibition Only Lasts Three Days - Please Purchase Tickets and Bid Quickly

Since the opening of the Comfort the Soldiers Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition, it has been about ten days, and the purchase of tickets and bidding has been very enthusiastic. Yesterday morning, a Cantonese woman in her forties came and gave 100 yuan in cash to the Boy Scout, stating that she was willing to donate half of her life savings to the soldiers on the front lines. The Boy Scout led her to the office for a detailed inquiry. It was learned that the woman's name was Wu Yuzhen, and she lived in the Zilaihuo Company in Nichengqiao. She used to work in a factory in Zhabei. Because she witnessed the tragic arson and massacre committed by the Japanese army when they occupied Zhabei, she was willing to donate half of her life savings to help the soldiers on the front lines bravely kill the enemy and avenge her compatriots. At that time, the visitors and staff at the venue were all in awe. They informed her of the rules of the venue and asked her to choose a painting. Ms. Hao did not care about the painting, but the staff chose a painting by Li Qiujun called Talented Women Sending Clothes to the Frontier as a souvenir. It is thought that the wealthy merchants and virtuous people of Shanghai must also be moved by this.

The Women's Painting and Calligraphy Association and the Chinese Drama Painting Association are also working hard in Shanghai. At this comfort the soldiers art exhibition, Ms. Li Qiujun took the initiative to call on everyone, and many people responded, including Madam Liao Xiangning, Zheng Shangyun, Wu Qingxia, Bao Yahui, Chen Huaqiu, Pang Zuoyu, Yu Danhan, Yuan Qingyao, and Yun Dinghui.

### City Boy Scouts Raise Over 30,000 Cotton Vests

Result of Efforts by Over Two Hundred Members

After the Shanghai Municipal Government launched a campaign for all sectors of society to donate and produce cotton vests for our frontline soldiers, the Boy Scouts Troupe of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also took on the task of soliciting 2,000 items. However, through the concerted efforts of the troupe members, more than 30,000 items have now been raised, a remarkable achievement worthy of admiration. According to reports, the process of the troupe's donation of cotton vests is outlined as follows: The troupe's fundraising method started with its own members, with members diligently soliciting donations from households in their neighborhoods or companies and organizations where they worked. Family members of the troupe members were also involved in production. It is also reported that foreign women, such as Mrs. American Yue Di, personally made and donated ten wool shirts. As a result, 17,382 items were donated, along with 3,237 yuan and some change in cash. In total, more than 30,000 cotton vests were produced. Each cotton vest had a cloth label sewn on, with inscriptions such as "Return My Rivers and Mountains," "National Hero," and "Serve the Country Loyally" to bravely kill the enemy, and the names of the producer and fundraiser were noted. After the troupe's efforts to promote this, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and people from all over the country have adopted this cloth label method. The troupe member with the best results was Qin Zhongyao, who contributed 1,873 items. There were more than 30 other people who donated more than 900 items. The troupe has only over two hundred members, and they all carried out the fundraising after their service hours, so it is truly rare to have such amazing results.

### Various Aspects of the Fallen Capital

— Zhu Jingxin

A Record of Seventy-Odd Days of Observations

(1) Severance of External Communication

Beiping is the hub of the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Beining railway lines. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the Pinghan line was the first to be interrupted. The battle in Langfang immediately cut off the Beining Railway, and traffic was immediately interrupted. When the Pingjiao army fought, the Pingsui traffic was also suspended. The traffic between Beiping and the outside world was completely isolated. At that time, only the Pingmen branch line (Beiping to Mentougou) was still passable. On July 29, Song Zheyuan went to Pingguomen and transferred by car to Changxindian. The Japanese army also tracked him to Baoding. They threw cards and stationed troops in Mentougou. The Pingmen branch line was also obstructed. The traffic around the city of Ping was cut off, and food and fuel sources were cut off, causing panic. Subsequently, the Maintenance Committee was established, and after coordinating with the Beining Railway Bureau and negotiating with the Japanese military, it first sought to restore passenger and freight traffic between Pingjin. After several compromises, it was approved. Every morning, Pingjin opened a pair of trains. Passengers from Ping to Jin were extremely crowded, and Japanese military vehicles were endless along the way. At each station, they had to wait for the train for ten minutes to one or two hours. The entire journey was only 240 miles, and it took more than twelve hours. The Japanese also carried out strict inspections at Beiping Qianmen Station, Yongdingmen Fengtai, and other places. The most attention was paid to military students and people related to the Party and government shares. If there was any disagreement, they would be detained. Even the aviation caps worn by young children were considered border violations. Each time the train arrived at the station, at least fifty passengers were detained and taken to the Ning Bing detachment for interrogation. The Beiping-Tianjin section of the Dongbei was also realized. At present, the entire line has direct express trains from Ping to Shenyang, which depart once every day at 12:30 noon, and trains from Pingjin to Jin Yutong, which also depart once every morning. Those who could not bear the brutality of the Japanese went from Ping to Jin, and took a boat to Qingdao and Shanghai. This line has become the only channel for North-South transportation. The Pingsui Road was interrupted at the end of July and then entered a military period. In order to facilitate transportation, the Japanese repaired the tracks with transportation soldiers. There is no definite news about passenger and freight cars. Only the Pingmen Line was reopened last month to facilitate the transportation of coal, and it runs twice a day, specializing in fuel transportation and not selling passenger tickets. As for the Pinghan Road, it has not been restored since it was interrupted. At present, Japanese troops are sent to guard along the stations.

In terms of aviation, the air routes of China Aviation and Eurasia Airlines were suspended after the incident. The Huitong Company, which was established during the Jicha Political Committee, was originally intended to facilitate the connection between Tokyo and Beiping. After the incident, all the airports were occupied by the Japanese army and used as bases for bombing North China. Every day, thirty to fifty enemy planes flew in groups, hovering in the sky, and all air traffic was cut off. After the Ministry of Transportation opened the nine-province long-distance telephone call, the connection between Ping City and various parts of the South was extremely convenient. At the same time, wired and wireless telegrams were also very developed. After the Japanese army occupied Beiping, the telephone lines were completely cut off, and the generators of the radio stations were seized by the Japanese. People were sent to monitor the telegraph bureau, and telecommunications traffic was suspended except for local calls. Recently, the Japanese repaired the long-distance telephone lines, but only Beiping and Tianjin Japanese Concession could talk. Wired electricity is also limited to reporting to Northeast China and Japan. The Tianjin Muyou Office set up a telegraph bureau on Dongmalu, specializing in receiving and sending telegrams, but the inspection was extremely strict. Beiping Post Office was also seized by the Japanese recently. Postal items (letters, packages, etc.) must be strictly inspected. Coupled with the inconvenience of transportation, the delivery of postal items is extremely slow. Express letters sent from Ping to the outside world only needed to be sent from the car five minutes before departure in the past, but now they must be sent thirteen hours in advance for the Japanese to inspect and approve before they can be delivered.

(2) Japanese Ruling Policy

After the Japanese army entered the city on a large scale on August 7, they first suppressed the anti-Japanese forces. Ruan Xuanwu's troops were disarmed, and there were more than 10,000 police and security teams with a large number of rifles and pistols. In addition to removing the security team leader who was a military officer, Pan Yugui was ordered to hand over all the police guns and transport them to the barracks of the country in Dongjiaomin Lane for preservation. The private possession of guns by the people was also limited to hand over to the government within three days. At that time, about 10,000 guns of various types were obtained. At that time, the police only relied on short sticks to maintain order. Therefore, robberies occurred endlessly during the day. The police could not intervene even if they saw it. When it affected the residences of Japanese and Korean people, the Japanese felt that their own safety was in danger. Therefore, they especially considered returning a part of the guns. According to the number of police districts, each district was given 50 rifles and 10 pistols, and each branch was attached with ten bullets. They were also instructed not to open them without reason. Even when necessary, they should first ask for approval before firing. Therefore, although a small number of police officers carry guns now, they are actually not much different from those without guns.

The national flag, party flag, party emblem, party card, and books such as the Three People's Principles were strictly prohibited after the Japanese army entered the city. The portraits of the Prime Minister in public places such as government offices and schools were all destroyed. The Japanese instigated the police to strictly investigate party affairs personnel and those involved, and regarded them as communists and Blue Shirts. They even encouraged citizens to report them, resulting in false accusations being heard every day. At that time, a book of the Three People's Principles was the evidence to constitute this crime. Xie Zhenping, the director of the Weiniu Bureau, who was crowded with prisoners in the Japanese military police headquarters, prepared epidemic prevention vaccines in Tiantan to prevent the epidemic. The Japanese army believed that they were manufacturing germs, and suddenly accelerated the arrest and detained him for two months before releasing him. There are even more people in prison who do not know what crime they have committed. Life and property have no protection. Except for traitors, no one dares to guarantee their own safety. The residences of central and local officials and soldiers residing in Beiping were inspected and arrested by the Japanese military police every day. The property management committee organized by traitors claimed to manage the property of important people and return it when they return to Ping in the future. In fact, there is no guarantee, and it is confiscated invisibly. The lives and property of the people have no protection. Japanese special agencies, military police, and military departments can issue orders at any time, arbitrarily inspect and arrest people. Even Japanese and Korean ronin, under the pretext of searching, no one dared to provoke the rebellious elements who forcibly demanded money. Japanese military vehicles drove on the streets every day, ramming into crowds. There must be several people who died tragically on the wheels of the Japanese every day, and there is no place to complain.

Our compatriots are in a place of lewd power, suffering from destruction, and the Japanese rule implements a high-pressure policy, so everyone dares to be angry but dare not speak. There is another group of Japanese who pretend to buy people's hearts and establish the so-called Shifu Headquarters. They also set up offices in various cities, with Japanese people who are proficient in the situation in our country as the chiefs, and third- and fourth-rate traitors as the deputy chiefs. They also invited local traitorous businessmen and local tyrants to establish the Yinfu Committee, using words to promote the virtues of the Japanese army, and occasionally solving disputes for the citizens. They must also be able to take effect under the condition that the Japanese side is not harmed. In fact, it is just to lure our country's Zhou people for the Japanese side and make them follow the example.

(3) Implementing Slavish Education

Beiping is known as the city of culture and education, and the student movement has always been active, which has long been hated by the Japanese. This time, the Japanese army entered the city, and the cultural institutions were destroyed. National schools such as Peking University, Normal University, and Peiping University were all changed into military camps, and the faculty and staff fled. The items in the school were destroyed without leaving anything. Students from various schools were arbitrarily arrested and killed. (After the troops stationed in the law school withdrew, the school collected the houses and found three students stabbed to death with bayonets.) However, it was during the summer vacation, and most of the students returned to their hometowns. Even a part of them fled Beiping after the incident. At present, except for Yenching University, which is still open as usual due to church relations, the others have been suspended.

There are many middle schools in Ping City, and private schools are subsidized by the government. After the incident, because of the small number of students and the lack of funds, most of them were suspended in an invisible way. Occasionally, a small number of schools that use the tuition fee as their monthly fee reluctantly open, and there are few students. Elementary schools and public schools are forced to open classes. Those in the textbooks that promote national consciousness and anti-Japanese thoughts are deleted and changed by the Maintenance Association's Cultural Group and the Social Bureau's Education Section. The special line of elementary and middle school textbook review committee reviews and deletes them one by one, and originally intends to reprint them. Because they were in a hurry, they temporarily cut and posted them for application. All the national flags related to party righteousness, the country, and the nation, as well as the blue sky, white sun, and red earth, were deleted.

There have also been great changes in the curriculum. Party righteousness has been completely cancelled. The Japanese also ordered the police bureau to discuss, and each school was forbidden to teach party righteousness. In addition, civics must be self-cultivation, military training, military nursing, and Boy Scouts were changed to martial arts, and a Japanese language course was added, forcing students to attend classes in order to cultivate traitors who have no national consciousness, and in the future, they will become their active puppets.

The Japanese severely cracked down on past student movements. At the same time, they created a pseudo-student organization, bought a group of shameless students with money, and forcibly pulled classmates and non-students to organize the so-called North China Student Federation. However, the appeal was very weak, and only a dozen people joined the extravagance. At the opening ceremony, the Maintenance Association ordered the principals of each school to bring students to attend. At that time, there were only hundreds of primary school students. The entire team was in the auditorium, and the speeches were all clichés. Those who spoke extravagantly had no impression on the listeners, and it turned into a slippery show.

The Japanese intend to fundamentally cancel higher education. However, general literati and traitors covet the beautiful names of the principals of various schools, so they also organized the North China Education Federation to replace the highest educational organ. However, the Japanese do not actively maintain this, it is just an empty institution.

### Sugar Industry Association Resolves on Public Sale of Japanese Sugar

Organizing a Public Sales Office for Centralized Sales; More Than 40,000 Bags of Japanese Sugar Stored in Warehouses

### Enemy Planes Run Rampant, One Family Dies Tragically

Seven or eight miles away from Nanxiang, there is a place called Gejia Village. Since the Shanghai war, its family members have long fled due to war terror, leaving only an old woman with a child to guard the house. On the 24th of last month, when enemy planes were rampant, they saw that the house was tightly closed, so they dropped a heavy bomb, which knocked down the entire house. The old woman and the child were killed, and the state of their flesh and blood was really unbearable to look at.

### Brief News on National Salvation Work

Since its establishment, the Wartime Service Corps of National Jinan University students has spared no effort in its work.

### Germany and Italy and the Far East Incident

— Hu Nianzhi

The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be held in Beijing today. The success or failure of this conference depends on the attitude of the major countries towards the Far East issue. The diplomatic strategy that our country adopts in this conference also depends on the attitude of the major countries. Therefore, at the beginning of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it is indispensable to review the attitudes of the countries.

Since our country launched the anti-Japanese war, the sympathy of the governments and peoples of the friendly countries for China can almost be said to be completely consistent. Whether it is Britain, the United States, France, or the Soviet Union, although the degree of sympathy is different and the pace is inconsistent, there is absolutely no difference in opposing Japanese aggression. Among the so-called "friendly countries," we feel uneasy; only two countries, Germany and Italy.

Until recently, we all recognized Germany and Italy as our friendly countries. However, since Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact last year, we have had to be wary of Germany, this friendly country. Although the German government stated that it would not apply to China when the Anti-Comintern Pact was signed, we must be wary of the allies of our enemies.

Germany did not attend the Beijing Conference. According to the German official explanation, if Germany were to attend the Beijing Conference, it would have to defend Japan, which would inevitably cause dissatisfaction in China, so it simply did not attend to avoid being in a dilemma. Germany's attitude has shown that Germany sympathizes with the aggressor. In addition, since August 13, German newspapers have repeatedly defended Japan, saying that Japan's actions in China are aimed at anti-communism and preventing red. Unexpectedly, our friendly country Germany actually colluded with Japan and falsely accused China of the Three People's Principles as "red." In any case, we cannot but admit that this statement by the German newspapers is an unfriendly expression to our country.

What is even more worthy of our attention these days is the news spread by the enemy that the German Ambassador Tao Deman is now mediating the conflict between China and Japan. At the same time, the German financial tycoon Luther arrived in Tianjin and gave a speech to the Japanese Allied News Agency, advocating cooperation between Japan and Germany to develop North China. We hope that these two messages spread by the Japanese side are completely rumors. If not, these actions of Germany are not only an unfriendly expression to China, but also a terrible conspiracy.

Unfortunately, Italy's attitude in this Sino-Japanese war is no better than Germany's. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's article published in the newspaper even publicly sided with Japan. Although Italy attended the Beijing Conference, according to the newspaper reports, its only role was to defend Japan's position. What makes us most sad is that Italy is preparing to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact at the time of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It turns out that Italy has decided to sacrifice its friendship with China for the sake of cooperation with the aggressor country in the Far East.

Italy is a fascist country, and Germany is also a fascist country. Although fascism is incompatible with the Three People's Principles, we will never oppose Germany and Italy because of this. We believe that there is only the opposition between the peace group and the aggression group in the world today. The opposition of the so-called ideological group does not exist at all. Even if it exists, China will never participate in the struggle of the ideological group. China is unwilling to participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact for this reason. But no matter whether it is a fascist country or a democratic country, if it helps our enemies, falsely accuses our national system, or even colludes with aggressor countries to share the spoils together, that is definitely not something we can forgive.

In the middle of the war of resistance, our country only recognizes Japan as our enemy, and we are willing to get along with all other countries in a friendly manner. But among all the "friendly countries," we should be able to distinguish. Treating everyone as an enemy is tantamount to condoning the real enemy. But treating everyone as a friend is tantamount to not having a friend. In the middle of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, whether in diplomacy or in public opinion, we must have this clear understanding.

### The Towns in Western Shanghai are Peaceful

Xujiahui and Caohejing are as Quiet as Usual; Hongqiao Town Has Been Bombed Repeatedly and Suffered Damage

After our right-wing front moved westward, people in Shanghai had many rumors about the recent situation in the western suburbs. In fact, the towns are still peaceful, and the residents are working as usual. Xujiahui Town is located at the junction of China and France. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the French authorities have set up barbed wire on Haige Road. The market in the town is also lively. Although there are enemy planes reconnaissance and distributing leaflets, there is no other danger. The people in the town are calm. Since the front line moved, Caohejing Town has been visited by enemy planes from time to time. Fortunately, the town is small and sparsely populated, and it is not militarily important. With the close maintenance of the local authorities, the shops are still operating as usual, and it is as quiet as usual. Since Hongqiao Town was repeatedly attacked by enemy planes, most of the residents in the town have fled. Recently, because it is closer to the Beixinjing Zhoujiaqiao front line, enemy planes have been bombing continuously in recent days. The rumbling sound shakes far and wide. Countless gun and cannon marks have been added to the broken walls and ruins of the town that were bombed earlier.

### 銀錢業內匯發展貸款收買農產

The remittance business within the city's banking and financial circles has become increasingly active due to the relocation of various important industries to the interior and the return of people from various provinces and cities in Shanghai to their hometowns to seek a living. As a result, capital is flowing into the interior. Various banks and financial institutions are planning to establish branch offices and representative offices in the interior to meet the needs. Additionally, the climate this year has been favorable, with timely and adequate rainfall, resulting in bumper harvests of agricultural products in various regions. However, due to enemy aircraft bombing everywhere, the enthusiasm for purchasing agricultural products such as cotton has decreased compared to the past. Currently, in order to regulate the rural economy and facilitate the flow of food and daily necessities, it has been decided that the various inland branch offices and financial institutions should provide as much loans as possible to support industries and businesses in purchasing agricultural products. According to a Xin Xin She reporter, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are currently implementing planned loan programs in various regions. The Agricultural Loan Bureau is actively promoting agricultural association loans, marketing loans, and agricultural product mortgage loans, and is preparing to store large quantities of agricultural products to meet the needs of the long-term war of resistance.

### 慈聯會注意患病難民管理

The Charity Federation Pays Attention to the Management of Sick Refugees

Sheltering 500 Refugees in Western Shanghai

The Charity Federation recently issued a notice to all shelters stating that, for the purpose of notification, each shelter should assign personnel specifically to manage sick refugees in order to avoid confusion and delay in treatment. The following points should be noted: 1. Registration of sick refugees: On the day of the medical consultation, the assigned personnel should pre-fill the registration form with the name, department, and other information of the sick refugees so that the doctor can examine them by name upon arrival, to avoid omissions and save time. 2. Dispensing medicine: Many refugees are illiterate. After preparing the medicine, the assigned personnel should immediately distribute it to the sick refugees and explain the dosage instructions on the bottle label in detail to avoid overdosing or underdosing. 3. Custody of empty bottles: After the medicine is finished, the empty bottles should be properly stored and returned to the medical section in a collection, in order to protect public property and prevent them from being used for other purposes. Furthermore, the association transports and shelters many refugees from war zones such as western Shanghai every day. Yesterday, the association's shelters dispatched trucks again, rescuing 490 refugees from areas such as Caojiadu and Hongqiao in western Shanghai, and sending them to the association's Dahong, Qingliang, Jincheng, and other shelters for accommodation.

An Unexpected Twist in a Robbery Case on Xinzha Road

Two Detectives Accused of Dereliction of Duty

At around 6 PM the day before yesterday, five robbers broke into the home of Xue Hongmao at No. 14, Lane 353, Xinzha Road, and robbed him of thousands of dollars worth of property. At the time, Chinese and Western detectives from the Xinzha Police Station arrested two robbers, Ni Chongqing and Tang Yuhuang, and recovered a portion of the stolen goods. They also killed a robber, known as "Little Tailor," and seized a handgun with nine bullets. The case was handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. However, detectives handling the case discovered that Chinese Constable Gao Xiaomin, No. 084, from Jiangsu Province, and Chinese Constable Li Shaoshan, No. 1994, from Jiangbei, who had apprehended Tang, had pocketed a portion of the stolen goods without turning them over to the police station, embezzling them for personal gain. The two constables were detained for investigation. It was learned that Li had taken gold jewelry the night before to Tu Wenji's pawnshop at No. 230 Avenue Edward VII, exchanging it for 145 French dollars. Gao had also exchanged a portion of the stolen goods at a pawnshop for 24 French dollars. Gao also confessed to finding 40 French dollars inside a telegraph pole at the corner of Qingdao Road. This morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, where the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the case and filed charges against them under Article 129 of the Criminal Law for dereliction of duty, requesting that they be punished according to the law. Judge Chen Lin reviewed the case and questioned the two defendants, and then decided to postpone the hearing for further review.

Two Robbery Cases on Rue du Pont Neuf in the French Concession

Da Xin Bookstore Suffers Significant Losses; Diners Rob Zhengxing Restaurant

Da Xin Bookstore, located at No. 15, Mai'anfang, Rue du Pont Neuf in the French Concession, is owned by Xu Changchuan from Taizhou. Xu, being wealthy, attracted the attention of robbers. At 6 PM on the first of this month, six robbers suddenly knocked on the door under the pretense of delivering a letter. They immediately pulled out weapons, demanding silence. One robber guarded the main entrance, while four robbers entered the house, driving the owner's family into a room and locking them up. They then ransacked the rooms upstairs and downstairs, overturning chests and boxes. They robbed 6,070 yuan in cash, a farmer's check for 200 taels of silver, and a diamond ring worth over 200 yuan, and fled in a chaotic manner. After the incident, the owner's family rushed out and shouted for help. Chinese Constable No. 541, along with three Western constables, were patrolling and saw a robber fleeing in a panic. They rushed to apprehend him, but the robber drew a gun to resist arrest. However, the bullet jammed and could not be fired. Chinese Constable No. 542 also drew his gun and fired a shot into the ground. The three Western constables apprehended the robber and seized his handgun. He confessed that his name was Zhao Kunrong from Wuxi and that all the stolen goods had been taken away by his accomplices. The police chief ordered him to be detained. At noon yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The Police Department's lawyer, Chen Ming, explained the case and requested that the authorities apprehend the accomplices as soon as possible and investigate the case before proceeding with the trial. Judge Chen Shuoying questioned the defendant and ordered him to be detained pending further interrogation.

Two robbers suddenly entered Zhengxing Restaurant at the intersection of Rue de l'Avenue Dubail and Rue des Villas in the French Concession at around 8 PM the day before yesterday. They first had a meal and then went to the counter to pay the bill. The robbers then pulled out handguns and threatened the cashier, robbing all the cash, small coins, and copper coins in the counter and cash drawer, totaling over 30 yuan. They then fled in a chaotic manner. The owner reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation.

Tuition Fees for Students Not Attending City Schools to be Refunded Regularly

Municipal Bank Rushes to Process, Refunds to Begin on the 8th

Although the city's municipal primary and secondary schools have gradually reopened after the war, the situation is different in these extraordinary times. The Social Affairs Bureau has publicly announced that students who are unable to attend school may have their families present receipts to the original collection points to claim refunds for prepaid tuition and construction fees. However, many schools entrusted the Municipal Bank to handle the collection of fees, and the bank refused to issue refunds based on the original receipts due to procedural issues, causing the students' families to make futile trips. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau, upon the request of the students' families, discussed the matter with the Municipal Bank and agreed on a solution, instructing the students' families to first have the receipts stamped by the original schools to prove that the students had not attended school, and then claim the refund from the Municipal Bank. After the solution was announced, the students' families flocked to the bank to claim the refunds. However, the branch offices that originally handled the collection of fees, such as the Ximen Branch, simultaneously moved to the main office at No. 66 Tianjin Road yesterday, causing great difficulty in handling the large number of people claiming refunds. After further discussions between the bank and the Social Affairs Bureau, it was agreed to publish a notice stating that refunds would begin on the 8th of this month to allow time to process the procedures. A notice was posted on the spot, and the students' families gradually dispersed.

Since the full-scale war of resistance, the general public believes that the duties of the Boy Scouts are only to provide first aid or security. In reality, it is definitely not so. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Social Boy Scout Group has done its best to unleash the vitality of its great youth and has taken on many important tasks in the war of resistance.

On October 27th, the group, at the request of the ×× department of the ×× army, sent eight comrades, led by team leader [ ], to the countryside to take on rear-area work.

### 渡河敵軍大部肅淸劉家宅殘敵卽可殲滅

Most of the Enemy Troops Crossing the River Have Been Eliminated; Remaining Enemy Troops in Liujiazhai Will Soon Be Annihilated

Enemy Troops in Wujialu Were Attacked on Three Sides and Suffered Losses; Our Troops Hold the Fanhuangdu Railway Station, Confronting the Enemy Across the River; Fierce Skirmishes Continue on the Jiangqiao-Xiaonanxiang Line

This morning, the North China Daily News carried a strange report that our troops had withdrawn from Nanshi. This newspaper's reporter met with our military authorities this afternoon, who absolutely denied this, saying that Nanshi is close at hand, and the facts are there for all to see, leaving no room for concealment. Speculations and reports by foreign newspapers are castles in the air and are enough to confuse people. As for the front-line situation, our troops still have the upper hand. Although the enemy crossed the river in multiple directions, they were encircled and severely attacked by our troops one after another, and eighty or ninety percent have been eliminated. Currently, only a small number of enemy marines are entrenched in civilian houses in Liujiazhai, stubbornly resisting. Our troops are searching and clearing them out. The remaining enemy troops in Wujialu are more numerous and can be eliminated after being attacked on three sides by our troops for two days and nights of bloody fighting. The village is still guarded by our troops. As of this afternoon, the enemy has only been shelling from across the river and has not dared to attempt to cross again. Foreign newspapers also claimed that the invading enemy troops numbered from 8,000 to 10,000, which is also completely false. This newspaper's reporter personally inspected the end of Avenue Haig at western Shanghai this afternoon. At the time, the sounds of machine guns were dense, with occasional artillery fire. The British troops stationed there were calm. Our troops were still holding the Fanhuangdu Railway Station, confronting the enemy across the river. [ ] folded to Xujiahui. When inquiring about the war zone refugees, they also said that the invading enemy troops were being encircled and fiercely fought. Finally, the reporter went to Nanshi for a week-long tour. Everything was normal. Stores were open for business, and the police were maintaining order. Although those who had moved to the concessions were more crowded, most were still able to live and work in peace, without any panic. All of these are ironclad facts. The reports in foreign newspapers are truly unknown on what they are based.

### 渡河敵軍已先後擊潰肅淸

The Enemy Troops Crossing the River Have Been Successively Defeated and Eliminated

Only a Small Number of Marines are Still Entrenched in Liujiazhai; Our Troops Still Firmly Defend the Line Along the River on the South Bank; Enemy Troops Flanking Xiaonanxiang Repelled

The enemy on the north bank of the Suzhou River has been using artillery fire and smoke screens in recent days to forcibly cross the river, attempting to invade our positions on the south bank. After fierce attacks by our troops, the enemy troops crossing the river at several locations have been almost completely eliminated, leaving only a very small number of remaining enemy troops. However, the enemy's ambition has not died. From yesterday morning to noon, they dispersed their forces again, dividing them into multiple groups, and forcibly crossed the river. There were traces of enemy troops in various locations, including Chenjiadu from Zhoujiaqiao to Shenjihang Estuary, through Liujiazhai, Beixinjing Beach, Qujiaqiao, Wujialu, and Yingtou. Our troops were prepared and immediately dispatched troops to block and intercept them, attacking the enemy troops with a calm posture. Without waiting for the smoke screen released by the enemy to dissipate, they immediately fired densely with machine guns into the smoke screen. As a result, many enemy troops behind the screen were shot and killed. The remaining stubborn enemy troops continued to break through, leading to fierce fighting. The battle lasted until the afternoon, when the rain poured down, and the enemy's movement was hindered. Our troops took advantage of the rain and launched a fierce attack from the north of Lincoln Road, advancing forward. They cut off the enemy troops crossing the river into several groups, causing them to lose contact with each other and immediately surrounded them. Although the enemy stubbornly resisted, under the brave charge of our troops, the fierce battle lasted until dawn this morning. The enemy troops along the river were successively announced to have been eliminated and defeated. The defeated enemy troops scattered in all directions, with only a few hiding in the broken walls. Our troops are conducting search operations. In the Liujiazhai area, a small number of enemy marines have also fled into the broken walls and are stubbornly resisting. This newspaper's reporter inspected Avenue Haig this morning and found that our troops were still holding the west of the railway line. The sounds of rifle and artillery fire were intermittent, indicating that our troops were still firmly defending the line along the south bank of the river.

There are still fierce skirmishes on the Jiangqiao-Xiaonanxiang line. The enemy once attempted to flank Xiaonanxiang from Hujiasi, but was eventually driven away by our troops. The fighting north of Guangfu was relatively quiet.

### 昨晚浦江兩度砲戰

Two Artillery Battles in the Huangpu River Last Night

Enemy Warships Struck by Our Fire Emit Urgent SOS Signals; Military Depot at [ ]shan Wharf Also Shelled by Us

Our artillery positions in Pudong unleashed powerful firepower again at 8:15 PM last night, fiercely bombarding the enemy base in eastern Shanghai and the enemy warships in the Huangpu River. For a time, the rumbling artillery fire shattered the silence of the entire line. The enemy warships hastily opened fire to return the attack, so the surface of the Huangpu River was flashing with fire and the sound of artillery fire was dense, alarming the entire city. After ten minutes of intense fighting, a thunderous explosion occurred on the surface of the Huangpu River. It was confirmed that one of the enemy gunboats anchored at buoy No. 3 was hit by our shells, causing many casualties among the soldiers. The ship was in urgent need and emitted frantic SOS signals, sailing downstream to avoid our fire. However, our brave artillerymen continued to fire, and soon the enemy's ammunition depot at [ ]shan Wharf was hit again by our shells, penetrating from the top of the warehouse into the interior. The sound of the explosion was very loud, and the extent of their losses can be imagined. Our troops stopped firing after completing their mission. The enemy's artillery fire also gradually decreased. At 9:15 PM, the enemy warships tried to retaliate, first opening fire on Pudong. Our troops refused to remain silent and returned fire, and the intensity of the battle was even greater than the first. Both sides exchanged fire for about half an hour, and then the sound of artillery fire gradually decreased. Many of the shells fired by our side landed in the enemy's base areas in Yangshupu and Hongkou. Two places caught fire after being hit. The enemy warships fired a total of more than two hundred shells, only destroying some civilian houses and killing or wounding more than ten civilians. After that, the entire line was extremely quiet. At 11 AM today, enemy heavy bombers dropped bombs and bombed Pudong, and enemy warships took the opportunity to open fire, but it was very sparse. Our troops did not pay attention to it. The enemy fired a total of more than twenty shells, and then it became quiet.

### 周家橋頑敵渡河被我殲滅經過

Enemy Stubbornly Crosses the River at Zhoujiaqiao and is Annihilated by Our Troops

Releasing Smoke Screens to Cross the River; Surrounded on Three Sides, Not a Single One Survives

This newspaper's reporter recently met a commander who had just returned home from Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai. Talking about the anti-war situation on both sides of the Suzhou River, he saw bravery and valor. He said that the troops he led were currently stationed in a section west of Zhoujiaqiao. At 3 PM the day before yesterday, the weather was rainy and the artillery fire from both sides was fierce. The enemy's artillery constantly shelled around our defenses. Suddenly, on the riverbank,

Smoke Screens Scatter

It was difficult to distinguish across the river. Only the sound of footsteps came, knowing that the enemy had secretly crossed over to invade. I ordered my troops to disperse and take a three-sided encirclement, waiting quietly to kill the enemy. Initially, hand grenades were thrown at the pontoon bridge from a distance. Because the bridge was made of canvas, it was soft and did not explode. Then, machine guns were used to fire fiercely, and the enemy dared not continue to cross the river. However, those who had already arrived in Henan were about one company, more than 300 people. These people were the enemy's daredevils, charging and colliding, and their momentum was very fierce. In addition to sending several machine guns to guard the mouth of the ferry bridge, the troops on three sides,

Fiercely Charged and Killed

In terms of firepower, the two sides were evenly matched. Fortunately, our morale was loyal and brave, and we fought regardless of ourselves. After more than an hour of fighting, about 200 enemies were killed. The rest also rushed to build fortifications, relying on the fort to stubbornly resist. At night, our army once again attacked and suppressed, and the sound of killing shook the sky. The enemy fought and retreated, bridging to the riverbank ferry crossing, and there were only a dozen stubborn enemies left. Eventually, they were completely wiped out by our army. At this time, the smoke screen had dissipated, but it was seen in Hebei

Dozens of Corpses Were Left Behind

The enemy had retreated, but the ferry bridge had not been removed, as it was prepared for those crossing the river to retreat. How could the enemy have no hope of returning today? We immediately destroyed and reduced the ferry bridge. The bridge was made of several layers of canvas stitched together, which was quite strong and sturdy. The ends were tied to wooden stakes and tightened with screws. It was about five feet wide and could advance on four routes at the same time. The river in this section was relatively narrow, so its use was also convenient. Without fierce gunfire to stop it, 300 enemy soldiers could cross it within ten minutes. Now our army has seen through the conspiracy, and the defense is tight. Wherever there is a smoke screen, machine guns are immediately used to strafe, so that the enemy does not dare to move forward at the risk of death. Otherwise, it is not enough to dare to have the ambition to steal and cross.

### 敵在天通庵附近築成臨時飛機塲

The Enemy Has Built a Temporary Airfield Near Tiantong'an

It is confirmed that another temporary airfield has been built by the enemy near the China Brewery in Tiantong'an. As for the claim of building an airfield near the large stadium, it has been found to be untrue after investigation. The reason why the enemy has been so fiercely attacking Liujiazhai, Yaojiazhai, Zhoujiaqiao, and Jiangqiao Town in recent days is that on the one hand, they dream of going directly to Xinlonghua from here to cut off our Shanghai-Hangzhou road's transportation line, and on the other hand, they want to occupy our Hongqiao airfield in the southwest, so as to use it as a base for their air force. However, we have built strong fortifications and deployed significant forces in various places south of the Suzhou River. The enemy's attempts are doomed to fail.

Enemy Warships Transport Aircraft Parts

The enemy's giant transport ship Hayatomo, which sailed to Shanghai yesterday, carried more than 500 boxes of unassembled aircraft parts. It docked at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf and began unloading ashore this morning (the 3rd). The enemy ship Chunjiumaru, which transported eight enemy seaplanes and a large number of bombs to Shanghai, set sail back to Japan last night.

### The World's Eyes Focused on Brussels for the Opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

The United States, Britain, France, and Belgium held preliminary talks yesterday; Chinese representatives prepared to elaborate on their solemn stance; Japan denied a willingness to accept mediation from other countries.

⊙Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference opened here at the Tongru Academy at 11:00 this morning. A total of nineteen countries are participating in the conference, and the list is as follows: ㊀ Eight original signatory countries, namely China, the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal, with Japan being the only one refusing to participate; ㊁ British Dominions and Territories, represented by the United Kingdom, including Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and India; ㊂ Five later signatory countries, namely Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Bolivia, and Mexico; ㊃ One non-signatory country, the Soviet Union; in addition, another non-signatory country, Germany, declined the invitation from the Belgian government to participate. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas dispatch)

⊙Brussels: Today, the world's attention has focused on Brussels, as the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, attempting to resolve the Sino-Japanese War by agreement, will open here at 11:00 AM today (7:00 PM Shanghai time). It is understood that this conference has not established a rigorous and unchangeable procedure. The first step is to explore whether Japan is prepared to engage with the conference and whether Japan can state under what conditions it would be willing to cease hostilities. Furthermore, it is necessary to pre-determine under what conditions the Chinese government would be prepared to discuss peace. Only after the above prerequisites are met can the likelihood of a resolution be assessed. It is reported that after the opening of the conference today, the main representatives of various countries will successively deliver speeches, generally seeking mediation of the disputes. Furthermore, according to news from the Japanese side, the Belgian Foreign Ministry yesterday inquired with the Japanese Embassy whether it would be willing to send an observer to the conference venue. It is said that the Japanese Ambassador has replied that he does not advocate any contact with the conference. It is also heard that the Italian representative also visited the Japanese Ambassador last night for a long conversation. At the same time, the Japanese side denied rumors here that Japan is willing to consider British and American mediation. On the Chinese side, Mr. Gu Weijun broadcast a speech last night, stating that the main facts of the current situation are nothing more than the conspicuous violation of the Nine-Power Treaty by Japan, and that this violation not only involves China alone, but also has close relations with all other signatory countries. Furthermore, on the eve of the conference's opening, everyone's attention is focused on Mr. Davis, the US representative, who, since arriving in Brussels, has been busy contacting various delegations in an effort to draft a proposal. However, so far, all parties deny that any concrete proposal has been established. However, representatives of some countries said that after exchanging views as much as possible, the conference will adjourn and delegate the mediation duties to several countries. However, if the conference cannot make any decision on how to stop the Sino-Japanese War, it will at least be able to issue a declaration, reaffirming the dignity of the treaty and condemning acts of aggression. Although this declaration may not have practical effect, it can at least record in the moral realm the attitude of the participating countries against Japanese military actions. Furthermore, it is heard that the US representative Davis has modestly declined the chairmanship of the conference, and that the most popular candidate for chairman thereafter is Mr. Bruce, the Australian representative who previously chaired the Montreal Conference, otherwise it is proposed to elect from representatives of the Scandinavian countries. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters dispatch)

⊙Brussels: British Foreign Secretary Eden held talks with US Chief Representative Davis at 11:30 this morning. Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Mofield, counselors of the US delegation, were also present. The representatives of the United States and Britain had lunch together at noon and continued their talks, which ended at 3:00 PM. Eden then went to meet with Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, while Davis held talks with Chinese Chief Representative Gu Weijun. Mr. Gu also visited French Foreign Minister Dalbos. At 5:00 PM, Spaak, Eden, Dalbos, and Davis held an informal meeting. It is reported that the results of the meeting have proven that the opinions of the four countries are in complete agreement, and future actions will also be consistent. In addition, although the Belgian cabinet tide has not yet been resolved, it is heard that Spaak has agreed to the request of the British, French, and American representatives to serve as chairman of the conference. In any case, Spaak will host the opening ceremony of the conference tomorrow as the host, delivering a welcome speech to the representatives of various countries and explaining the spirit and goals on which the conference is based. Then Eden, Dalbos, and Davis will successively deliver speeches, explaining that the opinions of their respective countries are in complete agreement. It is estimated that Chinese Chief Representative Gu Weijun will also speak after them. In short, the entire time of tomorrow's meeting will be devoted to speeches by representatives of various countries, and at the next meeting, all documents of the conference will be studied, as well as the views of China and Japan. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas dispatch)

⊙Brussels: This afternoon, it was rumored here that if some countries could come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, Japan might accept it. Regarding this statement, the Japanese Embassy in Belgium said that it had not received any news from Tokyo. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas dispatch)

### Japan Raises War Bonds

First batch of 200 million yuan

[Tokyo] The Japanese government, in order to cope with the Sino-Japanese war, feels a deep financial strain and has issued 200 million yen in war bonds, with the subscription deadline on November 6. The bonds will be repaid in seventeen years, with an interest rate of 3.5%. In December, another 500 million yen in war bonds will be issued. (Haitong News Agency dispatch)

### China Promotes National Consciousness, Unlimited Future

French Historian Evaluates Far East War; China Will Surely Win Final Victory

[Paris] Professor Ju Yu, a famous historian at the University of Paris, recently published an article in 'Capital Weekly', stating briefly: 'The current struggle in the Far East cannot be judged by the military strengths of China and Japan. China has a population of 400 million. If it can fully develop its national consciousness, even if it cannot win victory at the moment, its future is truly unlimited. The progress that China has recently made has already been very significant. After being tempered by iron and fire, if its national consciousness becomes more and more developed and strong, then even if Japan occupies Peiping, Zhangjiakou, and part of Shanghai, and establishes buffer states in North China and Inner Mongolia, similar to what it has done in Manchuria, the final result will certainly not be Japan absorbing China, but China absorbing Japan. Since ancient times, foreign tribes have invaded China and been assimilated by China countless times. Conversely, if China's internal divisions resume after the war ends, Japan will not only be able to maintain its vested interests, but also be able to dominate everything in China, just as a small number of British people did in the vast land of India in the past. This will certainly not be a blessing for China.' Ju Yu continued that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Premier of the Chinese Nationalist Party, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, created the Three Principles of the People, advocated equalization of land ownership, and control of capital. Since 1925, the prestige of the Nationalist Party has increased daily, the people's patriotic heart has been aroused, and China has been transformed into a modern country, all thanks to the Nationalist Party. For this reason, Japan believes that if it does not plan at this time, there will be no chance in the future. Specifically, with regard to the current war, the heroic and magnificent resistance of the Chinese National Army near Shanghai has shocked the world, and the barbarity of the Japanese army's methods of warfare and the cruelty of its massacre of civilians have aroused international indignation. The impact has attracted worldwide attention, so what was once considered a miracle has actually become a reality, and is very likely to happen. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas dispatch)

### Songjiang Suffered Another Tragic Bombing by Enemy Aircraft Yesterday

More than 30 bombs were dropped in the urban area, destroying many houses and causing numerous casualties.

Songjiang, November 2nd telegram: This area has been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft. The city and its suburbs, as well as prosperous areas, have been completely destroyed. At around 9:00 AM today, two more large enemy seaplanes came and circled over the city for reconnaissance. After about an hour, they dropped three bombs along the Huangpu River and then flew southeast. At 10:25 AM, even though there was a drizzle in the sky, three enemy heavy bombers still flew over the city, circling for a week before dropping more than 30 bombs and then quickly flying back in the original direction.

### Residents of Nanshi Intensify Relocation Today

After the enemy sent a notice to the consulates of various countries in Shanghai that they would bomb the undefended Nanshi area, residents of southern Shanghai, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, moved to the concessions one after another. This reporter personally went to inspect the three locations of Nanyang Bridge, Old North Gate, and Xie Bridge at 8:00 this morning. Vehicles for relocation and people moving were shoulder-to-shoulder and axle-to-axle. These three locations are the passages between the Chinese area and the concessions, and were therefore regarded by those seeking refuge as convenient routes. However, judging from the situation this morning, the so-called convenient routes were no longer entirely so. The authorities of the French Concession, in order to maintain order in the concession, require that relocation vehicles from the Chinese area must first apply for a pass from the Lujiawan General Patrol Room. Although such passes are never restricted, the sheer number of applicants requires a considerable amount of time, causing the relocation vehicles close to the Chinese area sections of the three above-mentioned passages to stop and not advance due to this reason, creating a very long line. Later vehicles continued to arrive, resulting in a situation where the section of Mingguo Road from Nine Acre Field in the west to Old North Gate in the east, and the section of Fangbang Road from Mingguo Road in the south to Nanyang Bridge in the west, were all seized. However, the situation at Xie Bridge was better. The steel mesh of the passages was forcefully cleared and maintained by Chinese police and French police respectively, so order was still good.

Nanshi has had no market activity since this morning, as most residents have fled. Therefore, in the small teahouses, only tofu stalls and the like are slightly embellished. It has been found that the current residents are mostly elderly, weak, poor people, people from churches, and disabled people from disabled people's homes.

### Italy, Germany, and Japan Anti-Comintern Pact

Will Soon Be Signed in Rome

[London] Italy, Germany, and Japan will sign the Anti-Comintern Pact in Rome on November 6. According to the Soviet Union's News, if the above news is indeed true, 'this action cannot but have a considerable impact on Soviet-Japanese relations.' The newspaper also hinted that the Soviet Union might reject Japan's request to conclude a fishing treaty. Furthermore, the original text of the Anti-Comintern Pact is said to have been drafted, and according to reports, it does not contain any military clauses. The important clauses mostly coincide with the existing German-Japanese agreement, and the German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, is said to represent Germany in signing.

### Japan Reforms Cabinet Structure

[Tokyo] The government is preparing to organize a wartime headquarters and at the same time reform the cabinet system, that is, to establish a new large agency within the cabinet called the Supervisory Bureau, which will supervise the administrative conditions of various provinces from a national policy perspective, and whether various administrative agencies have truly implemented the national policy guidelines determined by the cabinet. The fundamental reform of the cabinet system and the establishment of a new Supervisory Bureau seem inseparable. This is a landmark reform of the Japanese cabinet. The government leaders are also considering establishing an information bureau secretariat in order to decisively carry out the cabinet's major reforms. (3rd, Allied News Agency dispatch)

### The Rumor That There Were No Troops Withdrawing from Nanshi is False

Today's Shanghai-based North China Daily News reported that our security forces in Nanshi had withdrawn. According to this reporter's investigation, there have never been any troops stationed in Nanshi. All security has been maintained by the Self-Defense Corps with the assistance of the police station. What the newspaper reported is a misunderstanding.

### Enemy Troops Bombarded Yanglinkou, Attempted to Land, But Failed

Were Bravely Repelled by Our Troops; Enemy Ships Arrived Off the Coast of Hanjiang

[Changshu] At around 9:00 AM on the 2nd, the enemy again attempted to land in Yanglinkou in the rain, and used aircraft to provide cover and bombardment. After our brave counterattack, the sound of artillery and the sound of bombing occurred simultaneously. The sounds heard in the urban area here were very loud. After a fierce battle until noon, the sound of artillery gradually subsided, and the enemy retreated due to being unable to withstand the attack. (2nd, Special Dispatch)

[Fuzhou] Five enemy ships have arrived off the coast near Hanjiang on the border between Fu'an and Putian, seemingly with ulterior motives. We are closely monitoring their actions. (2nd, Special Dispatch)

### Brief Commentary

### Phase

The Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Is scheduled to be formally opened at 11:00 AM today. In the auditorium of the National Research Institute in Brussels. Therefore, at the time of this writer writing this manuscript. It is exactly the time when the heroes are 'discussing and generating wind' in Brussels. What the effect of the conference is. It is difficult to predict at this time. Perhaps quite pessimistic about the conference. Perhaps still hopeful about the conference. Mostly nonsense. I am not making such a 'prophet-style' guess now. What I want to say. Is a few factual issues.

The original Nine-Power Treaty was produced. Was signed to solve the China issue after the European War. It seems that the Nine-Power Treaty. Is entirely designed to protect our country's territorial sovereignty. In fact, since the signing of the treaty. How much of our country's territorial sovereignty has been invaded. And it is the country that is invading our country. That is, the country that signed the treaty to protect our country's territorial sovereignty.

The current situation. There are only two major front lines of war between aggressors and pacifists. It is definitely not just about a certain country and a certain place. Therefore, wanting to predict which front line will win or lose. That is, you can see whether that front line is united, consolidated, or loose. With this standard. Vaguely. Can be known.

### The Fierce Battle Against the Enemy at Guan

Four enemy divisions crossed the river, suffering heavy casualties; our army held out for three days and nights with high morale.

Renqiu communication: Guan is located on the south bank of the Yongding River, east and west are less than a hundred miles from the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways, respectively. The left and right are in a crucial location being the communications center of the northern section of both roads. Since the ×××th Division took over the defense, it has actively constructed fortifications. In less than a month, the enemy has attempted to cross the river secretly more than thirty times, all of which were repelled. On the morning of October 13, the enemy crossed the river with four divisions, dividing into upper and lower reaches. With one and a half divisions, they launched a fierce attack on the Xiyu and Dongxi Yangcun crossing points on our left flank, with cavalry in the lead and infantry in the rear, followed by heavy artillery and tanks, advancing in four columns. Reaching the river bank, they spread to the left and right, forming a straight line, moving closer and closer, the area of the battle line became longer. At the same time, more than 30 aircraft provided cover, and destroying our position, artillery shells were like flowing beads. The soldiers of our ×××th Regiment, under this rain of bullets, smoke, and mist, remained calm and fought back. Enemy corpses were piled up, and the river was blocked. The fierce battle lasted all night. Finally, because the enemy's artillery fire was too fierce, we had no choice but to abandon the Xiyu crossing point. One and a half enemy divisions crossed the river from here. This meant that one hundred miles between Yongding and Daqing Rivers, and countless people were ravaged by the enemy.

After the enemy crossed the river, on one hand, they used the main force to advance south, attacking our positions in the Xianggezhuang area, and on the other hand, divided their troops to attack the city of Guan. At that time, the defending forces in the city were less than two battalions. After more than a thousand heavy artillery shells bombarded it, the northwest city walls were completely destroyed. Our loyal and brave soldiers still fought the enemy at all costs. Officers and soldiers of a certain company rushed into the enemy's position and killed an enemy tank, capturing an enemy propaganda captain and more than 20 soldiers. Eventually, they were exhausted and died together with more than a hundred enemies. Their loyalty to the country was truly remarkable.

When the enemy used their main force to attack our Taiziwu line, Zhao Wenzhi, commander of the ×××th Brigade, led the reserve team to reinforce it. They encountered the enemy, who rushed us more than ten times, with hundreds of machine guns firing at the same time. Commander Zhao was hit by two bullets, and he actually held the wound with one hand and directed with the other, standing still. Unfortunately, he was hit by two more bullets in the abdomen, and two knife wounds to the head caused him to faint and fall to the ground. Later, the enemy was repelled, and Commander Zhao survived. The intensity of that battle can be imagined.

After the enemy occupied our Guan County, they desperately advanced south, invading our second line of Jicheng Pengcun. Our ×××th Regiment continued to engage in battle, while the ×××th Regiment launched a counterattack from the left flank. Reinforcements from other regiments continued to arrive. The enemy was encircled, with each layer restricting the other, reaching a mixed battle situation. It continued for more than three days and nights. Our ×××th Regiment was still able to attack the enemy's rear, intercepting three tanks and driving the enemy back more than twenty miles. At this time, morale was extremely high, and it was possible to drive the enemy to the opposite bank of the Yongding River. However, the loss of Niutuo Town in the rear and the simultaneous pressure from the enemy on the left wing, coupled with the exhaustion of ammunition and the severance of aid, made it impossible to save this situation.

In total, the enemy suffered more than 7,000 casualties in this battle, including the death of one regimental commander, the destruction of four tanks, and incalculable losses of equipment. More than 60 horses and one regimental flag were captured by us. We suffered more than 120 officer casualties and more than 3,000 soldier casualties. The division has now retreated to Shimen Bridge, south of Renqiu County, and is reorganizing. ★★★

### Tragic Bombing of Bengbu by Enemy Aircraft

The aircraft circled for about ten minutes and flew to the northeast. The Huachang Street, Nanyang Company, and Yunyang Building areas that were bombed caught fire, but the Bengbu Police Department's fire brigade tried their best to put out the fires, fortunately preventing them from spreading.

### Seamen's Resistance Association Cables Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Ensure Peace in the Far East; Joint Sanctions Against Japan

The Chinese Seamen's Resistance Association cabled the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying, "To the Brussels Nine-Power Treaty Conference, since the Xinhai Revolution, our country has been striving for the construction of a modern nation in order to coexist with the nations of the world and jointly promote human evolution. For 26 years, with the assistance of various countries, it has progressed boundlessly, which is deeply appreciated by our people. However, neighboring Japan, although it is a country with the same culture and rights as us, due to its enemy power being controlled by the military, not only does not assist in our country's construction, but also seeks to destroy it. Recently, it has even tried to swallow our country and exterminate our race. Tracing back to the Twenty-One Demands, such as hindering our revolution, there was the Jinan Massacre in the 17th year. Destroying our tariffs, there were multiple demands to our tariff autonomy before the 19th year. For the past three years, it has assisted in large-scale smuggling, using consular jurisdiction, it has sheltered trafficking, supplied bandits, and established special agencies. Invading our land, there was the creation of 'Manchukuo', the support of the Hebei-Chahar puppet organization, and the invasion of Hebei-Chahar and Tianjin. Massacring our people, there were bombings of Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, with deaths numbering in the thousands every day, and fleeing women and children were not spared. Blocking our foreign trade and destroying the economies of various countries in China, there was the announcement of the blockade of our 7,500-mile coastline. Saying that Japan still knows about treaties, the Nine-Power Treaty is a country that it signed, yet it dares to refuse to attend. Saying that we are intentionally excluding Japan and must defend ourselves, why has Japan's trade with China increased year by year in recent years, recently reaching the first place, and on the contrary, it is violently beating its buyers in the homes of its commodity buyers. Is the word self-defense explained in this way? All of these are facts, and the countries above and below are extremely clear. Therefore, there is the holding of the Brussels Conference, which upholds justice and respects our sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. Our association represents the seamen of the entire nation of China, and makes the following requirements to the conference: ㊀ Lift the illegal blockade of our country's coastline by Japan, which will benefit the commerce of various countries. ㊁ According to the articles of the Nine-Power Treaty, fulfill the obligations to protect our country's sovereignty, territorial and administrative integrity. ㊂ Implement the various resolutions of the League of Nations regarding the Sino-Japanese incident since 1931. ㊃ Various countries jointly implement sanctions against Japan in order to curb violence and ensure peace in the Far East, which is also to preserve human culture. Briefly stated, hoping for your consideration, and wishing the conference success and human civilization to flourish day by day, the Chinese Seamen's Resistance and Support Association respectfully winter,

### Thorough Clearing of Enemy Goods in Fujian Province by Deadline

Xiamen Registration Valued at Two Million Yuan, Customs Revenue Sharply Decreased in August and September

Xiamen Correspondence: The markets of Xiamen and Southern Fujian were almost monopolized by enemy goods. Since the Provincial Anti-Enemy Association decided to thoroughly clear enemy goods from the entire province, registration began in September, with a deadline of one month, until October, to complete the auction. The registered enemy goods stockpiled in Xiamen city alone were valued at over two million yuan, with silk fabrics being the most abundant, followed by general merchandise, then marine products, pigments, hardware, porcelain, ginseng and medicines, imported firewood, matches, wine, etc., totaling thirteen categories, from 471 businesses. Since October, all streets in the city have been holding large-scale clearance sales of enemy goods at reduced prices, creating a lively atmosphere. However, the silk fabrics are mostly summer goods, which were not sold due to public boycotts in July and August and are unsuitable for winter sales. Many of the general merchandise items are also out of season. Furthermore, apart from marine products, most of the goods are not daily necessities. In these extraordinary times, the social economy is not affluent, so even with clamorous advertising, very few transactions are made. Each business sells only a hundred or so yuan worth of goods per day, with some selling only tens of yuan or a dozen yuan. The entire city's daily sales do not exceed twenty thousand yuan. At the end of the one-month period, only six or seven hundred thousand yuan can be sold, making a thorough clearing impossible. The businesses then requested permission to export the goods and sell them in Southeast Asia. This was approved by the Provincial Anti-Enemy Association, which stipulated the following measures: ㊀ Register the names and quantities of goods to be exported; ㊁ Specify where in Southeast Asia the goods will be sold; after arriving at the destination, appropriate proof must be obtained; ㊂ The goods must be shipped out within this month (October), limited to one shipment. Currently, businesses are busy with overseas shipping. However, the boycott of Japanese goods in Southeast Asia is also very enthusiastic, and it is not limited to overseas Chinese, so it may be difficult to sell the goods. Furthermore, the Provincial Anti-Enemy Association stipulated that after this clearing of enemy goods throughout the province, anyone found with them again will be considered a traitor, and those who report them will be rewarded with 60%. After the deadline, the Anti-Enemy Association will centrally auction off the remaining enemy goods. In Fujian province, the enemy goods, silk fabrics and general merchandise, apart from a small portion of cloth produced by Japanese factories in Shanghai and shipped here, most of the cloth and rayon and serge are manufactured in Japan. Xiamen and Southern Fujian obtain them from the Taiwanese piece goods merchants in this city, which is cheaper than directly purchasing from Osaka, Kobe, or Taiwan, because these enemy goods are brought from Taiwan by so-called "water traders" who specialize in carrying luggage as passengers. The same is true for general merchandise. Previously, these "water traders" openly engaged in smuggling, relying on Japanese influence. The Xiamen Customs and the Japanese Consul signed an agreement two years ago, limiting the amount each person could carry, inspecting the goods, and paying taxes according to the "small cargo" rate. In name, they paid taxes, but in reality, the taxes paid were only 40-50% of the statutory tax rate. Furthermore, many people completely smuggled goods along the coast by sailboat. In the past, Japanese goods accounted for 90% of the silk fabric market in Xiamen and Southern Fujian. Next was porcelain. In the past, the best quality porcelain was Jiangxi porcelain, followed by Dehua porcelain from this province. Dehua products were sold annually to Southeast Asia, Shantou, Guangdong, Fuzhou, and Xiamen, valued at five to six hundred thousand yuan. Japanese porcelain began to be imported in 1926. Initially, due to high prices, it had little impact. After 1930, Japanese porcelain was sold at reduced prices, gradually taking over the market for Chinese porcelain. After the "September 18th Incident," Japanese porcelain suffered a major blow, but it later revived. In the past two years, the porcelain market has been almost entirely monopolized by enemy goods, and Jiangxi porcelain has almost disappeared. Dehua porcelain only sells a little over one hundred thousand yuan annually. Next is seafood, where enemy goods account for two-thirds. As for ginseng and medicines, Korean ginseng and abalone are entirely enemy goods. However, no one cares about these luxury items now.

Xiamen Customs revenue can reach over 600,000 yuan in peak months and over 400,000 yuan in slow months, averaging 500,000 yuan per month. From January to July of this year, the average monthly revenue remained at 500,000 yuan. In August, it decreased to 324,787.01 yuan, and in September, it sharply decreased to 132,588.97 yuan. The Xiamen Customs area covers all of Southern Fujian and a large part of Western Fujian and has long been a well-known port with a large trade deficit. Since the opening of the port, almost 70 years ago, there has been a trade deficit. The highest was in 1930, with imports of over 19 million Haikwan taels and exports of over 4 million taels. It declined annually thereafter, but in the past two years, imports have remained at 30 million yuan and exports at 4 million yuan, with an annual trade deficit of over 26 million yuan. Therefore, although tax revenue decreased in August and September, the outflow of cash due to exports also decreased, amounting to only four or five million yuan in the two months.

### Fewer Casualties from Stray Bullets

Residents near the war zone in western Shanghai have been moving to safer areas, resulting in fewer casualties from stray bullets. Yesterday, the Special First Court Prosecutor's Office had no corpses for examination, the first time since the Shanghai War. Although a ten-year-old boy, Zhang Jingfu, was killed by a stray bullet in Fahuazhen today, the date he was hit was the 29th of last month. Therefore, the number of deaths from stray bullets in the recent period has decreased by over 60% compared to the past.

### Modern Chinese Youth

— Cen Qiaorun

Our country is now at the final critical juncture of life and death. How should the people of the whole country save this precarious motherland? We must understand that the so-called justice and humanity of maintaining peace have long been shattered by the fierce artillery fire of imperialism, and the creed of the League of Nations has long been torn apart by selfish desires. Do we still want to rely on the League of Nations? Do we still hope that it will uphold justice and sanction violence? To put it bluntly, there is simply no second way other than the entire nation uniting to rise up and save itself.

But we know that youth are the pillars of the country and the backbone of society. The life of a nation and the future of a country are entirely entrusted to them. Therefore, to save the danger of modern China and to revive our nation, we must rely on the modern Chinese youth to work hard.

Ordinary cold-blooded youth, ordinary pleasure-seeking youth, are not worthy of being modern youth. These people will inevitably be eliminated sooner or later, but how can one be worthy of being a modern youth? It can be broadly divided into the following points: ㊀ Have the determination to save the country. We should clearly understand that the country is our only lifeline. Without the country, there will be no people. Saving the country is saving our own lives, which is also saving the lives of the masses. Therefore, we must have the determination to save the country with the attitude of "the country exists and we exist, the country perishes and we perish." ㊁ Have military skills and knowledge. Modern warfare is not just a plane war relying on guns and cannons, but a three-dimensional war and a chemical war. Therefore, we must first cultivate rich scientific knowledge, and everyone should have the ability to shoot and kill enemies and have knowledge of poison gas prevention and air defense. ㊂ Have a strong physique. We have always been known as "the sick men of East Asia." To eliminate this dishonorable ridicule, we should intensify our physical training and create a steel-like resistance force to serve as the vanguard of the nation.

Other conditions such as obeying leaders and having a spirit of unity are also necessary for modern youth.

Youth across the country, rise up quickly! I hope that all the youth in the country will become modern youth, then the bright future of China and the revival of the Chinese nation can be realized in no time.
