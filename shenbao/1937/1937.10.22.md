### Our Army Launches a Full-Scale General Offensive, Punishing and Crushing Rebellious Enemies on All Fronts

The Battle at Chenjiaxiang is Fierce, with Gunfire Ceaseless Throughout the Night - Enemy Forces at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang Suffer Extremely Heavy Casualties - Our Forces Fiercely Attack Zhabei and Jiangwan, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy - Our Air Force Assists in the Battle, Artillery Displays Its Power

This newspaper's reporter, in order to investigate the intense battles of the past few days, especially drove to the front line last night at 6:30 PM via a side road. The entire journey was shrouded in gunfire, with light and flames radiating everywhere. Our artillery was exerting its power, bombarding the enemy, the rumbling sound shaking the four fields. When returning to the office at 1:00 AM this morning, the sound of gunfire continued incessantly. At the same time, our air force also launched a night raid, with the enemy's anti-aircraft guns and machine guns randomly firing into the air, sparks flashing. Starting at 8:00 PM last night (the 21st), our army ordered a full-scale general offensive. The situation on all fronts is extremely favorable. Our artillery concentrated on targets, simultaneously launching a fierce bombardment of the enemy's positions. The density of the gunfire was unprecedented, especially in the Chenjiaxiang area. At the same time, our troops also made the most intense advances along this route. Chenjiaxiang is a powerful stronghold of our army, which has always remained in our hands, never having fallen. The area around Dunwu Temple, Shenjiazha, and Zhusanfang has been a point of contention between the two sides, with advances and retreats occurring no less than a dozen times. Therefore, the houses in the villages in that area have all been destroyed, a scene of scorched earth, only their names remaining. Currently, our army has adopted a semi-encirclement strategy, fiercely attacking them last night. At the same time, our rear troops are continuously advancing forward, and the enemy is showing signs of being unable to withstand the pressure. In the Guangfu area, around 3:00 PM yesterday, the enemy launched a prolonged artillery barrage against us, but we suffered no losses. Their troops were deeply entrenched in the trenches and did not come out to engage. We ignored them. At night, our army launched a full-scale general offensive, with the infantry and artillery maintaining close coordination, fiercely attacking the enemy. Although the enemy also came out of their trenches to resist, they suffered extremely heavy casualties. As for the Shixianggong Temple line, our army has gained a considerable advantage. The enemy is currently adopting a defensive posture, while our army is attacking daily, making considerable progress repeatedly, and the fortifications are gradually being strengthened, becoming exceptionally solid. The enemy has absolutely no way to advance. In the Liuhe area, our army's positions are even more secure than Mount Tai. This area was originally the enemy's main target, attempting to repeat the old trick from January 28th, outflanking our rear to shake our overall situation. We saw through their plot, so we deployed heavy troops and established powerful fortifications, rendering the enemy helpless. Even if they were to attempt a landing with a division or two of troops, it would not be difficult for us to annihilate them immediately. Therefore, this kind of conspiracy by the enemy has long been hopeless. Furthermore, at 4:00 AM this morning, this newspaper received a report from the front lines that our army had launched a full-scale general offensive since 7:30 PM last night. As of the time of the report, progress had been quite rapid on all fronts. The battle situation is as follows: ㊀ Our army north of Dachang advanced north along the Hutai Highway from Ximipu, and after several assaults, advanced to Wujiazhai around 11:00 PM, with Hujia Yan as the objective. Around 1:00 AM this morning, fierce fighting was still ongoing there. ㊁ Our army advancing from the line of Zhaojiajiao and Qiangmentou Zhai, with Heida Huangzhai as the objective, advanced very rapidly. Unable to withstand the pressure of our artillery fire, the enemy collapsed and retreated one after another. Around 9:00 PM, our army approached the vicinity of Sunjiachi to Yangzhai. ㊂ The enemy in the area around Gejia Pailou Zhai, after being encircled and severely attacked by our three sides, already appeared exhausted and unable to cope. Starting at 8:00 PM, our side, under the cover of intensive artillery fire from large cannons, gradually advanced. Around 1:00 AM this morning, the battle was still raging fiercely. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle, while our side also suffered considerable losses. ㊃ North of Miaohang, our army, with Zhouxing as the center, launched a fierce attack on the enemy at Yanjiawan. Progress along this route was also quite rapid. Around 12:00 AM this morning, they had already advanced to the area of Caojiazhai and Zhangzhai. The enemy's link west of Yanjiawan has already been cut off by us. ㊄ In the Chenjiaxiang area, our army launched attacks along two routes: one advancing eastward along the Yunzaobang, with Guojiazhai and Qiaojiazhai as the objective, and the other attacking northwards, with Yangzhai, Zhusanfang, and Shenjiazhai as the objective. The battle along this route was the most intense. From yesterday evening to 2:00 AM this morning, there was a bloody battle lasting for ten hours. The density of gunfire and the intensity of artillery fire were unprecedented. Our army advanced bravely and gained a considerable advantage.

The Central News Agency's correspondent with the army reported at 9:30 PM on the 21st that the outbreak of the Shanghai battle today marked seventy days. In the past half-month, the center of gravity of the battle has shifted to the south bank of the Yunzaobang, with repeated assaults along the Hutai Highway running north-south and on both banks of the Fengcun Tang running east-west. The intensity of the battle is truly unprecedented. As for the Luodian, Guangfu, Miaohang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei lines, there were only contacts between small units. Even our army's artillery in Pudong has been quiet for many days. Our army has adopted a long-term resistance strategy of attrition, mostly adopting a defensive posture. The enemy's four general offensives have all ended in failure after being met with our head-on counterattacks. This time, they have twice fiercely attacked the south bank of the Yunzaobang, attempting to advance into Dachang, putting forth their full effort for a final struggle. However, they were severely blocked by us at Wanjia Pailou and no longer have the strength to advance. Their exhausted and desperate state has been fully exposed. In order to severely punish the enemy, our army began a full-scale counteroffensive at 7:30 PM today. The air force also dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle. The intensity of our army's artillery fire is unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battle. As of the time of the report, our loyal and brave soldiers on all fronts, under the cover of intensive artillery fire, were fiercely attacking the enemy with heroic posture, and the fierce battle was progressing smoothly.

### The Enemy at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang is Attacked in the Rear and Forced to Retreat

The Fengcun Tang Area is Shrouded in Gunfire All Day Long - The Battle is Fierce, with the Enemy Suffering a Severe Blow

North of Dachang, the battle is still raging fiercely. Our army's front lines are exceptionally solid. The enemy, who are putting forth their full effort to attack Dachang, have suffered heavy casualties after being fiercely attacked by our army at Gejia Pailou, Huanggang, and Yujia Zhai, and dare not continue their advance. After two days and two nights of bloody battle, the enemy is showing signs of exhaustion and inability to cope. At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, the enemy again attempted to break through, fiercely attacking our army, and the bloody battle unfolded again. Our army bravely advanced, suppressing them. Under the concentrated fire of the enemy, they fell forward one after another, charging straight ahead, killing countless of the enemy who were attempting to break through. After this heavy blow, the enemy still retreated to their original positions. West of the highway, the enemy at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang are still surrounded by our army. The battle situation from yesterday all day to the night is described in detail as follows.

Repeated Assaults Ultimately Fail

The Central News Agency's correspondent with the army in Jiangwan reported at 9:30 PM on the 21st that the south bank of the Yunzaobang, along the Hutai Highway and both sides of the Fengcun Tang, was shrouded in gunfire all day long. Starting at dawn, enemy planes came in formations and dropped many bombs on our positions. The enemy in the Huanggang area has been attacking our Huli Zhai, Sujia Zhai, and Shengjia Zhai continuously from morning to night. We stood ready, and upon seeing the enemy approaching, immediately strafed them with machine guns. Although the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, we held our original positions and remained unmoved. At noon, the enemy used many tanks to cover infantry in a fierce attack on our line of Zhujia Zhai and Chenjia Zhai on the west side of the highway. Our warning line was breached once, but after a valiant charge, we finally drove the enemy away and restored our original positions. On the east side of the highway, the enemy attacked the entire line from Sujia Qiaozhai, Gaoren Qiaozhai, to Lu Zhai, Shenjiawan, and Zhoucheng Zhai from the northwest and both fought fiercely all day. However, our positions were solid and our defenses were tight, and the enemy ultimately had no opportunity to exploit.

Our Army's Counteroffensive is Irresistible

Following the lull in fighting, the enemy in the Gejia Pailou and Huanggang area, after being blocked by us, no longer had the ability to advance. The enemy is currently trying to build fortifications in Gejia Pailou in order to hold fast. Taking advantage of the enemy's unstable position, we immediately launched a counteroffensive yesterday afternoon, flanking them from the left wing, breaking through along the south bank of the Fengcun Tang, and cutting off their rear. At that time, although enemy planes were unusually active, our troops all assembled under Zhangjialou at the scheduled time. Once the order was given, our army, regardless of their own safety, charged forward in a bloody assault, pressing hard on the enemy's positions. Our army gained a considerable advantage.

### Our Army Launches Attacks in Jiangwan and Zhabei, Killing the Enemy

The Central News Agency's correspondent in Zhabei reported at 1:25 AM on the 22nd that yesterday, our army launched counterattacks on all fronts. In the Jiangwan area, starting at 3:30 PM, small units from Hejiaxiang, Dongzhai, Baziqiao, and the Tiyuhui Road launched guerilla attacks in separate directions on the city center area and the Sijing Ballfield. Upon seeing our advance, the enemy forces immediately hid themselves, but several tanks came and went to block our advance. Our troops then proceeded by backroads, and by 6:00 PM, several teams advanced along Jipu, killing over sixty enemy soldiers along the way. We also dispatched small units to attack the enemy at Tanjiazhai, Shuidian Road, Huojia Muqiao, and Liuying Road, as well as the enemy at the Liusan Garden and the Aiguo Girls' School. At 7:30 PM, the gunfire intensified and the general offensive began. Our artillery fire was accurate, repeatedly hitting key enemy targets, but the enemy avoided engaging in combat. Therefore, there was only contact with outposts in various locations. Enemy tanks were also active on the Jiangwan Road. At 9:30 PM, our army once charged from Baziqiao near Liusan Garden to annihilate the enemy, and then retreated, confronting the enemy. At the intersection of Guangdong Street and Dongbinxing Road, we also used a small unit to charge to the North Sichuan Road to harass the enemy, who were deeply entrenched behind fortifications, retaliating with machine guns. At that time, the dense gunfire shook the entire city, lasting for about two hours, before gradually subsiding. We achieved our goal of harassment and then withdrew to our original defenses.

### Our Air Force Comes to Shanghai to Assist in the Battle

Enemy Barracks and Ammunition Depots are Bombed by Us

At 10:35 PM last night, our air force came to Shanghai to assist in the battle. Enemy warships in the air space over the Huangpu River first used searchlights to search the sky, and then bombarded with anti-aircraft guns. It stopped after about three minutes. At 11:45 PM, the gunfire resumed, more intense than the first time, and the sound of anti-aircraft machine guns was also continuous, but not as dense as in the past. The purpose of our aircraft was not to bomb enemy warships, so they flew away safely. At 1:10 AM this morning, enemy warships made another disturbance, but the gunfire was also sparse, presumably the enemy was unable to bear the burden of wasting ammunition.

The staff quarters of the Fourth Factory of the Japanese-owned Shanghai Textile Company on Pingliang Road and Meizhou Road, since the outbreak of the war, have been used by the enemy as barracks. In addition, the staff quarters on Pingliang Road and Qiqihar Road have been used as an ammunition depot. Last night, our air force, while coming to Shanghai to assist in the battle, went to the sky over Meizhou Road at 12:12 AM this morning to bomb the enemy's barracks, which immediately exploded and caught fire, burning fiercely. It was not extinguished until 1:34 AM this morning. The enemy suffered many casualties. Around 1:00 AM this morning, the enemy's ammunition depot on Qiqihar Road was also bombed by our air force, catching fire and burning, and a large number of munitions exploded and detonated, the sound shaking the four fields. It was not until around 2:40 AM that the explosive force weakened slightly, and fire-fighting could begin. As of 4:00 AM this morning, the flames had not been completely extinguished. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses.

### Dachang is Absolutely Secure

In recent days, due to the fall of Gejia Pailou Zhai and Huanggang into enemy hands, the Dachang area has been under serious threat. The safety of Dachang is even more related to the battle situation in Jiangwan and Zhabei. Therefore, readers of newspapers have been very concerned about the situation in Dachang. This newspaper's reporter went to the front line last night and asked a senior commander, who said that the gains and losses of a small village are actually not very important. Although the enemy in the Heida Huangzhai area has penetrated deep near Huanggang, the situation in Dachang is not as serious as imagined. In short, Dachang is absolutely secure. Currently, the enemy at Gejia Pailou is surrounded by us on three sides, the front and the left and right sides, and the position is shrinking narrower and narrower, already becoming an extremely narrow triangular shape. The front is attacked by our Houjiaku, Shengjiazhai, and Jiejingzhai. The left is pressed by our Qiangmentou Zhai to Yangwan Zhai. The right is flanked by our Maqiaozhai and Jixiangzhai along the highway. Although the enemy is eagerly building fortifications, being trapped in a dead end is no different from inviting their own destruction. After our fierce counterattack last night, it will not be difficult to annihilate them. The commander also said that we have extremely solid trenches and strong troops in that area. Even if the enemy attacks Dachang, they will definitely not succeed. Zeng Guofan said, "Build solid camps and fight to the death." Our army is now adopting this strategy, and the future of the war is absolutely optimistic.

### Enemy Assault on Chenjiaxiang Repelled

A portion of the enemy force launched another assault on our Chenjiaxiang line. The enemy came with a fierce momentum, launching multiple assaults, but were all bravely repelled by our loyal soldiers. Our army's lines remain unmoving.

The Central News Agency in Suzhou telegraphed on the 21st that on the 20th, the enemy launched fierce attacks on our Maqiaozhai, Chenjiaxiang, and near Xinlao Lu Zhai, all of which failed. At 9:00 PM on the 20th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our Xinlao Lu Zhai. Our army rose up to meet the attack, and around 12:00 AM, the enemy, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated. Since the morning of the 21st, the enemy has again attacked the aforementioned locations, and our army is currently engaged in fierce fighting.

### Enemy Troops Plan to Land at Mingsha Port

Several enemy warships and many small motorboats are gathered at Mingsha Port in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River outside the mouth of Wusong, seemingly with the intention of landing, but have not yet taken action. Our army is on high alert.

### Seven Enemy Planes at Yangshupu Confirmed to Have Been Destroyed by Our Bombing

Our Air Force Ingeniously Follows Enemy Planes and Achieves a Wonderful Victory - Foreign Investigation Confirms, Japanese Authorities Do Not Deny

The Continental News reported that on the night of October 14th, a Chinese aircraft pilot cleverly devised a plan to destroy seven Japanese planes at the Yangshupu Japanese airfield. Although the Japanese authorities have kept this matter a secret, it has been confirmed by reliable foreign observers. On the evening of that day, amidst the continuous artillery fire in this city, four Japanese planes, with their lights on, flew back to their base, where they were seen by a Chinese plane, which also turned on its lights and joined the Japanese squadron. The Japanese planes, believing that the plane belonged to their own side, did not pay attention to it. Upon reaching the airfield, the plane also feigned a landing, and when all four Japanese planes had landed, it dropped two bombs and flew away. After the Japanese planes noticed, they immediately issued an alarm, and the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River simultaneously fired anti-aircraft guns. Residents of Shanghai should remember the deafening sound of anti-aircraft guns around 7:00 PM that day. However, the Chinese plane had already left Shanghai at that time. The rumor that the Yangshupu Japanese airfield had been moved to Wusong due to the threat from the Chinese artillery team in Pudong has been confirmed by foreign observers. Yesterday morning, a news reporter inquired about this matter to the Japanese naval spokesperson, who replied that the truth or falsehood can be found out for yourself.

### Enemy Officer Casualties Confirmed

Japanese Planes Crash Repeatedly

During the Liuhang battle on the 6th, 7th, and 8th, the enemy suffered very heavy casualties. The names of six officers of the rank of major or above who were killed in action or seriously wounded were announced by their military headquarters. Tokujiro Iizuka was killed in action at Sujiazhai, Jojiro Uno was seriously wounded by a bullet at Yangjiazhai, and Masao Sato was shot through the right chest at Liuhang and seriously wounded. In addition, Sueki Nakayama was killed in action, and Teiichiro Inaba and Michikazu Ishida were all seriously wounded, but the locations were not detailed. Furthermore, the enemy, realizing the weakness of their air force's combat power and the heavy casualties of their combatants, is actively engaged in training, causing planes to crash almost every day. According to the Tokyo Asahi, on the afternoon of the 6th, a fighter plane crashed at the Kagamigahara airfield. The plane was completely destroyed, and the pilot, Sergeant Tsutomu Imai, died on the spot. Also, according to the Osaka Mainichi, on the morning of the 9th, two planes collided in the air at the Kasumigaura Naval Airfield. One plane was piloted by instructor Major Motohachi Miyazaki, and crashed to the ground, seriously injured and died shortly thereafter.

### One Enemy Plane Shot Down in Huacao Town

Two Enemy Pilots Burned to Death

The Central News Agency's correspondent with the army in Jiangwan reported at 12:25 PM on the 21st that at 10:00 AM this morning, an enemy plane dropped bombs in Huacao Town and was hit by our army's anti-aircraft guns. It immediately caught fire and crashed into a small bay near the Suzhou River. The two pilots were dragged out by our garrison and were completely charred beyond recognition. Only the words "Third Team" were on its parts.

### Enemy Troop Movements

Enemy Troops are Cowardly

The enemy troops in the area of Laodan Zhai, Qin Zhai, and Zhangjia Village northwest of Luodian have recently been rotated. The newly arrived troops have very poor discipline. Whenever they are hit by our planes and artillery, they shout loudly and become extremely chaotic. They are also exceptionally cowardly, firing their guns randomly day and night to embolden themselves. However, their machine gunners seem to be quite calm.

Corpses and Wounded Soldiers

Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, another enemy merchant ship converted into a Red Cross ship, the America Maru, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the Huishan Wharf, carrying away approximately one thousand enemy corpses and wounded soldiers. In recent days, a total of five enemy Red Cross ships have sailed to Shanghai, indicating the heavy casualties suffered by the enemy.

Tanks Arrived

Yesterday, four more enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, the Nishiyama Maru, Ryukou Maru, Kotoku Maru, and another transport ship of unknown name, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu and Hongkou wharves, bringing over one hundred tanks, over three hundred military vehicles, and other military supplies and ammunition. Unloading began at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon.

### Our Army's Great Victory in Counter-offensive in Northern Shanxi

The enemy's main force north of Yuanping was encircled and routed by our forces. The enemy's second attempt to cross the Zhang River on the Pinghan Front was unsuccessful. Our army's advance north along the Jinpu Railway means the imminent recovery of all lost territories.

▲ National News Agency, Shanxi Frontline Report: Associated Press war correspondent Belden reported from the frontline today that the Chinese army had changed its strategy and launched a major counter-offensive. After using guerrilla tactics to besiege the enemy on all sides, it has achieved unprecedented victory on the entire northern Shanxi front. In recent days, fierce battles have taken place along the borders of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The Chinese army is advancing on all fronts. The main fronts are Yuanping, 80 miles north of Taiyuan, and Niangziguan, 130 miles east, both of which are key points for controlling Taiyuan. The Japanese army has advanced along multiple routes and, to protect transportation, has had to deploy troops along the way, gradually being wiped out by the Chinese army. At Nanhuaikuaizi, northwest of Yuanping, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack from Ningwu, completely annihilating an entire enemy brigade and capturing three to four hundred prisoners. North of Yuanping, the main force of two enemy divisions was also encircled and routed by the Chinese army's skilled troops, leaving countless corpses. Among them were many White Russians, though the reporter did not witness this personally. At the same time, the Chinese army's guerrilla forces have cut off enemy transportation in the mountains north of Yanmen Pass, forcing over a hundred Japanese freight vehicles to retreat to Datong, plunging the enemy's main force on the front lines into dire straits. With the traffic between Datong and Yuanping cut off, and the route from Zhangjiakou to eastern Shanxi impassable due to the Chinese army's recapture of Pingxingguan, enemy cavalry attempting to flee to Hebei were blocked by Chinese militia and forces. Meanwhile, Chinese guerrilla teams sped down the mountain paths along the Shanxi border, endangering the traffic on the Pinghan Railway. Currently, Chinese army aircraft in Taiyuan bomb Japanese positions daily, with intense aerial warfare. The Chinese army's frontline has also received many new artillery pieces, and coordination between infantry, artillery, and air force is extremely close. As a result, the Japanese army has collapsed in three routes east of Yuanping. During the retreat of enemy troops from Guoxian, 22 tanks were destroyed, and Japanese and Mongolian troops suffered 3,000 casualties. (21st National Telegram)

[Beiping] The number of volunteer soldiers near Beiping is increasing daily. Small teams of Japanese soldiers are ambushed from time to time. Foreign residents here often see dozens of wounded Japanese soldiers returning in groups from the suburbs. The Japanese authorities have now dispatched most of the over 5,000 Japanese troops in Beiping to guard key locations outside the city. When discussing the situation in Shanxi, a Japanese spokesman admitted that the Japanese army is suffering greatly from mountain warfare. (21st National Telegram)

[Taiyuan] On the morning of the 20th, the enemy north of Xinkou attacked our right flank at Lingshan (about 30 miles east of Xinkou). After a fierce counterattack by our army, they retreated. The enemy in the central area attacked our Guanzhuang (between Xinkou and Yuanping). Our army fought bravely to seize the mountain peaks from the enemy. Although both regimental commanders were wounded, they continued to lead their troops in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. In desperation, the enemy released tear gas, but its effectiveness was minimal. Our army continued to fight bravely and repelled the enemy. On the left flank, artillery fire was very intense in the morning, and the fighting was more moderate in the afternoon. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)

[Nanjing] According to a telegram from Taiyuan on the 19th, received by related departments in the capital: (1) Since the morning of the 19th, the enemy in northern Shanxi has launched a fierce attack on our right flank. The fighting was most intense at 10:00 AM. A certain unit of our army fought to the death to repel the attack. The fighting gradually subsided at 2:00 PM. Our central units fought with the enemy for the high ground south of Guancun. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties, and we also suffered considerable casualties. The situation is now stalemated. Most of the enemy remains near Yongxing Village and are using smoke screens, appearing to be shifting their forces to other areas. In recent days of fierce fighting, we have destroyed more than 20 enemy tanks and more than 100 armored vehicles, all of which were abandoned in riverbeds. Since then, enemy tanks and armored vehicles have not dared to approach our army's positions. (2) The enemy at Jiuguan in eastern Shanxi is still facing off against our army. Enemy and our forces are fiercely engaged in battle at Faluling, and are currently in a stalemate. (3) A battalion of a certain brigade of a certain route army of our forces rushed to Yanmen Pass on the 18th to destroy transportation. The enemy urgently dispatched two regiments of reinforcements from Guoxian and Fanshi, resulting in fierce fighting. (4) The Tianjin Japanese army headquarters ordered the Hasegawa unit to attempt to move towards Xinxian. The Kayashima regiment departed from Tianjin for Shanxi. The enemy force also includes the 77th and 78th regiments of the 8th Brigade and a division of the puppet Manchukuo army. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)

[Beiping] A Japanese spokesman admitted today that the Japanese army has encountered fierce resistance in Shandong Province, but refused to admit reports of the Japanese army's northward retreat. Yesterday, foreign sources in Jinan said that the Chinese army had advanced rapidly towards Dezhou from the Tuhai River, with the Japanese army offering little resistance and retreating northward. (21st Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)

[Jinan] From last night to this morning, the frontline has been quiet. Our forces and the enemy are currently facing off across the Tuhai River. Our reinforcements continue to move north, and the enemy is also reinforcing with more than 2,000 troops. At dawn, there was artillery fire on the front lines. Five of our aircraft flew to Pingyuan and Yucheng to bomb. Enemy aircraft dropped four bombs about 20 miles west of this city at dawn, mistakenly bombing sorghum stalk dams, with no other damage. Four other aircraft flew to Xuzhou and dropped two bombs, one bomb at Hanzhuang Lane Bridge, and strafed the railway station, but were damaged by our anti-aircraft fire, and one escaped. (21st Special Telegram)

[Beiping] According to a statement by the Japanese military authorities, the Japanese army has reached the south bank of the Zhang River, 14 miles from Zhangde. However, the situation in Shandong Province has become mysterious. A Japanese spokesman admitted that they had encountered strong resistance, but did not admit reports of the Japanese army's retreat. It is heard that most of the Japanese army is concentrated in Wucheng, 25 miles west of Pingyuan. The Jinpu Railway line seems to have no protection at all, and Han Fuqu's troops have advanced north, encountering little resistance along the way, and are now preparing to recover Dezhou and Sangyuan. Foreign reports also state that the Shandong army has moved north from the Tuhai River and is approaching Dezhou, with the Japanese army offering no resistance. (Central News Agency 9th Reuters Telegram)

[Jinan] The frontline was quiet last night. At 4:00 AM on the 21st, there was an artillery battle across the Tuhai River, which quickly stopped. Currently, most of our army is advancing forward, and it will not be difficult to annihilate the remaining enemy. At 4:50 AM on the 21st, a squadron of our air force flew north over Yucheng to bomb enemy troops along the Jinpu Railway line. Two enemy aircraft dropped two bombs in Tongshan, one bomb in Hanzhuang, and strafed, but one was hit by our anti-aircraft fire and escaped wounded. Also, one enemy aircraft dropped four bombs about 20 miles west of Jinan city at around 5:00 AM on the 21st, all of which landed in the water. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)

### No Doubt the Attack on Chinese Fishing Boats Was by a Japanese Submarine

Hong Kong Investigation Committee Holds Third Meeting, British Naval Major Testifies

[Hong Kong] The Hong Kong committee investigating the fishermen's deaths held its third meeting on the 21st. British Naval Major Herbert testified, stating that, based on the evidence, the bombing of the fishing boats was definitely by a Japanese submarine. A fourth meeting is scheduled for the 22nd. (21st Special Telegram)

[Hong Kong] The official committee investigating the Japanese submarine attack on Chinese fishing boats continued its meeting this morning, discussing the nationality of the submarine. According to three Chinese witnesses, they unanimously declared that the submarine had two cannons, the Arabic numeral "7" on the conning tower, and black and white stripes painted on it. The sailors on board all wore double-shouldered leather straps. Major Herbert, the committee's naval expert, testified that these are all characteristics of Japanese submarines. There is no doubt that the submarine belongs to Japan. (21st National Maritime Telegram)

[Hong Kong] Today, when the investigation into the Japanese submarine sinking of Chinese fishing boats continued, British naval expert Captain Herbert provided an eyewitness report, saying, "I testify under oath that the submarine that sank the Chinese fishing boats was definitely Japanese." According to Herbert, there have been no fewer than seven submarines recently attacking Chinese fishing boats in southern China. Their hulls are all painted with black and white stripes and other symbols specific to Japanese warships, and the sailors on board all wear the shoulder capes unique to the Japanese navy. Therefore, there is no doubt as to their Japanese nationality. (21st National Telegram)

[Hong Kong] Liang Qingwei, a fisherman from Hong Kong, sailed his fishing boat out to sea on the 16th. He encountered an enemy warship in Dapeng Bay, which sent nine soldiers to his boat. They used broadswords and axes to chop and destroy the sails, masts, and equipment, and confiscated his earth cannon and pistol. Before leaving, they declared that Chinese people had killed too many Japanese people. If they saw them again, they would be killed. Chinese fishing boats cannot fish within the blockade line. Liang returned to Hong Kong on the 21st after escaping. (21st Special Telegram)

### Enemy Warships Shell the Coast Outside Hupukou

[Changshu] At 2:00 PM on the 21st, enemy warships shelled the coast outside Hupukou, providing cover for three small boats to land. After we used machine guns to strafe them, both sides engaged in a fierce battle for about half an hour before the enemy retreated, unable to withstand the fire. (21st Special Telegram)

### Enemy Aircraft Bomb Everywhere, Two More Raids on the Capital Yesterday

Two Railway Lines Bombed by Enemy Aircraft, Minimal Damage from Enemy Attack on Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway

[Nanjing] Eight enemy aircraft flew to the Danyang and Changzhou areas at 9:00 AM on the 21st to drop bombs, and also appeared to be heading towards the capital.

[Nanjing] Twenty Japanese aircraft attacked the capital again today, dropping bombs at the airfield outside Guanghua Gate and the Pukou East Station. At 1:00 PM, five enemy fighter planes flew to the capital's airspace to conduct reconnaissance for about five minutes, also intending to challenge the Chinese air force. Following them were eleven bombers, which dropped countless bombs on the airfield, creating 46 craters in the ground. The city felt the vibrations of the explosions, and black smoke and flames were seen rising in the southeast sky. At the same time, three more bombers bombed Pukou. One of the aircraft dropped something resembling a ball of black smoke, leading to suspicions that the aircraft had been shot down, but no aircraft was shot down, and what was dropped was not determined. One aircraft dropped many leaflets, but they were blown to the southeast outside the city. The alert was lifted at 3:00 PM. According to a statement by the Chinese side today, it was learned at 9:00 AM that ten Japanese aircraft had attacked the capital, but did not arrive.

### Enemy Bombing of Our Cultural Institutions Falsely Accuses Us of Converting Schools into Barracks

Confusing International Public Opinion in Attempt to Evade Responsibility; Such Base Tactics Only Make the World Scornful

[Nanjing] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, enemy aircraft have violated international conventions and bombed our cultural institutions and non-combatant personnel. These illegal acts have long been scorned by all civilized countries in the world. However, due to the recent severe condemnation by international public opinion, the Japanese side is attempting to shirk responsibility and resorting to forceful sophistry. It is heard that the Allied News Agency claimed yesterday that the reason enemy aircraft bombed our cultural institutions was because we had converted schools into barracks. It is truly unknown what basis they have for saying so. For example, when National Central University and Sun Yat-sen University were bombed, they were both preparing for the start of classes. Where is the fact of their use as barracks? Moreover, those two locations are far from the front lines, so there is no need to convert them into barracks. The situation in other bombed cultural institutions is similar. In short, this kind of absurd propaganda by the Japanese side, based on strong arguments and unreasonable demands, is nothing more than an attempt to confuse international hearing and vision, and attempt to evade international criticism of Japan. But facts speak louder than words. Such base tactics by the Japanese only make the world scornful. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)

### China's Economic Strength Sufficient to Resist War for More Than Two Years

Even if Shanghai and North China are Lost, the Struggle Will Continue  Wartime Economy is Already Prepared and Will Be Implemented Soon  Song Ziwen's Interview with Foreign Reporters

The English "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that Song Ziwen, President of the Bank of China, recently met with a reporter from the London "Daily Herald" and discussed the Sino-Japanese war for a long time. Song stated that even if Shanghai and the provinces north of the Yellow River were completely lost, the National Government would never cease hostilities with Japan. China's economic power is sufficient to resist the war for two years, and can be extended if necessary. If Shanghai falls, it will be regarded as only the starting point of this great war for survival. Even if Nanjing is not defended, the struggle will continue as before. If there were a possibility of truce now, we would not have resisted at Lugou Bridge, and would have already negotiated peace there. Why wait until several provinces in North China are lost? Song admitted that if Nanjing were cut off from the industrial base of Shanghai, which accounts for half of China's customs revenue, the government would suffer a major blow and would have to organize a new economic base inland, very different from the Shanghai model. However, he believes that the Chinese people are prepared to endure the great shock of adjustment. China's ability to cope with the difficulties of war has been tested and is unlimited. The people are happy to provide everything the government needs, because the whole country is now united and determined to engage in the war for survival. Song then mentioned that the Eighth Route Army has repeatedly won victories in northern Shanxi against well-equipped enemy forces. He went on to say that the long-term resistance maintained by the communists in southern China in the past is a clear demonstration of the Chinese people's ability to overcome the strong with the weak and the few with the many. The communists, with only half of Jiangxi Province as their base, were able to fight against 500,000 government troops. This shows the capacity for national mobilization and concerted effort. The reporter asked whether the central government was prepared to take the necessary severe steps to organize a thorough wartime economy, given the broad scope of the war, which requires major reforms and sacrifices. Song replied that he was already prepared, or would implement it soon. The reporter also asked why China had been slow to take resolute steps to resist the war to the end, leading many to believe that the central government was still opening the door for negotiations with Japan. Why has China not yet formally severed economic relations with Japan, nor severed diplomatic relations, nor confiscated Japanese property, nor made long-term plans to use the wealth of Chinese industries and banks to move the main area of their activities to the new inland base? Song replied that he believed these were all matters of time and only required strategy, without the need to prepare resolutions. (For example, Japanese imports to Shanghai in September have decreased by 996.6% compared to July.) As for the fourth point, it is now being realized day by day, especially for industries fundamental to the war, such as the metal industry in Shanghai, which has now mostly moved inland. At this point, Song also touched on the general public's doubts about China's ability to fight to the end, saying that China's political unity depends on continuing the resistance. If the government thinks it should succumb simply because of the fall of North China or Shanghai, then political unity will be impossible. Today, the morale of the Chinese army is very high. If we were to think about a truce now, the morale of the army would inevitably be shaken. The Battle of Songhu has sacrificed many lives, and troops from various provinces have participated. Today, talking about reconciliation would certainly not be welcomed by the frontline soldiers. Song did not want to disclose China's current war expenses, but said that they were insignificant compared to Japan's. He estimated that Japan now spends at least £750,000 a day, or about 10 million Japanese yen. Song did not underestimate Japan's ability to cope with difficulties, because in times of national crisis, it will be able to awaken its people to make painful sacrifices. Some say that Japan's economic collapse is not far off. Song did not agree with this view, but said that if Japan were to have such a day, it would inevitably be discovered before China. Song also said that the National Government is well aware that in the initial stages of the war, China's losses and failures will far exceed those of Japan, but "no darkness, no dawn." The longer China resists, the stronger its position will be, and the weaker Japan's position will be. The National Government is deeply convinced of this. The reporter then asked whether it was reliable that 800 Soviet aircraft had been transported to Lanzhou. Song replied that he had heard this and found it very interesting, but could not verify it. The reporter also asked about the Japanese army occupying Baotou and penetrating into the Ordos region, which would cut off Sino-Soviet transportation and have significant implications. Song said that this question could be answered by consulting a detailed map. The reporter also said that it was rumored that Outer Mongolia would return to China, and that the war in the north might have new developments as a result. Song had no answer to this question, but said that if the military victories Japan has achieved in Inner Mongolia were to continue to deepen, various unfavorable factors would also develop accordingly. As the Sino-Japanese war prolongs, Japan's domestic and international position will weaken. Once there is a direct conflict with the Soviet Union, it would be unthinkable. However, he believes that if the Soviet Union's decision on the Far East crisis is delayed for too long, the assistance will be very great.

### Going to and Fro in the Bombing

— Guo Moruo

Thirteen

After the air raid alarm was lifted, the car came again. The driver was unusually happy, and kept saying to me in the car, "Our anti-aircraft guns are really good, really good!" He also saw the two planes that were shot down in the city.

The people on the street were all smiling. In those smiles, there was naturally a sense of relief from the terror, and even more so, there was the joy of "really good, really good." This joy united the emotions of our nation. We must gather this national joy into a roar of laughter to bombard down all the enemy's planes! Bombing with laughter that regards death as returning home is our most elite weapon. Enemy, come as much as you want!

When I arrived at the agreed place, because the time had passed, Mr. Wang had left a secretary, telling the driver to drive to another place.

I had been sitting in the living room waiting for less than a minute when Mr. Wang came in, running from afar: he ran to shake my hand, almost embracing me.

Mr. Wang was in good spirits, but much thinner than in the Wuhan era.

Mr. Wang said, "Everyone knows you're here, and they're all very happy. We were just in a meeting, and everyone was looking forward to meeting you after the meeting was over, but unfortunately the air raid alarm lasted too long, so they all dispersed."

Mr. Wang also mentioned my plan to return to Shanghai, so I knew that Yue Jun had reported my intention to leave.

After talking for nearly an hour, Mr. Wang asked me, "Have you seen Mr. Gongbo yet?" I said, "I haven't seen him yet, and I'm just planning to meet him."

Mr. Wang said, "Well, then stay here and have lunch with me. I'll call Gongbo to come, and we can talk together."

I said, "I've already made an appointment with Mr. Sun Zhesheng to see him before noon. I also have a lunch appointment."

Mr. Wang said, "Well, then I'll call Gongbo and ask him to arrange a time and place."

Mr. Wang went in to make a phone call. At first, he came back and said that Gongbo wanted to see me and asked where I lived. I told him. But when Mr. Wang came back again, he said that Gongbo had asked me to go to his place at three o'clock.

It was not far from twelve o'clock, so I said goodbye and went to visit Mr. Sun Zhesheng.

Mr. Zhesheng also asked about my research on oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions. I had heard Dr. Wu Jingxiong say in Shanghai that Mr. Zhesheng had bought my "Yinqi Cuibian" to give to him, but he had given my "Qu Yuan" and "Faust" in return. The study of ancient artifacts seems to be becoming a general interest in China, but I have only been back in China for two months, and those studies seem like two centuries ago. I myself may be afraid of a crisis.

Among the furnishings, I saw a bronze vessel with a lid, a "Yi". When I opened the lid, there were inscriptions on both the lid and the bottom of the vessel. The maker was "Gongfu Zhai, the grandson of Fu Gong" (Gongfu is the courtesy name, Zhai is the given name). I remember that this vessel was recorded in "Ningshou Jiangu" or "Xiqing Gujian". Wang Guowei believed that vessels like the Yi but with lids were drinking vessels called "Sigong". However, this Gongfu Zhai Yi is large and has a lid, and the inscription clearly states that it is a Yi, and both the vessel and the inscription are not likely to be forgeries, which shows that Wang Guowei's theory of Sigong is also a bit unreliable. In ancient times, Yi and Pan (basins) were necessarily similar. Yi are vessels for holding water. Whether holding hot or cold water, it does not prevent them from having lids. It is untenable to say that Yi did not often have lids. Perhaps small Yi with lids could also hold wine, and the ancients called them Sigong.

Because of frequent reports, I stayed at Mr. Zhesheng's place from twelve o'clock to past three o'clock. I talked a lot, met many people, and Gongbo also came to see me here.

Determined to Resolve the Sino-Japanese War  US Ambassador to the UK Returns to Post Yesterday Simultaneously  Secretary of State Hull Visits Canada

[New York] Davis, the chief representative of the United States to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, departed from here today for Brussels. Before his departure, he expressed the hope that Japan could attend the conference and cooperate with other countries to shorten the war and peacefully resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. When a Japanese reporter asked Davis whether he was accusing Japan of being an aggressor, Davis replied, "We have no prejudice, only like other peace-loving wise people, sit down and discuss." As for whether Soviet Russia was invited to participate, Davis said, "We (probably referring to the United States) did not invite Soviet Russia," meaning that the United States does not have the authority to invite any country. Davis further stated that although the United States has a plan in mind for participating in the conference, it is unwilling to make any predictions and will probably adapt to the situation as it changes. (Guomin News Agency, 20th)

[New York] Davis, the US representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, stated to reporters before his departure today that "What we need is peace, so we must do our best to promote peace. The US delegation's trip to Europe does not offer any promises, but we are determined to explore all avenues to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict and end the war." When asked about his hopes for the future of the conference, Davis replied, "It is not yet possible to predict what steps will be taken or what paths will be followed. Our minds are absolutely open and are not bound by anything." Davis added that, according to the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, we can convene a conference to consult without proposing any specific actions. In addition to Davis, the members of the US delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference include Hornbeck, Special Advisor for Far Eastern Affairs at the State Department, and Murphy, Director of the European Division of the State Department. Both feel that the future of the conference will be very long and difficult. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)

Before the departure, many reporters, especially reporters from China and Japan, asked whether the severity of the international situation was equivalent to that of 1914. Davis declined to comment, saying only, "I am not a prophet. We are going to Brussels this time at the invitation of the Belgian government to seek a constructive and peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute in accordance with Article VII of the Nine-Power Treaty. We have not taken any obligations, nor do we harbor any prejudices. In short, the US government is prepared to seek any path that can lead to peace." A spokesman for the US delegation said that the Brussels conference will be based solely on the Nine-Power Treaty and will not involve the League of Nations, but if the conference ultimately fails, the League of Nations will continue to take action. As for the current position taken by the United States, it is to leave Japan some room for maneuver. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)

### Japan Only Received Notification of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Yesterday Morning

Hirota Plans to Consider Carefully with Konoe and Related Cabinet Members  And Plans to Ask Belgium to Explain the Meaning Before Submitting a Reply

[Tokyo] The Belgian Ambassador to Japan, Bassompierre, visited Foreign Minister Hirota this morning at 10:30 am, and formally submitted an invitation to Japan to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in accordance with instructions from his government. Foreign Minister Hirota will consult with Prime Minister Konoe and various government agencies. The Belgian invitation stated that the Belgian government, following the British government and with the consent of the US government, specially proposed to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to hold a meeting in Brussels on the 30th of this month, to review the situation in East Asia and study effective methods to promote the termination of disputes in various regions, in accordance with Article VII of the treaty. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the content and wording of the invitation are prone to misunderstanding, so he plans to first ask the conference initiator to clarify the meaning and examine it in detail, so as to ensure that it does not leave any misunderstanding in the future, and then respond. It is now scheduled that at the cabinet meeting on the 22nd, the Foreign Minister will first report on the acceptance of the invitation, and then the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Konoe, as well as various related cabinet members, will engage in careful consultation, taking a cautious and cautious attitude to deal with it. Among the related ministries, although it is planned to submit it to the cabinet meeting after deciding on the countermeasures, and then submit it to the Emperor for approval, it will be reported to the Belgian government. The government also plans to clarify Japan's actions towards China in its reply, announce it to China and foreign countries, and attach a statement on the Japanese government's policy on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The so-called Japanese government's established policy is that the Sino-Japanese dispute should be resolved fairly and appropriately by the two countries themselves based on reality. Therefore, in addition to regretting the invitation to participate in the Nine-Power Conference, it is difficult to accept. (Daimeng News Agency, 21st)

### US Military Supplies Can Be Self-Sufficient

[Washington] According to US veteran Wagner today, among the world's great powers, the only country that can be self-sufficient in wartime without waiting for external assistance is the United States. After examining 24 kinds of minerals, he determined that Japan, Germany, and Italy are all unlikely to engage in long-term warfare. In terms of these 24 kinds of mineral raw materials, the United States' self-sufficiency rate is 22.35%, Germany's is only 6.20%, Italy's is only 1.77%, and Japan's is only 1.77%. As for France, it accounts for 5.37%, Soviet Russia accounts for 4.95%, and the United Kingdom accounts for 4.50%. Weber also said that all aggressive countries are now actively storing magnesium, which is necessary for steelmaking, so he asked the United States to prepare for a rainy day and store 1,500,000 tons in case of emergency, because only Soviet Russia can be self-sufficient in this metal. As for chromium, which strengthens iron armor shells, only Soviet Russia is rich in it, so it is necessary to store it in advance. Weber went on to say that countries around the world now depend on each other for important raw materials, and few can be completely independent. Therefore, except for the United States, no country has the possibility of defeating other countries. Therefore, in his opinion, if aggressive countries are placed in a completely isolated position, and the world does not communicate with them, they will be in a situation of being unable to advance or retreat. But the United States is not the same. In the event of an emergency, in addition to its own rich mineral resources, it can also use the mineral resources of Central and South America. As for the abundance of food, there is no other country in the world that can compare with the United States. The only things lacking are the aforementioned magnesium, as well as nickel, tungsten, antimony, rubber, and quinine, which are necessary for wartime. (Guomin News Agency, 20th)

British nationals are also suffering, with many having their homes destroyed and livelihoods cut off. The Lord Mayor added that the mayors of Edinburgh, Glasgow, York, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, and Plymouth have united with him in appealing to the nation. In addition, the British Red Cross, the China Association, and the British Missionary Societies have formed a committee to receive donations, chaired by Lord Donoughmore, former Under-Secretary of State for War. All money and goods donated in Britain will be sent to China and distributed under the direction of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Northcote. The Lord Mayor of London's public letter will be published in various newspapers today. Sir Evelyn Baring, a well-known British financier, has donated £1,000, which has already been delivered to the committee. There are many other large donors. It is also noted that the joint appeal letter of December 2nd was signed by many prominent figures, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of Westminster, the Archbishop of York, and the Lord Mayor of London.

### Methods for Registering Japanese Goods for the Economic Severance Association

Distributed to Various Trade Associations for Registration　Final Deadline is November 1st

The Shanghai National Economic Severance Association Against Japan has decided on methods for registering Japanese goods purchased before August 13th in this city. These methods have been handed over to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to be implemented by various trade associations. It is learned that various registration forms (three in total) have now been printed. It is hoped that all businesses will go to their respective trade associations immediately to register as soon as possible, no later than November 1st. The established methods for registering Japanese goods are recorded below: ㊀ All factories and businesses in this city that purchased raw materials produced in Japan, goods imported from Japan, or goods manufactured in Japanese factories in China before August 13th of this year must register with the Registration Section of this Association in accordance with these methods before October 31st. ㊁ Registration forms are divided into the following three types: (A) Raw Material Registration Form, for factories that purchase Japanese raw materials to manufacture goods; (B) Goods Registration Form, for businesses that sell Japanese goods; (C) Order Contract Registration Form, for factories and businesses that have entered into contracts with Japanese merchants or agents selling Japanese goods that have not yet been fully fulfilled. ㊂ The format of the registration form shall be determined by this Association. ㊃ The Raw Material Registration Form shall be filled out by the factory applying for registration, indicating the manufacturing process. ㊄ The Goods Registration Form shall be filled out by the business applying for registration, indicating the sales method. ㊅ In the Order Contract Registration Form, if part of the contract has been fulfilled, both the fulfilled and unfulfilled parts should be indicated. ㊆ The registration forms shall be printed and distributed by this Association, and a letter shall be sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to distribute them to the affiliated trade associations for distribution to member factories and businesses to fill out. ㊇ Factories and businesses that have not established trade associations and have not joined the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce as members should apply to this Association to obtain and register the forms. ㊈ The registration form should be signed and sealed in person by the factory owner or shop owner, or their manager, and should state that if any of the items filled in on the registration form are found to be untrue or incomplete, they are willing to accept the most severe punishment from this Association. ㊉ The registration form shall be in quadruplicate. After being filled out by the factory or business applying for registration, it shall be submitted directly to the respective trade association for review. The trade association shall retain one copy for record, and the remaining three copies shall be stamped and certified by the chairman of the trade association and sent to the Registration Section of this Association. After the Registration Section reviews them, it shall stamp them with a security seal and retain two copies for use by the Association. The fourth copy shall be stamped with the seal of the Shanghai National Economic Severance Association Against Japan for registration and future inspection, and returned to the factory or business applying for registration to keep. ㊉㊀ The quantity of raw materials and goods registered, in addition to those currently in the store or warehouse, those holding warehouse receipts and customs permits should submit them along with the registration form for inspection by the respective trade association during registration. Only after the trade association has verified that there are no errors can the trade association stamp and certify them. ㊉㊁ After the registration procedure is completed, the Inspection Section of this Association will send personnel to inspect the actual quantity of raw materials and goods stored in the store and warehouse of each factory and store, and the quantity on the warehouse receipts and customs permits at any time to see if it matches the quantity reported on the registration form. If there are any discrepancies, once discovered, they will be severely punished. ㊉㊂ After registering raw materials and goods, the factory or business applying for registration, except for the raw material part where the factory owner explains the situation and requests the Association to allow continued use until the raw materials are used up in order to facilitate work, all goods shall not be sold separately before the Association permits centralized sales. Otherwise, once discovered, in addition to confiscating the goods, the person in charge will be severely dealt with according to law. ㊉㊃ After the registration deadline expires, the Registration Section of this Association shall compile and bind the raw materials, goods, and order contract registration forms of the factories and businesses into volumes according to the industry categories, assign numbers to them, and retain one copy in this section for record, and transfer another copy to the Inspection Section for reference in conducting inspection work. ㊉㊄ These methods shall be implemented from the date of the resolution of the Standing Committee of this Association, and the same shall apply to revisions.

### Transit Tax Only Collected Once

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce responded to the China Chemical Industry Society yesterday regarding the explanation that the transit tax is only collected once, stating, "According to Jianghai Customs Proclamation No. 1611, the transit tax that has already been paid at other customs ports shall be exempted." In other words, the transit tax is only collected once, and it is not collected at each level like the Likin tax. Therefore, in the case of A, B, and C mentioned in your letter, if there is a customs office or branch office set up at any point in A, after the transit tax is collected once, it will not be collected again after passing through other places. A copy of the Jianghai Customs Special Waybill Method No. 1616 is attached for your reference. For machine-made goods, after the principal and surtax of 7.5% ad valorem are paid at the first port of departure, they are exempt from repeated collection when passing through the country. In this transit tax regulation, it is stated that machine-made goods should pay transit tax when transported to various places in the country, just like ordinary local goods of the same type. This item of goods should also pay customs duties once. However, goods that should pay consolidated tax are not included in this example. In other words, cotton yarn, etc., which has already been collected consolidated tax once, no longer needs to pay transit tax. Other machine-made goods that do not need to pay consolidated tax only pay transit tax once. The newly ordered transit tax rules mostly levy 7.5% ad valorem, so the method of exempting machine-made goods from repeated collection in the country is not harmed or changed by changing to transit tax. According to what the Association has heard, when machine-made goods arrive at a certain place and are disassembled and transported to another location for sale, it is possible to apply for a distribution license. Please verify this point clearly and reply before the Association inquires Jianghai Customs again to see if it is still handled according to the old regulations.

### Seamen's Union Promotes Boycott Movement Against Japan by Workers of All Countries

Telegrams Requesting Leadership from the International Transport Workers' Federation and the British Labour Party Executive Committee

Since the outbreak of our sacred war of self-defense and national resistance, the anger of working friends all over the world at the brutality of Japan's invasion of China has spread like wildfire. Our Chinese Seamen's Union expresses its admiration for the stance of justice taken by major labor unions around the world, and sends telegrams expressing its gratitude. The following are the two telegrams sent by the union yesterday to the International Transport Workers' Federation in the Netherlands and the Executive Committee of the National Labor Movement of Great Britain in London.

Telegram 1 To the International Transport Workers' Federation in Amsterdam, Netherlands: The Japanese imperialists, in order to realize their ambitions of aggression, have not hesitated to destroy human peace, and have suddenly invaded us with force, invading our Peiping and Tianjin, and disturbing our Shanghai. We are launching a full-scale war of resistance for national self-defense. Although we strike back at those who attack us, we are actually sacrificing ourselves to maintain world peace. In the two months of the war of resistance, the brutality of the Japanese army in China has been witnessed by all. Simply because they were unsuccessful in their expedition, they used innocent refugees as targets, dispatching troops and aircraft to bomb them recklessly in order to retaliate. The disaster-stricken areas extend to thirteen provinces, especially the major cities such as the capital and Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou, resulting in the tragic bombing deaths of over ten thousand elderly, weak, women, and children. As for destroying cultural institutions, disturbing embassies of various countries, occupying churches, and massacring fishermen, these are even lesser matters. With such unbridled actions, there will be no justice or righteousness in the world. This union, leading the national seamen, hereby appeals to your federation to uphold justice and speak frankly, and to inform all member countries of the brutal behavior of Japan's invasion of China, and to unite and rise up to impose severe sanctions on them. Implement the following three measures: ㊀ Boycott the import of Japanese goods. ㊁ Refuse to transport military supplies and various raw materials to Japan. ㊂ Urge your government to implement effective sanctions against Japan. World peace and human justice depend greatly on this. We eagerly await your reply.

Telegram 2 To the Executive Committee of the National Labour Movement of Great Britain in London, and forwarded to working friends all over the world: The tyrannical Japan, having already invaded our Northeast with force, has also sent reinforcements to Ji, Cha, Sui, and Jin, and invaded South China. In fact, they are attempting, on the one hand, to encompass China and monopolize the political and economic interests of East Asia to enrich their poisonous teeth and claws, and on the other hand, to realize Tanaka Giichi's memorial, and to advance westward through our Mongolia to reach Europe and implement a policy of vertical and horizontal alliances, to seize the resources of Europe and the United States, to wield modern weapons, and to indulge in barbaric atrocities. An unprecedented catastrophe for humanity is spreading at an extremely rapid pace. It goes without saying that Chinese women, children, the elderly, and the weak are being bombed and massacred. The flames of their ferocity have also affected friendly peace officers, innocent civilians, neutral ships, and remote ports. If this scourge that threatens world peace and massacres humanity is not removed, there will be no peace in the world. Fortunately, your federation has issued a high-pitched call, proclaiming five resolutions to urge the workers of the world to prepare to "boycott" Japan. Your kindness and friendship are deeply appreciated. In addition to assisting the government troops in defending against violence with the spirit of saving the world by joining the army, the Chinese seamen earnestly hope that our friendly government and people will at least maintain strict neutrality and cut off the economic resources of the Japanese enemy. We specially send this telegram to your federation to lead the workers of the world to effectively urge their respective governments to implement a boycott against Japan as soon as possible and sever all economic ties, so that world civilization will not be destroyed by beasts and demons. China is fortunate, and the world is fortunate.

### British Boy Scouts Association Telegraphed the City's Boy Scouts Yesterday Expressing Sympathy

It is learned that the British Boy Scouts Association has replied to the city's Boy Scouts, and it is also heard that the Corps has been approved by the China Boy Scouts Association to be reorganized as the First Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps. The details are recorded as follows:

Reply from the British Boy Scouts Association

The British Boy Scouts Association replied, "Shanghai British Consulate forwards to the Shanghai Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps, Upon receipt of your telegram. Chinese Boy Scout brothers, in this critical moment, are not afraid of difficulties and are carrying out rescue work. We express our deep sympathy and congratulations. Your work has been reported prominently in major British newspapers. We hope you will continue your efforts. More details in a letter. British Boy Scouts Association, London, October 17th."

Approved for Reorganization as the First Regiment

In order to prepare the national Boy Scouts for long-term service, the China Boy Scouts Association has issued orders to the councils in various regions to organize wartime service corps. Now, the Shanghai Boy Scouts have been approved to be reorganized as the First Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps. The staff of the General Headquarters has not changed. A secretariat, command office, propaganda office, and law enforcement office are established above the regimental commander. Each office has a director and deputy director, and several staff members below the director. There are six district corps and a total of twenty-six direct-affiliated detachments. Each detachment has one detachment leader and several squad leaders. In total, the regiment has approximately 1,000 members, of which female comrades account for a quarter. They are all dispatched by the command office to the front and rear lines to undertake rescue, communication, engineering, and other work.

Current Commentary

### The Enemy's Military Intentions

— It Is Appropriate

Judging from the overall war situation, the enemy, having tasted the bitterness of our army's strong resistance and being pressured by the international situation, has concentrated its main military objective in Shanxi. It wants to use all its strength to seize Taiyuan and complete the military control of the situation north of the Yellow River, and then coerce our country into accepting a humiliating peace. As for the Shanghai front, it is really for the sake of the "Imperial Army's" face that it has to painstakingly fight on. The enemy's intention in this area is to urgently occupy D场, forcing our army in Jiangwan and Zhabei to retreat in order to regain some of the face lost before. Once this is achieved, they may be eager to stop.

This intention of the enemy is of course an unattainable fantasy. Since the reinforcement of large armies in Shanxi, we have repeatedly won great victories, and the enemy forces have been exhausted. The enemy's five general offensives in Shanghai have all suffered disastrous defeats, and it is clear that it will not be easy to advance further. Moreover, our military leaders have repeatedly declared their determination to resist to the end. Even if the enemy occasionally wins a local victory and wants to stop, we will not let them off.

However, we cannot fail to point out that the enemy's current attempt to narrow the scope of the war is poisonous. The enemy knows that a protracted war is detrimental to them, and they want to end the war by means of a swift battle. Although this cannot fool our country, it can quite cater to the psychology of some third countries.

### The Question of Democracy During the War of Resistance

— Zhang Naiqi

Recently, some people, upon hearing the word "democracy," immediately think of the following two questions:

1. During the War of Resistance, a strong government is precisely what is needed. Why are we still talking about democracy?

2. During the War of Resistance, we need to support our leaders. Why are we still talking about democracy?

To these two questions, we can give a very simple answer: democracy is civil rights. Mr. Sun Yat-sen has already told us this. Our current War of Resistance is not something that fell from the sky, but simply a new stage of the National Revolution, a further implementation of the Three Principles of the People. Then, who can say that democracy is not needed during the War of Resistance? However, we are unwilling to offer such a simple reason. We want to further study the content of these two questions.

In his "Principle of Democracy," Mr. Sun clearly analyzed the distinction between political power and governing power.

He said:

"The new country we want to create is one in which the great political power of the country is divided into two parts. One is political power, and this great power must be completely handed over to the people, so that the people have full political power to directly manage national affairs. This political power is democracy. The other is governing power, and this great power must be completely handed over to the organs of the government, so that the government has great power to govern national affairs. This governing power is the power of the government."

He also said:

"The power of the government can be developed, and the power of the people can also be expanded. With this kind of political power and governing power, we can achieve the goals of American scholars and create an all-powerful government for the happiness of the people."

These two paragraphs prove that the development of democracy will not only not reduce the power of the government, but can actually increase it. The lessons that history has given us also show that only a democratic system can thoroughly eliminate all feudal separatist forces in politics and economics, complete a truly unified country, and establish a strong government. The political disputes and the fragility of the foundation of government caused by democratic systems in European and American countries in recent decades are not inherent weaknesses of democratic politics, but rather acquired pathologies of democratic politics. This is because parliaments have gradually become tools of □□ capitalists and cannot reflect the public will of the majority of people. The contradictions within the bourgeoisie are reflected in the parliament, while the unanimous opinions of the majority of the people are not expressed. Let us look at how, after various countries overthrew the feudal system and established a democratic system, the tyrannical power of autocracy was eliminated, but the power of the government only increased. An emperor who wields the power of life and death may seem "unparalleled" on the surface, but where can he mobilize the power of the entire country? A democratic government, even though it is constrained by parliament in peacetime, has a growth of national strength and the mobilization of national power that a feudal government can never match. Let us look again at how, in recent years, the people of some countries have gradually become aware and have gradually been able to elect representatives who represent their own interests, and the foundation of politics has become relatively stable. In short, the weakness of democratic politics is exposed when the parliament cannot represent the majority of the people, when democracy becomes false democracy. What evil does democracy itself have? As for the issue of democracy in our country, the call for democracy before the War of Resistance is different from that after the War of Resistance. Before the War of Resistance, when we talked about democracy, we wanted the government to execute the public will of the people and resist aggression. After the War of Resistance, when we talked about democracy, we wanted the government to concentrate national power, mobilize the people's strength, and fight the War of Resistance to the end to achieve final victory. To be honest, what the people are currently concerned about is not the excessive power of the central government or the concentration of power in the leader, but the fear that the power of the central government cannot reach the local level, and that the leader's will cannot reach the lower levels, thereby weakening the strength of the War of Resistance. I once said that "unity from top to bottom" has been achieved, but there are still some problems in the middle layers. The people want to resist the War, the leader has already launched the War of Resistance, the people want to fight the War of Resistance to the end, and the leader also says that we cannot achieve final victory unless we mobilize the entire nation to participate in the War of Resistance. The leader has completely executed the public will of the people. From the relationship between the leader and the people, it can be said to be extremely democratic. However, there are a few obstacles in the middle layers! From a military point of view, everyone knows that the initial failures in the North China War were due to the fact that a small number of local military personnel still harbored feudal separatist ideas. They were unable to execute the intentions of the central government above, and violated the soldiers' demands for resistance below, which led to missed opportunities and repeated losses of famous cities. If there were no obstacles in this middle layer, and the intentions of the central government and the demands of the soldiers could be integrated, how could this have happened? We also know that in this great tide of the War of Resistance, all corrupt and filthy things will be washed away cleanly, and all obstacles will be eliminated as much as possible. However, washing away and eliminating them in a way that burns both jade and stone and loses territory is too great a drain on national strength! Secondly, in the political sphere, the bureaucratic atmosphere of corruption and stupidity, the consciousness of monopolistic power, and the tricks of political manipulators still remain everywhere. Even enemy spies and traitors who recognize thieves as their fathers are constantly being discovered. Undoubtedly, the policy of compromise, both internally and externally, in the past ten years has caused many evil and corrupt habits to re-emerge. At the same time, many evil and corrupt elements have also taken the opportunity to infiltrate political institutions. Some of them deceive those above and deceive those below, while others flatter those above and abuse those below. On the one hand, they nominally obey but actually disobey, hindering the implementation of the central government's policies. On the other hand, they exploit their borrowed authority to weaken the people's faith in the government. In the event of military setbacks, those who re-propose a policy of compromise and attempt to undermine the War of Resistance will probably be these people. Thirdly, in the social sphere, new and old local bullies who control the rear work and the Baojia system, using it as a tool for personal gain, are also everywhere. For example, the punishment of traitors and the conscription of strong men have become excuses for local bullies to extort money from the common people in many places. In order to cover up their own misdeeds, they cannot but suppress the rise of the people. How urgently the country needs the people to rise up during the War of Resistance, how can these people understand or care about it? These selfish and shameless scoundrels will naturally become traitors and puppets for their own private interests when enemy troops are pressing down on the border. These various obstacles in the middle layer have usurped the governing power of the government above and plundered the political power of the people below. What we are asking for now is democracy, which is to ask them to return the governing power to the government and the political power to the people. In terms of the relationship between the government and the people, we hope that the government can eliminate all evil and corrupt elements who deceive those above and deceive those below, and create a situation of unity from top to bottom. In terms of the relationship between the central government and the local governments, we hope that the central government can eliminate all remnants of feudal separatist consciousness and create a truly unified country. In order to achieve this hope, we believe that the government must first give the people more democratic rights, so that the people can automatically organize to protect their own interests and contribute their own strength. At the same time, public opinion can become the mouthpiece of the people, enough to expose all the evil deeds of exploiting, grabbing, and oppressing the common people, and correct all the habits of monopolizing, controlling, corruption, and stupidity. The thorough execution of this task is not enough to rely solely on the power of thunder above. Even if a network of detectives is set up, I am afraid that it will have little effect. There must be the strength of the people below as a foundation for the strength above to be brought into play. What corrupt elements fear is not the spotty and leaky sanctions from above, but the sanctions from the people who are watching with a thousand eyes.

The great War of Resistance is a touchstone for the entire nation, and also a touchstone for every individual. Who loves the country, who does not love the country, who is progressive, and who is corrupt, will be fully expressed in their enthusiasm for the War of Resistance. In this great tide, we do not need any party consciousness, nor do we need any class prejudice, because the interests of the nation ultimately outweigh the interests of any group, and the pain of being a subjugated slave is ultimately supra-economic. To be more specific, we do not need to overemphasize a person's past history and economic foundation, but only need to pay attention to his performance today. If a warlord participates in the War of Resistance, or a local bully launches rear support, we should immediately regard him as a comrade. The battle lines are too easy to draw, and all general slogans of "oppose" and "overthrow" are no longer needed now. As long as everyone can eliminate prejudices, unite all patriotic people, and at the same time break through affection and sanction all selfish people, the obstacles in the middle layer can be easily removed.

Historically, the implementation of democratic systems has often been in the midst of a great tide. We now have a leader above who executes the public will of the people, many pure and good cadres in the middle layers, and a unified will of the people in the lower layers. The opening of democratic rights and the improvement of the government's governing power have become two things that are not contradictory and cannot be separated. What else is there to worry about? Have we forgotten the meaning of the four words "democratic centralism"?

In short, in order to guarantee the final victory of the War of Resistance, we need an all-powerful government. However, an all-powerful government must have the great strength of the people as its foundation. The purpose of democracy during the War of Resistance is to improve the strength of the people, eliminate the obstacles in the middle layer, so that the people and the leader are integrated, so that the central government and the local governments are integrated, in order to create an all-powerful government.

### A Hundred Aspects of Wartime Japan

Preface

Special dispatch from Shishi News Agency: After the Lugouqiao Incident, our reporter immediately went to Japan as quickly as possible and returned to Shanghai yesterday. For a period of three months, Japan was always in a very tense state of war. Because the Japanese police monitored the reporter's movements and checked the reporter's letters, there was no freedom of communication in Japan. Now that he has returned to the motherland, after taking a deep breath of freedom, he immediately took up his pen to draft this "A Hundred Aspects of Wartime Japan," depicting its dynamics from various aspects of politics and society, which may be used as a reference for those who are concerned about wartime Japan.

㊀ Why the War?

Why is Japan at war with China? This is easy to answer. Japan wants to plunder China's resources and conquer China in order to realize its continental policy.

However, they find it inconvenient to say this so bluntly to the countries of the world. Therefore, they have to agonizingly seek some grand and legitimate reasons. The first step is to cover up: "not expanding the incident," "local settlement." By the time the incident expanded to Shanghai, and even the 72nd extraordinary Diet session was convened to increase military spending by 260,000,000 yen, the □□ section, □□, then Konoe also followed in the footsteps of the military and shouted "punish the Chinese government!"

On the one hand, they shouted "punish," while on the other hand, they put on a wonderfully unique Japanese mask, saying that the purpose of Japan's war with China is to demand China's cooperation ("tie-up"), not to demand "territory." The target of Japan's punishment is the Chinese government, not the Chinese people. Japan would rather seek happiness for the Chinese people.

These divisive words may sound very pleasant to Konoe and the various members of the military, but they fundamentally failed to see whether today's Chinese government and people are so easily divided. Just look at the enthusiastic support of the central government by the generals and the people across the north and south of China after the War of Resistance, and their desperate resistance, and you can see how short-sighted and pitiful Konoe and others are.

Regarding this matter, Honda Kumalaro Shiha, a senior member of their country's diplomatic circles and former ambassador to Germany, made a severe criticism at a national conference in Shiba Park. He said, "Japan keeps saying that it wants to seek happiness for the Chinese people. I think that before Japan seeks happiness for the people of other countries, it is best to first enable its own people to have food and clothing. Japan itself is a poor country. The people's needs for food and clothing all depend on China. The most developed industry in Japan is textiles, and the Japanese textile industry in Jiangnan accounts for 20% of the national textile industry, and can earn a surplus of hundreds of millions of yen every year. The undershirts, cotton vests, underwear, etc. worn by Japanese citizens are all stained with the benefits of this surplus. But the war has destroyed this huge source of profit. What will the Japanese people rely on to maintain their food and clothing in the long term?" This is truly a pointed comment. Unfortunately, under extreme pressure of speech, those who dare to shout so loudly are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. And what Mr. Honda said, if the reporter had not heard it with his own ears, would never be seen in the newspapers.

The wonderful theory of demanding "tie-up" through war is like slapping someone in the face with one hand and asking them to shake hands and be friends with the other. No country or nation other than the clever Japanese can do this. So Konoe asked the author of the Three Principles, Foreign Minister Hirota, for advice, and received a new magic weapon, saying that he wanted to eliminate the communization of China. He thought that this time he could scare the economic imperialist countries. However, this magic weapon does not seem to have much effect either. The President of the United States, in his speech in Chicago, abandoned his previous wait-and-see attitude and gave an inhuman evaluation of the Japanese army's brutal bombing of unprepared cities and unarmed people, believing that Japan's military actions against China violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

This forced Japan to reveal its true colors. On October 6, Tatsumo Kawai, head of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department, issued a "bomb" statement to foreign reporters, saying that the world was created for mankind, and that honest and hardworking people have the right to enjoy a happy life. Those who rely on the legacy of their ancestors to possess vast resources, but are lazy and unwilling to develop them, should be eliminated. The distribution of world resources is currently uneven, with a distinction between "holders" and "non-holders." What other means can "non-holders" use to resolve the demand for an average distribution of resources other than war? This statement is Japan's true attitude: you have it, I don't; give me yours; if you don't give it to me, I'll hit you. This is the reason for Japan's war against China. This robber-like confession won applause from foreign reporters, who said, "If you had said so earlier, wouldn't that have been better? We now understand Japan's true intentions."

Kawai's statement, which revealed the dagger after the map was exhausted, aroused great dissatisfaction in the cabinet. At the cabinet meeting on October 8, Ryutaro Nagai sternly questioned Hirota about why the head of the Information Department spoke so rashly. At a time when relations between Britain and the United States and Japan were tense, such an important statement was not understood by the cabinet and was lightly released, which was extremely inappropriate. Cabinet members echoed Nagai and criticized Hirota one after another. Hirota was very embarrassed, and Konoe also said, "This head of the Information Department is really terrible."

㊁ Reuters vs. Kawai

There is a foreign newspaper in Japan run by an American, □□□□□□□, □ have □'s □ say. He said that in this war, Japan has taken the offensive militarily, but in international propaganda, it is completely on the defensive and has been completely devastated by China's attacks. To do propaganda work, you must at least have basic knowledge of journalism. According to the conventions of news, sensational reports are usually placed in the most prominent position to attract readers, and the most unwelcome thing in news is corrective reports. And in general readers only pay attention to sensational reports, and do not pay attention to the subsequent corrections. In this Sino-Japanese incident, the information supplied by the Chinese side and the telegrams taken by Western reporters from China were all based on on-the-spot observations exposing the inhumane behavior of the Japanese army. The telegrams sent by Japan only denied or corrected the communications of Chinese and Western reporters. The war is in China, and the actual situation of the war is reported by Chinese and Western reporters based on on-the-spot observations. Readers will of course gladly believe it, while the denying telegrams sent by Japan are mostly taken from Tokyo. Since Tokyo is not the location of the war, and no Japanese official or reporter stays in Nanjing or other Chinese cities, what materials does Japan have to deny the communications of Chinese or Western reporters?

The above editorial revealed the entire picture of Japanese propaganda. The Information Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs meets with foreign reporters twice a week. It seems that every time they are there to do the work of denying or correcting. For example, on September 22, Reuters had an unusually detailed report on the large-scale bombing by Japanese aircraft in Nanjing and Guangdong. It was sent to London, and all newspapers used this inhumane bombing of unprepared cities and the killing of 2,000 non-combatants as the headline, causing indignation in the British government and public against the Japanese army's atrocities. Kawai, the head of the Japanese Information Department, issued a fanciful statement on this matter, saying that Reuters had no special correspondent in Guangdong, and that the news was provided by a Chinese person surnamed Liang from Guangdong, which was obviously untrustworthy. M. J. Cox, the Tokyo correspondent of Reuters, confronted Kawai face-to-face about this. Cox officially notified the Allied News Agency and Japanese newspapers that this correspondent was ordered by the headquarters of Reuters to solemnly declare that Reuters did have a special correspondent in Guangdong. This person is British and has been a teacher at the Shanghai Municipal Council Middle School for many years. He is an executive of Reuters who is proficient in Chinese affairs. The special correspondent personally witnessed the Japanese aircraft killing 1,000 non-combatants. Reuters does not have the so-called Mr. Liang.

Faced with Cox's tough counterattack, Kawai had no choice but to abandon his armor and flee. Propaganda that is not based on facts can only expose its own ugliness.

㊂ Strengthening the Wartime Cabinet

The problem currently being considered by the Japanese political world is no longer the war, because the war has already begun. The problem that the upper levels of the political world are anxious about is the result of winning or losing the war, and how to deal with the aftermath.

In the space between heaven and earth, even if it is not defeated, with the upward trend of China's national strength today, the courage of the War of Resistance, and the complexity of international relations, Konoe cannot afford the heavy responsibility of dealing with the postwar situation. Therefore, he planned early and organized a temporary cabinet council.

The cabinet council brings together representatives of various forces in Japan to reflect the opinions of people from all walks of life and resolve all minor frictions in order to deal with the current situation. Because it is a combination of various forces, it is no different from various factions sharing the political responsibility for Konoe. From Konoe's own point of view, it is indeed a cardiac injection to strengthen the fragile cabinet. However, it is doubtful how much effect a cabinet council that is pieced together, even pulling together Ugaki and Araki, who are usually incompatible, can have. Moreover, people in the press have reservations about the candidates, such as Kiyoshi Akita and Yosuke Matsuoka. Therefore, even before the cabinet council was established, some people were already questioning its weight. The temporary cabinet official system was approved by the Privy Council plenary session on October 13 and announced on the 15th. The content consists of two articles: first, regarding important state affairs concerning the China Incident, a number of cabinet councilors shall be appointed to participate in the cabinet's planning. The cabinet councilors shall be selected from among experienced people by imperial decree. Second, the cabinet councilors shall be treated as state ministers.

The general election of cabinet councilors will be held with four people selected by the military (two each from the army and navy), three people selected by the political world, two people selected by the financial world, and one person selected by the diplomatic world, for a total of ten people.

Army: General Kazushige Ugaki, General Sadao Araki.

Navy: Admiral Kiyotane Anbo, Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu.

Political parties: President of the Minseito, Chuji Machida, Acting Committee Member of the Seiyukai, Yonezo Maeda, Independent Kiyoshi Akita.

Financial world: Seinosuke Gō, Shigeyoshi Ikeda.

Diplomatic field: Yosuke Matsuoka.

The Asahi Shimbun editorial on the 14th stated, "The cabinet council is not a deliberative advisory body. Each person treated as a state minister individually participates in the planning of the cabinet. There is a risk of a lack of political clarity. Depending on the selection of personnel, rather than being regarded as a national institution, it gives the impression of a private organ of the Prime Minister. "It also said, "When the current cabinet appeared, some people said that the appearance of Duke Konoe was the 'last resort.' In a certain sense, this cabinet participation is the real last resort. At the same time that everyone is present, there is a feeling that the treasury is empty." It also said, "The people will never believe that absolutely trusting Foreign Minister Hirota in the diplomatic field means that there is no need for any strengthening work. Otherwise, it would make people sigh that there is no one in the diplomatic world. What is more necessary than internal strengthening is the renewal and strengthening of the diplomatic front." (End of the third paragraph, to be continued, the full text is not finished.)

### The Municipal Authorities Establish a Children's Hospital for the Common People

Madame Kong is also selecting a site to prepare for the establishment of one. In the future, there are also plans to provide considerable education.

Mayor Yu of this city, in view of the fact that after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, refugees have been displaced and children are particularly suffering, has instructed Director Li of the Health Bureau to investigate the situation. According to reports, the average daily death rate of children in shelters and other common people is about 200. Therefore, he instructed Director Li of the Health Bureau to establish a children's hospital as soon as possible to save them. Director Li is actively preparing for this and has received the full cooperation of Director Xu and Section Chief Xia of the Finance Bureau in arranging funding. A children's hospital for the common people has been established at No. 65 Moore Road, with 100 beds temporarily. Work began on the 16th of this month. Children from one to ten years old in difficult circumstances can go there for free outpatient and inpatient treatment. In order to expand the number of beds and enrich the content, we still need enthusiastic men and women from all walks of life who care about the well-being of children to donate clothes, milk powder, milk, and medicines. If you want to donate cash, please hand it over to the Shanghai Municipal Bank branch at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Luyuan Road for collection, and a stamped official receipt will be issued to ensure prudence and prevent impersonation and fraud.

Ms. Soong Ai-ling, wife of Vice President Kong, previously single-handedly funded and ran a wounded soldiers' hospital at the original site of Lido, with outstanding results. Later, she received an order from the Central Government that all private hospitals must be closed. Therefore, all the items in the hospital were transferred to the rear hospital in Suzhou in the interior. Madame Kong, in view of the fact that there are still no children's hospital facilities in society, and that general poor and sick children have no place to seek medical treatment, has long had a plan to establish a children's hospital. Now that the wounded soldiers' hospital has been completed and closed, she has decided to open it in advance. The location at a large Western-style house on Kangnaiduo Road is the most suitable. However, there are still many Christian refugees helped by Madame Kong in that place. Arrangements are currently being made to resettle them separately. It will be established in about a week. It is heard that the hospital specializes in accepting orphaned children between the ages of six and twelve. The entire hospital can accommodate about 100 people. At the beginning of the opening, 60 people will be accepted temporarily. Madame Kong also plans to provide considerable education to the children after they have recovered their health, and to establish contact with the educational institutions run by the China Child Welfare Association, so that the children in the hospital can receive at least elementary school education. Those who have outstanding talents will be selected to study further and receive further education. The rest will be found ways to make them employed, so that they can become useful talents in society. Madame Kong also hopes that there will be the same facilities in large cities in the future. Her contributions to children and the country should not be small.

### Random War Diary (9) (Attached Picture)

— Special Military Correspondent Chen Wanli from the Central News Agency

October 15th

The sky is much calmer than the previous two days. Although the buzzing of planes still disturbs us from time to time, construction continues on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River. The enemy will never forget the heavy losses at Dachang and Zhenru, but they are only sacrificing their lives in vain. This dream of a central breakthrough will be shattered under our bayonets.

"Frontline Daily" and "Frontline Pictorial" are newly published wartime reading materials, said to be specially provided for the soldiers on the front lines to read. The content is very rich. I saw a picture on the Frontline Pictorial; it depicted a soldier tying a straw man and hanging it on a tree branch. He then tied a rope to the bottom of the straw man, held the other end of the rope, and lay prone in the trench, constantly pulling the straw man. The enemy saw it from afar and thought it was our attack, so they bombarded wildly in panic, wasting a lot of shells. Someone told me this was a true depiction of the battlefield, and I found it very interesting.

Tonight is as quiet as daytime. I rarely hear the sound of cannons, so I should be able to sleep peacefully.

October 16th

I got up at four o'clock in the morning, rushed to Shanghai, and was very happy to see many friends. A little after two o'clock in the evening, I hurriedly returned in the moonlight. Along the way, I saw stretcher bearers carrying wounded soldiers down from the front lines. Their family members stood waiting for the ambulances to arrive. I was deeply moved. I feel that we need to provide faster medical care for our wounded warriors.

October 17th

Fierce fighting is taking place in the areas of Gejia Pailouzhai and Chenjiahang. On one hand, the enemy is trying to advance south (Gejia Pailouzhai) through Dachang to Jianzhenru, completing an encirclement. On the other hand, they are trying to advance west (Chenjiahang) towards Nanxiang, implementing a strategy of central breakthrough. However, the enemy has suffered major setbacks in both locations. There is fierce, heroic fighting taking place in Gejia Pailouzhai.

The enemy at Houjia Muqiao (in front of Miaohang) previously attacked our Xinzhaizhen position, but we inflicted a crushing defeat on them, and even captured a prisoner. He is a private first class in the Second Platoon, Twelfth Company, Third Battalion, Third Regiment, Second Brigade of the First Division, named Tanaka Seizo. He was sent here yesterday.

A middle-aged man with a full beard and a bald head is Tanaka Seizo. He grew up in Tokyo and is thirty-five years old this year. He runs a flower shop in Tokyo. He is a reserve soldier and was discharged from the military in the twelfth year of the Taisho era. After the outbreak of this war of aggression against China, both reservists and retired soldiers were mobilized, and he was forced by the warlords to come to Shanghai. He has been fighting submerged in water for more than a week, and his waist and legs are swollen and painful. His spirit is exhausted to the extreme, so he could not escape and was captured by us.

According to him, the Japanese army in Shanghai has suffered heavy casualties. Generally speaking, the casualties have exceeded half. The Second Division has suffered even heavier casualties, with almost no prisoners taken. The commander of the Kano Brigade and the captain of the Hasegawa unit, both belonging to his own First Division, have also been killed in action. It is verified that Kano, the brigade commander, died in battle at Caojiazha in the eleventh month of this month. His name was Haruji, he was from Tokyo Prefecture, and he was fifty years old. He was a graduate of the 21st class of military officers and had served as an adjunct to the 13th Infantry Regiment and the adjutant to the 1st Division.

We asked him if it was true that General Matsui was injured, and he replied, "I heard that he was indeed injured."

He also said that the Japanese army is currently experiencing great difficulties with food. Soldiers carry dry rations on the front lines, which are distributed once every two days. But after eating the dry rations, everyone cannot quench their thirst, so they randomly drink dirty, raw water, and dysentery is seriously prevalent among the soldiers.

He expressed extreme disgust with this war. He said that both the reservists and retired soldiers unanimously oppose this war, and that Japan's economic strength cannot bear this war.

He is very grateful for our preferential treatment and is even more grateful that he will be able to return alive to Tokyo.

October 18th

The bombing and shelling continue as usual, but the infantry only has minor contact all day. Today, enemy planes scattered six or seven different kinds of leaflets over our positions. Most of them say "Welcome to surrender" and even "We've raised the price!" saying "Those who surrender with this leaflet will be rewarded with two silver dollars." This only exposes the enemy's desperate ugliness and also proves that the enemy is completely helpless in the war.

One type of leaflet even has English printed on it. I don't know if the enemy has accepted the suggestion of foreign journalists and hopes that the British and American troops stationed here will also surrender. This is truly unfathomable.

In addition to "welcoming" our "surrender," the enemy is also trying to provoke and alienate our feelings toward England. Among the many leaflets they have distributed, there is one called "A Diagram of Britain's Exploitation of Chinese Funds," which says "The pro-European and American factions are helping Britain funnel Chinese funds into England without end." After seeing this "Diagram of Britain's Exploitation of Chinese Funds," I think that the enemy planes' strafing of the British ambassador and air attaché was definitely not a misunderstanding. They clearly saw the British flag before shooting at it.

Today, someone took a photo of the prisoner Tanaka Seizo, so I took a few too. At that time, he saw me smoking a cigarette, so he asked for one and also requested to write a letter home to report his safety because, since he joined the war on September 14, the officers have absolutely forbidden domestic correspondence, probably fearing that the truth of the defeats would be spread back home.

### Comforting Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Opens Today

More than 700 Pieces of Exquisite Works Displayed on the Fourth Floor of the Great World Company

The Chinese Painting Society, the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Society, and others, in order to comfort the brave soldiers fighting against the enemy on the front lines, specially initiated a calligraphy and painting exhibition to comfort the soldiers. Since the preparation, they have received enthusiastic support from important figures of the party and state, as well as famous contemporary calligraphers. More than 700 pieces of exquisite works have been collected, numbered, and displayed on the fourth floor of the Great World Company on Nanjing Road for public exhibition. The exhibition will be held from October 22nd to November 5th, from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day. Visitors are welcome to visit without tickets. The calligraphy and paintings displayed at the venue are not priced, and people are free to bid and draw lots. There are also methods for people to obtain them. All proceeds from the sale will be used as consolation money, and the Shanghai Consolation Committee will send personnel to directly collect the money with receipts. It is expected that the number of visitors will be very crowded.

### Red Cross Tenth Ambulance Team Seeks Donations of Vehicles and Quilts

Jiang Fangjiu, captain of the Tenth Ambulance Team of the Pudong Red Cross, yesterday issued a request to the Shanghai charity community to donate ten bicycles and one hundred quilts. It is reported that enemy planes and cannons have been indiscriminately bombing innocent civilians in Pudong in recent days. Towns like Yangjing West and Tangqiao East have been the worst affected. Many people have been torn limb from limb. The team is responsible for the rescue work along the river for forty or fifty miles. Unlike Shanghai, where there are cars for transportation, everything relies on walking, and the work is arduous. Bicycles are specially for the use of intelligence officers to investigate the bombing locations and notify the stretcher teams for rescue. Quilts are for the wounded to cover themselves. Donors are also requested to send their donations to the General Association at No. 25 Ye Hong Road, specifying that they are for the use of the Pudong Tenth Team.

### Film Industry Appeals for Refugees

Broadcasting Begins Today on Chinese and Western Radio Stations to Raise Funds

The golden wind sends coolness, and the weather is getting colder. Hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled from the war zones are displaced, crying from hunger and cold, and their situation is particularly pitiful. The Shanghai Film Industry National Salvation Association, as fellow countrymen, should answer their call. It has specially joined forces with the Relief Committee to launch a broadcast appeal for donations. Starting at 2:00 PM today, famous male and female stars will broadcast and sing their specialties of Peking opera, drama, singing, etc. on Chinese and Western radio stations (frequency 1040, telephone 94020). It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate generously to help the disaster-stricken people in their hour of need.

### Ambulance Team of the Rescue Association Encountered Danger

Two Wounded Soldiers Killed on the Spot by Bombing, Ambulance Riddled with Over a Hundred Bullet Holes

The 　 Rescue Team of the Shanghai Rescue Committee, led by Deputy Captain Lei Shude, departed from a certain place in Jiading at 7:15 AM on the 18th to rescue wounded soldiers. When the ambulance was carrying wounded soldiers through a certain town, because the place was located on the front line and enemy planes were releasing signals, enemy artillery fire was concentrated on the area. The team immediately stopped advancing and completely moved the lightly and seriously wounded soldiers out of the vehicle, scattering them around. Within a period of thirty-five minutes, more than two hundred shells landed in the vicinity. Two wounded soldiers were killed on the spot by the bombing. The remaining wounded soldiers, team members, and drivers were all knocked into the ditches along the road. The ambulance was riddled with over a hundred bullet holes of various sizes. Fortunately, the machinery was not badly damaged. After the artillery fire subsided slightly and after some repairs, the deputy captain personally drove the vehicle with the wounded soldiers to a certain dressing station set up by the association for treatment.

### Women's Battlefield Service Corps to Expand its Organization

Ms. Hu Lanqi, the leader of the Shanghai Labor Women's Battlefield Service Corps, has led her comrades to serve on the front lines with remarkable achievements. Yesterday, she returned to Shanghai on official business and will expand the organization and add another team to depart for the front lines and work hard on rescue work. According to Ms. Hu, the refugees in the war zone are everywhere, homeless, and suffering from cold and hunger. There is an urgent need for refugee clothing, especially clothes for women and children. It is hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will donate generously. Women in the war zone are currently making cloth shoes for the soldiers, so it is hoped that all sectors will donate cloth. The above two items should be sent to Ms. Hu at No. 13 Zhenping Lane, Songshan Road, so that they can be forwarded to the front lines. The merit will be immeasurable.

### Our Army Recaptured Xin Muqiao and Vigorously Advanced Toward Liuhang

Stubborn Enemy Defending Gejia Pailou and Huanggang • Successively Conquered Important Locations North and South • General Offensive Centered on Guangfu Town • This Morning Our Army Captured Hei Da Huang Zhai

For several consecutive days, the enemy has been attempting to advance on Dachang on a large scale. After our close interception and thorough mopping-up, the enemy has become disoriented and panicked. The night before last, in order to test the enemy's strength, our army launched a counterattack on the entire left wing with concentrated artillery fire. After achieving our purpose, we triumphantly retreated back to our original positions. Starting at 8:00 PM last night, we ordered a general offensive on the entire front, centered on Guangfu Town, and advanced to take Liuhang in order to make the enemy unable to care for both ends and to threaten the rear of the enemy forces advancing on Dachang from the south. As a result of the general offensive, our entire army has achieved considerable gains, making the enemy who crossed the Fengcun Tang to attack Dachang from the side trapped between Gejia Pailou and Huanggang, making it impossible for them to advance. The safety of Dachang can be said to be completely assured from the current war situation. The front-line battle report obtained by this newspaper at 2:00 PM this afternoon is as follows: ㊀ Last night, our army's general offensive centered on Guangfu Town recovered the important locations of Shiqiao and Daizhai southeast of Guangfu Town at midnight. Our army has recovered part of the North and South Meizhai northeast of Guangfu Town. After our army was successful on the left and right wings, it encircled and fiercely attacked the enemy in the center of Xin Muqiao. After a fierce battle, it was also completely recovered by 2:00 AM this morning. ㊁ On the line of Chenjia Lane and Dunwusi Temple, we deployed elite and fresh troops. For several consecutive days, the enemy has been fiercely attacking this line, attempting to directly spy on Nanxiang. After our head-on attack, they no longer dared to try again lightly. Last night, our army began to attack, breaking through the enemy's first line of defense and forcing them to retreat to the second trench. ㊂ The stubborn enemy on the south bank of Fengcun Tang is still entrenched in the Gejia Pailou and Huanggang area. Last night and this morning, they repeatedly attacked our positions in Hulizhai and other places, but were all repelled. ㊃ Along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway in the Huangjiazhai and Zhujiazhai area, there was fierce fighting this morning that has not stopped so far. Enemy planes and cannons are constantly bombing our positions. Our mechanized units were dispatched to meet the enemy, and they have a great advantage. ㊄ Our army continues to make progress in Jiangwan and Zhabei. The situation in Miaohang is relatively quiet.

### We Recaptured Hei Da Huang Zhai

A Central News Agency correspondent with the Jiangwan army reported at 1:30 PM on the 22nd that the biggest success of our army's counterattack last night on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River was the recapture of Hei Da Huang Zhai. At dusk, we advanced in five routes, with the troops at Dunwusi Temple on the north bank providing support. Our army fought bravely and killed the enemy and advanced rapidly. By 11:00 PM, we had advanced to the vicinity of Shenjiazhai and continued to charge, up to four times. We fell forward and followed each other, advancing without retreating. It was not until 5:30 AM this morning (the 22nd) that Hei Da Huang Zhai was recaptured, posing a major threat to the enemy who had advanced deep to the south.

### Guangfu Our Army Ordered General Offensive Last Night and Advanced Toward Liuhang

Southern Route Recovered Shiqiao and Daizhai • Northern Route Occupied North and South Two Meizhai • Recaptured Xin Muqiao and Continued to Advance

Last night, our army issued an order for a general offensive on the entire front. Centered on Guangfu, the entire army advanced to take Liuhang in order to threaten the rear of the enemy forces on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River. After a night of bloody fighting, our army has made considerable progress, successively recovering important strongholds east and west of Guangfu, such as Shiqiao, Daizhai, South Meizhai, North Meizhai, and other places. The enemy at Xin Muqiao east of Guangfu was surrounded on the left and right and hastily retreated. Our army tracked the enemy and continued to advance, aiming for Liuhang. The distance between Guangfu and Liuhang is only four thousand meters. If our army can recapture Liuhang and cut off the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, then the enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River will have their retreat cut off and will fall into our army's large encirclement. Advancing on Dachang will be nothing more than a dream.

Last night at 8:00 PM, our army's general offensive began. Starting from Guangfu, we advanced on Liuhang from the north and south routes. All the soldiers were exceptionally brave. As soon as they heard the order, everyone was excited and rushed forward. Although the enemy concentrated their firepower and fiercely bombarded us, they could not stop the advance of our brave soldiers. The sound of killing shook the sky under the artillery fire. Although the enemy stubbornly resisted, their defensive works were completely destroyed under our army's brave and fierce attack. Corpses were everywhere, and countless weapons were abandoned. The enemy retreated in panic. Our army on the southern route completely recovered the two important strongholds of Shiqiao and Daizhai to the southeast. Our army on the northern route attacked the enemy, who stubbornly defended the strong fortifications at Nanmeizhai and Beimeizhai. Under the rain of enemy bullets, our army fell forward and followed each other, charging and fighting in close combat with bayonets and hand grenades, and finally broke into the two villages and occupied part of them. The enemy at Xin Muqiao in the center saw that the left and right sides had been lost and were surrounded by our army on three sides. They had no intention of fighting and hastily retreated. The defeated enemy was in a state of panic and great confusion. This morning, our army is still continuing to advance on the entire front, advancing towards Liuhang.

### Our Army Broke Through the Enemy's First Line of Defense in Chenjia Lane

Fighting is Still Fiercely Progressing This Morning

On the Chenjia Lane and Dunwusi Temple line, our army also launched an attack forward at the same time last night. Although the enemy stubbornly resisted based on fortifications, our soldiers were incomparably brave and advanced through the enemy's artillery fire and rain of bullets. After a night of bloody fighting, they broke through the enemy's first line of defense and fiercely forced them to retreat into the second trench. This morning, the fighting on this line is still extremely fierce, and our army has made considerable progress.

### Our Air Force Attacked Again Last Night and Inflicted Heavy Damage on the Enemy

Enemy Ammunition Depot and Barracks Were Bombed by Us

When our air force was bombing the Yangshupu area last night, the Yizhong Rubber Factory at No. 134 Chaoyang Road was hit by a bomb and caught fire, spreading to neighboring houses and causing considerable damage. In addition, two warehouses of the Weitong Textile Company on Lan Road also caught fire and were extinguished by fire engines dispatched by the Public Works Department. It is reported that the above locations were all parts of the enemy's military supplies and temporary barracks, so the deaths and losses were exceptionally heavy.

Between 10:22 PM and 10:31 PM, 11:29 PM and 11:36 PM, 12:56 AM and 1:07 AM this morning, 1:39 AM and 1:46 AM, and 2:40 AM and 2:47 AM, our planes launched night attacks. Anti-aircraft guns fired continuously. Bombs fell in the following locations: ㊀ 11:15 PM, Qiqihar Road and Yanshan Road, causing a large fire. ㊁ 12:15 PM, Pingliang Road and Meizhou Road intersection also caught fire. ㊂ 2:55 AM, there was also a fire at Pingliang Road and Qiqihar Road.

### Enemy Forces at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang Are Still Surrounded by Our Army

Attempted to Break Through Once Last Night but Were Still Bravely Repelled by Our Army

Our army's advance at Guangfu poses a great threat to the enemy advancing on Dachang from the south of the Wenzaobang River. Our army north of Dachang is also attacking from the Huangjiazhai and Yujiazhai area along the highway. Our army in the Zhangjialouxia area on the left wing is also striking the back of the enemy attacking from the south. The enemy at Gejia Pailou and Huanggang are thus trapped in a heavy encirclement. After our army attacked last night, the enemy stubbornly resisted and once attempted to break through and counterattack us. Our army's morale was extremely high, and we repelled them in one go. The enemy is holding on to their fortifications and is still surrounded by our army.

### Our Army is Making Rapid Progress in Jiangwan

Has Occupied Three Important Villages • Last Night, Our Army Launched a General Offensive on the Entire Front. On the Jiangwan and Zhabei line, our army also launched a brave attack at the same time. Due to Zhabei's proximity to the concession, citizens of the special district heard very clear and continuous artillery fire, as well as dense machine gun and rifle fire, until about 6:00 PM. After 7:00 PM, it became even more intense and did not stop all night. Our army repeatedly attacked the enemy in the area of ​​Sijing Stadium in the direction of Baziqiao, Tiyuhui Road, Dongzhai, and Hejiazhai in separate attacks. At the same time, our army also launched a fierce attack on 63 Huayuan and Aiguo Girls' School from Tan Jiazhai, Hujia Muqiao, Shuidian Road, and Liuying Road. Under the cover of the artillery, everyone in our army was exceptionally brave, and once approached 63 Huayuan, killing many enemies. The enemy in the North Sichuan Road area was also attacked by our army from Guangdong Street and Dongbaoxing Road. In particular, our army near the Jiangwan Stadium made faster progress and occupied three important villages there, annihilating many enemies.

The Miaohang area was relatively quiet yesterday. Both sides maintained their original positions. However, our army's vigilance was extremely tight. If the enemy comes to attack, it will be difficult for them to succeed.

### Fierce Artillery Battles Several Times in Pudong

At 8:00 PM last night, just as the troops in Zhabei were fiercely attacking the enemy's Hongkou and Yangshupu positions, our brave heavy artillery team in Pudong once again exerted its power, firing artillery shells at the enemy's bases in the above two places. Each shell was extremely loud, and the houses and land in Pudong were shaken. When the sound of the artillery fire began, it landed in the enemy's positions, and the sound of explosions was heard. The target was extremely accurate. After more than a dozen shells were fired in succession, a fire broke out near North Sichuan Road. The enemy suffered a major threat from this, and more than a dozen enemy warships of various sizes also joined forces to fire artillery at Pudong in retaliation. As a result, a fierce artillery battle broke out between the two sides. For a time, the rumbling sound in the Huangpu River resounded through the clouds. In the fierce battle until about 10:30 PM, our side fired more than one hundred heavy artillery shells. Many shells hit the enemy's positions, and the enemy soldiers suffered heavy casualties. In order to avoid our shells, the enemy warships moved back and forth from time to time and fired a total of more than two hundred shells. Most of the shells landed in the fields of Caijiaxiang, Nanyangjing Bridge, Jiangjiaxiang, Yangjiadu, Tangqiao, and Zijiaqiao. Only a dozen shells destroyed several civilian houses. More than a dozen men and women, including Xiangmin Jiang Chenshi, Zhu Qinghua, Zhang Xirong, Jiang Abao, Lu Jiangshi, Jiang Jinsheng, Chen Shiliang, Chen Dingshi, Chen Yueming, He Dingsan, Jiang Agen, Wu Linjiang, and Jiang Fendi, were killed or injured. At 4:30 AM this morning, enemy warships opened fire again in retaliation. Our army ignored them. The enemy fired a total of twenty or thirty rounds. Seeing that our side did not react, they stopped. At 8:00 AM, five or six enemy planes flew to the rear of Pudong to scout our artillery positions. They lasted for two hours without gaining anything.

### Our Army Attacked Along the Pinghan Railway Line and Advanced to the Matouzhen Area

Remnants of the Enemy North of Yucheng on the Jinpu Railway Line are Being Mopped Up • Fierce Fighting in Eastern Jin, We Occupied the Heights North of Jiuguan

[Zhengzhou] North of the Zhanghe River on the Pinghan Railway, a certain unit of our fresh troops has been bravely attacking for days. It is said that they have now advanced to the Matouzhen area.

### Enemy Army Admires the Spirit of Our Army

Women and Children Also Love Their Country

[Taiyuan] According to the obtained memo of a Japanese officer, (1) Chinese soldiers who fell behind (that is, retreated) and were pursued by our army often chose to commit suicide rather than surrender. Even though they are enemies, we cannot help but admire their great spirit. (2) Men, women, old, and young in the Guangjin area threw hand grenades at our army, showing that even women and children in China have a patriotic spirit. (3) Corpses continue to be left everywhere, and even a bellicose nation cannot help but feel war-weariness (Central News Agency telegram on the 21st).

### Nine-Nation Pact Conference: Italy Decides to Participate

Japan Carefully Considers Reply, Eden Explains British Foreign Policy

[Rome] Regarding the Nine-Nation Pact Conference, Italian officials have stated that the Italian government has accepted the invitation to participate. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

[Nanjing] Sources in diplomatic circles state that the Nine-Nation Pact Conference will be held in Beijing on the 30th of this month. Representatives from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have already been appointed. It is now reported that the French cabinet has decided that Foreign Minister Delbos and the Under-Secretary will serve as plenipotentiary representatives to attend the conference. The representative of Sweden to the conference is expected to be the Swedish Minister to Belgium. (Central News Agency, 21st)

[Tokyo] After Foreign Minister Hirota received the Belgian government's invitation for Japan to participate in the Nine-Nation Pact Conference, he convened a meeting of key officials at the Vice-Minister's office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:30 PM. Vice-Minister Horiuchi and various bureau chiefs attended the meeting. They decided on the general outline of the government's reply. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, taking a cautious approach, decided to hold another meeting of key officials today and exchange views with relevant ministries. The proposal will be submitted to the cabinet on the 26th for a formal decision and then sent to the Belgian government. At the same time, the central government will issue an important statement to clarify Japan's attitude toward the Nine-Nation Pact Conference to countries around the world. (Domei News Agency, 21st)

[London] The House of Commons reconvened at 3:00 PM today and immediately began debating foreign policy. Foreign Secretary Eden first gave a speech, explaining Britain's policies toward the Far East and the situation in Spain. Regarding the situation in the Far East, he said, "The desire of everyone today is to stop the killing and suffering within China. If the upcoming Nine-Nation Pact Conference can achieve this goal, it will be a great contribution to peace and humanity. If it fails, we will inevitably have to consider a new situation. However, we have great hope for the success of the Nine-Nation Pact Conference, and I reiterate this repeatedly. The British government is determined to do everything in its power to make it a success." Speaking of the conflict between China and Japan, he said that regardless of the final outcome, the result will only be to impoverish both sides and the world. Britain is most aggrieved by this conflict, not only because we have significant commercial interests in the Far East, but also because we were in talks with the Japanese government before the Sino-Japanese war broke out. If these talks had continued and the Chinese government had been consulted, relations between countries in the Far East might have improved considerably. Now these talks have been suspended, and it seems impossible to continue them under the current circumstances. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the British government has maintained close contact with relevant countries, especially the United States, to find a solution. As a result, the decision was made to convene the Nine-Nation Pact Conference. According to information received here, the Italian government has decided to participate, and the US government has sent Davis as its chief representative. It is not appropriate to speculate at this time what issues should or should not be discussed after the conference opens. What can be said is, "The League of Nations has prepared an agenda for this conference. Therefore, I would like to make a suggestion to the gentlemen of the House of Commons: The proper step for us to take is to consult with the other signatory countries of the Nine-Nation Pact and do everything in our power to carry out the tasks assigned by the League of Nations." (Havas News Agency, 21st)

### (Brief Commentary)

— Xiang

One of the reasons Japan is hastily using force against China this time is the instability of the European political situation. Therefore, after the undeclared bloody war between China and Japan, it concluded some kind of agreement with Germany and Italy to provide remote support. This move is clearly a gesture towards the Soviet Union, saying, "If you come, you must consider your rear." In fact, Japan's credibility in the international community has long been bankrupt. Who knows if it will unite with Germany and Italy today for support, and then unite with Soviet Russia tomorrow for backing if the situation changes? Germany and Italy, though foolish, will certainly not allow themselves to be genuinely used by Japan to create a second world war. Furthermore, the relationship between China and Russia is completely different from the relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Japan considers China a constant annoyance and the Soviet Union an enemy. The first step is to invade China, and the second step is to go to war with Russia. Therefore, China's resistance this time is tantamount to resisting Japan for the Soviet Union. Germany and Italy have always been on good terms with China and have no affection for Japan. However, due to certain circumstances, they have joined forces with Japan. But Japan's strength, after this war, has been exhausted and its tricks have been exposed. If Germany and Italy are not able to use Japan but are instead used by Japan, wouldn't that be a great injustice?

### Our Troops Launch Full-Scale Counterattack, Recapturing Many Key Points

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 11:00 AM on the 22nd that our troops launched a full-scale counterattack, starting at 7:30 PM last night. Soldiers from all directions, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, advanced towards their predetermined targets. The enemy frantically fought back, with anti-aircraft guns, artillery, and machine guns forming a wall of fire. The intensity of the situation was unprecedented since "August 13th." Our brave soldiers braved the artillery fire and fought bravely, making progress in all directions, recapturing many important strongholds, and annihilating countless enemies. The fighting temporarily stopped at 4:00 AM. After dawn, a thick fog enveloped the area, preventing enemy aircraft from operating. Our troops continued to take advantage of the natural smoke screen, pressing on and fighting bravely. They fought fiercely for another four hours, and everything fell silent at 9:00 AM. The situation in each sector is as follows:

Gejia Pailou Area

The Gejia Pailou and Huanggang areas on the south bank of the Yunzao Creek were the center of intense fighting. In order to eliminate the enemy forces on both sides of the Fengcun Pond, we adopted a pincer attack from both flanks and a large encirclement from the rear. Therefore, on the front line of Huguozhai, Sujiazhai, and Xiaochiyuan, we strictly blocked the enemy's continued advance, while attacking their left flank along Fengcun Pond via Tanjiatou and Zhangjialou. Our troops advanced one after another, with no retreat. The enemy's strength was gradually shaken by our encirclement, but because the enemy concentrated a strong main force there, it was difficult to annihilate them immediately.

Chenjia Lane to Guangfu

Our troops made considerable progress on the entire line from Chenjia Lane to Guangfu. Our troops launched attacks from Dunwu Temple, Lao Lu Zhai, Guangfu, Wu Zhai, Zhangjia Zhai, and Zhu Bei Zhai, creating a formidable momentum. The enemy collapsed at the sight of us. Zhangjia Zhai, Wu Zhai, and Nan Mei Zhai in front of them were the locations of the enemy's main force on the right flank. We attacked from both sides, and the enemy could not resist. We captured many of their weapons and equipment. On the Guangfu front, we advanced more than a thousand meters, reaching Xi Erfang via Xinmu Bridge. After our troops recaptured Tang Qiaotou, they turned north and joined the troops at Xi Erfang to attack and capture Shi Qiao. Among them, Daizhai was a point where the enemy stubbornly defended and refused to retreat, and it has been heavily surrounded by us. On the northeast sides of Dunwu Temple, we have recaptured Shengjiazhai, Qiaotingzhai, and Zhu Sanfang, etc.

Jiangtianwan Lukesi

In other areas, such as Jiangwan, we recaptured Lukesi and attacked Liangjiang Girls' School from the East and West Sports Association roads, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In Miaohang, we also advanced 300 meters east from Guo Lezhai, restoring the point of the Shuixian Temple. Near Houjia Muqiao, many enemies were killed, and many rifles were captured. In Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai, the enemy resisted stubbornly, so the fighting was very fierce. A certain battalion commander of ours was seriously injured near Lu Zhai while leading the charge. Shenjiawan Zhai was once broken through by the enemy, but it was recovered by our daredevil team by midnight.

Cao Su Wangcun Temple Line

According to a report from our Guangfu war correspondent at 10:00 AM, the enemy at the western end of Wu Zhai was still dreaming when we attacked. Our troops suddenly arrived and surrounded and annihilated dozens of enemies. Many documents were obtained from the enemy corpses and are being examined. On the Cao Wang Temple and Su Village line, our troops also launched a surprise attack. In Lao Dan Zhai, Xin Dan Zhai, Qin Jia Zhai, Meng Jia Alley, and Zhao Jia Bridge, the enemy collapsed and retreated, and our troops bravely pursued, killing and capturing many enemies. Shugou Bridge Station and Yang Zhai south of the Liu River Creek were all recaptured by us. The remnants of the enemy collapsed and retreated to Houjia Zhai, Chen Zhai, and Wang Zhai. In total, in the area between Zhai, Guangfu, and the Liu River, we suffered several hundred casualties, while the enemy suffered several times more.

### Impressions in the Midst of Artillery Fire

— Geng Ya

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Under the bright moon of the previous night, the car circled along a relatively safe route, like a Taoist priest drawing talismans, stubbornly sending us to the front line in the ×× sector. Fortunately, we were not visited by the flying gentlemen along the way, thanks to the spirit of the Premier in heaven!

However, passing through several small villages and towns along the way, we saw collapsed houses and rubble everywhere. From the lingering aftereffects of the flying shrapnel and gunpowder, we could still smell the remnants of the mad and brutal enemy planes that had just withdrawn during the day or late at night. Some shops that had narrowly escaped destruction, although their doors and windows were tightly closed, and no light could be seen, could still be inferred from the sales of tofu shops that were still grinding and filtering soy milk as usual that the people had not all died or fled due to the enemy's bombing. Such illegal acts of the enemy arbitrarily bombing the people in non-combat areas, besides (1) strengthening our determination to fight and win, (2) further arousing international public anger against Japan, and (3) sowing some bad seeds for their own Yamato descendants, could it be that their sun flag, which seems to have been shot through into a large blood hole by the arrow of human justice, would suddenly be planted on our territory along with the bombs?

The enemy planes' random bombing is not only "unreasonable" but sometimes also "unfathomable." A adjutant on the front line said, "He personally saw an enemy plane flying from our rear and dropping eight bombs on a cotton field of hundreds of acres. The next day at dusk, he saw the same thing again." Is this because the pilot couldn't find a target after flying out and had to drop them randomly to get reimbursed? Or has he realized the illegality of his country's warlords' invasion and is passively implementing his anti-war ideas? I think if it is fortunately the latter reason, then the new development of this kind of situation will inevitably intensify and promote the collapse of Japanese imperialism.

General ××, the commander of the ×× division, who was directing operations at a certain place on the front line, also told us a similar unexpected thing. He said, "Today, more than twenty enemy shells were fired and landed one after another nearby, but strangely enough, not a single one exploded, otherwise our whole nest would have been in trouble! At that time, everyone laughed and commented on this matter, some saying 'Heaven helps China,' and others saying 'God protects the General,' but in reality, everyone understood that this was obviously the enemy sabotaging themselves. Otherwise, objectively speaking, it also exposed the enemy's great weakness of ineffective ammunition."

We certainly cannot overestimate the enemy's military strength, but we should not underestimate it either. For example, the artillery shells fired by the enemy a few days ago had the recent year number of Showa 12 on them. If we believe the saying that the enemy's artillery fire is lacking only two months after the start of the Sino-Japanese war, then we are undoubtedly making a mistake of underestimation. However, the enemy used all their magic weapons, such as aircraft, artillery, and poison gas, in their four general offensives in February, but they were still stumped by our heroic and resistant warriors and could not move an inch. They originally worshiped material things the most, so they brought out the newly improved artillery shells, but the results were only so-so. This, of course, reflects that we are using extremely strong and invigorating morale to lash out at the enemy who only relies on material things, and we will definitely have smooth sailing and win every battle to the end.

Now the enemy's fifth and sixth reinforcements have arrived in Shanghai, trembling with fear. However, our heroic soldiers on the front line, who are killing more and more vigorously and gaining more and more experience, only responded with a cold laugh when they heard this news, saying, "We hope they come to Shanghai in batches, the more we kill, the fewer there are; otherwise, if they don't come here, they will eventually go to North China!" What a heroic and responsible statement! The ancients had a butcher who was good at killing cattle, so he had no whole cattle in his eyes. Similarly, these jumping clowns in front of us, in the eyes of our generals who command the wind and clouds and have the ambition to swallow the Big Dipper, have also become the ashes of corpses packed into thousands of boxes to be transported back to Taiwan!

Kill a batch when they come, kill one less – this is not just our soldiers exaggerating early. That day, they captured three genuine Japanese prisoners in the victorious counterattack in the downtown area. From their squeaking confessions, we learned that the enemy army has indeed suffered more than half casualties since the start of the war. They were originally reserve soldiers who had just been transferred and had not yet learned about the war. When they were recruited in Tokyo, they were tricked into believing that they were only defending against the communist army in the concession. Who knew that as soon as they arrived in Shanghai, they were told to go to the front line. For a few days, the food was not delivered, and they were really starving to death... As the prisoner spoke, he disregarded his so-called imperial army's dignity (?) and wept bitterly, complaining endlessly. Such demoralized morale, driven to the battlefield of guns and bullets, and the sound of killing, is not tantamount to driving lambs to feed the tiger's mouth?

Another prisoner said that their headquarters is located in our magnificent New City Government Auditorium. Nearby tall buildings, such as museums, libraries, and gymnasiums, are all protected by anti-aircraft guns. General Matsui, the human butcher who led the general Japanese innocent civilians to Shanghai to die, has indeed been injured and is hiding in the headquarters, barely directing the command.

Since the enemy army launched the war on August 13, their initial strategy of attacking from the wings has been repeatedly hit hard, and their strength has been almost exhausted. Then they requested elite reinforcements, such as the so-called mechanized division of the Kurume Division, attempting a central breakthrough. Although they have repeatedly paid a heavy price, they have gained little and have not been able to easily cross the Lei Pond. Since the central breakthrough plan has repeatedly failed, if they want to change to encirclement on both flanks in the future, the extended front line will inevitably require more than twice the number of troops as before. But how will the small three islands collect so many troops again? In desperation, it seems that they will still adopt the central breakthrough, but we are building fortifications step by step and fighting steadily. No matter which point they break through, they will not touch our carefully prepared barrage and will throw themselves into our long-awaited fire net, guaranteeing to make them follow the repeated failures of the past and collapse and retreat with their heads in their hands.

This is one of our positions on the front line: in front of us, there are enemy and our machine guns, the sound of short bursts of fire, behind us, there are our farsighted and loudly bombing the enemy's accurate cannons, looking into the distance in the sky above the Huangpu River, there are enemy planes constantly firing searchlights high into the sky, and signal flares with red and green colors. Needless to say, this is again our planes showing their power in the Hongkou area,... In such a front-line environment, some fragments of information were actually discovered from my heroic soldiers who are bravely resisting the war (26, 10, 20)

### The Activity of Guerrilla in the Suburban Areas

Workers, Peasants, and Students Participate the Most; It is Extremely Difficult for the Japanese Bandits to Cope

Beijing Communication: Since the Lugouqiao Incident, followed by the loss of Beiping and Tianjin, the general salvation groups in Beiping, in order to recover the lost territory, expel Japanese imperialism from China, and strive for the victory of the war of resistance, decided to organize guerrilla teams and launch guerrilla warfare.

Organizational Basis

There were originally the National Salvation Association, the Anti-Gambling Association, and the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard in the suburbs of Beiping, with more than 30 members. There were 23 people in Wanping 7th District, Qingbaikou, and other places. There were more than 30 members in the Beiping Elementary School Students Reading Club. In addition, there were 152 local militia. These armed elements immediately tried to hide in various places when the Japanese troops occupied most of the 7th District. After the 7th District was lost, they immediately led more than 200 refugees, more than 10 members of the Changxindian Wuwei Group, more than 100 members of the Zhuoxian National Salvation Association, dozens of workers and civilians in Kangzhuang, and 40 to 50 members of the People's Vanguard team who remained in Beiping to participate, actively organizing them and laying a preliminary foundation.

Organizational Process

After the 29th Army withdrew from Beiping, Zhao's 27 troops who went to a certain place in early August were blocked and returned to Beiping in Yangyifang and other places. They immediately decided to organize three independent units that contacted, echoed, and helped each other. At the appropriate time, they would organize a staff group to serve as the overall leadership organ. After August 15, the staff group began to send people to inspect and enrich the organization of various units. Later, student soldiers were secretly deployed in the northeast and west suburbs of Beiping and smashed the Second Prison, releasing more than 500 people. With the consent of the prisoners, more than 200 people participated in guerrilla work. In a few days, they came into contact with the enemy army. As a result, the team killed the brigade commander and one member, and injured one machine gunner. The enemy died eight or nine people, and many were injured. The unit immediately retreated to ×× and other places. Because of the expansion of the unit and the busy affairs, a reorganization meeting was held on September 9.

Organizational Composition

Those who participated in the guerrilla team included farmers and workers, former Northeast Volunteers and political prisoners, and general prisoners. In addition, there were soldiers and security groups, among which there were especially many students.

Impact on the Enemy

The enemy in Beiping does not have many troops. Every day, the same troops enter Xidaomen and exit Dongzhimen, then enter Yongdingmen and exit Chaoyang or Andingmen. Even at the Qinghua and Qinghe stations on the Ping-Sui Railway, the enemy troops only station 40 to 50 people daily. When there is an alarm, they call Xiwan or Xizhimen to temporarily dispatch troops. The enemy originally stationed many troops in Kongshankou Road, Mentougou, and Pingxi Xiyuan, but the enemy troops in Pingxi Xiyuan and other places in mid-September have all been transferred away. Our guerrilla team knows the enemy's situation well, is very active, and attacks various gates from time to time. The enemy army cannot dispatch enough troops and finds it difficult to cope. The enemy army often conscripts laborers inside and outside the city and ravages women. The houses in the villages before and after Qicun and Nanbeiliucun on the edge of the Western Hills have been mostly burned down by the enemy army, and countless people have been killed. Especially when entering Futouling, they kill anyone they see, which is extremely cruel. Therefore, the general public hates the enemy army very much, and the guerrilla team gets a lot of help from the people when it attacks. (11th)

### Enemy Ships Attack Changshu Along the River Ports

Enemy Ships Take Advantage of the Rising Tide; After Two Fierce Battles, the Enemy Finally Collapses and Retreats

Changshu Communication: In recent days, the cities here and the Fushan, Hupu, and Dongzhang City areas along the river have been repeatedly ravaged by enemy planes, and enemy ships have also sailed to various ports from time to time, bombarding our shore, attempting to land. Therefore, recently, each river port has been unusually strained. The situation in each port is briefly recorded as follows:

In the early part of this month, the weather was cloudy and rainy, and the southeast wind was strong. As a result, the river tide rose greatly. The enemy took advantage of the opportunity and ordered four enemy ships that had gone to the outside of the Fushan port on the night of the 7th to fire on our shore along the Hupu port area. However, because they were still far from the shore, the bullets all fell into the river. On the night of the 8th, the enemy took advantage of the strong wind and heavy rain to launch a large-scale attack on the Fushan port with wooden rafts and bamboo rafts. Our army waited until they were close to the shore and used dense rifles and machine guns to sweep them. The enemy used small steel cannons to bombard us. After three hours of fierce fighting between the two sides, our army, because it was waiting in ease, had an absolute advantage and finally repelled the enemy. The next day, due to the rapid tide, the bamboo and wooden rafts used by the enemy were all scattered. Hupu port also had wooden sections drifting in. On the evening of the 11th, the enemy ships sailed from downstream and docked outside the Baimao, Xu Liujing, Hupu, and Geshān ports, with a total of more than 35 ships. That night, they also used rubber boats to sail to the shore, and the ships used artillery to cover them. Our army also fought back fiercely all night, and it did not stop until dawn. The enemy suffered many casualties, and the bodies mostly fell into the river outside Hupu port. Our army also sank four enemy rubber boats, and a cannon in the boat also fell into the river. A giant bomb fell in the countryside of Guijia City, but it did not explode. The bomb was about three feet high and was manufactured by our Shenyang Arsenal in the 11th year of the Republic of China. Now it is used by the enemy, which is very regrettable. The bomb has now been moved to the Old Wu City District Office for preservation. Many other unexploded small artillery shells of the enemy have also been picked up in the wilderness. This was the most severe two nights of the 8th and 11th. From the evening of the 14th, the enemy took advantage of the tide and had two ships intending to attack Baimao port. Fortunately, the wind suddenly changed in the middle of the way, and the northwest wind blew strongly. An enemy ship was stranded in the Laoshusha area outside Baimao port and could not withdraw. The next morning, we discovered it and immediately gave it close surveillance. Unfortunately, due to insufficient firepower, we could not bombard it. From the 15th to the 17th, the wind did not change, and the enemy ship was still difficult to leave, but it seemed to be protecting the ship to wait for the high tide and then leave. According to visitors from Fushan, a giant ship docked outside Fushan port on the 14th. He witnessed at 9:00 PM that night that two of our planes flew to drop bombs, hitting as many as seven. Although the ship fired artillery in a panic, our planes all flew back safely. Then the ship caught fire, but it was extinguished after a while.

### The Garrison Headquarters Announces the Protection of Merchants and Civilians Transportation

Police Officers and Members Illegally Extort; Those Who Commit This Act Will Be Dealt with Strictly According to Military Law

Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued Announcement General No. 155, stating: During the wartime period, the transportation of goods by merchants and civilians is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood and is of great importance to the long-term war of resistance. In addition to strict investigation to prevent traitors from aiding the enemy and to prevent merchants from manipulating prices, the transportation of goods by legitimate merchants and civilians should be protected and facilitated. It has been found that police officers and members of local agencies and organizations in the suburbs and towns along the way or on the streets of this city illegally extort money from inland merchants and civilians who transport goods to Shanghai by ships. This is really disregarding discipline and harming the people. It is necessary to issue a notice and inform everyone. If such incidents occur again in the future, once verified, they will be dealt with according to military law. The victims of the merchants and civilians are allowed to report to this headquarters for strict investigation in order to maintain commercial transport and uphold the law. In addition to the notice, a public announcement is made for all to know. This announcement is issued by Commander Yang Hu.

### Comforting Soldiers in North China

Women's Comfort Association Sends Comfort Goods; National Pharmaceutical Industry Levies Special Donation

He Xiangning, chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Soldiers Fighting in the War of Resistance Against Aggression, sent out four truckloads of comfort goods yesterday (the 21st) afternoon. These included 150 comfort bags (specifically designated for air force soldiers), 2,500 cotton vests, 1,000 pairs of gloves, 2,000 pairs of earmuffs, 2,000 pairs of socks, 200 sets of thermal underwear, 50 cotton quilts, and 200 sets of clothing for wounded soldiers. She requested that Madam Chiang, chairman of the Nanjing General Association, distribute these to the soldiers fighting in North China. The value of this batch of comfort goods is approximately 5,000 yuan.

The Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, in order to raise funds to comfort the soldiers, issued a notice to its members yesterday stating: "With the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the attainment of final victory depends on whether the entire nation can arouse its conscience and contribute all it has to the country. Now, the Songhu War of Resistance has already inflicted heavy damage on the brutal enemy and has been praised by the international community. The North China War of Resistance, which is vital to the nation's lifeline, sees our loyal and brave soldiers fighting fiercely, defending the country with a spirit that deeply moves and respects our entire nation. Various groups in this city have specially organized a North China Soldier Comfort Delegation to express their respect by going north in the coming days to comfort the soldiers fighting in North China. Soldiers risk their lives and forget their own safety to fight for the survival of the nation, and the people should actively support them. The Northbound Comfort Delegation is an important matter. Therefore, after a joint meeting of the association's executive and supervisory committees, it was decided to levy a special donation from all members for two months, starting from now, to be handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for the needs of the northbound comfort mission. We sincerely hope that everyone will share the same hatred for the enemy and generously donate what they can. This is what we earnestly hope for."

### Two Railway Bureaus Add Deputy Directors

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways are vital arteries for transportation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since the war of resistance, enemy aircraft have indiscriminately bombed along the lines. Our country repairs them as soon as they are damaged, striving to maintain them. Therefore, the arduousness of the work of the two railway bureaus is widely acknowledged. The Ministry of Railways, recognizing the importance of the two railways' missions, has specially added the position of Deputy Director. Lu Futing has been appointed to fill the vacancy and took office in Wuxian a few days ago.

### Charity Federation Focuses on International Propaganda

Collecting Photos of Enemy Atrocities to Send to Our Ambassadors in Europe and America

The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association, in view of the fact that the violent Japanese invasion of Shanghai disregards humanitarianism, and indiscriminate bombing has made it difficult for non-combat areas and non-combatants to escape, with countless refugees and rescue workers being killed or injured, in order to expose their atrocities to the international community and awaken the sense of justice in the world, is collecting more than sixty photos of various atrocities and sending them separately to our ambassadors in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium: Gu Weijun, Wang Zhengting, Guo Taiqi, Cheng Tianfang, and Qian Tai, etc., in order to carry out international propaganda. The association properly sealed and mailed the photos yesterday, which will certainly have a significant impact on international opinion.

### Consolidating the Front Line of Resistance

— Yan Zhen

Earlier this month, we received a letter from Mr. Yan—who is over fifty years old—expressing great concern about national affairs and providing us with three methods to consolidate the rear-area front line of resistance. We have specially excerpted them below for public discussion and reference. —Editor's Note

㊀ Resist Enemy Goods—Seeing reports that the enemy is setting up customs in Zhabei to collect taxes is certainly hateful, but their promotion in the market must rely on the assistance of traitors. The way to crack down on this is for each industry to supervise and report on each other. Those who violate the rules should be subject to the death penalty. If someone knows the situation but does not report it, or makes false accusations out of spite, they should be punished in the same way. Once sales are stagnant, imports will inevitably decrease, and the illegal customs will become a mere formality.

㊁ Organize the People—In the interior, rigorously implement the Baojia system, with county and municipal administrative chiefs bearing full responsibility. The quality of its implementation should determine the ranking of their performance. If an unexpected incident occurs, officials and the people should be jointly punished. In cities, implement the neighborhood organization system, tasking relevant public organizations to carry it out forcefully, with strict rules and regulations. If there are difficulties, those in charge should find ways to resolve them.

㊂ Purchase Agricultural Products—The autumn harvest has already begun in various places. Although the Four Banks are handling collateral loans, this may be too slow to address the urgent need, and it may be difficult to prevent traitors from buying up supplies to aid the enemy. To remedy this, the government and the people should do everything they can to purchase on the spot, the sooner the better, to prevent traitors from getting there first.
