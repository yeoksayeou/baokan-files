### Fukuyama and Changshu are still firmly held by us, fierce fighting broke out in the suburbs of Jiaxing yesterday morning.

Our reinforcements, after arriving, once broke through the enemy lines. The enemy suffered heavy losses in the area north of Pingwang and Wujiang.

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 18th: The enemy, who landed in Hangzhou Bay, advanced west to attack Jiaxing, resulting in fierce fighting for days. We are still firmly holding Jiaxing. On the morning of the 18th, our reinforcements continued to arrive and once broke through the enemy lines. Zha Pu is still firmly held by our army. However, a small number of enemy troops were discovered about eight miles northeast of Pinghu on the 17th, and our army is currently annihilating them. Furthermore, the enemy has the intention of attacking Nanxun, which belongs to Huzhou. Fierce fighting for control took place in Pingwang on the 17th. Also, a telegram from Changzhou on the 19th stated that fierce fighting broke out in the suburbs of Jiaxing on the morning of the 19th. Our army bravely resisted the enemy in the positions north of Pingwang Town and Wujiang, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. As for the enemy troops in the Xiejiaqiao area south of Fukuyama, they continue to advance south. Changshu is still firmly held by our army.

The frontline battles in recent days have remained extremely fierce, especially in the Jiaxing area, where the enemy is launching an all-out attack. Our army is resisting desperately, advancing and retreating repeatedly. Both sides have suffered extremely heavy losses. Along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway line, between Zhengyi and Weiting, we are taking advantage of the natural terrain and setting up defenses relying on the water, which puts us in a relatively advantageous position. Although the enemy has mechanized units, they are finding it difficult to maneuver due to the rain and mud. Our army, having the advantage of both favorable weather and terrain, is confident about the future of the resistance. According to news obtained by our local office yesterday: ㊀ Enemy ships are densely deployed on the Fukuyama river surface, numbering as many as sixty or seventy, constantly firing towards the shore, flanking our left-wing Changshu positions. The fighting near Wangjiangjing is intense. After days of heavy bombardment by the enemy, fortifications have been destroyed. There are reports that our army has retreated to the southern district of Yangcheng Lake. ㊁ Our army is guarding the southern district of Yangcheng Lake, which is considered a strategically important location, and the troop strength is strong, so there is no cause for concern. A certain high-ranking general personally went to the battlefield yesterday to supervise the battle, greatly boosting morale. ㊂ The main force of the enemy previously approached Wujiang. After our side received reinforcements, we launched a fierce counterattack and have already lifted the siege. ㊃ There are rumors that Jiaxing is under pressure, but according to sources, our heavy troops are still holding the southeastern sides of the city, resisting bravely. Reinforcements are also arriving one after another. A major battle is imminent, and the enemy will definitely find it difficult to succeed.

Military News: For days, the enemy has been making a very urgent all-out attack on our Jiaxing. However, after being bravely intercepted by our army, they retreated to the Qixingqiao and Tangwanzhen areas, where they are in a standoff with our army. Currently, the enemy is uniting with troops from the Wangjiangjing area to encircle the rear of Jiaxing. At the same time, they are also attempting to attack Wujiang along the Sujia (Suzhou-Jiaxing) Road. However, after our army ambushed Pingwang, the enemy troops on that route seem to have suffered significant losses. There are intense mixed battles near Jiaxing, but we have heavy troops stationed there, which can be relied upon to hold out for a long time. Even if the enemy has intentions, they will have to pay a heavy price.

East China News Agency reported: In the Jiaxing area, after the enemy's plan to encircle the rear via Haiyan and Haining failed, they repeatedly attempted to seize the eastern side of Jiaxing via Jiashan to the front of our Jiaxing, and then via Pingwang and Wangjiangjing. Our ××× Division lured the enemy in and fiercely attacked them, completely annihilating the enemy's reconnaissance team that had fallen into our encirclement. Their cavalry repeatedly attacked along the railway line, but ultimately failed.

### Our army has made progress in both Changshu and Fukuyama

The enemy troops in Taicang are溃退, and we ?? can recover the city.

Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 19th: Cheng News, our army's front lines in Changshu and Fukuyama are consolidated, and progress has been made on all fronts. In Xiejiaqiao Town, south of Fukuyama, our enemy is facing each other across the river. The enemy in front has already retreated to the front. According to war news, the enemy troops in the Taicang area suddenly retreated from the front line the night before and yesterday morning, with a total of more than 2,200 people fleeing into Taicang city. There is still a portion of the remaining enemy troops, who are now fleeing in a panic to Yuewang City. Our army is currently following up in pursuit, advancing towards Taicang, and it is expected that the city will be recovered within days.

### American expatriates in Shanghai talk about Suzhou being bombed, with almost no intact land left.

Bombing sounds have been deafening for a week, non-stop all day long. Most of the people are scattered, resembling a picture of refugees.

Shen Shi News reported that the war situation near Suzhou has been extremely fierce in recent days. The people there are fleeing one after another. However, there are still several British and American expatriates who, unafraid of danger, continue to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. Yesterday, an American expatriate came to Shanghai via Nantong. According to him, since last Saturday, Japanese planes have been bombing Suzhou in large numbers, each time with thirty or forty planes, indiscriminately dropping bombs without any targets. The bombing sounds are deafening, non-stop all day long. The wounded soldiers' hospital near Soochow University was also bombed and destroyed, and most of the wounded soldiers in the hospital were tragically killed in the bombing. That area is not a military zone, and there are no military facilities nearby. Currently, Suzhou is lacking water, and most of the newspapers have also stopped publishing. Most of the residents have left the city, and refugees in the countryside are displaced and wandering everywhere. The tragic situation is difficult to describe completely for a while.

### Suzhou and Kunshan refugees recount the hardships and miseries along the way.

Of the eleven people who traveled together, only five arrived. They suffered all kinds of hardships and tasted all the bitterness.

Yesterday, reporters encountered many people who had fled to Shanghai from Kunshan and Suzhou. These people took a detour through Ningbo and arrived in Shanghai by sea. The hardships and miseries they experienced along the way were truly unlike any experiences in the human world. According to their accounts, after our army retreated to Kunshan, they originally considered Qingyang Port to be a natural barrier that was easy to defend. Even if the enemy had many troops, it would not be easy for them to cross. They planned to hold the line firmly. Unexpectedly, the enemy used small steamships that they had seized on the Suzhou River, as well as small boats that we had collected and moored in a certain place, and civilian boats that they had forcibly requisitioned along the way. They used Chinese traitors to steer the boats, while the Japanese soldiers were all hidden in the cabins. They falsely claimed to be refugees along the way and infiltrated Qingyang Port, taking us by surprise and landing. The enemy's planes and artillery then provided cover. Therefore, the abandonment of Qingyang Port by our army was completely sabotaged by Chinese traitors. As a result, Kunshan had no choice but to strategically withdraw. From then on, Suzhou became the target of Japanese bombing. When they left Suzhou, it was two days before the large-scale Japanese bombing. Many residents of Suzhou city and the surrounding areas had already fled to the countryside. Among the residents of the city, old women who were unable to escape and who threw themselves into wells or hanged themselves were heard of every day, a tragic scene that one could not bear to witness. They were a group of eleven people, traveling along the Sujia Road. They took cars when available. If they encountered air raid alerts, they would get out of the cars and lie down in the fields to take shelter. Fortunately, although Jiaxing was already tense, there were no battles nearby, so they were able to safely reach Jiaxing. However, they had run out of food and could not find tea or water. Enemy planes were constantly wreaking havoc, more than ten times a day. Everyone hid in the ditches in the fields. Extremely hungry and thirsty, they could not find food, so they had to scoop up the dirty mud water from the ditches and drink it. Although it smelled fishy and offensive, they could not care less. After departing from Jiaxing, they still traveled by day and hid by night, finally reaching a certain station on the Huhu (Shanghai-Hangzhou) Railway. After some twists and turns and pleading, they were able to board a train to Hangzhou. There was no order in boarding the train, and there were no more procedures such as buying tickets or collecting tickets. Among their group of eleven, five had already been lost along the way because they were not used to traveling at night. They had no way to find them. They continued to make their way to Ningbo, their clothes and shoes covered in mud, looking like beggars. When they arrived in Ningbo, they encountered enemy planes bombing again. Fortunately, everyone had some money left, so they took the last boat of the Endeavour Line to Shanghai. However, a woman and a child traveling with them were unfortunately lost along the way, and it is feared that they have been buried in the ditches.

### Reports of Bombing in Various Places

Haining

A reporter from Xin Sheng News met Mr. Zhu, a fellow Haining native who arrived in Shanghai on the Shan Ende Line yesterday. According to him, Xiaoshi, Changan, Xieqiao, and other places belonging to Haining were bombed by enemy planes due to their proximity to the Huhu Railway after the outbreak of the Shanghai war. As for the Haining county seat, enemy planes passed over it many times after the war, but it was never bombed. On the contrary, at 8:00 a.m. on the 9th of this month, three enemy planes suddenly dropped three bombs outside the Dadongmen and Xiahetou of the county, destroying four or five flat houses such as the Yishoutang Pharmacy, killing one person and injuring more than ten. Currently, all the residents of the county have moved away to take shelter.

Fengjing

A letter from a certain person in Hangzhou to a friend in Shanghai on the first of this month only arrived yesterday. The person went to Hangzhou from Fengjing on the 7th and witnessed the bombing of Fengjing on the 5th and 6th. On those two days, there were constant enemy air raids from morning to night, and about 200 bombs were dropped. The entire town of Fengjing is no more than three li in area. All the houses were either bombed and destroyed or shaken down. There were no intact houses left in the entire town. The railway station was burnt to the ground. The Ruan family's house was completely destroyed by bombing, and bombs also fell on the Xie family's house. Five bombs fell from Shen Shifang, across from the post office, to the Jiehe Bridge. The main streets on both sides collapsed. The same was true from Fengjia Lane to Xinjiekou. Thirty houses collapsed up and down Shengjia Bridge on the lower West Street. The enemy troops arrived in Fengjing on the 9th, it was said.

Tongxiang

It was reported some days ago that Tongxiang was bombed, with one bombing in Wumiao Street, destroying more than 40 civilian houses and collapsing more than 20, killing and injuring dozens of people. Another bombing was in Miaoqiao Street, destroying one civilian house. According to reliable sources, the residents of the urban area had already evacuated. A dozen houses were destroyed on Wumiao Street, and one person was killed on Miaoqiao Street. The reports of heavy casualties were not true.

### The enemy officially announces 40,000 casualties

Only in the Shanghai-Songhu area; other places are not included.

The Japanese military spokesman officially announced some days ago that the Japanese army, from landing on August 23 to November 15, suffered a total of 39,620 casualties in the Shanghai-Songhu campaign. Among them, 9,700 were killed in action or died of illness, and 29,850 were wounded or sick. Casualties in the Hangzhou Bay and Yangtze River areas are not included in this number. The number of casualties in the North China war zone is about 80% of that in the Shanghai-Songhu area.

### Enemy ships carry bamboo rafts and wood materials to the upper reaches of the Wusong River

Another 5,000 reinforcements arrive in Shanghai, along with a large number of medical supplies.

On the 17th and 18th, ten small enemy transport ships, including Song Maru, Cai Maru, Ying Maru, Haisheng Maru, Yangtai Maru, Sanhe Maru, and the Third Dragon Maru, fully loaded with bamboo rafts, wood materials, and other military supplies, sailed to the upper reaches of the Wusong River at dawn yesterday morning to be used by the enemy army to build bridges and tools for crossing the river.

At 8:00 a.m. yesterday (the 19th), five enemy transport ships, including the 402nd transport ship Yosun Maru, the 198th transport ship Ume Maru, the 292nd transport ship Karafuto Maru, the 394th transport ship Sanxing Maru, and the transport ship Zijin Maru with an unknown number, successively sailed into Shanghai and berthed at the Huangpu, Osaka, Huishan, and Qiujiang wharves, bringing the eleventh batch of the enemy's seventh reinforcements, about 5,000 people. They immediately disembarked separately and headed to the front. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 19th), seven more enemy transport ships, including the Fifth Unkai Maru, the 41st transport ship Katsuragisan Maru, the 349th transport ship Seikyo Maru, the 140th transport ship Ehime, the Sixth Dairyu Maru, the 418th transport ship Shinno Maru, and the transport ship Lushan Maru with an unknown number, sailed into Shanghai and berthed at the Qiujiang, Osaka, Huishan, China Merchants, Huazhan, and New Huishan wharves, bringing a large amount of munitions and food, which are currently being unloaded separately. In addition, the enemy transport ships that have arrived in Shanghai in recent days but have not yet sailed out, including Chikugo Maru, Shinsho Maru, Hato Maru, and Kayo Maru, are continuing to unload munitions and food at the Huishan, China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, Central Wharf, and New Huishan wharves. Also, around 1:00 p.m., two more enemy transport ships, the 72nd transport ship Dairiku Maru No. 9 and the 308th transport ship, sailed into Shanghai. The former berthed on the Bund outside Beijing Road, bringing a large amount of enemy munitions, preparing to unload. The latter, fully loaded with munitions and military supplies, sailed directly to the vicinity of the 16th Pu blockade line. After a brief stop, it sailed into South Huangpu to supply the enemy troops near Songjiang on the Huhu Line.

Central News Agency reported that around 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the enemy Red Cross ship Taizan Maru sailed into Shanghai, first berthing at the fish market wharf, unloading a large amount of medical supplies. At around 11:00 a.m., it sailed to the Huangpu wharf, where more than 1,000 wounded enemy soldiers were carried onto the ship. At around 4:00 p.m., it set sail and returned to Japan. Yesterday, the number of enemy ships in the Huangpu River decreased even further. Apart from 17 transport ships carrying a large number of reinforcements and munitions and one Red Cross ship carrying away more than 1,000 wounded enemy soldiers, only one Izumo warship remained berthed at the No. 2 buoy, one torpedo boat was berthed at the China Merchants Bureau Huazhan, one ironclad ship was berthed at the No. 8 buoy, three destroyers were berthed at the No. 44, No. 40, and No. 1 buoys, and three gunboats were berthed at the Mitsubishi wharf and the New Mitsui wharf, totaling nine ships.

### Asahi Shimbun reports on British preparations for war against Japan

Singapore Naval Base to be completed urgently

The Osaka Asahi Shimbun of the 11th carried a telegram from its Singapore correspondent Aoki stating that the Singapore naval base will be completed within the next month or two. Once completed, the British Navy in the Far East will become more mobile. That is, Britain will demonstrate that it is "truly and faithfully protecting East Asian interests." Recently, a speech by the former British Secretary of the Navy, Samuel Hoare, that "Singapore is the center of national defense" has attracted attention in all quarters, especially with Japan as the hypothetical enemy. As the English-language newspapers in Singapore have spread the word everywhere, the Singapore naval base, according to Mr. Lyens' explanation in the British Parliament in March of this year, was originally scheduled to be completed by 1939. Hoare's statement that it could be completed ahead of schedule proves that there has been a 180-degree major turn in British naval operations. That is, the base is being rushed to completion this year, and all necessary equipment has been mostly completed. Among them, the Air Force has been putting all its efforts into expansion. In other words, the British Navy has changed from horizontal equipment to three-dimensional equipment. In the past, there was only one military airfield on Singapore Island. Three more have been added last year, and more flight squadrons have been added. Recently, the Malay Federation has invested another 2.5 million pounds to add two squadrons. Other volunteer teams have also been expanding one after another. This kind of equipment is a major conversion for war against Japan, it is said.

### German Consul-General Protests Japanese Seizure of Ships

Forcibly Lowering the German Flag on Two Tugboats; Cannot Be Considered an Oversight

National Maritime News Agency reported that the acting German Consul-General in Shanghai today protested to the Japanese Consul-General here regarding the illegal seizure of two German tugboats anchored in the Huangpu River by a Japanese gunboat, and the forcible lowering of the German flag flying on the mast. It is understood that the incident occurred at 11:00 a.m. on the 17th of this month. At that time, two German tugboats were anchored at the French New Shipyard when suddenly many Japanese sailors forcibly seized them. Despite the strong protest of the captain of the French "La Glaciere" gunboat, the Japanese sailors disregarded it, lowered the German flag, replaced it with the Japanese flag, and forcibly sailed away at 4:30 p.m., destination unknown. It is suspected that they are being used for military purposes. The German Consul-General, in addition to expressing his deep gratitude to the French authorities, has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consulate-General, requesting that they investigate the whereabouts of the two tugboats, and strongly arguing that this matter cannot be considered an oversight.

### Enemy Defenses Vacant in Pudong, Bandits Rife in Various Counties

Normal Residents Have Long Fled, Villagers Fleeing to Shanghai are Often Robbed En Route

A portion of the enemy troops in the Pudong area were ordered to be transferred to the front line yesterday, and the remaining troops are already insufficient to be allocated. In the area east of Qichangzhan along the Pudong River, only a few enemy ships are relied upon, anchored in the river to monitor. No troops have been dispatched to defend on land. There are no traces of the enemy in the south, Yangsiqiao Town, or the east, Gaoqiao, Lixing, etc. Therefore, local ruffians are extremely active. Normal residents have long since fled, so all places are desolate. The enemy is trying hard to establish a puppet maintenance association to maintain the facade, but the current Chinese traitors lack prestige, and it is extremely difficult to find suitable people. The enemy also cannot take care of Chuansha and Nanhui counties, which are adjacent to Shanghai City, as the able-bodied men are scattered. As a result, looting is rampant. Most of the villagers who want to flee to Shanghai, with money hidden on their bodies, are often robbed en route. Yesterday, there were reports that unarmed police would replace the enemy troops to return to their posts along the riverbank, but this is absolutely not true. Although the enemy has recruited 150 people who look like workers, they are still being trained separately. Therefore, the various towns along the Pudong River, such as Yangjing, Laiyi Ferry, Yangjiadu, and Tangqiao, are still guarded by a small number of enemy and puppet troops.

### Serious Russian-Japanese Dispute, Fisheries Agreement Runs into Trouble

New Agreement Not Yet Signed, Japan Will Lament Eating No Fish

The China Press reports that the Japanese representative in Moscow recently applied to the Soviet Union to sign the fisheries agreement concluded between the two countries last year. Thus, one of the most serious disputes that has troubled relations between the two countries for many years has once again attracted the attention of the general public. The right of the Japanese to fish in the northwestern waters of the Pacific Ocean is the right enjoyed by Japan recognized by the Treaty of Portsmouth, and the two countries have often had disagreements because of this. Japan often complains about the treatment of its fishing boats in Soviet waters. According to the auction method, fishing lease areas are auctioned every year. This method and the issue of the ruble exchange rate for the rent payable have always been points of contention between the two parties. Last year, when the regulations under the Treaty of Portsmouth expired and needed to be re-signed, this dispute was negotiated. The two parties agreed to draft a new agreement, which was soon completed, but was only awaiting formal signing. Unexpectedly, at this time, Germany and Japan suddenly signed an Anti-Comintern Pact. As a result, the Soviet Union was deeply displeased and shelved the signing. Since then, Italy has long been heard to have joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. Although Japan has repeatedly applied to the Soviet Union to complete the fisheries agreement, the Soviet Union has ignored them, and this must be the reason. Therefore, one of the major reasons for the discord between the two countries has now been revived. Valuable contributions to Pacific harmony will at least be temporarily invalidated. If this matter is not resolved one day, then the crisis is lurking and it is very worrying. And there is one point that is very important: If the two sides renegotiate the problem and reach an agreement, then a formal document must be prepared to complete it. However, the Soviet Union has no intention of doing this at present. Japan is very dissatisfied with the old agreement and will not want to abide by it again. However, since the new agreement has not been signed, it is naturally invalid. If Japan acts according to the benefits obtained from the new agreement, then the Soviet Union will not tolerate it. Fish is one of Japan's main foods and is closely related to its national survival. Japan's departure from this is a matter of course.

### British Factories Jardine Matheson and British American Tobacco Resume Work

Since the outbreak of the war, the Yangshupu area of ​​Eastern Shanghai and the Pudong area have fallen into the war zone. The factories of Chinese and foreign companies have been forced to suspend operations for three months. At present, the Eastern Shanghai district has not been opened, and it is difficult to resume work. Jardine Matheson's cotton mill in Yangshupu, in view of the urgent social need for goods, took about 300 workers yesterday morning, took a boat from the customs wharf, and entered the factory via the waterway to try to resume work. Yesterday, 500 male workers in the Tongjiang Tobacco Factory in Pudong, in the copper workshop, printing workshop, and tin foil workshop, also took boats from the Puxi side to the factory to start working, in order to meet urgent needs, and will also repair other factory buildings and machinery in order to officially resume work.

### American Businesses Express No Intention to Develop Manchuria

The Continental Times reports that according to a telegram from Tokyo recently, a certain American consortium plans to invest 120 million yen in a certain new commercial bank to develop the industry of "Manchukuo." It is said that in addition to several American banks, Mobil Oil Company, Ford Motor Company, etc. will also participate in the "Manchukuo" silver group of 200 million yen. According to the general manager of Mobil Oil Company, Mr. Shegute, who spoke to a reporter from the Continental Times, he has heard of this plan, but does not believe it to be true. Other American businesses also do not believe this statement. A certain American official told a reporter from the Continental Times that American merchants and financiers do not seem to be cooperating with Japanese merchants to develop the industry of "Manchukuo."

### Nanshi Fire Raged for Six Days and Nights

### League of Nations Medical Team to Serve in China at the End of the Month

[Geneva] Regarding the Chinese government's request for the League of Nations to assist the country in epidemic prevention, the League of Nations General Assembly previously approved the implementation plan last month, and has now decided to form three mobile medical teams with 200,000 Swiss francs to go to China to serve.

The first team is led by Dr. Rasnai of the "Pasteur" Microbial Academy in Tunis, French Territory. The second team is led by Dr. Leigray of the same academy. The third team is led by Dr. Musser, a famous doctor in Zurich, Switzerland. Each medical team is equipped with various sophisticated instruments, such as disinfection equipment, irrigation treatment equipment, and microbial diagnostic equipment, and has a large supply of serum, vaccines, and various drugs for emergency supplies. Its mission is to cooperate with Chinese health agencies to carry out epidemic prevention work. (Central News Agency, Havas telegram, 18th)

### Our Troops Firmly Defend New Positions on the Jinpu Railway Line

Jiaoji Railway Trains Suspended Yesterday  Silence Remains on the Pinghan Front  Minor Contact on the Right Flank at Chuwang

[Jinan] The battle on the Jinpu Railway line has been at a stalemate on both sides of the Tuhai River for over a month. However, the main enemy force is in the Jiling County area on our right flank. On the 10th of this month, part of the enemy force suddenly invaded Qingyun from Cangzhou along the Jin-Yan Highway. Our troops in that area were relatively weak, and the city fell on the 11th. The enemy then advanced directly towards Huimin via Leling and Yangxin, attempting to cross the river at the Qinghe Town ferry and directly approach Zhoucun, cutting off the Jiaoji Railway line and threatening Jinan. Upon receiving the report, our authorities immediately dispatched reinforcements to Huimin and deployed heavy troops to defend the Qinghe Town ferry. They also ordered part of our troops in Shanghe to attack the enemy's rear. Unexpectedly, Zhao Mingyuan, the Fifth District Commissioner and concurrently the Security Commander in charge of defending Huimin, abandoned his post without authorization, causing the city to fall on the 12th. Zhao Mingyuan has now been detained and will be punished according to the law. After occupying Huimin, the enemy, knowing that we had deployed heavy troops at the Qinghe Town ferry, launched a surprise attack on Jiyang. Our forces in that area were relatively weak, and after a brief fierce battle, the city was lost on the 13th. However, our defending troops in Linyi and Shanghe desperately held their ground against the enemy at Fenghuangdian. Due to the isolation of their rear, they had to withdraw to the south bank of the Yellow River. On the 14th, the enemy advanced from Jiyang towards Xingjia Ferry east of Luokou, but they were repelled by our forces. The enemy troops on the Yucheng front also launched a southward attack at the same time. Due to the retreat of our right flank, our forces retreated to defend Yancheng. The enemy then sent troops to attack our rear in Sangzidian and directly assaulted Luokou. To prevent the enemy from crossing the river, we destroyed the Luokou Bridge twice on the night of the 15th and the morning of the 16th. At the same time, our troops who had been holding Yancheng also moved backwards. As for the left flank, the enemy forces advanced directly from Gaotang to Zhaihe. Thus, our defense line was completely shifted to the new positions on the south bank of the Yellow River, where we are currently confronting the enemy. (19th Central News Agency telegram)

Manila: People here generally believe that the war in the Far East has made the people of the Philippines deeply aware of the potential dangers after complete independence. Yesterday, President Quezon, in talks with the press, mentioned the possibility of the Philippines becoming a U.S. territory. Today, various sectors are paying close attention to this point. Although there is currently no expression from the public, the war between China and Japan will likely promote a strong anti-independence movement. (18th Kokumin Shimbun telegram)

### Hitler's Trusted Aide, Weidemann, Goes to America

Will Meet with U.S. President Roosevelt  German Dignitaries Fete Chiang Pai-li  Chen Gongbo Visits Mussolini

[Berlin] According to news from here today, Hitler will send a special envoy to Washington to conduct important consultations with President Roosevelt. The European political situation is developing rapidly, and its impact on the situation in the Far East will be significant. It is reported that Hitler's special envoy to the United States is Weidemann, who is scheduled to depart on the North German Lloyd ship tomorrow. (18th Kokumin Shimbun telegram)

[Berlin] Captain Weidemann, a close confidant of Führer Hitler, boarded the Europa ship this morning to travel to the United States. He will stay in New York for a few days before proceeding to Washington. According to Weidemann's statement, this trip is a private holiday and does not carry any political mission.

[Paris] Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Radical Socialist Party's newspaper recently commented, "On the 6th of this month, German Führer Hitler personally exerted pressure on the Japanese government, firmly advising it to be satisfied with conquering North China and to establish peace with China as far as possible. The German military and industrial circles are also uneasy because they fear that the more territory Japan occupies, the more its national power will be weakened. However, the Japanese militarists may not heed Führer Hitler's advice and may instead dispatch troops to land in Guangzhou within a short period of time in order to establish a new front line in South China. Diplomatic figures in various European countries generally believe that the spirit of the Chinese people's heroic resistance will not diminish because of this, and they should block any compromise with Japan. However, as for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, at the next meeting, it is likely that representatives from the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Belgium will be appointed to form a committee to be ready to contact both parties at any time."

### Anglo-American Trade Agreement Negotiations Will Have a Significant Impact on the World Situation

Will Have a Stabilizing Influence in Various Places  The U.S. and Canada and Australia Will Also Revise New Treaties

[London] British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that efforts to improve commercial relations between Britain and the United States have made significant progress. Informal discussions of a tentative nature, with the aim of establishing a basis for Anglo-American trade agreement negotiations, have now reached the point where the two governments can announce the commencement of trade agreement negotiations. He believes that the House will welcome this news. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, the House erupted in applause. Former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, who was in the gallery, paid close attention to the British Prime Minister's remarks. (18th Reuters telegram via Central News Agency)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull announced today that the United States intends to begin reciprocal trade agreement negotiations with Britain, and requested American businesses to suggest to the State Department which products should be included in this agreement. This announcement is the first formal step towards the establishment of an Anglo-American trade agreement and is the result of a year's worth of research by the two governments. It is expected that negotiations will begin in a few weeks. However, before starting negotiations, the United States must hold a public hearing, and anyone concerned can state their objections during the hearing regarding any proposed tariff reductions. According to reliable sources, there is reason to believe that the British government has agreed to grant preferential treatment to certain American goods, the same as the treatment enjoyed by British goods shipped from British colonies under imperial preference. Closer commercial ties between Britain and the United States will be emulated by other countries and join the general movement to reduce world trade barriers. Therefore, Anglo-American trade agreement negotiations can make an effective contribution to improving world trade. It is believed that Secretary of State Hull will soon publish a list of products that will be discussed by both sides. Approximately all current trade between the British Empire and the United States will be included in this list. It is reported that while the U.S. government does not object to the principles of the Ottawa Agreement, it will request a reduction in imperial preferential treatment on certain goods, especially agricultural products. As for manufactured goods, such as automobiles, typewriters, and steel products, they will also be negotiated. In return, the United States is reportedly prepared to make concessions on British textiles, woolens, machinery, and luxury goods. It is also reported that the purpose of the negotiations is not to divert trade between the two countries, but merely to increase the volume of trade. (18th Reuters telegram via Central News Agency)

Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King has recently confirmed reports from Washington that Canada and the United States are about to negotiate a new trade agreement and said that he hopes that the basis of this new trade agreement will be as broad as possible. King declined to comment on whether Canada would abandon some of its preferential treatment in the British market to facilitate the establishment of an Anglo-American trade agreement. The current trade agreement between Canada and the United States will expire in 1938. (19th Reuters telegram via Central News Agency)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement stating that the United States intends to negotiate with Canada to expand the scope of the agreement established in 1935. As the United States will soon conduct formal negotiations with Britain to sign a trade agreement and attach the most-favored-nation clause, and is now also conducting negotiations with Canada, Canadian industrial products, which are similar to British products, can naturally enjoy the most-favored-nation treatment stipulated in the future Anglo-American trade agreement. However, U.S. authorities stated that the negotiations between Britain and the United States and the negotiations between Canada and the United States are two separate matters and are not related. (18th Havas telegram via Central News Agency)

Ottawa: Since the announcement of the Anglo-American trade agreement negotiations was made simultaneously in London and Washington, Canadians have generally expressed goodwill. Prime Minister King also made a statement stating that the Canadian government has been notified of the progress of the preliminary talks between Britain and the United States, and we also have a full understanding of the impact that future formal negotiations may have on Canada. Once these negotiations are concluded, current trade agreements between Canada and other countries may have to be revised. However, the Anglo-American negotiations will take several months to complete. Regarding the U.S.-Canada negotiations, I requested the U.S. government in August of this year to conduct consultations in order to revise the current trade agreement to the greatest extent possible. These negotiations may proceed simultaneously with the Anglo-American negotiations. After Britain and the United States establish a trade agreement in the future, certain Canadian goods that are shipped to Britain will have to sacrifice the preferential treatment that they originally enjoyed under the Ottawa Agreement. This will inevitably cause considerable anxiety in the Canadian export industry. However, on the other hand, the Canadian export industry can obtain substantial compensation in the U.S. market, especially for agricultural products, and it is hoped that sales can be expanded. Therefore, even if there are those who oppose the future Anglo-American trade agreement in Canada, they should weigh the pros and cons and know how to proceed. Moreover, the economic relationship between Britain, the United States, and Canada will take the form of a triangular economic understanding. In addition, Canadian public opinion is extremely hostile to dictatorial regimes. If this understanding can be broader in nature and can be used to develop cooperation between major democratic countries and to counter the threat of dictatorial countries, it would be particularly welcome in Canada. Furthermore, since France has already concluded a currency agreement with Britain and the United States, it can also participate in this understanding and form a group. Then, by combining the strength of Britain, the United States, France, and Canada, it will be possible to control 50% of the world's wealth. (18th Havas telegram via Central News Agency)

Canberra: Australian Federal Prime Minister Lyons announced today that he wants to negotiate trade with the United States at the earliest opportunity. This declaration was made after the declaration by the United States and Canada began discussing the conclusion of a trade agreement. Lyons also said that he will maintain close contact with Britain at present. (19th Reuters telegram via Central News Agency)

[New York] The New York Times criticized the Anglo-American trade agreement negotiations today, saying that the war debt issue will be an obstacle in the discussions, and that any step that consolidates the economic relations of the two major democratic countries will have a stabilizing influence on the situation in various parts of the world. (19th Reuters telegram via Central News Agency)

[London] Regarding the Anglo-American trade agreement negotiations that are about to proceed, the newspapers here have unanimously praised them. The Daily Telegraph reported, "The results that can be obtained from this move are far from comparable to some material benefits. This is the best example for all countries in the world. Various restrictions that can cause international trade to be hindered will be cleared up in one fell swoop." The News Chronicle reported, "The future Anglo-American trade agreement is not just an ordinary agreement; its intention is clearly to demonstrate the solidarity of the major democratic countries in order to deal with the threat of international bandits. Its political importance is far above the economic one. This is truly good news for all democratic countries." The Daily Herald reported, "If the future negotiations between Britain and the United States fail, then the sincere cooperation between the two sides to solve major international problems and prevent various serious crises will be hopeless for years to come." The Daily Mail reported, "Some say that the two major democratic countries of Britain and the United States are about to unite to deal with various non-democratic countries. Nothing could be more of a misunderstanding of the future Anglo-American trade agreement." It is especially wrong to say that the intention of this move is to confront a certain country ideologically. (19th Havas telegram via Central News Agency)

### Japanese Circles Concerned About New Anglo-American Trade Agreement

[Tokyo] Japanese circles are very concerned about the Anglo-American negotiations for a reciprocal trade agreement. According to newspapers, the agreement is an action by the democratic group to deal with the anti-communist group, so as to put pressure on these countries.

The amendment suggested by Bolck is to remove this restriction. It is claimed that American businesses in Shanghai all advocate for the amendment, and Democratic Senator King has introduced a similar proposal in the Senate at the same time.

### British Privy Councilor Meets Hitler

Ninety-Minute Talk; Earlier Departure from England than King's Return

Berchtesgaden – British Privy Councilor Lord Halifax arrived here at 9:30 this morning. Hitler warmly welcomed him and showed Lord Halifax around the villa. They then entered the study together for a talk lasting ninety minutes. German Foreign Minister Neurath was also present, with Mr. Schmidt serving as interpreter. After the talk, they had lunch together. Lord Halifax left here around 2:00 PM. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

[Berlin] Regarding the political importance of British Lord Halifax's visit to Germany, local newspapers are still maintaining a cautious silence and refraining from making comments. Only the National Socialist News reported that the misunderstandings of the past twenty-five years cannot be completely resolved with a single simple talk. Therefore, Lord Halifax's visit is only the beginning of an upward trend in relations between the two countries, or it may even be a failure. (18th, Haitong Telegram)

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that Lord Halifax will meet with German Chancellor Hitler to discuss everything, but this is not a negotiation. The British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, will not participate in the talks between Hitler and Halifax, as Halifax's visit to Germany is purely private and informal. (18th, Haitong Telegram)

[London] The British House of Lords today resumed discussion of foreign affairs. Former Lord Chancellor Sankey and former Conservative Party Chairman Stonehaven both spoke in favor of deleting Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Labor Party Buxton advocated making concessions regarding the restoration of Germany's former colonies, saying that if this were acknowledged, the current situation could be freely discussed. Air Minister Swinton, representing the government, replied that what is needed now is calm discussion. If Parliament requests the government to provide detailed explanations of British policies and procedures, this would not contribute to achieving a complete solution. Privy Councilor Halifax is extremely capable of conveying British thoughts, but it is hoped that the people will not have extravagant expectations for his trip to Berlin. Arbitrary remarks are detrimental to negotiations. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

[London] It is rumored that the British government intends to invite German Foreign Minister Neurath to visit here in the near future. German sources here do not believe this, thinking that the British government had previously invited the German Foreign Minister to visit Britain in June. Although Neurath did not ultimately make the trip, the British invitation has not been withdrawn, so there is no need to invite him again. Moreover, the purpose of British Privy Councilor Halifax's visit to Germany is to establish communication between Britain and Germany. (Central News Agency, 19th, Havas)

[London] King Leopold III of Belgium departed from here at 10:20 AM this morning to return to Brussels.

International Labor Unions Meet in France to Discuss Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement

[Moscow] Soviet Far East Red Army Commander Blyukher (i.e., General Galen) stated here today, "When we are forced to abandon peace, we will extend the war beyond the borders of the Soviet Union. I deeply believe that the valiant resistance of China and Spain will surely achieve final victory. I further believe that the fascist countries' attacks on China and Spain are preparations for their attack on the Soviet Union." (18th, National Telegram)

[Paris] The Presidium of the International Federation of Trade Unions met in Paris today to discuss the dispute between China and Japan. Federation Chairman Sir Citrine (President of the British Trades Union Congress) reported that since the Federation initiated the boycott of Japanese goods, branches in various countries have responded enthusiastically. The boycott movement has been implemented in several countries and has achieved significant results. In addition, the Federation has also appealed to branches in various countries to provide financial assistance to China, especially to cities that have been heavily bombed by the Japanese army. This request has also been answered. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)

### This Year's Nobel Peace Prize Awarded to British Lord Cecil

Oslo – The Nobel Prize Committee has decided to award this year's Nobel Peace Prize to Lord Cecil, President of the World Peace Association and President of the British League of Nations Union. Lord Cecil, aged seventy-three, is the third son of the late British statesman, the Marquis of Salisbury. After graduating from Oxford University, he practiced law. During the European War from 1916 to 1918, he served as Minister of Blockade in the Cabinet. In 1918, he was transferred to Foreign Secretary and attended the Versailles Peace Conference, contributing greatly to the establishment of the League of Nations and the drafting of the Covenant. In 1923, when Conservative Party leader Baldwin formed his first cabinet, Cecil served as Lord Privy Seal and went to the United States to conduct a propaganda campaign advocating American membership in the League of Nations. In 1924, he was ennobled as a Lord. Since then, he has dedicated himself to the peace movement and advocated strengthening the League of Nations' structure, truly a pillar of world peace. (Note: In 1923, Viscount Cecil's name was included in the list of Nobel Prize nominees. The following year, he was the first to receive a prize of US$25,000 from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.)

### First Batch of Tribute Rice Handled by the Shanghai Municipal Council Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday for Price Stabilization

Regulations Stipulate Each Rice Store Allots Forty Bags for Sale; Changshu Rice Guild Raises Funds to Purchase National Rice; Rice Merchants' Registration Completed, Retail Sales Begin

Since our army's strategic movement, Shanghai has been surrounded by the Japanese army, so rice from the interior cannot be transported to Shanghai for supply. In order to regulate the food supply for the city's residents, the Shanghai Municipal Council, together with the China Southern Rice Company, ordered foreign rice from Saigon for price stabilization. The first batch of 25,000 bags, transported from Saigon by the Taikoo Company's Jia Ying, arrived in Wusong yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. It will dock at the New Customs Wharf for unloading and distribution to rice merchants for sale. The Changshu Rice Guild in this city plans to raise funds to purchase national rice to plug the leak. The details are as follows:

First Batch Arrives in Shanghai

The Shanghai Municipal Council and the China Southern Rice Company ordered 25,000 bags of foreign rice from French Saigon for price stabilization in order to supply the residents of Shanghai. It was originally intended to arrive in Shanghai earlier, but it was hindered in Hong Kong, so it was delayed. Now it is reported that the ship arrived safely in Wusong yesterday afternoon. Due to the strong tides, it was delayed until this morning to enter the port and berth at the New Customs Wharf for unloading. This is the first batch of imported foreign rice. The second and third batches of continued orders will be shipped to Shanghai one after another.

Allocation for Price Stabilization

The Shanghai Municipal Council and the China Southern Rice Company convened a meeting with various rice industry groups to discuss the matter and decided to allocate forty bags to each rice merchant and stipulate a market price of fourteen yuan per picul for price stabilization. It also restricted each household to only purchase one yuan's worth. The Rice Merchants' Association of this city issued a notice to its member rice merchants yesterday, requiring them to sell at the allocated amount and not to exceed the stipulated price. If found, they will be severely punished. It is said that the second batch of goods will be handled in the same way.

Discussion on Purchasing National Rice

The Changshu Rice Guild in this city, in view of the insufficient food supply for Shanghai residents, has been ordering foreign rice for sale, resulting in a huge outflow of funds, which is not a long-term plan for the War of Resistance. This year's domestic agricultural production is abundant. The farmers in the war-torn areas have become refugees and cannot be purchased from. However, the new rice is stockpiled in the counties of Wenzhou, Taizhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Liyang, and Nantong in Zhejiang Province, and in various parts of Anhui Province that have not entered the war zone, and cannot be transported for sale. The goods are abandoned on the ground, which has a major impact on the rural economy. Therefore, the guild is actively planning for transportation to circulate the national rice and allow farmers to rotate funds. After a detailed plan by Lu Muqin, they raised funds to facilitate transportation, and suggested that various rice industry groups and merchants purchase as much as possible to maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents.

In addition, the rice industry in this city, in order to supply food for the people, is actively seeking ways to dredge sources in accordance with the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It is now heard that Ren Chengxing, a member of the industry guild, intends to go to Nantong to transport 1,500 bags of japonica rice and has requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to issue a certificate for verification along the way.

Registration Completed

The Rice Merchants' Association of this city obtained foreign rice from the Public Concession Bureau at a parity retail price. Yesterday, they processed the application registration for member rice merchants to receive the rice for retail sales. It was stipulated that there would be 300 rice merchants in the Public Concession and 200 in the French Concession. The application for rice retail sales was very crowded. The total quota of 500 was reached last night. In the Public Concession, there are Deng Rentai, Yuchengtai, Shunfeng, etc.; in the French Concession, there are Baohe, Shengtaihe, Wanchang, etc. It is stipulated that the first batch of 10,000 bags of rice will be allocated to each household, 40 bags. Starting today, payments will be made at the Bank of China.

Retail Sales Method

The Rice Merchants' Association of this city issued a public notice yesterday stating that the association is handling the payment application for the retail sales on the same day. All registered member rice merchants in the Public Concession and the French Concession should quickly collect from the association and prepay the estimated transportation fee of 25 cents per bag, with any surplus refunded and any shortfall supplemented. For the sake of popular parity, the retail sales method stipulates two items: (1) Each person is limited to a maximum purchase of one yuan. (2) The price is set at 8.5 cents per catty. All member rice merchants must abide by this from the date of allocation. This is the special notice.

Strictly Prohibit Hoarding

The French Concession authorities attach great importance to the food supply for Shanghai residents. In addition to sending detectives to investigate the rice reserves of various rice merchants in the concession, they strictly prohibit rice stores from hoarding for profit. It was heard that some rice stores were found to be hoarding rice yesterday and were ordered to sell it at a parity retail price immediately.

### Shanghai Financial Transition: Economic Center Shifts to the Interior

Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks Execute Branch Business; Silver Shops and Banks Seek Development in the Interior Together

The change in the Songhu battle situation and our army's temporary withdrawal have had no impact on the city's finances. Although the foreign exchange and gold are weak, it is not due to military relations. It is actually fluctuating due to drastic changes in overseas British and American exchange rates. The reporter learned from the financial community that after our army's withdrawal, Shanghai's finances are stable and the silver and money industries are operating as usual. The details are as follows:

Economic Center Has Shifted to the Interior

The change in the Songhu battle situation and the stability of Shanghai's finances are due to many reasons, such as the application of financial stability measures and the reform of financial operations. The most important factor is that Shanghai is no longer the economic center of our country. Since the outbreak of the August 13th incident, our government authorities have used the fastest and most miraculous means to decentralize its center. At the same time, the financial authorities were prepared for any eventuality. The four government banks, the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, had already moved their capitals in accordance with the regulations. When the war broke out, commercial savings banks and money shops planned to develop in the interior. Therefore, although Shanghai's finances still maintain their important appearance, their substance has shifted to various cities in the interior when the god of war descends. The reason why Shanghai's finances can remain stable is due to the appropriate measures taken by our government authorities and finances.

Four Banks Move to Nanjing; Silver Shops and Banks Cooperate

Since the head offices of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks have moved to the capital and Hankou in accordance with the regulations, the Shanghai branches of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks have been reduced to branches. All treasury receipts and payments and all affairs between the government and the banks have also been centralized at the head office of the Central Bank in the capital. However, for the convenience of trade between Chinese and foreign merchants and for the purpose of continuing to handle remittance transactions, the Shanghai four branches execute branch businesses within a certain authority in accordance with laws and regulations to benefit the market. As for all commercial banks and money shops, they are currently on the same path, jointly seeking to develop businesses in the interior. In addition to moving the branches in this city back to their original locations to operate as usual, they are also adding branches and offices in various cities in the interior such as Hankou and Chongqing to meet the needs of developing the interior's industry and commerce.

Sufficient Chips; Stable Market

When the Songhu war was fierce, the various chips in the market were still able to cope with ease, without any appearance of being stretched. For example, the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life to purchase national salvation bonds, donate funds to relieve wounded soldiers and refugees, and comfort the soldiers at the front was huge. Under the war situation, our people were still able to donate this huge amount, which proves that the market chips are as active as usual. When the battle situation changed and our army withdrew, the purchase of bonds and donations continued unabated. The stability of the market can be imagined. There are also remittance instruments that can only be used for interbank transfers. After three months of use, both commercial firms and lenders can use them. Moreover, the fact that these instruments are used as legal tender has become almost nonexistent. Even if there are any, they are only a few. Foreign merchants and import houses cannot purchase foreign exchange because of the remittance.

### Residents North of Suzhou Creek All Return

Rental Housing is Empty

The citizens in the area north of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, from Sichuan Road in the east to North Henan Road, North Zhejiang Road, and North Xizang Road in the west, up to the boundary road of the Shanghai Railway Station, had, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, experienced stray bullets from time to time. In order to avoid danger, some residents had already moved to other places. After our army withdrew from Zhabei on the 27th of last month, the panic among the citizens there became even greater. All the citizens there completely moved to the Public Concession and the French Concession south of Suzhou Creek, fearing our army's counterattack. Recently, because the war has gradually shifted westward, the citizens in that area have all moved back, and the number of people has increased compared to before. The small rental houses in the original alleys are now all rented out.

### Ningbo Ships Prohibited from Sailing

De Ping Wheel Decides to Stop Sailing to Ningbo; Tickets Sold are Refunded at Face Value

After the ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line were ordered to temporarily suspend navigation, the Italian-owned Huayi Shipping Company, in response to the request of various Ningbo groups in Shanghai, planned to send the De Ping Wheel to continue sailing in order to maintain traffic. On the 17th of this month, a telegram was sent to the Ningbo fortress commander for instructions, and tickets were sold in advance. Yesterday morning, the company received a reply from Ningbo, stating that due to military reasons, Zhenhai Port has been sealed off by our army, prohibiting ships from sailing. After receiving the telegram, the company decided to stop sailing to Ningbo and refunded the sold tickets at the original price. However, the passengers who had already purchased tickets and boarded the ship were unwilling to refund the tickets. The company has explained to the passengers and persuaded them to refund the tickets. It is heard that the ship intends to temporarily moor in Shanghai and will not implement the Dinghai-Haimen shipping line.

### International Red Cross Representative Takes a Ship to Japan

Mission in China Completed; Same Inspection in Japan

Colonel Walter Ville, a representative of the International Red Cross Society in Geneva, was sent to China to inspect the organization of the Chinese Red Cross Society's wounded soldiers' hospitals. After arriving in Shanghai last month, he was led by Dr. Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross Society, to inspect various places for more than a month. The mission has been completed. He returned to this port from Nanjing the other day. According to Colonel Ville, he inspected the Red Cross wounded soldiers' hospitals and military hospitals in Hankou, Nanjing, Suzhou, and other places. He was impressed by the progress in the organization and operation of the hospitals. However, the hospitals fear that there will be difficulties in technical personnel and first aid medicines as the war shifts to the interior. Fortunately, the United Kingdom and the United States are providing assistance, so there is no fear of shortage. Now Colonel Walter Ville has taken the Japanese mail ship Shanghai Maru to Japan yesterday. This trip is at the invitation of the Japanese Red Cross Society and is also to inspect. At the same time, he will conduct final negotiations with the Japanese side on the issue of transporting medical supplies to China to ensure that there are no obstacles. After a week or two of stay in Japan, he will return to Washington to report on the inspection to the head office.

### There is No Organization in the Pudong Yanpu Area

There is a rumor about a puppet organization in the Yangjiadu, Laiyibo, and Qichangzhan areas of Pudong. According to people from the Pudong area, there is no such organization there. Because the Japanese army is focusing on the front-line war, although the army has searched Pudong, it has not been heard that they are paying attention to local affairs. As for the rumor that the maintainers are interested in a certain Mr. Li, according to someone in Shanghai who knows Mr. Li, Mr. Li is over seventy years old and has always tried his best for local charitable and public welfare affairs. However, since the outbreak of the Songhu war, he has taken his family to Shanghai, and there is nothing to do in Pudong, so he has not returned to his hometown. His energy has also declined, and he is not participating in anything.

### China Travel Service Colleagues Relieve Refugees

Donate Guangbing (crisp pancakes) and Cotton Clothes

Since the War of Resistance, compatriots who have been displaced and suffered from wind and dew, hunger and cold, are miserable. All sectors have risen up to appeal and plead for the refugees. It is learned that the colleagues of China Travel Service have donated a large amount of money and specially ordered a large number of Guangbing from the Huacheng Salty Guangbing Company on the west side of Shenbao Hall on Sanma Road (telephone 92826). They are sent by car to the French police station for collection and transferred to the refugee area daily. The refugees heard that Mr. Yang, the owner of the Guangbing Company, is also charitable and does not hesitate to spend a lot of money to make the Guangbing thicker and cheaper than other products. People from all walks of life are enthusiastically going to order. It is also learned that the colleagues of the Travel Service have also ordered hundreds of cotton clothes to distribute for relief. However, there are many refugees and few porridge. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to donate to provide help, which is immeasurable merit.

### The Vertical and Horizontal Alliances and Divides in the International Arena and China's Future

— Jin Zhonghua

During the period of our current war of resistance, international relations also present a variety of vertical and horizontal alliances and divides. The more important ones include the Nyon Conference not long ago, the sudden signing of the "Anti-Comintern Pact" by Germany, Italy, and Japan while the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was in progress, the various reactions and postures of Italy and Germany towards the Brussels Conference, the sudden establishment of a fascist regime in Brazil, as well as the recent visit of the British Privy Councilor to Germany, the ongoing business negotiations between Britain and the United States, the disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding consulate issues, Korean residents' issues, and fishing agreements, and the issues between Japan and France regarding Annam and Hainan Island, etc. All these developments have direct and indirect relations with our country and should be closely watched by us at present.

We must pay attention to these various vertical and horizontal alliances and divides in the international arena and their developments, especially because our current war of resistance must not only prevail on the military battlefield but also on the diplomatic battlefield. We cannot cope with these international diplomatic developments with a passive expectation psychology, but must use an active and self-initiated spirit to operate. At present, people generally pay attention to the development of the international environment. We feel that there are three tendencies that are prone to causing mistakes and must be corrected: First, it is thought that the war of resistance has exceeded three months, and the international assistance has not been actively launched, which seems unexpected, causing some disappointment and complaints; the error of this concept is due to excessive expectations of the outside world, and the efforts of ourselves have not been reviewed, because since we launched the war of resistance, there has been an infinitely broad expression of sympathy in the international arena, and how to make this expression transform into concrete action depends on our own ability to promote and use it, so this concept of disappointment and complaint should not exist. Second, it is thought that at present we should try to obtain the support of as many countries as possible in the international arena, without having to make any choices. This is certainly correct in principle, because harmony among all nations is precisely the way to promote world peace; but one point we must pay attention to is that in peacetime, this policy of harmony among all nations is certainly the best way to establish a country and deal with the world, but in wartime, in order to achieve positive results in diplomacy, we cannot but recognize our own interests and the basic trends of the international situation, and determine the true focus of our diplomatic efforts. Third, the recent posture of vertical and horizontal alliances and divides in the international arena seems to show the development of the power of aggressors and their allies in East Asia and even in Europe and the United States, which is alarming and cannot be resisted. Therefore, some people think that diplomatic opportunities can be used to disregard their own anti-aggression stance and plunge into this chaotic vortex; this speculative psychology is also very dangerous, because if one's own foothold is unstable, one will become a victim in the international vortex.

To correct the above-mentioned erroneous concepts, we must recognize the basic trends of various developments and firmly establish our own correct stance in the current changing and complex international relations, and then we can seek a bright future for China. Léon Blum, the leader of the French Socialist Party and current State Councillor, said in a speech in Paris on the 7th of this month that "we have arrived at the situation of 1914." This statement is very accurate. To grasp the development of the current vertical and horizontal alliances and divides in the international arena, we must recognize that we have now arrived at the eve of the Second World War; like the vertical and horizontal development in the international arena on the eve of the 1914 World War, all the developments before us are the work of aggressors and anti-aggressors arranging their positions. Therefore, on the one hand, Germany, Italy, and Japan suddenly established the "Anti-Comintern Pact," and on the other hand, Léon Blum also pointed out: "The important factors of current peace lie in the state of relations between Britain and the Soviet Union." At the same time, many politicians in Britain and the United States are also vigorously saying that this "Anti-Comintern Pact" poses a major threat to Britain, the United States, and France, and that there should be rapid and active unity among Britain, the United States, and France to safeguard world peace. We can assert that the position of the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente on the eve of the 1914 World War will reappear. The only difference is that the Austro-Hungarian Empire of the past has been replaced by Japan today, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of the past will be replaced by the Anglo-American cooperation of today. More clearly, the several Balkan wars of the time were equal to the Manchurian War, the Abyssinian War, the Spanish War, and the current Sino-Japanese War in recent years. The only difference between them is that the scope and intensity of today's wars are far greater than those of 1914.

In such a serious international situation, we must not have the slightest hesitation in our own anti-aggression position, which would create a situation of complete fragmentation. The tragedy of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1914 is the best lesson. At present, some people are dazzled by the lukewarm relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, and dazzled by Britain's attitude of separately wooing Germany and Italy. They do not know that before the 1914 World War, the British King had personally gone to Berlin to shake hands and make peace with William II, proposing mutual protection of European peace; however, the great trend of international alliances and divides was like a rapid torrent, and could not be shifted in the slightest direction. After Germany declared war on France and Russia, Britain's attitude was completely clear in less than three days, which William regretted too late. At present, the threat of the Abyssinian and Spanish wars to Britain and France, the threat of the Far East war to the interests and security of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union on the Pacific coast, the threat of the Central European situation to France and the Soviet Union, and the threat of the Brazilian coup to peace in the Americas are all much more serious than the various changes before 1914. The international anti-aggression situation is rapidly forming with each stimulation. As long as we firmly establish our own position and actively use it, our future will not be disappointing.

The food sent by various charitable organizations has been distributed. The association hopes that various organizations will quickly donate more.

### Refugees in the Nanshi Refugee District Are Not Worried About Hunger

Improving Sanitation Will Be Handled Shortly, Mr. Purlant Assists Father Jacquinot

The Continental Daily reports that yesterday a reporter from the Continental Daily went to the Nanshi Refugee Safety Zone, guided by Father Jacquinot, and saw that the refugees all had joyful expressions, unlike the frightened expressions of a few days ago. An American lady had seen the mass migration of war refugees in other parts of the world, and now seeing the situation in the refugee district, even a martial and stern country like Japan was moved by Father Jacquinot's selfless good deeds, and allowed him to carry out his work without hindrance. Father Jacquinot said that food is being transported into the district every day, so the refugees are no longer worried about hunger. In the past few days, they have focused on ensuring an adequate supply of food, and have not had time to take care of other things. The work of improving sanitation will be started soon. In recent days, several robbers have been arrested in the district, and punishment will begin this morning. After Father Jacquinot intervened, they were not detained, but their hands were tied behind their backs, and they were paraded through the streets of the district to warn the rest. They will be released after three days, and they will still be well fed during those three days. Currently assisting Father Jacquinot in the work of relieving refugees is Mr. Purlant of the American Steel Company. Although Mr. Pu is a busy man in the business world and also serves as a director of the Municipal Council, he still does not shirk his hard work and assists Father Jacquinot in everything all day long. Such people are truly meritorious and immeasurable.

### Refugees in Bailianjing Are Expelled

Since our troops stationed in Pudong withdrew, the enemy troops landed and occupied the area. Refugees in various districts of Pudong have been displaced and have come to Shanghai for shelter in large numbers. However, there are still more than two thousand people who have not been able to escape, living in the area of Bailianjing, residing in undamaged houses and warehouses, waiting for rescue, suffering from hunger and cold. Fortunately, friendly people have shown human compassion and provided assistance from time to time. However, the enemy troops suddenly felt that the situation was unstable due to the refugees staying there, and starting the night before last, expelled all of the refugees.

### Thugs Break Into Building and Commit Murder

Luo Fusheng Stabbed to Death, All the Murderers Fled

Luo Fusheng, a resident of the pavilion room on the second floor of Dr. Chen Tingfang's residence at 259 Yunnan Road in the Public Concession, was in his thirties. At 4:55 PM yesterday, while he was napping in his room, a few thugs suddenly swarmed up the stairs, kicked open the door, and without asking why, pulled out sharp blades and stabbed Luo's head four times in the bedclothes. He bled profusely and was barely breathing. The murderers fled in a panic. Afterwards, neighbors discovered the incident and reported it to the Laozha Patrol Station, which sent Patrolman No. 218 to the scene and summoned an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, Luo's injuries were too severe, and he died en route. Shortly after, two modern women went upstairs and entered the room, and the detectives guarding the room arrested them and took them to the patrol station. They were released after questioning. It is said that the room's facilities seem to belong to a guiding agency, and this assassination is likely caused by a romantic rivalry.

### Monks' Rescue Team Fasts for Three Days

Donating to Medicines and Food for Wounded Soldiers

The Monks' Rescue Team has been serving on the front lines, rescuing wounded soldiers and civilians since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, for three months. Their work has been diligent and their achievements are excellent. Now, due to changes in strategy, some are serving on the front lines for rescue, and some are serving as hospital nurses. It is said that the team leaders and members at all levels are abbots, supervisors, and greeters of temples from various places, and Dharma masters from Buddhist academies. They all have the determination to sacrifice themselves to save the world. Under the leadership of Dharma Master Hongming for three months, their courage is commendable. Because the Dharma Master is in retreat on Changsha Road, practicing Dharma to pray for world peace, the team members, in view of the widespread development of the Buddhist Hospital he founded and the difficulty of funding, fasted for three days, and now donated 112 yuan of food expenses to the hospital to help with medicines and food. This spirit of self-sacrifice is commendable and admirable.

### Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Procures Pigs from Tienshengang

With the assistance of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association, with the United Business Office jointly formed by members of each business, is planning to procure pigs from places such as Tienshengang, Tongzhou, and transport them to Shanghai for regulation. It has been agreed to rent a barge from Jardine Matheson Towing & Lighterage Company to specifically travel between Shanghai and Tienshengang to load pigs, and the United Business Office will send personnel to directly procure them there. Currently, due to traffic congestion, renting a ship for transportation, the number of pigs dying en route to Shanghai has increased compared to before, so the cost is higher. The industry has set the price of pigs at 16 yuan per dan (100 market catties) in national currency, and the price will be adjusted according to the supply and demand in the market. Currently, the demand in the market exceeds the supply, and the selling price has soared. As for the selling price of street vendors, it still needs to be increased.

### US Consul in Shanghai Cares About American Nationals in Suzhou and Changshu

Some are still serving in the Suzhou and Changshu areas. However, as these places have become the focus of the war, the US Consulate is very concerned about them. It is said that there is still one American national in Suzhou and two in Changshu. There are also several nationals from other countries who are still rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees amidst the shelling.

Current Affairs Commentary

### An Alarming Rumor

— Yi

The other day, the National News Agency released an alarming piece of news. It said that Japan had presented France with a note similar to an ultimatum. It demanded that France promptly stop foreign military supplies from passing through Annam into China. Otherwise, Japan would occupy Hainan Island and bomb the railway from Annam to China. Based on common sense, we find this news to be unbelievable. Because Japan's interference in the transportation of military supplies within Annam is tantamount to infringing upon French sovereignty. Unless it really wants to challenge France, Japan would certainly not be so foolish. As expected, after this rumor spread, the diplomatic authorities of both France and Japan denied it.

However, it is worth pondering the role of the spread of this rumor. It was obviously spread by the Japanese side. After the declaration of the Brussels Conference, Japan fell into a siege of moral condemnation from the whole world. It had to bluff and bluster in many ways. The publication of the new military order and the consideration of the declaration of war were examples. The intention of the above rumor is also the same. It suggests that the arrogance of the Japanese Imperial Army is so strong that it dares to offend other powerful countries. The reason is to make peace-loving people in various countries who hate war fear Japan. The point of mentioning the occupation of Hainan Island as a condition of coercion is especially full of intimidation. Because Japan has seen through the weaknesses of countries such as Britain and France, it does not hesitate to raise the weapon of the southward advance policy. Even so, rumors are still not facts. Let Japan bluff and bluster as much as it wants. Can it really disregard the "common attitude" of the majority of countries in the world and be overbearing in the Far East? I think the answer should still be negative.
