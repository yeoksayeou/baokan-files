### Liu Hangchen Arrives in Beijing to Meet with He Yingqin and Zhang Qun

Welcoming He to Sichuan to Preside Over the Military Reorganization Conference; Smooth Progress Expected in Reorganization Prospects; Zhang Qun's Trip to Sichuan is in a Personal Capacity

[Nanjing] Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Finance Department, visited Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan last week to report and seek instructions. He arrived in Beijing on the Yihe Wheel steamer at 1:00 PM on the eighth. That evening, at 9:00 PM, he met with Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Zhang Qun, and others to continue seeking instructions. He will remain in Beijing for two or three days, awaiting Minister He and Secretary-General Zhang's decision to enter Sichuan, after which Liu will return to Sichuan first. Liu Hangchen told interviewers that the six measures discussed and agreed upon in the military reorganization plan for Sichuan and Kang were instructed by Minister He. When he met with Chiang Kai-shek, he was instructed that Chairman Liu Fucheng had already replied to the telegram, agreeing to follow the central government's methods and immediately begin implementing the reorganization. The central government's designated officials to enter Sichuan are Minister He and his party. Liu Fucheng has already sent telegrams to Minister He and Secretary-General Zhang, welcoming them. He himself will be able to decide when he meets with the two leaders He and Zhang tonight. It is also understood that the central government's reorganization of Sichuan and Kang military affairs will involve nationalizing all troops into the National Army. Before the reorganization, a reorganization committee will be formed to carry out the reorganization according to the methods stipulated in the implementation plan, with a reasonable deadline to complete this work. He also said that Chiang Kai-shek is very clear about the situation in Sichuan Province, so there are already solutions to the problem of reorganizing Sichuan and Kang military affairs, which will be implemented separately according to Minister He's plan. It is stipulated that the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Military Affairs Commission's Chongqing Branch, and the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Commissioner's Office will be responsible. Senior officials from the three agencies and some officers from the Sichuan-Kang garrison will serve as reorganization committee members, forming a committee to be responsible for presiding over the reorganization. The meeting location will be Chongqing or Chengdu. Regarding Sichuan Province's hope that the central government will send high-ranking political officials to Sichuan to instruct political construction, the candidates will be Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Zhang Qun and Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, which should be decided in the coming days. As for Chairman Liu's visit to Beijing, he is currently ill and unable to leave Sichuan for the time being. After the central government's military and political officials enter Sichuan, Liu will come to Beijing to report to the central government, despite his illness. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Liu Hangchen arrived in Beijing at 1:00 PM on the eighth from Xun, aboard the Pinghe Wheel steamer. That evening, he met with Minister He to report on his trip to Guling and, on behalf of Liu Xiang, Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan and Kang, welcomed Minister He to Sichuan to preside over the implementation of the major plan to reorganize Sichuan and Kang military affairs. He plans to stay in Beijing for a few days before returning to Sichuan to report. According to Liu's statement to reporters, when he met with Chiang Kai-shek in Guling, he fully reported on the reorganization of Sichuan and Kang military affairs on behalf of Chairman Liu and expressed absolute acceptance, which was greatly appreciated. Scholars such as Yan Yangchu and Chen Zhishan previously jointly drafted a plan to build Sichuan in a personal capacity, which included the reorganization of Sichuan and Kang military affairs. As a result, there were rumors that Chairman Liu intended to change the central government's original plan to reorganize Sichuan and Kang military affairs through political means. He also clarified the truth to Chiang Kai-shek during this trip to Guling, which was understood. He further explained that Liu's telegrams regarding accepting the reorganization of Sichuan and Kang military affairs were all sent by him on Liu's behalf, and he was concerned that this might not be credible enough. Therefore, he telegraphed Sichuan from Guling, urging Chairman Liu to express directly to the central government. It was not until the fifth, when he learned that Chairman Liu's telegram had arrived in the mountains, that he left the mountains and came east. Now there is no problem with the plan to reorganize Sichuan and Kang military affairs, only in quickly promoting its implementation. According to the plan, the Minister of Military Affairs, the Director of the Chongqing Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, and the Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan and Kang should jointly establish a Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee, responsible for implementing all reorganization matters. He is coming to Beijing this time on behalf of Chairman Liu to welcome Minister He to come to Sichuan as soon as possible to preside over the establishment of the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee. Chairman Liu has no preconceived notions about whether the committee will be located in Chongqing or Chengdu, but will follow Minister He's intentions. As for the future of the reorganization, in his observation, it will definitely proceed smoothly. Even the most important aspect, financial management, which all parties consider to be the most difficult, does not pose any difficulty. Although Sichuan and Kang's military expenses are 41 million yuan per year, since the year before last, the Financial Supervision Office of the Chongqing Branch has been responsible for overall planning and distribution. If reorganization is implemented, it is only necessary to improve the method of issuing funds to the generals. Other aspects, such as command, dispatch, personnel, education, and organization, are easier to solve. Liu also said that Guan Jiyu is still in Guling seeking instructions on the 1937 Sichuan Province budget preparation method. Because the military reorganization plan has been finalized, the method of budget preparation can also be easily resolved. Finally, when asked about Zhang Qun's trip to Sichuan, Liu said that Chairman Liu had telegraphed the central government, requesting that military and political officials be sent to Sichuan for inspection. In addition to Minister He, who has already been designated for military affairs, the candidate for political affairs has not yet been decided. Mr. Zhang is an ideal candidate, but Mr. Zhang has expressed his willingness to enter Sichuan in a personal capacity. Chairman Liu plans to come east for a trip after the central government's military and political officials have completed their inspection in Sichuan. (Eighth Day Central News Agency Dispatch)

### No Need for Silent Contemplation in Ordinary Gatherings

[Nanjing] The National Government recently instructed all directly subordinate agencies that, in accordance with the Central Executive Committee's reply, the purpose of the three-minute silent contemplation was to commemorate the Premier's past words and deeds and the self-reflection of party members on their work during the week.

### Yesterday's Solar Eclipse

[Nanjing] The Shanghai newspapers reported yesterday that a partial solar eclipse could be seen in northern Jiangsu Province on the eighth. According to the person in charge of the Central Astronomical Observatory, there will be two solar eclipses this year: the solar eclipse on the eighth of this month and the annular eclipse on December 3. Neither will be visible in any part of China. There will be only one partial lunar eclipse on the 18th, but when the moon rises on that evening in most parts of China, the lunar shadow will have already recovered, so it will not be visible.

Only Peru in South America will be able to see it on the mainland, but the sun will be very low at that time, and the star field will not be good, so very few countries have sent observation teams.

If the above three points can be achieved, compensation for unjust verdicts can be implemented. (Eighth Dispatch)

The above-listed defendants, having been prosecuted by the prosecutor for the crimes of murder and disturbing public order and endangering public safety, this court, after trial, renders the following judgment:

Main Text: Cheng Xiechao, found guilty of joint murder, sentenced to death with permanent deprivation of civil rights; Gong Bozhou, found guilty of continuous joint murder, sentenced to death with permanent deprivation of civil rights; Cao Bingrong, found guilty of joint murder, sentenced to life imprisonment with permanent deprivation of civil rights; Liu Luyin, found guilty of inciting murder, sentenced to ten years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for five years; Yang Qixin, found guilty of continuous joint preparation for murder, sentenced to two years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for two years; Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, Cao Bingrong, and Yang Qixin are acquitted of the remaining charges; Li Yijian is acquitted; Nie Jingquan, found guilty of assisting in the sale of military firearms and ammunition without permission, sentenced to two years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for two years; Wen Maoquan's public prosecution is not accepted; one planning document, one handgun, six bullets, one bullet casing are confiscated. Facts: Liu Luyin was elected as a standing committee member of the People's Movement Committee last year and, not fully understanding the central government's efforts for the country, incited Yang Xiaoming, using the alias Xu Qun (also known as Yang Erqian, Yang Yousheng, Yang Pakun, Yang Qizhen, Xu Chao), to organize a special task force (i.e., an assassination agency) in Shanghai to assassinate Yang Yongtai, the former chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government (hereinafter referred to as Chairman Yang), former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, Interior Minister Jiang Zuobin, and Transportation Minister Yu Feipeng (hereinafter referred to as Minister Zhang, Minister Jiang, and Minister Yu), and Chiang Kai-shek. Subsequently, seeing that opportunities were difficult to come by in Shanghai, they planned to expand their organization in Nanjing and Hubei, with Shanghai still serving as the headquarters for promotion. Yang Xiaoming, under the name Xu Qun, drafted a plan, naming his organization the "China Youth Anti-Traitor Special Task Force," and submitted it to Liu Luyin for approval in his capacity as a standing committee member of the People's Movement Committee, allocating 2,000 yuan per month, which was remitted by Ru Yun. Later, Yang Xiaoming summoned Xiao Zhun (i.e., Xiao Peiwei, Fan Qishu, Liang Jiubao, Gong Bozhou, Yang Qixin, etc.) to organize the special task force in Nanjing and Hubei in accordance with Liu Luyin's approved plan. In May of the same year, Lu Zhun sent a letter instructing Yang Qixin and Gong Bozhou to go to Lushan to observe Chiang Kai-shek's movements, believing that Guanyin Bridge was a suitable place to strike. In August, Yang Xiaoming summoned Yang Qixin and Gong Bozhou to Shanghai, personally ordering them to investigate Minister Zhang's whereabouts in Nanjing, believing that the Overseas Chinese Reception Center was suitable for sniping. They pretended to prepare for the assassination in September. Yang Xiaoming ordered Gong Bozhou to take a handgun to Nanjing and then come to Hankou, where he and Xiao Zhun, Fan Qishu, Liang Jiubao, Cao Bingrong, and others hid at No. 35, Erjiao Street, New Tai'an Inn. Fan Qishu introduced his friend Cheng Xiechao, who was unemployed in Hankou, to join the assassination organization. In July of the same year, he asked Nie Jingquan to persuade Wen Maoquan to privately purchase a handgun along with bullets and gave them to Cheng Xiechao for use. Yang Xiaoming secretly gave the Yang Yongtai's photo to the team members to identify, first attempting to assassinate in Sandao Street, Wuchang, and near the Hubei Provincial Government, but failed. They then discussed changing the plan and waiting for an opportunity by the river at the Hankou wharf. On the morning of October 25th, Yang Xiaoming and Cao Bingrong found out that Chairman Yang would attend a banquet in Hankou. They followed him across the river, and Yang Xiaoming ordered Cao Bingrong to stand at the People's Information Office at the wharf as a marker and to be responsible for keeping watch. He then returned to the New Qin'an Inn and ordered Cheng Xiechao and Gong Bozhou to carry handguns loaded with live ammunition to wait at the wharf. He secretly supervised and directed the operation on-site. When Chairman Yang arrived in a car at 3:00 PM and had taken only a few steps after getting out of the car, Cheng Xiechao approached him from behind and fired two shots at his back, both hitting vital points, and he died soon after. Cheng Xiechao was captured on the spot, and one handgun and six bullets and one bullet casing were found on him. (To be continued) (Central News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Significance of the German Foreign Minister's Visit to Southern Europe

‚Äî Auxiliary

Since Germany's intervention in the Spanish Civil War suffered a major blow, its foreign policy has undergone considerable changes. It knows that blindly acting tough externally will not only encounter resolute resistance from the invaded countries but will also arouse resentment from various countries. At the same time, it deeply feels that the country has not been sufficiently prepared to act tough externally. Especially worrying is the severe lack of raw materials for manufacturing armaments. Therefore, its foreign policy has recently temporarily abandoned the method of acting tough and has adopted a gentler approach to improve external relations and strengthen its ability to develop outward. Under these circumstances, the old tune of Anglo-German amity has been revived, and German-Italian relations have seen further development. This visit by the German Foreign Minister to the countries of Southern Europe is also worthy of attention.

Neurat's trip to Southern Europe lasted about a week. The countries he visited included Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The mission he bore was not only to promote Nazi influence politically but also to establish a foundation for cooperation economically, so that the raw materials Germany needs could be adequately supplied by these countries. Can this important mission succeed? Let us examine it based on the current situation.

First, let's talk about German-Yugoslav relations. Germany had already laid the foundation for amity in Yugoslavia. In economic terms, Schacht's magic hand had already plunged Yugoslavia into Germany's economic orbit. It used Yugoslavia's huge debt to Germany (in 1935, Yugoslavia owed Germany a huge debt of 3 million pounds) to force Yugoslavia to purchase large quantities of German goods and obtain preferential treatment in commerce. As a result, Germany occupied a very important position in Yugoslavia's trade relations. For example, in Yugoslavia's total export trade last year, France accounted for only 1.26 percent, while Germany accounted for as much as 19.86 percent. This difference in percentage is not that important. What is more important is that Germany imports mostly raw materials for armaments from Yugoslavia, and Germany enjoys exclusive rights over the export of these raw materials.

This economic advantage naturally has a significant impact on politics, especially under the active propaganda of the German Propaganda Department. The pro-German forces in Yugoslavia have grown stronger. Almost all news agencies in Yugoslavia have become branches of the German National Society. As for the leaders of the pro-German faction, in political circles, there is Dr. Koroshetz, and in military circles, there is General Zivkovitch. Koroshetz is the leader of the Slovenian Catholic Church and is currently the Minister of Interior, wielding great political power. Zivkovitch was a confidant of former King Alexander and holds a very important position in the army. At the same time, the current cabinet has a strong pro-German color. Under these circumstances, Neurat's success on this trip is of course highly certain.

As for Bulgaria, although its relationship with Italy was very close in the past, the influence of the Nazis has grown increasingly in the last nine years. The economic relations between the two countries are particularly close. In 1935, Bulgaria's exports to Germany accounted for 48 percent of its total exports, while its imports from Germany accounted for 53.5 percent of its total imports. In the first few months of last year, Bulgaria's exports to Germany increased to as high as 64 percent. This situation is rare among any countries. Under this economic advantage, Nazi influence naturally easily develops significantly in Bulgaria, especially since former Prime Minister TsanKov strongly advocates pro-German policies in Bulgaria.

Because Nazi influence has already laid a solid foundation in the countries of Southern Europe, Neurat's mission has a high possibility of being accomplished. Once this mission is accomplished and Germany receives an adequate supply of raw materials to massively expand its military strength, its foreign policy will probably shift from gentle to violent again. This is something that countries that uphold peace cannot fail to prepare for early on.

‚äôGibraltar It is claimed that wealthy financier March, the economic backer of the Spanish rebel army, has today authorized General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, to use another sum equivalent to US$150 million to continue fighting the government. (National Telegram, 7th)

‚äôHendaye General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish rebel army, today urgently transported 14,000 troops across the Strait of Gibraltar in preparation for a major offensive against Bilbao and Madrid, including 1,500 foreign volunteers.

‚äôBarcelona The National Army cruiser "Canarias" suddenly and heavily bombarded the towns and cities along the coast of Catalan yesterday. At 2:00 PM, the ship first bombarded the town of Barcelona, 120 kilometers northwest of Barcelona. Then, it shifted its target to the port of Palamos, where the forts in the suburbs of the town suffered heavy damage. The ship took advantage of the victory to continue destroying the towns of Cucurull and Calella, 50 kilometers north of Barcelona. All the towns were caught off guard and did not resist. However, the Calella fortress responded with bombardment, but the result failed to inflict any damage on the National Army cruiser. The people of Barcelona, upon hearing the news of the bombing, took shelter in cellars or other shelters. (China News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)

‚äôMadrid The National Army again bombarded the city last night, firing a total of over a thousand shells.

Upon receiving this news today, the Valencia government immediately ordered all able-bodied men born between 1932-1936 in the government-controlled territories to enlist. The government also ordered the immediate purchase of all available food with cash. At the same time, according to news from Spain received by San Juan de Luz, if General Mola were still alive, General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, would have entrusted him to immediately form a government. Although General Franco has consulted foreign history, this move seems to have been shelved. (Reuters, Central News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)

### Four Countries Reach Understanding on Western Mediterranean Security Plan

Drafting a Plan Based on British Proposals; Italy and Germany Expected to Return to the Adjustment Committee

[London] According to reliable sources today, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have reached an agreement on restoring the Spanish Western Mediterranean surveillance plan based on British proposals. A final plan is now being drafted to be submitted to both warring parties in Spain for implementation. (National Telegram, 8th)

[London] According to well-informed sources, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have reached an understanding on the issue of Western Mediterranean surveillance, and Italy and Germany may return to the Non-Intervention Committee. It is claimed that the British government, after negotiations with France, Germany, and Italy, has begun drafting a new agreement, which will eventually be signed in London by the ambassadors of the countries concerned, and then the agreement will be delivered to the warring parties in Spain. (China News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)

[London] London sources now expect that Germany is unlikely to object to the British proposal that any unilateral action taken by the countries concerned in the event of an attack on naval vessels involved in maritime surveillance in the future should be limited to self-defense. The current key task is to work out a plan to ensure that the principles of consultation have sufficient force, as Germany, while not insisting on retaliatory action, is eager for a consultation mechanism that is not meaningless but should stipulate action that can uphold the dignity of international surveillance. Judging from the French reply, British and French views are almost identical. According to sources in Berlin's political circles, the exchange of views between Berlin and London is currently proceeding smoothly. Germany is expected to resume attending meetings of the Non-Intervention Committee by the end of this week. (Reuters, Central News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)

### Talks in Southern Germany

Emphasis on Danube River Economic Cooperation; Czech Prime Minister to Visit Romanian Capital

‚äôYugoslav Capital. German Foreign Minister Neurath, around 11:00 AM, held another meeting with Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinoviƒá. Yugoslav officials stated that Neurath's visit should not alarm friendly nations, and newspapers reported that Neurath's trip was not only harmless but also beneficial to the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente. Prime Minister Stojadinoviƒá also stated that Yugoslavia would continue to abide by existing treaties and fulfill international obligations. Sources said that Neurath's talks with Stojadinoviƒá yesterday afternoon focused on economic cooperation among countries in the Danube River basin and genuine economic cooperation between major powers and Central European countries. In addition, Stojadinoviƒá explained Czechoslovakia's position toward Germany as a means of mediation. Furthermore, Yugoslavia's attitude towards Hungary's rearmament was entirely the same as that of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries. In other words, this issue could be resolved through negotiations among the countries concerned, but unilateral action would not be approved by the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 8th)

‚äôYugoslav Capital. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinoviƒá hosted a banquet for German Foreign Minister Neurath at 8:30 PM. Many important officials from both Germany and Yugoslavia attended. After the banquet, Stojadinoviƒá delivered a speech, hoping that the current relations between Germany and Yugoslavia would be further strengthened, and that the international agreements signed by the Yugoslav government with its friendly nations would promote international cooperation. In addition, any country with the possibility of cooperating with Yugoslavia should find ways to sign agreements with it. Yugoslavia is willing to promote cooperation between Yugoslavia and Germany and develop economic relations between the two countries in accordance with the spirit of the international treaties it has signed with other countries. Neurath responded, saying, "Hitler and the German people have always had friendly feelings towards Yugoslavia and firmly believe that the friendly relations between Germany and Yugoslavia have the possibility of further development. For this reason, we can exchange opinions and discuss the methods and goals of the two countries' foreign policies in a sincere and friendly spirit. This goal is to protect and enhance peace, which is self-evident." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)

### Blumberg's Visit Aims to Strengthen the Rome-Berlin Axis

Denies that the Trip Contains Secret Political Motives; Italian Navy Unafraid in Mediterranean Operations

‚äôNaples, Italy. German Defense Minister General von Blomberg visited the Italian naval exercises today, ending at 5:00 PM. He then reviewed the honor guard and boarded Mussolini's private yacht at 8:00 PM, sailing to the port of Bava. When boarding the yacht, the crowd cheered at the dock, holding signs that read "Long live Hitler, Long live Blomberg." Before leaving, Blomberg gave a speech to the Italian semi-official news agency Stefani, saying, "If people mistakenly believe that my visit to Italy has secret political motives, it would be truly absurd. What Prime Minister Mussolini of your country and Leader Hitler of my country sincerely hope for is nothing more than to maintain world peace. We, as soldiers, all know that excellent weapons should be in the hands of excellent soldiers, so that they can dedicate themselves to the glory and freedom of their motherland. I believe that there may come a day when this happens. Furthermore, the strengthening of the Rome-Berlin political axis is the most outstanding way to guarantee world peace. If the result of my trip can further advance this path, then when I recall the glorious situation of my visit to your country in the future, I will be even more pleased." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)

‚äôNaples. Mussolini today invited German Defense Minister Blomberg to conduct a grand naval review outside the port of Naples. Seventy submarines were lined up in formation. Mussolini, accompanied by Blomberg, sailed between them on the cruiser "Duca d'Aosta," leading other cruisers and destroyers. It is reported that the submarine review was unprecedented in number, with seventy participating, and its purpose was to show that if there is a war in the Mediterranean, Italy can mobilize its fleet to blockade it. In addition, after the submarine review, there were exercises involving fifteen other cruisers and forty-one destroyers. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from 7th)

### Archduke Otto Candidate for Spanish Throne

Mussolini Supports

[Paris] A certain prominent member of the Spanish Royalist Party recently gave an interview to a Havas News Agency reporter, stating that the old Habsburg royal family of Austria, which reigned over Spain from 1516 to 1700, now has its heir, Archduke Otto, as a candidate for the Spanish throne. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini supports this and will try to arrange a marriage between Archduke Otto and Italian Princess Maria, so that the Italian princess can be the mother of Spain in the future. Archduke Otto is currently in Biscay Province, Spain, visiting his uncle, Prince Gaston, who is injured. Archduke Otto's abandonment of the Austrian Royalist Party and engagement in propaganda in Spain shows that the claim that he is a candidate is not false. As for General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist military government, he originally supported the restoration of the throne to the deposed King Alfonso, but only Franco holds this view. Other leaders of the Nationalist army, especially General Queipo de Llano, commander of the southern front, although not opposed to the restoration, are unwilling for the Alfonso royal family to reign over Spain again. However, because the other heir to the Spanish throne, Prince Carlos of Bourbon, recently passed away without descendants, those who oppose Alfonso plan to welcome a foreign royal family to be the King of Spain. This is why Archduke Otto has put forward his candidacy. In short, there are currently four people qualified for the Spanish throne: the deposed King Alfonso, the deposed King's eldest son, the Count of Covadonga (who first married the daughter of a Cuban tycoon, and recently divorced again, planning to marry a beautiful model), the deposed King's third son, Prince Juan, and Archduke Otto of Austria. Who will ultimately reign over Spain is a matter for the Spanish people to decide. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)

### Cause of British Ship Hunter Explosion Determined

Caused by Hitting a Mine

[London] The British Admiralty's Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, Shakespeare, recently answered a question from a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, saying that the Court of Inquiry has confirmed that the British destroyer "Hunter" did indeed hit a mine, causing an explosion. The ship hit the mine off the south coast of Spain, just a few miles from Almeria, where the water is 600 feet deep. Based on this information, the British government will protest to the Spanish Nationalist authorities, stating that laying mines on the high seas cannot be considered legal in the current war situation in Spain. The "Hunter" exploded while patrolling the sea on a surveillance mission, resulting in eight deaths and fourteen injuries. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from 7th)

### Rumors of Dismissal of Russian Air Force Commander

[London] According to the Finland correspondent of the Morning Post, Soviet Air Force Commander Alkonsnis has been dismissed. Alkonsnis was the creator of the Soviet Air Force. His dismissal is due to his friendship with Gamarnik, the Red Army's political leader who was recently arrested and committed suicide. The correspondent added that Alkonsnis invented the method of jumping with a parachute, equipping the jumper with hand grenades and machine guns, so that he could attack the enemy when landing. The dismissal of such a meritorious general shows Stalin's deep suspicion. (National News Agency, Hai Tong Dispatch, 8th)

### Southern Hemisphere "Solar Eclipse" Today

Astronomers from Japan and the United States Observe on the Coast of Peru

[Tokyo] The appearance of the mysterious black sun in the Southern Hemisphere is imminent. Dr. Yamamoto Isshi and his party are determined to compete with the American observation team (observation site is Fincago, a rural area on the coast of Peru), adjusting their observation equipment, full of confidence, waiting for the opportunity. Regarding this competition between the Japanese team and the American team, South American astronomers, who are technically and theoretically behind, can only watch with wide eyes. This total solar eclipse will occur at 4:00 AM on the 9th, Japan time, starting from the British-owned Katuna-Cond-Fininger Islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east longitude 169 degrees 49 minutes, latitude 2 degrees 47 minutes, and ending at 7:20 PM, west longitude 70 degrees 51 minutes, latitude 12 degrees 47 minutes, near Lima, South America. The total eclipse time is seven minutes and four seconds, the longest total solar eclipse in eight years since 1929. The previous longest record was seven minutes and forty seconds, only thirty-six seconds longer. If this solar eclipse could be observed at sea, it would be a spectacle. Unfortunately, the observation site of the Japanese team and the American team, the coast of Peru, coincides with sunset on the day of the solar eclipse. The total eclipse time is short, and it is on land, with many obstacles such as mountains and clouds, so extremely fast observations must be made. This is a disadvantage for the Japanese and American observation teams in this session. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 8th)

Brussels. Dr. H.H. Kung, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, is currently here, receiving hospitality from the Belgian government. The Belgian evening newspaper recently inquired about the relationship between China and Japan. Dr. Kung replied that China is a peace-loving country, and its dealings with its neighbors are always characterized by patience. In recent months, some broad-minded politicians in Japan seem to have changed their attitude towards China. For example, important figures in the country's economic circles, led by Kenji Kodama, former President of the Yokohama Specie Bank, came to China to conduct inspections. We now hope that Japan's change of attitude is sincere. On the Chinese side, we are prepared to do everything possible to reach an understanding with Japan and work together in a spirit of friendship for peace in the Far East. This was the case in the past, and it is still the case today. In terms of economics, China is now prepared to cooperate with Japan and any other country, but with conditions, namely that this cooperation should be based on the principles of mutual benefit and equal rights. Dr. Kung then described China's progress in recent years, saying, "In the past ten years, under the wise leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan, China has made rapid progress under the rule of the National Government. Political unity and financial stability are unprecedented achievements. As a member of the National Government, I feel deeply fortunate. The National Government is now outlining a new construction plan. China is prepared to accept assistance from any friendly country. China and Belgium have a long history of close cooperation, and we hope that this close cooperation can continue in the future." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)

### British Imperial Conference Discusses Far East Situation

[London] The British Imperial Conference continued to meet this morning and issued a communiqu√© stating, "The Imperial Conference has continued to consider the situation in the Pacific and the Far East." Sources said that various issues in the Pacific have been discussed at length and will not be raised for discussion again in the future. British officials were tight-lipped about the proceedings of today's meeting. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 8th)

[London] As the British Imperial Conference nears its end, the work of its various committees has been completed. According to officials, the Constitutional Committee has submitted a report to the representatives attending the Imperial Conference, arguing that while the various parts of the British Empire retain the freedom to participate in various multilateral treaties, the various parts of the Empire are not bound by multilateral treaties signed by one part of the Empire. This proposal can facilitate the negotiations on the new Locarno Pact, because according to this method, the British government can participate in the Locarno Pact alone, without being hindered by the autonomous territories' reluctance to participate. In addition, the Economic Committee has also submitted a report, most of which consists of various economic statistics. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)

### North China Smuggling

Affects British Trade with China; British Undersecretary Answers Member's Question

[London] British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne today answered a question from Conservative Member of Parliament Childe in the House of Commons, detailing the current state of smuggling in North China and its impact on British imports, and comparing it with the situation six months ago. Cranborne said that based on the information obtained, it can be seen that smuggling in North China is very rampant, and the volume of transactions has not decreased compared to the previous six months, especially in December and January. However, since January, there has been a sign of decline. Judging from the recent general phenomena, the trend of smuggling is expected to be slightly curbed.

### Platinum Blonde Movie Star Jean Harlow Dies of Illness

Famous in the Film Industry for Playing Romantic Roles; At the Young Age of Twenty-Six, She Had Been Married Three Times

[New York] American film star Jean Harlow, known for her platinum blonde hair, suddenly died of cerebral edema in New York today at the young age of 26. Jean was born in Kansas City on March 3, 1911. In school, she was known for her talent for acting. Therefore, after graduating from Lake Forest School in Illinois, she went to Hollywood, the film capital of the United States. At that time, there were countless beautiful women seeking jobs outside the film companies, but Jean Harlow was uniquely noticed by the directors because of her silver-white hair, which was dazzling, and her clear green eyes, which were full of charm. It was as easy to get a contract as picking up a straw. Jean's family was wealthy. When she first entered the film industry, her grandfather strongly opposed it. Jean once dropped out of school because of this matter and stayed at home for several months. Finally, with the mediation of her kind mother, she was able to return to Hollywood. At first, she was only a supporting role for the hot girl Clara Bow. Later, she was appreciated by Howard Hughes, who selected her to be the protagonist of the film "Hell's Angels." From the release of this film, Jean became famous overnight, and Caddo Company signed a long-term contract with her. Other companies saw the emergence of new talent and rushed to recruit her. Jean became the most popular silver star in the film industry. Later, she was hired by the wealthy Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which signed a long-term contract with her for seven years. "Personal Property," which was recently released in Shanghai, was actually the last film completed by Jean Harlow during her lifetime, because Jean had not yet finished filming "Saratoga," which she was starring in. Jean was married three times in her lifetime. When she married for the first time, she was only sixteen years old. Her husband was Charles McGrew, whom she first met at a school dance and later fell in love with. However, later, because Jean was determined to pursue photography, they agreed to divorce. Her second husband was Paul Bern, a big director at MGM. Two months after the marriage, news of Paul's suicide spread, shocking the entire United States. A year later, she married Harold Rosson, a famous photographer. Seven months later, they agreed to divorce. Recently, she was seen with William Powell, and it was said that the two had been engaged, but this could not be confirmed. Furthermore, Jean Harlow's hair was originally silver, but it was also dyed red.

‚äôHollywood. American vamp actress Jean Harlow died at 11:37 this morning at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. At the time of her death, her mother and stepfather, as well as her on-screen co-star William Powell, were by her side. According to friends' estimates, her estate should be worth one million dollars. When encoffined, the remains were dressed in all white, with her hair combed back, as she was usually seen on the screen. The funeral is scheduled for Wednesday and will be buried in the Crypt Mausoleum, where many deceased movie stars, such as Rudolph Valentino, are buried. (National dispatch, 7th)

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations

London Remains Silent; Manchester Guardian Expresses Astonishment

[London] Regarding the negotiations between England and Japan, the Japanese "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun" newspaper published a report on the 21st of last month, stating that preliminary talks had concluded and formal negotiations were about to begin. The Manchester Guardian recently published an editorial expressing deep surprise at London's silence. The report stated: (According to the Mainichi Shimbun, England and Japan will cooperate in China and establish a friendly understanding. England's proposals regarding Central and Southern China will be recognized by Japan, but Japan requires England to recognize the "independence of Manchukuo" as a fait accompli and Japan's special interests in North China. All of this is what we imagine and fear. It is hard to believe that the British government could consider it. Regarding this matter, Foreign Secretary Eden is said to have provided assurances to Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, and China was thus reassured. However, the situation of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations is now shrouded in secrecy, so it is no wonder that China still feels uneasy.) (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)

### British Monetary Policy Remains Unchanged

Simon States in the House of Commons

[London] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated in the House of Commons today that the British monetary policy announced by former Chancellor Chamberlain at the 1933 World Economic Conference and in the Anglo-French-American declaration last September remains unchanged to this day and will continue to do so in the future. The government has no intention of changing it. This policy does not involve Britain buying gold at a fixed price, but it does involve buying and selling gold to prevent inappropriate fluctuations in exchange rates. The implementation of the Anglo-French-American declaration has greatly satisfied the three countries, and there are currently no considerations to amend it.

### London Market Gold Prices Rebound

The Effectiveness of the Tripartite Agreement is Clearly Demonstrated

[London] The price of gold bars rose five pence today, the largest one-day increase in over a year. There were very few sales, the reason is unknown, but there are rumors that the government may have taken some action. (National Telegram, 7th)

[New York] The New York Federal Reserve Bank announced that cash worth US$6,506,000 was shipped to the US today, all originating from the UK. (National Telegram, 7th)

[Washington] The market price of gold in London has begun to rebound. US Treasury Department and financial figures are satisfied, believing that this is a new achievement of the Anglo-French-American monetary agreement. Yesterday's gold sales in the London market were halved compared to last Saturday. The practical effectiveness of the tripartite agreement can once again be clearly demonstrated. The continued inflow of gold into the United States does not endanger the current US financial policy. It is believed that if England, France, and the Netherlands can cooperate with the United States, they have the power to buy up all the world's gold reserves. If all of these gold reserves can be bought up, the problem of stabilizing international currency through holding it will have a greater chance of success. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Movement for the Recovery of Lost Territories by Youths in the Northeast

Harmonica Society Discovered; Over Ten People Imprisoned; Zhang "Wildcat" Qiyi Leads Troops in Northern Chahar

Tianjin Correspondence: In recent months, news of the unity and solidarity of our country has spread throughout the four northeastern provinces. Young people who have been suppressed and persecuted believe that the motherland has hope and are secretly engaged in collective activities to recover the lost territories. The new Kempeitai of the Japanese army in the puppet state is thus extremely busy with investigations and is extremely strict with the inspection of letters and telegrams. Last month, the Harbin Harmonica Society was inspected by the Japanese military police due to a communication from within the country. Anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese evidence was found, and more than ten people were arrested successively, including Chen Baoluo, a translator at the Atlantic Cinema, Liu Xingcheng, a teacher at the Municipal Second Girls' School, and Ren Baiou, a doctor at Binjiang Hospital. They were imprisoned in the Japanese Kempeitai headquarters and subjected to harsh torture to investigate accomplices. Dozens of young men and women, fearing implication, had already fled upon hearing the news. Since the Japanese Kempeitai was unable to capture them all at once, they interrogated the more than ten people who were arrested all day long. It is said that several people have already died from unbearable torture. However, despite the oppression and strict prevention by the Japanese and puppets, they still cannot stop the vigorous patriotic movement among the people. In the border area of Jilin and Heilongjiang, the righteous army, hearing about the preparations in the motherland to recover the lost territories, rose up in February to organize the righteous army and secretly arranged for internal support. Therefore, the Japanese and puppets are very panicked. On the one hand, they strictly prohibit the import of accurate news from China to incite the fellow countrymen in the Northeast; on the other hand, they prevent young people from the Northeast from coming to the country. In addition, they widely purchase traitors to detect anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu news and severely punish those involved in the patriotic movement. Therefore, the young people in the Northeast at this time are in a thorny situation, and every move they make lacks any freedom. Last month, righteous armies rose up in Northern Chahar and the border of Suiyuan and Mongolia, killing puppet officials and expelling the Japanese. Zhang Chengde, the former commander of the Northeast Cavalry Division, was originally a hero from the grasslands. In the past, he led a brigade of brave soldiers and roamed Inner Mongolia, nicknamed "Wildcat Zhang." His chivalrous behavior was admired by the people of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Mongolia. After retiring from the military, this gentleman lived in Northern Chahar. A month ago, he was supported by the various righteous armies and formed the Suiyuan-Chahar-Mongolia Border Defense Army, with him as the commander-in-chief. He gradually gathered more than two thousand people. Two weeks ago, he led troops to capture Huade Laideng Temple, burning puppet organs. In the Huade-Chongli area, only the county seat is still guarded by the Japanese and puppet troops. All the Mongolian banners outside the county seat have been recovered by Zhang's righteous army. This righteous army deeply hopes that the motherland will send troops to recover the lost territories and decides to take the lead. At present, it is raising funds to "preserve itself and seek survival" to resist the evil forces. The puppet Xing'an South Province and various counties on the Rehe border have also risen up and raised flags under the influence of the righteous army. Therefore, the unrest on the puppet border has become an undeniable fact. The headquarters of a certain army outside the pass felt that this matter was a major concern and believed that it would be impossible to succeed without cooperating with the headquarters of a certain army stationed in the country to deal with this issue. The headquarters of a certain army in the country also urgently wanted to have close contact with the army headquarters outside the pass to deal with everything. Based on this idea, the two parties secretly held a meeting in Changchun. On the 5th of this month, the commander of a certain army in the country secretly went to Shanhaiguan under the pretext of going to Qinyu and took a plane to Changchun early on the 6th and 8th to meet with the commander of the army outside the pass for detailed consultations.

### The Situation in Northern Chahar Remains Serious

The Uprising in Taotunmiao Village; A Certain Side's Surveillance of the People Becomes More Severe; Many People Are Detained and Massacred

Wanquan Correspondence: Although the self-defense act of the people in Northern Chahar has not achieved any results, it has had a significant impact on a certain side and the bandits and puppets, and has caused great shock to the morale of the people. In recent days, a certain side has paid special attention to all actions of the people, and the cruel methods of surveillance and oppression are even worse than before. Those who are slightly suspected are either detained or massacred immediately. Therefore, the morale of the people in each county is even more panic-stricken, and the situation is extremely serious. As for the course of this incident in Northern Chahar, according to people from Zhangbei, the main reason for the incident was indeed the people's indignation at the abuse by the puppet bandits. Unable to bear it any longer, they rose up in rebellion in order to defend themselves and strive for survival. In May, they had already started secretly activities and agreed to launch simultaneously in Zhangbei, Guyuan, Binchang, Kangbao, Shangdu, Huade Chongli and other counties on June 1. Unfortunately, the secret was leaked and heard by the puppet bandits and a certain side. On the night of May 30, the puppet bandits and a certain side first carried out a major inspection in Zhangbei City. The various counties followed suit. During the inspection in Zhangbei, any people (natives) from all walks of life who had served in the military and political circles before the 24th year of the Republic of China and are not currently employed by the bandits and puppets were uniformly detained if there was any suspicion. On the night, more than 200 people were detained. By June 1, nine of them had been killed. The leaders of the people who attempted to revolt were inevitably detained and brutally killed. However, the date of the official launch on June 1 has arrived, but the internal and external news is completely isolated, so most of the counties are hesitant and watching. Those who bravely took the risk of launching were also gradually cut off by a certain side with drastic measures by the third day. Recently, in Zhangbei City, in addition to more than a thousand puppet Mongolian troops, there are only more than 20 regular troops from a certain side. Since the incident, the troops have been on strict guard, and the work of guarding and sentry duty is all undertaken by themselves. This also shows their panic.

The self-defense of the people in Northern Chahar was initiated by Zhao of Taotunmiao Village, Chongli County. It is now known that Zhao, whose name is Xiangchun, was originally the village chief of Taotunmiao Village. At 2:00 AM on June 1, he personally led three baojia chiefs to sneak into nearby Shizuizi Village, confiscating the baojia and guns of the village. At the same time, several righteous people joined in, totaling more than ten people. After Zhao announced to the crowd the purpose of the uprising and the method of proceeding, they went together to the Taotunmiao Village Public Security Sub-station, specially killing the puppet director Wang Yaoguang and confiscating more than 20 guns from the puppet police. Before the incident, rumors were rife in Chongli County, saying that there would be changes in various places on June 1, and the puppet county government ordered all subordinates to be on alert. Because Taotunmiao Village is very close to Zhangyuan, Wang Yaoguang was ordered to pay special attention to the security of the village. Wang Yao had long been wary of Zhao Xiangchun and planned to detain Zhao first to prevent accidents. Zhao saw through his conspiracy and took the initiative to preemptively surround and kill Wang Yaoguang under the cover of the dark night. According to the village uprising, Chongli County sent more than 60 puppet security team members to the village on the 2nd. Zhao and others only had more than 30 guns and a shortage of bullets. After a slight resistance, they dispersed around 3:00 AM on the 3rd. The puppet security team detained many villagers afterwards. The team left a part in the village and returned to Chongli early on the 4th. It is said that Zhao and others are currently hiding in nearby villages and plan to rise up again after the puppet security team has left.

Sakakibara, a senior adviser to the puppet Huade Municipal Government, flew from Jiabusi to Changchun by plane at 1:00 PM on the 3rd to report the civil unrest in Northern Chahar to Commander Ueda of the Kwantung Army and Chief of Staff Watanabe. That night, the military headquarters had telegraphed the heads of various special agencies to do their best to eradicate the people's forces, advised the internal personnel of the puppet state at all levels not to easily publicize the need to calm the situation, and telegraphed De Wang to quickly return to Jiabusi from Sonid Right Banner in Shanxi to suppress everything. It also said that when necessary, the Zhigui Army Brigade stationed in Rehe would be ordered to enter Northern Chahar to act as a support for the puppet bandits. Chief of Staff √ó√ó would also fly to Duolun when necessary to command everything. As for the military pay of the puppet bandits, it will also be appropriately increased and ordered to be distributed to various units immediately after the funds arrive to appease the military.

The rebellious leader De Wang has always been immersed in the dream of the Renyuan Empire. Every month, a certain side supports him and allocates 270,000 yuan of puppet military and political expenses every month, all in the form of puppet Manchukuo paper money. This paper money can only be circulated within the sphere of influence of a certain force. Outside the scope, it is like ghost money. Any Mongolian with a little knowledge is ashamed. Recently, there were many people planning to secretly hold a meeting in Jiabusi to discuss persuading De Wang to reflect deeply and awaken early to avoid cutting himself off from the country and the nation, or to refuse to accept the support of a certain side. Even if the situation is unavoidable, they should refuse to accept the puppet money. This meeting is being convened, but it was broken by a certain side's detection. All the participants will be arrested and imprisoned and will be punished separately. (5th) One found central China Traffic Farmers Four Lines of five yuan ‚Ä¢ ten yuan ‚Ä¢ fake money one thousand six hundred Wu, when will the people and the stolen goods sent to the police station responsible for,

As for manufacturing, Minnan people with opium addiction originally only smoked opium. Occasionally, a small number of travelers and lower-class vagrants swallow opium bubbles and ointment for convenience and financial reasons, which is extremely rare. Strong drugs are even rarer. Recently, morphine, heroin, cocaine, Jindan, Hongwan, and other drugs have flowed in in large quantities and spread everywhere. The reason is that the price of opium is expensive, and the search is extremely strict. The weak-willed opium smokers are afraid of the trouble of registration. For convenience and economy, most of them switch to swallowing drugs. Although the increase rate of drugs in Xiamen City and Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Putian, and Xian counties in recent months cannot be counted, the lowest should account for more than 60% of opium smokers. The source of drugs starts from neighboring countries such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, and some are transferred from Shanghai. This year, with the strict prohibition of drugs, the smuggling of private goods has been intensified, but the Ronin secretly manufacture them on the spot. It is said that there are already four secret manufacturing agencies in Xiamen City that can be verified. In the mainland and offshore, there are also many secret drug manufacturing places. In Xiamen, those who run fierce drug items, in addition to citizens of a certain country and local ruffians attached to a certain country, among the Western medicine industry, there are also those who take advantage of the convenience of trafficking in drugs to do so (June 6).

Gathering to Rob a Widow Detained

In the commotion, Dong woke up and escaped through the back door. He saw Wang Ziming and Xiao Zhongzi among the crowd. Afterwards, the town police station was reported, and Wang and others were transferred to the Jiangdu Land Court.

### The Two Major Harms of Counterfeit Money and Drugs in Southern Fujian

‚ÄîBoth have a background of a certain country‚Äî

Xiamen Correspondence, There are two major harms in southern Fujian recently, counterfeit money and drug production. Both of these have the background of a certain country. Counterfeit money in Fujian has become a serious problem in finance. Among them, the subsidiary currency of the Fujian Provincial Bank is the most common. The printing technology of the domestic currency is crude, so it is very easy to counterfeit. In the early days of the lithographic printing plate, there were many counterfeit banknotes, so the general use of one-corner coins was suspicious. After the engraving plate was changed, the counterfeiters specialized in making five-corner coins. In the previous month, the five-corner counterfeit coins were found in the inland areas of Minnan, Xiamen and Quanzhou. The Fuzhou garrison executed three traitors who were instigated to use counterfeit coins this year. The source of such counterfeit money is a certain island across the strait, along with smuggled goods, imported from Zhangquan offshore into the mainland, and some secretly imported from Xiamen. The Xiamen Water Police often finds a lot of search on passengers from the mainland who are going to the mainland, the lesser counterfeit than the central China traffic farmer four line method is less and the source is Shanghai or Hong Kong, too, a certain square person counterfeits the purpose is not limited to Fujian Province, on June 4, the Taiyuan wheeled from Shanghai to Xiamen by the Taikoo Steamboat Company The tenth team of the water police first received a report that a Ronin was secretly transporting a large number of counterfeit coins from Shanghai to Xiamen, so when Ganlun Mikoma Wharf secretly arranged for police detectives to rigorously search all the passengers landing from the land and water, he finally found Lu Mou in a small suitcase.

### Sea Yuan Vessel Salvage Details: Ship and Cargo Losses are Staggering

Goods worth 500,000 were jettisoned into the sea. Small boats and barges made a fortune. Repairs are expected to be completed in a month for return to Shanghai.

The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new Hai Yuan vessel ran aground on the morning of October 21st at the Hong Kong Kap Shui Mun lighthouse. The company dispatched Li Yunqu, head of the maritime affairs division, by airplane to Hong Kong to oversee the salvage efforts. It is now known that the ship has been rescued and taken to the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong. The combined losses from ship and cargo repairs are estimated to exceed 800,000 yuan. Yesterday, Li Yunqu, who oversaw the salvage, returned to Shanghai. A reporter inquired about the salvage situation. According to Mr. Li, he arrived on the afternoon of October 22nd. Taikoo Dockyard, responsible for the salvage, deployed over two hundred workers, including one chief technician in charge of salvage, two British divers, and six Chinese divers, to work on the ship. The location where the Hai Yuan ran aground was only two hundred feet from the foot of the mountain. Two rocks were beneath the ship's midsection near the engine room, one on the right side and one in the middle. When the Hai Yuan ran aground, it was secured to the mountain with four steel cables to prevent it from sinking. The breach in the first two holds was near the keel, measuring eleven feet long and four inches wide. The coal bunker had a fifteen-foot leak. The first two holds were completely flooded, causing all the cargo within to be submerged. From the 22nd to the 29th, until 9:00 AM, seven water pumps (two in the first hold, five in the second) were used day and night to pump water. Divers worked inside and outside the ship's hull to plug the leaks with wood wedges, hemp fibers, and caulking mats. Cement and wooden planks were used for patching. Two large barges were used to remove intact cargo from the third and fourth holds. The submerged cargo in the first two holds consisted of valuable items such as cotton yarn, textiles, silk crepe, general merchandise, and white rice. The salvage chief ordered all of this cargo to be jettisoned into the sea because the bow was deeply submerged, with the deck level with the sea surface, while the stern rose high (as shown in the image). After the cargo from the two holds was thrown overboard, the coal bunker was emptied, and some coal was also dumped into the sea. On the 27th, the rocks shifted under the second hold, causing more severe leakage, which the pumps could not handle. At this point, the salvage engineers were extremely alarmed. After consultation, it was decided to first drag the stern of the Hai Yuan off the rocks to prevent the bottom of the ship from being further damaged, averting extreme danger. However, during the towing, the towboat's propeller became entangled in the cable, nearly causing it to run aground and be destroyed. Only after switching to a second towboat was the ship pulled fifteen feet away from the rocks. The ship listed by fifteen degrees, an extremely precarious situation. Fortunately, it was low tide, and the leaks in the two holds were sealed, averting disaster. By the 28th, the work of sealing the coal bunker leaks with caulking mats was completed. Simultaneously, the leaks on the outside of the ship were also repaired. After an entire night of pumping, by 9:00 AM on the 29th, the water level in the first two holds had gradually decreased to about seven feet. The entire process took six days and seventeen hours. At 9:20 AM that morning, a massive tarpaulin was used to wrap the bottom of the Hai Yuan's first two holds. Finally, three large towboats were used to pull the ship backwards off the rocks, completely freeing it. It was towed backwards all the way to the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong, with the ship listing eleven degrees to the right to relieve pressure on the damaged bow. At 11:45 AM, it was safely towed into the dock. The ship is now being supervised by Zhou Houfu, a technician dispatched by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, for repairs, estimated to take about a month before it can be completed and returned to Shanghai. According to a crew member who arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, when the cargo from the Hai Yuan's first two holds was jettisoned into the sea, because both holds contained high-value goods, dozens of small boats and barges from Hong Kong went to Kap Shui Mun lighthouse to salvage the items. These vessels were fully loaded and overjoyed. It is now estimated that the jettisoned cargo was worth about 500,000 yuan, while ship repair costs and lost charter fees add up to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Therefore, the total loss from the Hai Yuan incident, including both cargo and ship, is estimated to be over 800,000 yuan. Insurance companies that underwrote the cargo insurance have dispatched personnel to Hong Kong to thoroughly investigate the details of the incident.

### China Merchants Resumes Sichuan Shipping: Jinjiang to be Launched

Launching on the 26th of this month, joint operations with Yihua from June 1, resumption after more than four years of suspension.

The Sichuan River route of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been suspended since the accident of the Emei vessel, for more than four years. During these four years, it was a time of congestion in the transport of Sichuan goods, and the water freight rates soared, some increasing to about nine times. The company watched with envy the huge profits earned by companies such as Minsheng, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and Sanbei. Last winter, it began planning to restore the Sichuan route in order to help connect the transport of goods to and from the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It thoroughly transformed the salvaged Emei vessel and presented it to the Ministry for approval. It was decided to completely rebuild the hull of the Emei, adopt the latest style and enlarge the hull, while the engine would still be the Emei's. Everything was entrusted to Jiangnan Shipyard for construction. The construction cost of the hull alone was 380,000 yuan. The interior of the vessel was elaborately designed to the most magnificent and luxurious standard. The grand dining room and first-class rooms all used Simmons beds, and the third- and fourth-class cabins were equipped with ventilation, dining halls, water heating in winter, and fans in summer. It surpassed Minsheng Company's Mintai and Minben first-class vessels. The vessel was named Guijiang, meaning that this vessel would become a "state-run mail ship in the Sichuan River." Because of the urgency to resume the Shanghai-Chongqing route, Jiangnan Shipyard was hired to expedite the construction, and engineers were sent from the company to the shipyard to supervise the construction. All the work on the vessel has been completed. Yesterday, the shipyard notified the company that it was scheduled to officially hold the launching ceremony on the 26th of this month. The company has reported to the Ministry and requested that the Ministry send a special commissioner to Shanghai to attend the launching ceremony of the Jinjiang vessel. It is also possible that Minister Yu will personally attend. On that day, the company will invite all sectors of Shanghai and abroad to participate in the ceremony at Gaochang Temple. After the launch, it will immediately speed up the installation of all levels of seats in order to start shipping passengers and goods to and from Shanghai and Sichuan on a regular basis. In order to facilitate the Sichuan merchants, the company has agreed with Yihua Company that all goods bound for Sichuan will be jointly transported by Yihua above Yichang, and all goods from Yichang to Shanghai will be transported by the company's river vessels. This has been implemented since June 1st. Therefore, the Sichuan navigable transport that has been interrupted for several years will first accept joint transport from June 1st.

Requesting discussion on the matter. „äÅ Regarding the second phase of land value tax in this county, which has already begun, the assessed land values still do not conform to the figures agreed upon by local people convened by the county government. How should this be handled? The above two cases were discussed together, and it was resolved: A. The county government issued a proclamation on May 26, following a provincial order, entrusting the Land Administration Bureau to handle the matter according to the law. What legal basis did the bureau use to assess the new land values? B.

### Measures for Levying Income Tax on Public Bond Mortgages

All Previously Mortgaged Bonds Exempted; Interest on Other Bonds Payable

The Ministry of Finance has submitted to the Executive Yuan the collection measures for income tax on interest from government agency mortgage loans and public bonds, and has specially requested the Jiangsu Provincial Government to review and refer to them, attaching the collection measures for reference. The original text is recorded as follows:

Ministry of Finance Official Dispatch: The Ministry of Finance, in a dispatch to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stated: Regarding your government's telegrams of December last year and April this year, inquiring whether income tax can be exempted on price bonds not yet issued and deposited in banks as loan guarantees, and requesting a prompt reply to proceed accordingly; Your request is approved. According to the Public Bond Regulations, once announced, the issuance date is clearly defined. Although the bond certificates are still held by the issuing agency, their entitlement to principal and interest is the same as that of general bondholders, and cannot be considered unissued. However, the income tax on public bond interest began to be levied on October 1, 1936, after the approval of the 1936 expenditure budget for government agencies. This tax was not included in the budget and lacks funding, which presents practical difficulties. A relief measure was proposed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan convened a review committee to examine the measure and submitted it for approval. The Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 2326 on April 24 of this year, stating: The 309th meeting of this Yuan decided to adopt the review opinion on the report jointly submitted by the ministry and other bodies regarding the relief measure for income tax on interest from public bonds mortgaged by government agencies. The case is recorded and reported to the National Government for filing and is also notified for compliance. A copy of the review committee's record is attached for your ministry to comply with. This order, along with a copy of the corresponding review opinion, is sent to your government. Please review and list the names, numbers, amounts, mortgage dates, interest amounts, total tax amounts, and debt repayment deadlines of the above-mentioned mortgaged bonds in detail and reply so that we can handle the matter accordingly. This is sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for the collection measures. This case was returned for further review, and the original proposed measures A and B were discussed in detail. The original proposed measure B used the actual issuance of public bonds as the standard for tax payment. This type of boundary is extremely difficult to determine because once the public bond regulations are announced, the issuance date is clearly defined. Although the bond certificates are still held by the issuing agency, their entitlement to principal and interest is the same as that of general bondholders and cannot be considered unissued. Furthermore, mortgage methods vary, with some being fully mortgaged, some partially mortgaged, and some changing the mortgage quantity at any time. Investigation and registration procedures are very cumbersome. If this is used as the tax standard, it will cause great difficulties for the collection agencies and is practically impossible to implement. The original proposed measure A is supplemented to take both facts into consideration and submitted to the Yuan for review and approval. Revised measure A: Before this case is approved, all bonds that have been mortgaged by various issuing agencies before debt settlement will be exempt from income tax. If tax has been levied, it will be refunded. (The tax exemption and refund should be reported to the Ministry of Finance by each agency with the bond number, amount, mortgage date, interest amount, and total tax amount for approval.) Interest from the remaining bonds should be subject to income tax. If the tax on interest from mortgaged public bonds affects loan usage, the issuing agencies can list it separately in the budget.

### Li Shaoduo Telegraphs Report on Disaster Inspection in Western Henan

All That Is Heard Is Selling Wives and Children; Nothing but Tree Leaves and Wild Grass

The joint disaster relief association of charitable organizations in this city received a telegram yesterday from Li Shaoduo, the investigation and relief commissioner of Henan, reporting on his inspection of various counties in western Henan. (Omitted titles) Li Shaoduo arrived in western Henan on the 29th of last month to inspect the area. He found a vast expanse of barren land and displaced disaster victims. He thought that after a large amount of emergency relief, the disaster victims would still be able to survive. The two rainfalls last month increased his sense of security. He fully expected that this trip would bring a change for the better. Who knew that the urgency of relief was even greater than before, two to three times greater than in March and April? Besides the starving disaster victims, half of the disaster victims, although their possessions were exhausted, could still buy grain by selling daily necessities, tattered clothes, and eat tree leaves and grass roots boiled into soup to survive. Now, the mountains and rivers are exhausted. All the disaster victims have nothing to fill their stomachs except stone powder, tree leaves, wild grass, and rough bran. Those who had a sallow complexion in the past now have sunken bellies and exposed ribs, or they are as thin as dried corpses and have transformed into skeletons. Every village and city he passed, all he heard was reports of selling wives and daughters and abandoning or killing children. Even with this emergency relief, the affected area is so vast and the number of disaster victims is so large that those who receive relief account for less than one in ten. Although the autumn crops have emerged from the soil, it will be more than three months before they can be eaten. Their lives are hanging by a thread and cannot wait long. He humbly begs all of you to quickly gather large sums of money to continue saving lives and resurrect the dead. This merit will last for generations. This telegram expresses the utmost urgency. Respectfully, Li Shaoduo, investigator and relief commissioner for the drought in Henan. It is also reported that the Ministry of Finance has allocated 120,000 in work relief funds to Henan Province, and the Shanghai branch of the China Bank has telegraphed the Henan branch to allocate and distribute the funds.

### Report on the Implementation of Work Relief in Dengfeng, Henan

The Shanghai China Jisheng Association and the Sino-Foreign Relief Society have completed emergency relief in Dengfeng and have begun implementing work relief. We have received a report from Mao Rucai, the magistrate of Dengfeng County, along with two printed receipts. One work relief receipt states that 18,889 relief tickets were received, totaling 55,937 yuan in relief funds. In addition, grain and wheat were distributed to disaster victims in the city, totaling 869 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. This includes 54 bags of relief rice and 3 shi, 2 dou, 5 sheng, and 4 he of wheat, totaling 56,806 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. In addition, 4,193 yuan and 8 jiao and 8 fen of work relief funds were used. Excluding relief expenses, the total is 61,000 yuan. The distributions by both associations were supervised by local officials and county government personnel on-site, benefiting the people in a practical way. The magistrate issued printed receipts in the correct amounts to show good faith. Work relief is just beginning and is the start of water conservancy in Dengfeng, which is being carried out with real effort and is not yet completed. The relief funds remitted to Dengfeng by both associations for emergency relief have been exhausted. The work relief funds will be disbursed successively according to the progress of the project. However, the relief funds from Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and other provinces for the Jisheng Association are meager and insufficient. We still hope that benevolent people will continue to contribute generously. We have already allocated relief medicine to Sichuan and Henan provinces.

### American Red Cross Concerned About Chinese Disaster Victims

Remitted Funds to the Sino-Foreign Relief Society

The Sino-Foreign Relief Society reports that the severe drought in Henan, Sichuan, Gansu, Guizhou, and other provinces has caused extreme suffering to the people. In addition to sending personnel to various disaster areas for relief, the association has also been appealing in newspapers to raise relief funds. It has been learned that the American Red Cross has repeatedly raised funds and remitted them to the association for distribution, and has stated that more remittances are coming. This shows the concern of the United States for the Chinese disaster victims.

### Reasons for the Cancellation of Yesterday's Student Disaster Relief Variety Show

Prohibition by the French Concession Police; Remedial Measures to Be Discussed on the 10th

The Shanghai Student Disaster Relief Variety Show was originally scheduled to hold variety show fundraising performances at 2:00 PM and 7:30 PM yesterday and today, with all proceeds to be sent to disaster-stricken compatriots. In recent days, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically purchased tickets, and it was expected that the results would be satisfactory. Yesterday morning, the association's affairs were all arranged, and representatives from various schools responsible for the venue also arrived at the Yameng Grand Theater on Songshan Road. Unexpectedly, the French Concession Police believed that the plays must contain patriotic meanings and prohibited the performance. After clarifying that it had been approved by the authorities and contained no anti-Japanese implications, and that the matter was purely for disaster relief with no other connections in fact, the police still did not allow it. The association, caught off guard, has now scheduled a meeting at 1:00 PM on the 10th at the Qingnian Middle School on Sichuan Road to convene various schools, discuss remedial measures, and reschedule the event. They deeply apologize to the ladies and gentlemen who enthusiastically purchased tickets for their wasted trip.

### Chinese Insurance Companies to Jointly Form Reinsurance Organization

Chinese life insurance companies in our country have never had a formal joint reinsurance organization. Therefore, there are occasional cases where the remaining amount is reinsured with foreign companies, resulting in the outflow of rights and interests. People with good intentions are concerned about this. The life insurance group of the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association has also seen this problem and held a meeting at the association at 10:00 AM on the 8th of this month to discuss the reinsurance issues of Chinese life insurance companies. It is proposed that the member companies of the insurance group of the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association jointly organize a reinsurance organization with a fixed capital of 200,000 yuan. It is now being started and will be realized in the future. Then the Chinese life insurance business will have no worries about the loss of rights and interests or the outflow of resources.

### Post Office Adds Automobiles to Deliver Parcels

Temporary Delivery Measures in Place

Postal parcels have traditionally required recipients to go to the post office to pick them up. The Shanghai Postal Administration, in order to facilitate the public, has purchased two covered vans since June 1, 1937, to initiate door-to-door delivery services for domestic parcels. It is learned that the post office, seeing that this service is developing daily and that the original vehicles are insufficient, has purchased two more similar vehicles, scheduled to be put into use on the 10th of this month. At that time, the bureau will have four large special vehicles, departing together at 9:00 AM every day to deliver all door-to-door parcels sent to Shanghai from all over the country as quickly as possible. For parcels sent by mailers, the delivery fee is one jiao per item, and the recipient can enjoy this convenience. If the mailer has not prepaid the delivery fee, the recipient can include the parcel pick-up slip (i.e., the notification slip) along with the delivery fee of one jiao per item in an envelope with the words "Postal Official Business" written on the cover and send it free of charge to the Parcel Delivery Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration. The post office can also send someone to deliver the parcel to the address. However, insured parcels, cash-on-delivery parcels, and those requiring customs clearance or tax payment are not included in this service.

### Fujian Plague Prevention Committee Ships First Batch of Medicines

Various Medicines Including Plague Serum and Plague Vaccine; Shipped to Quanzhou on the Xinli Steamer

The Fujian Plague Prevention Committee has been working intensely recently. In addition to continuing to urge central and local authorities to implement effective measures, and telegraphing to county civilian organizations to quickly organize prevention and rescue agencies and conduct practical coordination, yesterday it purchased the first batch of plague prevention medicines, including plague serum, plague vaccine, carbolic acid, and disinfectant, sufficient for tens of thousands of people.

It is also reported that there is a severe shortage of plague serum and plague vaccine on the market, and the committee has purchased all existing stocks. The next batch of medicines must wait for the Central Epidemic Prevention Office to produce them.

It is also reported that the committee, seeing that Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health, has returned to Beijing and expressed his intention to formulate a five-year rat extermination plan, intends to send personnel to Beijing again to express sympathy and inquire about the truth of the plan. It is currently drafting a proposal for reference in order to facilitate its early implementation. The documents from the committee to the Fujian Provincial Government and other bodies are recorded below. A petition to the Fujian Provincial Government: Regarding the submission of plague prevention medicines for distribution: This committee has purchased the first batch of plague prevention medicines totaling eighteen pieces and shipped them from Shanghai to Quanzhou on the Xinli steamer on June 7, to be transferred by the Jinjiang County Chamber of Commerce to the Jinjiang County Government for temporary storage. We respectfully request that your government consider the severity of the epidemic situation in various places and promptly distribute the medicines to various epidemic prevention agencies for application, and please inform us of the distribution situation. Respectfully presented to Chen, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, and Xiao Bichuan, Chairman of the Fujian Plague Prevention Committee. A letter to the Jinjiang County Government is roughly the same.

### Domestically Produced Cast Iron Enamel Sanitary Ware

Success Made by Yifeng

Domestically produced cast iron enamel sanitary ware has been successfully developed by Yifeng Enamel Company after three years of active research, making it the originator of domestic production. The current products include electric stove surfaces, kitchen sinks, washbasins, toilets, etc. The enamel is delicate and strong.

### Yarn Brokers Secretly Withhold Payment for Goods as Speculation Margin

Suspect Arrested and Investigated After Victim Reported to the Police; Court Orders Rescheduled Hearing in One Week

Japanese national Morioka Asakichi operates a yarn business at No. 18 Miller Road under the name Japanese Maritime Transportation Company. He hired Jiang Bingsheng, a local resident, as a bird broker. On the morning of the third of this month, at 9:00 AM, Jiang told Morioka that Guangzengxiang Yarn Shop at No. 7, Alley 4, Tianjin Road, intended to purchase 22 bales of cotton yarn (valued at 9,352.42 yuan). He requested that a warehouse receipt be issued immediately, as the payment could not be made until 11:00 AM due to the banks not being open at the time. Morioka, because Guangzengxiang had a long history of transactions and had never been short on payments, did not suspect anything and issued the warehouse receipt. However, by 4:00 PM, Jiang had not paid the amount, and Jiang's whereabouts were also unknown. Morioka then inquired with Guangzengxiang and was informed that the payment had been made by the company to Jiang Bingsheng with a Guohua Bank cashier's check. Morioka immediately reported to the General Police Department. Hua detective Geng Deru's investigation revealed that Jiang had given the cashier's check to Qin Chuan Yarn Shop at No. 229, Zhonghui Building, Aiduya Road, as a margin for his standard cotton yarn trading. A plan was devised for Guangzengxiang to stop payment with the bank, and Jiang was put under strict surveillance. Finally, at 1:40 AM yesterday, Hua detective Yang Peisheng discovered Jiang's whereabouts in Room 69 of the Pinxiang Hotel at No. 270 Yuqiaqing Road and rushed to arrest him. Subsequently, a search of the residence of Jiang's concubine's mother at No. 221 Beihai Road yielded 425 yuan in cash, a China and South Bank savings passbook with 600 yuan, a Yongda Bank savings passbook with a balance of over 16 yuan, and a checkbook, which were all brought back to the police station. At around 9:00 AM, Jiang was sent to the Special Court's First Criminal Tribunal, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated him. The police attorney Ru Baoyi explained the previous circumstances and charged Jiang with embezzlement under Article 236, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, and stated that the defendant had been sentenced to three months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence by this court for forgery in May last year and was still within the probation period. He has now committed a similar crime, and the investigation of this case is not yet complete. The court should allow a rescheduling, etc. Then, Morioka Asakichi testified and interrogated Jiang Bingsheng. Jiang Bingsheng confessed that, according to the trading practices between me and the plaintiff, the plaintiff first issues a warehouse receipt and gives it to the client, and the amount paid by the client is paid to the plaintiff by me at 5:00 PM. The amount paid by Guangzengxiang this time was transferred by me as a margin for standard cotton yarn trading. I originally planned to pay the plaintiff after settling the accounts at 5:00 PM, but I could not fulfill the plan due to a loss of several hundred yuan. However, the cashier's check has already been paid and collected by the plaintiff, etc. After Judge Feng verified the confession, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for one week.

### Shanghai Grand Theater Scheduled to Reopen

### Film Industry Opposes Anti-China Films

Ever since the Japanese-owned Toa Cinema began showing the Japanese-German co-produced film "New Land," all sectors have expressed indignation, believing the film shows contempt for our national territorial sovereignty and insults the nation's dignity. It is learned that the Motion Picture Producers Association of this city believes that it is all the more necessary for the film industry to strive to prevent the public showing of anti-China films by Japanese merchants in Shanghai. It has been decided to raise the issue for discussion during the inauguration ceremony of the newly elected executive and supervisory committee members at the Pudong Mansion Club at 5:00 PM on the 14th of this month, in order to express a serious stance and encourage the other party to realize their mistake.

### Passenger on New Ning Shao Steamer Jumps into Sea, Leaving Farewell Letter to Wife

Fang Guangtian Commits Suicide by Jumping into Sea Due to Illness; Another Passenger Jumps into Sea on Ningxing Steamer

The New Ning steamer sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 4th of this month. Another passenger jumped into the sea, leaving behind two letters filled with poignant words. The sentiments expressed are recorded as follows:

Jumping into the Sea near Tongsha

The New Ning Shao steamer set sail from the 16th Wharf at 5:00 PM on the 4th. Around 8:00 PM, as the ship left the Wusongkou and neared the waters of Tongsha, a passenger suddenly jumped into the sea and committed suicide. Later, the steward Wang Zuhuang discovered that the passenger was received by him and was about thirty years old, wearing a gray lined spring shirt, a wool robe, and a felt hat, with a Ningbo accent. Upon inspecting his berth, a cloth robe was found, and in its pocket were two letters, one addressed to his wife and the other to his father-in-law, both bearing the name Fang Guangtian, which is presumed to be the name of the deceased.

Letter to His Wife

The letter addressed to his wife gave the address as No. 28 Yian Lane, Chengdu Road, Shanghai. The steward of the ship delivered the letter to the address. The letter to his wife is recorded as follows: "My beloved wife, please forgive me. I am in too much pain, so I am committing suicide. I know my illness is deep-rooted, and dragging it on will only burden you. It is better to leave early and spare you the suffering. However, I know your heart will ache, but there is nothing I can do. In the future, please do not dwell on it too much. When I left home, I was overwhelmed with sadness. I wanted to die for your sake, but when I thought of my illness, I had no choice but to die. Please forgive me. Do not forget my instructions. Take good care of my parents-in-law. If you want to go back to Cixi to live, you can. I have written a letter to my brother, entrusting him to take care of you. Farewell forever, farewell forever. A letter to my parents-in-law is enclosed. Please present it to them. Fang Guangtian, Sixth Month, Fourth Day."

Another Jumps into the Sea

Furthermore, according to a report from the Datong News Agency yesterday afternoon, a passenger on the Ninghai steamer of the Sanbei Company, which sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 5th of this month, jumped into the sea. The passenger, about thirty years old, bareheaded, wearing a green-gray Western suit, speaking with a Shanghai accent and without luggage, was in a small cabin on the left side of the ship on the third floor. At 6:00 PM that evening, as the ship was sailing through the Wusongkou, the passenger immediately climbed over the railing from the berth and jumped into the sea and committed suicide. Because there was no suicide note, the reason for the suicide is unknown.

### Gang Gathers Thugs to Force Dissolution of Marriage Contract, Husband Angrily Kills Wife

Woman Suffers Eleven Knife Wounds, Life in Critical Condition; Husband Explains Reasons in Detail

Long Heshang, a 31-year-old resident of Pudong, used to work as a sailor on a tugboat for the British-owned Tsang Tak-fung Tug & Lighter Co., but has been unemployed for many years and makes a living by selling vegetables. His home is located at No. 22, East End, Wu Family Hall, Pudong. His wife, Yao Jinmei, is currently 14 years old and works as a female worker at the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Lujiazui. The couple has been married for five years and has a four-year-old son. However, Long is by nature weak and an honest country bumpkin, and has not won his wife's favor, so the relationship between the two is weak. Yao has even returned to her mother's home in Meiyuan, Changzhan since September of the previous year and has not returned to this day, nearly two years. Recently, she gathered several thugs to force Gong to sign a document dissolving the marriage contract. Gong was stimulated by this, coupled with rumors that his wife was having an affair. Under this dual pressure, he developed deadly thoughts. At 6:00 PM the night before, he hid a kitchen knife and waited for Yao as she was about to leave work at the crossroads of Tobacco Factory Road and Tomb Mountain Road. When Yao left the factory with the crowd and arrived at the spot, Gong rushed into the crowd without asking any questions, pushed Yao to the ground, and slashed wildly with the knife. Yao suffered one knife wound above her right ear, splitting the ear skin in two, two knives below her right ear, three knives on the top of her head, one knife on the back of her neck plus one knife, one knife on the left shoulder, and two knives on her arm. Blood flowed all over the ground. At the time, Yao struggled fiercely, so Gong himself also cut his left arm and slipped and fell to the ground, his face scraped by the stone road. At this time, the guard at the entrance of the Tobacco Factory had already arrived and Gong still tried to raise the knife to continue slashing, but was stopped by the guard using a wooden stick to knock the knife from his hand. The guard then apprehended him and sent him to the Pudong Branch for disposal. Yao was rushed to Pudong Hospital for treatment. The wounds were found to be deep, about three inches long. She was dizzy and after a dose of cardiac stimulant, she gradually woke up. After the wounds were sewn up, she was transferred to Renji Hospital that night. Her condition was severe, and she was still in critical condition yesterday. As for the perpetrator Gong Heshang, he was interrogated by Branch Chief Zhang yesterday, and he spoke in detail about the reasons for his actions. The Branch Chief ordered him to be sent to the local court for prosecution in the afternoon.

### Truth About the Expulsion of Vegetable Stalls on Fuyou Road

Yesterday's newspaper reported that the vegetable stalls on Fuyou Road were expelled by the police. After investigation by reporters, the details of this case are as follows: The vegetable stalls in the eastern section of Fuyou Road, because they had not obtained donation licenses and were not arranged neatly, obstructed traffic in that section. As early as the end of last year and mid-April of this year, the Municipal Police Bureau, based on the decisions of the Municipal Government's various bureaus, ordered the relevant Yimiao Police Station to carry out the crackdown. The vegetable vendors in that area initially complied and withdrew, but before long, they arbitrarily set up stalls again. On the morning of May 8, when the station chief was ordered to carry out the crackdown, the stall vendors gathered more than 100 people and went to the station, demanding to set up stalls as usual. Although they were persuaded to disperse, they still set up stalls arbitrarily as before. It is now heard that the police bureau, in order to rectify the city's appearance and take into account the livelihood of the peddlers, will still implement reasonable crackdown measures.

### Fire at Yan Hai Road This Morning

The Jutang Sauce Garden, located at No. 3, 4, 5, and 7 Yanhai Road in the city, suddenly caught fire at 0:05 this morning on the facade of the No. 2 building, and immediately spread to the No. 4, 5, and 7 buildings. Flames soared into the air and the situation was dire. The nearby police officers were notified and immediately reported to the Fire Brigade, which dispatched fire trucks to the scene to put out the fire, preventing it from spreading. After about half an hour, the fire was completely extinguished, but the four buildings of the sauce garden had been completely destroyed, resulting in considerable losses. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the police station.

### Yesterday's Weather Was Cool and Pleasant After the Rainstorm the Day Before

The Seasons Can Change in a Day. On the 4th, the city was sweltering, with the temperature rising to 97.2 degrees, breaking the highest record for this year. In the afternoon, there was a heavy rainstorm, which swept away the heat. Yesterday morning, the weather was even cooler, like early spring. Compared with the scorching weather the day before, it was like a change of seasons. Residents felt a sense of coolness after the scorching heat.

### Shen Junru and Others' Reply (2)

Although the indictment lists as many as ten counts of criminal evidence, it is nothing more than taking the various documents of the National Salvation Association out of context, piecing them together, distorting the meaning of resisting the external enemy as a desire to seize internally. It does not provide a holistic view of the facts and evidence in this case, resulting in fragmentation and obscuring the truth. Moreover, it lacks understanding of the international situation and the content of national policy. In order to expose the fallacies, we will reply to the ten counts one by one as follows:

(1) The indictment claims in the first count that the defendants intentionally obstructed the central government's national policy of eradicating the Red menace, citing two phrases in the declaration of the National Salvation Association of All Circles as evidence. However, upon investigation, (A) the phrase "The National Salvation Association of All Circles' declaration contains 'The major powers' attack on the Soviet Union is a mistake, and China's suppression of the Communists is also a mistake,'" is marked with quotation marks to indicate direct quotation, but no such phrase can be found in the declaration. This is astonishing. Upon reviewing the letter from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to the Inspection and Study Department of the Judiciary, it was found that this phrase was included in it. The indictment simply copied its error. It is unexpected that the indictment, after four months of investigation, has not even carefully reviewed the original text of the National Salvation Association's documents. If one end is like this, the rest can be imagined. Furthermore, the similar but different point in the declaration is: "In the four years and eight months, the Western powers, under the erroneous policy of supporting Japanese imperialism's attack on the Soviet Union, have fatally threatened their interests in the Far East. Our pro-Japanese bureaucrats, under the erroneous policy of tolerating Japanese imperialism's establishment of a base for attacking the Soviet Union in the Northeast and dreaming of establishing an international anti-Communist alliance with Japan, have almost cut off the lifeline of the entire country," (see page 2 of the declaration). The so-called mistake of attacking the Soviet Union clearly refers to the Western powers' misbelief in Japan's smokescreen of attacking the Soviet Union, resulting in the loss of interests in the Far East. The so-called mistake of anti-communism clearly refers to the dream of being able to ally with Japan to oppose communism, which may result in the country being destroyed by the Japanese before communism can be opposed. Furthermore, the first paragraph of the declaration states, "In the four years and eight months, Japanese imperialism, on the one hand, used the smokescreen of establishing a military base to attack the Soviet Union to deceive the European and American powers, and on the other hand, used the trap of a joint anti-communism to deceive our authorities, taking the opportunity to annex our six provinces of 1.68 million square kilometers and enslave 60 million compatriots," (see page 1). The last page of the declaration states, "Do not listen to the sweet words of Japanese imperialism and attempt to sacrifice China to launch a war against the Soviet Union in the Far East." Reading the front and back together makes the meaning clearer. (B) As for the indictment, in the same count, it also cites the phrase "A few people with ulterior motives still believe that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party are the main enemies of the Chinese nation," on the second page of the declaration, as the second argument. The meaning of this phrase is still the same as the above, that is, the main enemy of the Chinese nation is Japan, which aims to destroy us. If the indictment does not deny that Japan is our country's main enemy, it cannot make any accusations against the above phrase. Judging from the various phrases quoted in the documents cited in the first count of the indictment, it can be seen that the discussion of whether it is wise to ally with Japan to attack the Soviet Union and oppose communism is purely based on the point of resisting Japan, and does not touch on the attack on the Soviet Union and the anti-communism themselves. The National Salvation Association arose for the sake of resisting Japan, and the Soviet communist issue other than resisting Japan was originally unrelated to the purpose of the association. The indictment did not pay attention to the words about resisting Japan in the sentence and the meaning of the so-called delusion, so its attacks are inherently baseless. Furthermore, the Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Agreement was repeatedly proposed by the Japanese side during the Sino-Japanese negotiations last fall and winter, but the government has always firmly rejected it, which shows that the National Salvation Association's views on this point are not at all in conflict with the government's measures. Moreover, the declaration of the Third Plenary Session clearly states, "As for internal affairs, peaceful reunification has been the common creed of the whole country for several years. Only through reunification can a modern country be built, so as to bear the great responsibility of saving the country and preserving its existence. Only through peace can everyone know that they should unite sincerely and face the difficulties together, so as to achieve true reunification. The interests of the entire nation ultimately outweigh the interests of all individuals and all groups," etc. The resolution of the Third Plenary Session on eradicating the Red menace states that it yearns for a world of great harmony and has no parochial views on domestic affairs, but only seeks to gather the strength of China and lay the foundation for unification. "Regarding the Communist Party, the party takes love as its heart and will never cut off the path for people to reform themselves," etc., which is enough to prove that the central government's national policy is no different from the meaning of the phrases contained in the declaration of the National Salvation Association of All Circles. The indictment claims that the defendants intentionally obstructed the central government's national policy of eradicating the Red menace based on this phrase, but in reality, it does not clearly understand what the central government's national policy is. (2) The indictment claims in the second count that the defendants do not recognize the current government as having the power to rule and want to organize another government outside the current government, based on the following points:

(A) The National Salvation Association of All Circles' declaration suggests the release of political prisoners. However, the Second Plenary Session and the Third Plenary Session both had this proposal. The Third Plenary Session has already passed the principle. President Jiang also said in a conversation with a reporter from the Central News Agency after the Third Plenary Session, "There are many examples of leniency and exemption for those who have committed political mistakes in the past," and clearly stipulated the conditions for amnesty, showing that it was even more specific. The indictment uses this as the basis for determining that the defendants do not recognize the ruling power of the current government and want to organize another government, but it is unknown how it interprets the central government's proposal and resolution on this matter. (B) The indictment uses the declaration of the National Salvation Association of All Circles, which states that the congress suggests that all parties and factions should immediately send representatives to negotiate, formulate a common program for resisting the enemy, and establish a unified anti-enemy regime, and the political program, which states that we need to quickly establish a unified national salvation regime, as evidence that the current government's ruling power is not recognized and that another government is to be established. Its error lies in confusing the regime with the government. It is well known that the government is the institution of the state, while the regime is the power exerted by this institution. Therefore, the same government can exert different powers, and the change in its power does not affect its organization. For example, after the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi, the central government's regime expanded, but the organization did not change in the slightest, which is clear evidence. When the National Salvation Association of All Circles issued the declaration and political program, the domestic situation still had the appearance of separation between various parties. The National Salvation Association, in view of the imminent foreign aggression, issued a call for internal unity. Since the government has peaceful unification in mind, how can it be used as a basis for conviction? As for "unified anti-enemy regime" and "unified national salvation regime," "anti-enemy" and "national salvation" are the unanimous demands of the people, (to be continued)

### Thorough Rectification of Wharf by China Merchants Bureau

Implement Arrest of Thieves to Eliminate Long-Standing Malpractices; Dismiss Security Personnel to Increase Wages and Fundamentally Reform

The state-owned China Merchants Bureau, in order to thoroughly rectify the order of the Jinliyuan Wharf, has dismissed all of the original security personnel. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the Jinliyuan Wharf has always been a den of thieves, and the security personnel rarely reported any crimes. The bureau is implementing the government's rectification plan and is determined to eliminate long-standing malpractices. The previous screening of security personnel and the recent decision to dismiss all security personnel are all for the purpose of reform. Since the employment of the petition police last month, many cases of theft have been discovered under strict supervision and have been sent to the Second Special Zone Court for punishment. This kind of arrest and punishment of thieves is unprecedented, which shows that the reform has achieved practical results. As for the petition police hired by the bureau from the court and police station, they are directly commanded by the bureau, and their employment and dismissal are entirely decided by Director Li. There is absolutely no connection to the so-called sovereignty issue. Regarding the explanation of the sovereignty issue, the bureau has previously disclosed it in detail in the newspapers. The security personnel who were dismissed this time, in order to protect their personal interests and try to restore their evil forces, are resorting to the trick of releasing smoke, using the words "sovereignty" to embellish their words and sensationalize the situation. In fact, the issue of power can only be researched by those with considerable expertise in law, he said.

### Trial of Meat Industry Standing Committee Member Accused of Embezzlement

Awaiting Subpoena for Further Questioning

Huang Yexin, a standing committee member of the Fresh Meat Industry Association, was accused by Zhou Chengxiang, Zhou Yueliang, Jin Guifu, Yao Desheng, and others, who run meat shops in Xujiahui, of embezzling public funds from the slaughter tax. After the prosecutor of the local court filed a public prosecution, Judge Wang Shanxiang held a trial yesterday. Huang Yexin appeared in court with his lawyer, Zhang Shiben. According to his defense: (1) Procedurally, the complainants are not members of the Meat Industry Association, nor are they real meat merchants, and have no direct interest. However, they claim to be representatives of meat merchants from the surrounding countryside, without any power of attorney to prove it, and are not recognized by the industry in the surrounding countryside, which is a deceptive tactic. Therefore, they have no right to sue. (2) The organization of the Shanghai Municipal Slaughter Improvement Funding Committee was established by the municipal authorities, under the guidance and supervision of the Municipal Society, Finance, and Health Bureaus, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which each sent one representative, and the Meat Industry Association, which sent three representatives, to manage the improvement and reorganization of various public welfare undertakings in the meat industry with the funds from the slaughter tax. Three people were mutually elected as standing committee members, and one person was elected as chairman. The rules were established and reported to the municipal government for record and announced for implementation. The association was organized and established in August of the 20th year of the Republic. The defendant took office in June of the 21st year of the Republic, after the resignation of Committee Member Yan Weixiao, who represented the meat industry. For more than a year in office, he organized large and small undertakings that were approved by the committee and reported to the municipal government for approval before applying to the Finance Bureau for funding. Every six months, he prepared a report on the income and expenditure of the administrative expenses, together with the calculation books and vouchers, and reported them to the municipal government for verification and cancellation, and notified the relevant agencies and groups. In October of the 22nd year of the Republic, after receiving an order to close down, he submitted a final statement of income and expenditure and handed it over to the municipal government for acceptance. At that time, the Meat Industry Association suspected that there were no piles and repeatedly requested the municipal government to order the association to announce the detailed rules. However, the association directly paid the monthly regular expenses, while other expenses, such as the expenses of various schools, were received by the principals in whole, and the expenses of charitable hygiene, etc., were either received by the Industry Association or received by the designated person in charge, all of which were issued in whole and receipts were obtained. They were repeatedly submitted to the municipal government for verification and cancellation, and the municipal government appointed clerk Sun Baozhang, Meat Industry Association Chairman Rong Qianchu, and members of various bureaus to the scene to examine the income and expenditure one by one, all of which were signed and certified as consistent, and then reported to the municipal government for record. Therefore, the system of the association is one of the subordinate organs of the municipal government, rather than a merchant group. The funds of the association are purely public funds, not merchant funds of the plaintiff, and they have no right to sue. As for the alleged embezzlement, the substantive matter has been found to be correct by the previous meeting, and there is no crime to speak of. After questioning and verifying his defense, the court ordered a subpoena to be issued for further questioning.

### Chicks

‚Äî Lin Jia

If I were in my hometown, at this time I would have raised a few yellow and black chicks.

The wheat in the fields floats gold and glittering in the sunlight, and spring has gone far away. The cuckoo sings so diligently, "Cut the wheat and plant the rice." In the melon garden, the melon trellis has been built, and the weather is getting warmer and warmer. The farmers, wearing reed hats, stay by the fields, tapping the hard mud with small cedar sticks for beating thieves, singing one line after another, "In the fifth month, it is the Dragon Boat Festival, the death of a virtuous wife is so desolate, realgar wine, too lazy to taste, ..."

Along with this simple song, a long call comes from the streets of the countryside: "Who buys little goslings, exchange them if they are sick..."

These peddlers are beloved by the children. They are all tall and big, wearing climbing cloth shoes on their feet, and dark-colored coarse cloth pants tied with a five-inch wide board belt. On their dark and tight backs, they slant a small cloth shirt, and a straw hat as big as a wheel covers the top of their heads. On their shoulders is a thin wooden carrying pole with two ends raised, and under each end are eight strands of hemp rope, tied to a bamboo basket that is large enough for four six-year-old children to sleep in without crowding. He treads softly on the smoky dust, passing through the fences of the farmhouses. When a white-haired, disheveled old woman or a few mud-like, naked children walk out of the gate, he repeats this attractive tone, and then chooses a large tree shade or a mill shed to put down the load, open the thin burlap cover of the bamboo basket, and a burst of trivial and clear chirping sounds, like a plate of hungry silkworms eating freshly picked mulberry leaves, chirping non-stop.

In the basket, there are hundreds of pairs of apricot-yellow, velvety chicks and ten pairs of mouse-like, black, shiny chicks. Each one is full of vitality and actively jumps around, raising their little heads with pointed beaks, and turning their pairs of surprised round eyes, chirping in surprise at this strange big world.

Grandma and the children all have their dreams. She uses the money she earns from spinning four taels of cotton thread a night, and the children use the New Year's money they earn from kowtowing during the holidays, both equally conservative in their inherited farmer's character, choosing, arguing, calculating the amount of money, and sighing:

"So expensive, I won't buy it."

The chicken peddler answers in the tone he is used to dealing with these people:

"Old lady, look carefully, a chicken, guaranteed to weigh five taels. I bet you, this yellow and white one is a pullet. When it grows up, it will lay eggs without fail. Four eggs will be enough for the capital!"

"Don't say that, what about the grain?"

"What about raising pigs?"

"Raising pigs is for manure."

"Pigs need to be fed, chickens will find food themselves."

As a result, the grandmother and grandson count the copper coins in their palms and give them to the peddler, and carry them home in a small round basket. The children are no longer willing to leave the chicks that eat husked rice. At night, to prevent greedy cats, they hang a pair of small straw baskets on the beams, but often their efforts are in vain, and a clever cat actually eats the poor chicks cleanly in the deep of night without making a sound.

It has been fifteen years since I left that life that is regarded as a groundhog by the nobles. My younger siblings may still be playing with those chicks at this time, and it may be said that they no longer have any money to buy those lovely little things because the family is getting poorer and poorer. I miss home, and I also want to live that peaceful and simple life like in my childhood.

### Three Kinds of Understanding

‚Äî Meng Ruo

Mr. Song Zheyuan said to people: Chinese people must have a global understanding, Chinese people must have an understanding of Japan, and Chinese people must have an understanding of China. If everyone can do this, then we can talk about saving the country. This is very true! For the Chinese of today, this kind of understanding is absolutely necessary! Otherwise, nothing can be discussed, and the country cannot be saved. But what kind of understanding should we have of the world, of Japan, and of our country?

Regarding the world, we must understand: the current international relations are extremely complex. Within them, there is opposition between the aggressive front and the peaceful front, conflicts between right-leaning and left-leaning ideologies, the struggle between imperialism and oppressed nations, and even infighting among imperialist powers. These crises are very likely to erupt. Today's world is moving in the direction of war. To gain a foothold in this chaotic situation, one must struggle with one's own strength. Relying on others will not work. Letting the strong arrange things is even worse. This is a path to self-destruction!

Regarding Japan, we must see clearly: Japan is a militaristic country with ambitions for external expansion. And China is its biggest target for invasion! The land of the Northeast has already been seized by them through force. Now the other side is devoting all its efforts to plotting against North China. Japan's invasion of our country ultimately aims to realize its continental policy. If we understand this, we must first make a firm resolution to deal with it! Otherwise, one day China may become a vassal of Japan!

Regarding our own country, we must recognize: the current state of China is facing increasingly serious national crises. The entire country, under the covetous gaze of a powerful enemy, is constantly in danger of destruction! Therefore, if we want to save the country, the only way out is to launch a national struggle, to seek survival from death. This task is naturally extremely difficult. But we must not be discouraged or lose heart. As long as everyone is aware and rises up together,

## Page 18

it is not difficult to reverse our fate and restore our nation!

The above points are my personal observations, and may differ from others, but generally, they should not be far from the truth. In short, only by understanding the general trend of the world can we determine how to conduct ourselves amidst the changes of the situation. Only by seeing clearly the attitude of Japan can we adopt methods of resistance under heavy pressure! Only by understanding our own situation can we muster all our strength and fight for the country! This is what military strategists call "knowing the enemy and knowing yourself," and it is something that those who talk about saving the country today cannot fail to pay close attention to!

### Scrambling for Leftovers

‚Äî Tianshe

This semi-nomadic life, even the time and place for eating are uncertain. I've run through restaurants that boast "economy," and tasted all sorts of different flavors. Sichuan restaurants lean towards spicy, Northern restaurants are sometimes spicy with a hint of bitterness, and Cantonese restaurants have rice that's hard and difficult to swallow. This kind of food doesn't really suit my appetite. To fill my stomach, I can only force it down. Only the food from my hometown suits my taste, a bit of sweetness hidden in the saltiness. But my increasingly barren hometown can no longer accommodate me. The great winds of life blew me out, to this supposedly prosperous city, using all my strength, widening my moist eyes, to scramble for the leftovers of others. These leftovers, however, are seen by others as the source of their entire lives.

Perhaps the enjoyment of human life can never be balanced. In the city, the two sides of this unbalanced life are displayed even more clearly. In Western-style buildings, some people have food‚Äîalready tired of eating delicacies from land and sea. On the steps below the Western-style buildings, there are people sitting, greedily swallowing coarse grains. When I see those thin, dirty "little beggars" blocking the path of the food carriers, scrambling for the leftover scraps of food in the baskets, I feel that I am relatively happier. Although my life is also obtained through scrambling, I don't have to be scolded, beaten, or kicked... subjected to all sorts of inhumane and unbearable insults. But these kinds of tragedies are being performed everywhere:

It was in a restaurant that wasn't very big. I became a patron in the evening. Because there were many diners, ordering food took some time to wait. Sitting near the door was a single diner. He had already finished eating comfortably. He wiped his face, picked his teeth, drank tea, and read the evening newspaper. His face was flushed, knowing he had drunk some wine. He looked very comfortable. On his table, there was still more than half a bowl of rice, half a piece of "four happiness meatballs," and some chicken bones left over. For someone like me, these leftovers would be enough to fill my stomach. But to maintain a kind of self-respect, I would never beg him to give them to me.

But there were people begging for handouts. Right in front of him, next to the glass door, a person as thin as a skeleton, as dirty as a ghost. He said intermittently: "Sir, please give me the things on the table, sir... like... like you'd feed a dog at home..." His voice was lowered, as if afraid others would hear. His sunken eyes stared at the half bowl of rice, half piece of meat, and those scattered chicken bones on the table. The diner didn't pay any attention, still reading the newspaper, picking his teeth, and drinking tea, looking very comfortable. I really wanted to go up and tell him, or do this favor for him, but I didn't. I was still suppressed by a kind of self-respect: Why meddle?

The waiter hadn't brought my food yet, so I simply watched this drama unfold:

Another ragged person appeared next to the glass door, younger than the first one. Although both were under the pressure of hunger, they seemed to be in a state of antagonism. The first one's right foot had already crossed the threshold, his hands reaching out, but not daring to reach out rashly. He was still speaking in a low voice, begging for the leftover food, his eyes stealing glances at the waiter, probably fearing the waiter's interference and expulsion. I could see clearly that his arms were shaking, his legs were also shaking. The one behind only showed a dark face over the first one's shoulder, as if also eagerly waiting for an opportunity to come, his eyes also firmly fixed on the leftovers on the table.

The diner folded up the evening newspaper, stood up, and prepared to leave. Only then did he hear the pleading words that had been spoken for quite a while. He twisted his mouth indifferently, with a hint of drunkenness. The person by the glass door rushed in, and before he could grab the leftover food, the younger one followed closely, turning into four hands scrambling for the leftover scraps on the table. "I asked this gentleman first, you're snatching it!" "Let's each take a little, fill our bellies." The two sons started arguing in front of the guest. The guest was annoyed: "None for either of you, go, go, go..." The waiter brought my food, hurriedly went over to chase the two people out, cleared away the dishes and bowls, poured the broth and water into one container, glanced at the door, "Beggars, bring money if you want to eat!" he said sarcastically, and carried the dishes away. I picked up my rice bowl, looking at the two distressed faces outside the glass door. I felt that my own life, though also a scramble for leftovers, was still relatively happier after all. When will human life ever achieve balance? I pondered like this...

### Ghost Market

‚Äî Jiang Niao

Before the irritating sound of frogs breaks the silence of the air, in that desolate, dim corner, could it perhaps be a ghost market at this time?

No trace of travelers can be found, only a few distant barks of dogs are heard from time to time: then everything returns to silence, silence.

It is dusk, wisps of smoke are coming out of the chimneys of distant villages, gradually blurring, disappearing.

The streetlights are flickering with dim light.

Heaps of people who have lost their spiritual core‚Äîperhaps a machine of flesh, lascivious and charming bas-reliefs cover the wounds of the heart and body, gathering there like ghostly figures.

They all drag their tired bodies, their mouths exhaling the pungent smell of alcohol, their eyelids drooping heavily, unbuttoning their clothes, revealing their red, greasy chests, dripping with sweat, mumbling crude, dull, and unpleasant tunes, each coming here to seek their comfort.

They often quarrel and curse their companions for their own momentary happiness...

Waves of disturbing noises are surging around.

The moon casts down its pure white veil, hanging askew in the east.

The "ghost market" is brewing gray dreams again!

### Introducing Generalissimo Chiang's Half-Month in Xi'an

Introducing Generalissimo Chiang's Half-Month in Xi'an

The Northwest is the birthplace of our Chinese nation, and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident before was truly a chance for the rebirth of our Chinese nation. Even today, with the passage of time, every time we recall the situation of the Xi'an Incident, we cannot help but feel disturbed and pray silently for the safety of our national leader.

The Xi'an Incident, as Madam Chiang put it, was truly the last righteous revolutionary struggle for the fate of our country. When the incident was tense, the entire country was of one mind, showing it in their expressions. With an unprecedented spirit of unity and a unified voice, they ran around and appealed for the sole national leader, deeply knowing that if the Xi'an Incident was resolved one day and the leader was safely rescued from danger one day, then our nation, which had fallen into the depths of water and fire, could regain a glimmer of hope for revival. Although this move by the people of the country stemmed from the urgent and compelling love for the leader in the face of hardship, distress, and imminent peril, it also sufficiently proved the people of the country's profound understanding of the leader's selfless devotion to the country. It showed that our leader could lift the Chinese nation from countless calamities, and that the unity and solidarity of the compatriots throughout the country could accomplish the arduous plan of saving the country and seeking survival. This kind of understanding by the people of the country was nothing less than restoring the spiritual foundation of the nation, and this spiritual foundation was fully expressed during the Xi'an Incident. The Xi'an Incident was not only a touchstone for the national concept of the people of the country, but also a general expression of the Chinese nation's desire for revival.

Previously, when we read the full text of Generalissimo Chiang's instructions to Zhang and Yang before leaving Xi'an, the great righteousness and passionate spirit filled us with emotion and tears. Only with the most sincere heart for the country can one utter such sincere and touching words. It is not only enough to serve as a principle for our lives, but its great spirit can also serve as the highest lesson in history forever. Recently, the Zhengzhong Book Company compiled and published Generalissimo Chiang's half-month diary in Xi'an and Madam Chiang Song Meiling's memoir of the Xi'an Incident, so that we can see more deeply the leader's great personality in this historical event that has had a significant impact on the history of national revival, and the greatest and most upright national character expressed in the leader's behavior, which is indispensable for every national fighter who is struggling to build internally and resist externally for a long time in this dangerous situation.

Generalissimo Chiang is involved in countless affairs and bears the weight of the country's safety, causing the news of the Xi'an Incident to spread throughout the country and shock the world. This can be seen clearly in Madam Chiang's memoirs, in which she describes the various situations at the time. With the occurrence of the incident, the whole country was in despair, and Madam Chiang's sense of public and private justice warred in her heart. She was able to restrain her emotions and put the country and the people first in everything. On days of rain and snow, braving difficult journeys with ice on the road, she carried the last hope of the people of the whole country and entered the tiger's den in person. In an extremely harsh atmosphere, she maneuvered and finally overcame the strong with justice, protecting the leader from danger and restoring the country to peace. Her memoir is beautifully written and is already a valuable historical literary material. In particular, looking at history, there are few women of valor who have established virtue and accomplished meritorious deeds like Madam Chiang's actions this time, which have filled the people of the whole country with gratitude. I would like to quote a few words to introduce this historically valuable document. It must be known that reading this book not only allows us to learn about the various truths of the Xi'an Incident, but also that the leader's words and deeds can serve as a permanent model for us.

During the peace talks, Li Hongzhang agreed to all the conditions proposed by the Allied Forces that would result in the loss of national sovereignty, but the conditions that insulted the imperial family were really difficult for him. After the meeting, Li Hongzhang gathered officials from various departments to discuss strategies to deal with the situation. Knowing that Sai Jinhua had close relations with the commander of the Allied Forces, he wanted to put this "major responsibility" on a weak woman to intercede with Waldersee.

### How to Back Up

‚Äî Wei

Backing a car into a defined and narrow space in a parking lot is the final and most difficult lesson in learning to drive. Many people can change gears or restart on a hillside, but when asked to back into a parking space, they freeze. The reason for this is clear: because it is the most difficult part of driving, the instructor often drives it for the beginner to see, rather than directly teaching the beginner to practice. This is a mistake, because only through gradual practice can the beginner make progress.

When backing a car into a parking space, the driver must be able to do two things. First, he must be able to steer correctly with one hand, while keeping the other hand ready to use the brake to stop or change gears. Second, he must be able to use the clutch and accelerator well so that he can move forward and backward at the slowest speed. If you are not confident in the speed of the car, backing up will not be a smooth process. Because in certain situations, even a speed of four miles per hour is still too fast. Moreover, a lack of confidence in speed will lead to fear, and fear will eliminate confidence.

The visibility behind the car is poor, so the speed must be extremely slow when backing up. Therefore, beginners should practice in a convertible before they have gained complete confidence. Because without obstructions, the visibility in all directions is unimpeded, and the difficulty of backing up can be greatly reduced. When practicing, it should be done in an open space and alone. Because a nervous driver is afraid of the person standing next to him. Initially, practice driving straight back. Of course, you should make sure in advance that there are no obstacles or dangers behind the car. Then drive straight along the sidewalk. This method is not suitable for ordinary roads, because the traffic there cannot be predicted in advance. When driving, put your arm on the car door and your left hand on the steering wheel to steer. Then stick your head out of the car window so you can see clearly what is going on along the outside of the car. This method is very useful in narrow places, otherwise it will be difficult to back into a defined position. There is also another method, which is to use the rearview mirror. However, this can only be used in spacious places. Before attempting difficult parking techniques, you must first have preliminary practice, until you can move forward and backward at will in a space that is only a few inches wider than the car‚Äîwhether its direction is straight or angled. When practicing, you can use two bamboo poles instead of practicing in a real doorway. When practicing, gradually shorten the distance between the two bamboo poles. If you steer the car wrong, you will not damage the car body. And the learner can easily find that the front wheels do not always follow the rear wheels. When backing up, sometimes the rear has safely passed the gatepost, but the front is damaged. Therefore, although the rear of the car has safely passed the gatepost, we must pay close attention to the front. In short, parking in a parking lot is the most difficult thing in driving. Backing up, changing gears, and sudden stops are all necessary and important skills.

To park the car between two cars that are already parked on the side of the road, the best way is to first drive the car past the gap, and then back the car in. Stop the rear wheels where the car is expected to stop after it is parked properly. Then use the steering wheel to turn the front wheels in. In this kind of situation, simply using the method of driving forward will not work.

### The American Automobile Industry in Late Spring

‚Äî Yu

March Production Breaks Records

Not long ago, the automobile production center of the United States, Detroit, was experiencing a strike. At that time, some people were worried that it would affect automobile production. Fortunately, the strike did not last very long. After several negotiations between labor and management, the storm gradually subsided. Although each factory was somewhat affected during the strike, the authorities worked hard afterwards to make up for the lost time. Therefore, the result was not only not bad, but the automobile production in March 1937 created a new record in the history of automobile manufacturing, becoming the best month since June 1929.

Several giants in the American automobile industry, such as General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, all had good results during this period. General Motors had several shutdowns and restarts during the strike, but once the storm was resolved, they ran at full capacity, striving to produce as much as possible. The production volume of two of their divisions became the highest point in their history, and the high production volume was truly amazing. Ford and Chrysler were not far behind, with production volumes reaching almost the maximum limit, with the number of vehicles manufactured each day at around 7,000. When the strike was tense and their factories were temporarily shut down, the output of Chrysler and Hudson factories was also at its peak.

The brisk sales of high-priced cars can indicate the prosperity of the market. Among the products of various automobile factories, those cars with a selling price of US$1,000 or more have good business. The Ford factory's high-priced car, the "Lincoln Zephyr," has sold almost three times as many as it did a year ago. The number of retail deliveries in the current popular model year has reached more than 10,000. Therefore, the output of the Lincoln Zephyr by the end of March will increase significantly compared to 1936. (To be continued)

### A Record of the New York Trailer Exhibition

‚Äî Nie

Recently, automobile dealers from southern New York and Connecticut held a trailer exhibition in "Plainview," at the West Gishes County Center. This was the first of its kind in the New York area. All the products of the more famous automobile trailer manufacturing companies participated in the event. Several trailer manufacturers also displayed automobiles to show the coordination between their products and automobiles. These manufacturers were Cord, Duesenberg, Ford, Lincoln, Nash, Lafayette, Packard, Chrysler, and Plymouth.

The most distinctive feature of the various trailers displayed at the venue was the tight internal configuration. Everything that is indispensable in a modern household is fully equipped in the trailer. However, although there are many things, they still maintain their spacious and comfortable characteristics due to proper equipment.

The wardrobes and cooking utensils that ladies pay the most attention to are fully equipped in various trailers. Other items such as dining tables, lounge chairs, bookcases, dish racks, showers, and even bathtubs are all available. Most of the various devices in the car can be re-equipped according to the customer's wishes, as long as they have discussed it with the dealer in advance.

When planning this "mobile home," the manufacturers paid the most attention to refrigerators, water supply, hot water heaters, ventilation equipment, etc., because these things are indispensable in modern homes.

Among all the trailers on display, two were the most noticed by the audience. One was specially built by the Western Union Telegraph Company, with its interior designed as a relay station. In the event of an emergency, such as the recent flood in the Wahaihua area, it could be used as a telegraph relay station to prevent the interruption of telecommunications. The second was a trailer customized by Pastor Sullivan, which was to be used specifically for preaching in China in the future. The pastors who visited the venue were very interested in the equipment of this trailer, and many wanted to imitate it so that it could be used as a special vehicle for spreading the gospel in the countryside.

There was also a section in the venue dedicated to displaying "parts." Among them was a product of the New York Automatic Battery Charging Company. This machine can pump the water stored in the tank into the battery. The water in this tank can be used for 10,000 miles without refilling. Attached to this machine is a measuring table that shows the water level and the actual situation of the battery bottle. It is said that this charging device is very useful for trailer users.

The trailer exhibition lasted for a total of six days. During the exhibition, the number of visitors was very enthusiastic, estimated to be around 20,000. The manager of the venue was Mr. Nathol. According to him, it will be held again at the same location this fall, but the scale may be smaller.

The New York Trailer Exhibition had never been held before, so this was indeed the first time. In total, there were fourteen manufacturers or dealers participating in the exhibition, with a total of thirty-eight trailers. A total of forty-five trailers were sold on the spot in the venue, but many people, although they did not decide to buy, were very willing to buy one in their minds. All these accounts have been recorded by the dealers, who are preparing to ask salespersons to promote them. Therefore, everyone is very satisfied with the results of this exhibition.
