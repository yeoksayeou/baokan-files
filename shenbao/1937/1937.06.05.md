He believes that one must work hard while staying grounded, and staying grounded requires hard work. Staying grounded without working hard is hypocritical, and working hard without staying grounded is reckless. One must stay grounded and work hard, which is both calm and practical. In other words, one must be tough, quick, and pragmatic. He hopes that the press will also assist the local authorities with this spirit and strive for the construction of national culture. The so-called national culture includes three meanings: independence, self-strengthening, and self-defense. Promoting the inherent culture and catching up with modern culture is independence. Continuing to work hard, promoting and developing national culture, and establishing self-confidence is self-strengthening. Maintaining Chinese culture and defending against foreign cultural aggression is self-defense. One must possess the above three spirits before it can be called national culture. Finally, Fang Zhi specifically stated that this time he came to the north and felt that the local authorities and cultural circles in the north have been working together with the central government in the same spirit for several years and fighting hard, which he especially admires. In addition, he offered several opinions to the press in Beiping, mainly concerning the mission of reporters in peacetime and extraordinary times, and the relationship between newspapers and the nation-state. The gathering ended happily at 2:00 pm. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th)

### The Amendment of the Land Law and the Improvement of People's Livelihood

— Zhang Yinlin

The announcement of the "Principles for Amending the Land Law" in early May this year is a long-awaited message from many concerned people in recent years. It is the first sound of the relationship between the Principle of People's Livelihood and practical politics, and it is also the eternal problem of "restraining annexation" for more than two thousand years: seeing the light of day again. The determination of these principles should exhaust the wisdom of the whole country.

However, before reviewing these principles, there is one point we must pay attention to: there is a very long way to go from the amendment of the land law to the improvement of the lives of farmers. No matter how perfect a law is, it cannot guarantee its actual effectiveness. Let's take the old land law as an example. One of the key points of the old land law was to stipulate that the amount of land rent should not exceed 37.5 per thousand of the yield, which seems much milder than the provisions of the new principles. From our own observations and from reliable social survey reports, we know that land rent accounting for 50% to 60% of the yield is a common occurrence. However, since the promulgation of the old land law, has a single landlord reduced land rent because of it, or has a single tenant or government office forced the landlord to reduce land rent based on it? Speaking frankly, I am afraid that most of the readers of this article did not even know that such a provision existed before! Not to mention the farmers in remote rural areas? In terms of its reformist elements, the old land law is actually equivalent to waste paper. What guarantee is there that the new land law in the future will not have the same fate? What is the point of replacing old waste paper with new waste paper?

Any new law that involves a wide range (in terms of both spatial and social relations) and is far from the status quo will only take effect under one of the following two circumstances. First, the driving force behind the creation of the new law is the demand of the majority: there must first be a certain positive, vocal public opinion, and then the legislative body will follow it and formulate a new law. Second, although the new law is derived from a few "pioneering" and "benevolent administrators," it is based on an ideology that truly becomes the religion of the most politically active elements in the country: they support this ideology and all the laws it determines with the enthusiasm of a devout follower; they propagate this ideology and all the new laws it determines to the public with the insistent nagging of a missionary; they can truly go deep into the people to do the work of awakening the public; at the same time, the government also promotes the new law with swift and decisive measures.

At least in terms of the principles of the land law, does China currently have one of these two situations? For those who are not accustomed to flattering the times, this is self-evident. Then, isn't it too early to discuss those principles now? However, China's politics are indeed moving on track. Once politics are on track, one of these two situations or one of them must be created. Discussing the principles of legislation is to seek more concrete goals under abstract doctrines. Since we are determined to move forward, the goals must be determined in advance.

With this understanding, we can examine those new principles.

On the premise of abandoning the policy of confiscation, the twenty-three "Principles for Amending the Land Law," legally speaking, are generally acceptable. The most noteworthy of these is Article 11, "When the lessor of cultivated land is an absentee landlord, or the lessee continues to cultivate for more than five years, and the lessor is not a farmer or an elderly, weak, or widowed person who relies on the land for livelihood, the lessee may request the levy of his cultivated land according to law." In the land legislation of all "non-socialist countries," this is the most radical provision. It removes a major obstacle for tillers to "own their land," an obstacle that many countries have not yet overcome—that is, the landlord refuses to sell when the tenant wants to buy the land he cultivates. Furthermore, Principle 2 states, "The state may establish land banks and issue land bonds to implement land policies and adjust land distribution." This article seems to have the following intention: when a tenant farmer wants to acquire the land he cultivates but cannot afford to buy it, the government can use land bonds (entirely or partially) to levy the land he originally cultivated and transfer it to him free of charge, or transfer it to him for compensation and let him repay the land price in installments on a regular basis. This is the most effective way to promote tillers owning their land. If the principles do have such an intention, it is best to state it clearly.

Many people have already noticed that the principle does not adopt the provision of progressive land tax and believe that it is a major shortcoming. Judging from the "legal intention" expressed in these principles, the legislators do not seem to theoretically oppose progressive tax. They may be considering the difficulties of this method in China at present. These difficulties were previously pointed out by Mr. Wu Jingchao in "From Tenant to Self-Cultivating Farmer" (Tsinghua Journal, Volume 9, Issue 4). He said:

"Progressive tax cannot be implemented until we know how much land a person has."

"In a country where land is not registered, how can we know how much land a person has? Even if we enact laws to force registration (note: such provisions already exist in the Principles for Amending the Land Law), will the landlord not underreport? Will he not use the names of several people to register the land of one person? (Note: Article 8 of the Principles, "When the land owner is not the head of the family, the name of the head of the family should be noted in the land registration," is to prevent this malpractice.) If we want accurate registration, how many more officials will the government have to add, and how much disturbance will be caused among the people?"

We do not deny these difficulties. But here, the difficulty of implementation does not constitute a reason to oppose the adoption of progressive tax, because many of the methods stipulated in the principles also have difficulties in implementation, and perhaps even greater difficulties. For example, Principle 3.

(1) With reference to local conditions, stipulate the minimum area of cultivated land that a self-cultivating household should have and restrict its disposal, (2) Restrict the maximum amount of debt for self-cultivated land.

And Article 18

The declared land price shall be the legal land price. Before the declaration, the land administration authority shall first determine and announce the standard land price with reference to the land revenue and market price of the recent five years (note: naturally different in different places) as the basis for the declaration.

And Article 20

In special construction areas, when the land tax revenue increases more than the original amount due to the sharp increase in land prices, it may be approved to allocate the increased portion to compensate for the construction expenses of the project; the increment tax without transfer in such areas may be levied from the sixth year after the start of construction.

And Article 21

Within the actual amount of land appreciation, the labor and capital invested by the land owner for special improvement and the special expenses paid shall be deducted.

The determination of the facts required by these clauses is not more difficult and complicated than preventing the malpractice of "anonymous accounts" in land registration? Furthermore, can we abandon the Three People's Principles because it is difficult to realize them? Can we accept the doctrine of non-resistance because of the difficulty of resistance?

Perhaps some people will say that the implementation of these clauses is already difficult enough, so we cannot add the difficulty of progressive tax. Our answer is: Since the difficulties are equal, why should we choose?

There is no reason to remain silent on progressive tax in the principles.

The land law in the future should not only adopt a progressive tax system, but also use the progressive tax system to achieve the effect of "limiting the people's names and fields" advocated by our country's Confucian scholars throughout history. How can this be explained? We can take land price or area as the unit and set a limit; for the land property that exceeds this limit, levy a fairly high tax (even the entire rental income exceeding this limit can be levied), so that the net profit obtained by people whose names exceed this limit is equal to the name field just reaching this limit. In this way, the field will be limited without being limited. The level of this limit can measure the degree of "equality" of a society.

Whether the ideal of limiting fields can be realized in the land law or to what extent it can be realized depends on how the people who now hold the power of legislation feel about "lamenting the excessive and dividing the insufficient, balancing the objects and distributing them equally."

### French Banking Syndicate Banquets Kong Xiangxi, Praising Each Other's Energetic Efforts

French Four Major Banks Invest in Road Construction, China's Renaissance Can Benefit the World

[Paris] At noon today, the French Banking Syndicate for China hosted a banquet for Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, and his party. Mr. Jaland, the former Governor-General of French colonies and current Chairman of the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, delivered a speech on behalf of the entire China United Banking Syndicate. First of all, he expressed his gratitude for Minister Kong's gracious visit. He then stated that the purpose of the Banking Syndicate for China is to unite the four major French banks to promote financial cooperation with China with their strong capital. Judging from the agreement signed between the Syndicate and the China Construction Bank, it stems from the willingness of both China and France to cooperate, and does not hinder the freedom of investment of any other party. Moreover, China is now making energetic efforts, which can be seen from the modern spirit of China's leaders. General Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan of China, has created a situation of political stability, unification, and progress in China, and his achievements will be immortal. Vice President Kong assists Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in laying the foundation for China's financial institutions to be as stable as a rock. General Chiang Kai-shek calls him the most meritorious financial expert in Chinese history, which is well deserved. Now, your country's political economy is thriving, and industrial construction is booming. As for sincerity and good neighborliness, it is the traditional spirit of the relationship between China and France. This Syndicate seeks common prosperity with China in this spirit, rather than being preoccupied with profit. This should also be appreciated by the distinguished Chinese guests. At this point, Mr. Jaland raised his glass to wish Vice President Kong good health and to wish the Chinese government success in its construction, so that the French business community can also benefit from it.

Dr. Kong Xiangxi then delivered a reply speech, expressing his gratitude to the host, and expressing his admiration for Mr. Maspero, a famous sinologist, for translating Chinese. He said, "The mutual communication between Chinese and French cultures can be proved by this. China and France are both democratic countries in politics. The fact that I have received the warmest welcome from the leaders of the French government proves that the friendship between China and France comes from the bottom of our hearts." Vice President Kong then said that he was particularly grateful for the enthusiastic concern of the French financial leaders for the economic cooperation between China and France. China has been making efforts to move forward in recent years, and people from friendly countries have expressed their satisfaction and joy upon hearing this. China is now implementing a new construction plan as soon as possible under the guidance of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in order to develop its vast and incomparable natural resources, which will not only benefit China, but also benefit the whole world. According to the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, we welcome foreign cooperation to develop China's resources. As for France's assistance in completing our country's great construction projects, we are even more grateful." Vice President Kong continued to praise France's banking assistance to China's construction projects, saying that it combines insight and sincerity, and that this cooperation will not only benefit China and France, but also contribute to world peace. Finally, Vice President Kong mentioned the achievements of the French banking syndicate in assisting China's construction, among which the most prominent are: first, participating in the investment in the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, and the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway; and second, enabling close cooperation between French banks and the China Construction Bank and other institutions. All of these are praised by the Chinese people. "I sincerely hope that China and France will cooperate more closely in the future than in the past. I hereby reaffirm to you on behalf of the Chinese government that France's cooperation in China's economic construction is welcomed by China, and the Chinese government will be responsible for protecting the safety of French investment." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 4th)

[Paris] Mr. Jaland spoke in French, which was translated into Chinese by Mr. Maspero, a member of the Jinshi Cizhang Academy and a famous French sinologist. Dr. Kong Xiangxi replied in Chinese, which was translated into French by a secretary of the Chinese Embassy. According to the United Banking Syndicate, the Paris Netherlands Bank is the largest international business bank in France, with a capital of 300 million francs. The Banque de l'Indochine has a capital of 120 million francs. Lazard Brothers Bank is also one of the major banks in Paris and has a very close relationship with Lazard Brothers Bank in London and New York. As for the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, it was reorganized in 1922, with the Chinese government undertaking a part of the capital. The representative of the syndicate in China is the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, and its task is to study various financial and industrial businesses with the China Construction Bank and its other banks in the area. Recently, the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank signed a contract with the Chinese government to provide funds for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which has already started construction. The syndicate also recently reached an agreement in principle with the Chinese government to lend money to China for the construction of a railway from Guiyang to Kunming, so that Sichuan can be directly connected with French Vietnam after the completion of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway. The syndicate has now sent specialists to Shanghai to negotiate the final agreement with the Chinese authorities. The two sides are also negotiating on other financial and industrial cooperation issues. In addition, several French technicians are in China inspecting various industries, such as the sugar industry, the textile industry, and aircraft construction and repair factories.

### Hirota's Diplomacy Doesn't Forget Universal Harmony

The Three Principles Towards China are No Longer Applicable; Striving to Remove Diplomacy from Political Strife

[Tokyo] This morning, the Miyako Shimbun published an exclusive interview with the new Foreign Minister Hirota, in which he stated that his diplomatic policy would still be "Universal Harmony." Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, he believes that the previous Three Principles towards China were abstract expressions of the Sino-Japanese relationship at that time, and that if they were still adopted today, they would be inappropriate. This is because the Sino-Japanese relationship has already progressed from abstract principles to the stage of resolving practical problems. However, the resolution of these practical problems must absolutely exclude the interference of third countries and should be handled solely by the two countries. Regarding Japanese-Russian relations, Hirota said that the war crisis reported in the newspaper only once has now been mostly eliminated, and the future of resolving outstanding issues will soon show glimmers of hope. There is still hope for the future relationship between Japan and Russia. The immediate resolution of border issues is extremely difficult, and what is needed now is to gradually resolve the differences that are easily resolved. Regarding Anglo-Japanese relations, the new Foreign Minister expressed ignorance of the detailed content of the recent Anglo-Japanese talks, but firmly believes that the improvement of Anglo-Japanese relations can greatly help promote world peace. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota has long felt deeply that the implementation of diplomatic policy requires genuine unity between the government and the opposition, and cooperation to move forward. After the investiture ceremony yesterday, he revealed a part of his belief. At today's regular cabinet meeting, he reiterated the following important opinions and requested the understanding of the cabinet members, which was unanimously passed. Therefore, it will be officially implemented. The Foreign Minister's intention is that diplomacy should be placed outside the realm of political strife. Therefore, he will meet with representatives of both the political and civil parties to explain the fundamental principles of imperial diplomacy and seek their understanding. He will also take the same steps with the House of Peers and the financial community, and even intends to hold talks with friends in the Social Mass Party, which is in an anti-government position, who hold similar views, in order to achieve national unity and smoothly carry out diplomatic policies. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 5th)

[Tokyo] After yesterday's cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Kaya and Commerce and Industry Minister Yoshino made statements regarding the outline of the new cabinet's fiscal and economic policies, stating that the three ministers, Konoe, Yoshino, and Kaya, discussed fiscal and economic policies at the cabinet formation headquarters on the morning of the 4th. It is expected that these issues will become more concrete in the future. We intend to focus on the following three points as the focus of fiscal and economic policies:

㊀ Concrete measures for balancing international payments, that is, to establish concrete policies to maintain the average state of international payments.

㊁ Concrete measures to expand productive capacity.

㊂ To gain insight into the future of the supply and demand of materials and their regulation.

These three key points are the basis for the preparation of next year's budget and economic policies. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 5th)

### Roosevelt Denies Changing Gold Purchase Policy

Frenzied Gold Bar Sales in London; Gold Prices Showed a Rebound Trend Yesterday

[Washington] President Roosevelt firmly stated today that the US government will not change its gold purchase policy and is not concerned about the drop in gold prices in the London market. He also said that he had not heard of any rumors that Britain, the United States, and France would announce the maintenance of uniform gold prices. Treasury officials also said that there is no need to worry about the reduction of gold reserves in London, as this is a natural phenomenon of economic recovery. (National Telegram, 4th)

[London] Today, gold hoarders rushed to sell, their condition was frantic. The number of transactions reached 1,493 bars worth £4.2 million. Except for 250 bars purchased by merchants to arbitrage to New York, the rest were absorbed by the authorities. At the time of settlement, one seller wanted to sell 1,500 bars, but later, due to such a large quantity, it was feared that it would not be possible to deliver within one day, so the sale did not materialize. The panic in the gold market can be seen from this. Today's gold price is seven and a half pence lower than the US parity, but sellers are still not decreasing, and they are dividing the money they have sold to purchase US dollars and British pounds, fearing that a monetary statement will be issued at the end of this week. After the settlement, the mood improved and there were some buyers. The fact that the Exchange Equalisation Account has been consistently buying huge amounts of gold has slightly reduced the panic that gold prices may fall again. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 4th)

[London] In recent days, a large amount of gold has been sold off in the London market. By yesterday, the total amount had reached a staggering £4,200,000, breaking all records. Apart from the British Exchange Equalisation Fund, which purchased approximately £3,400,000, the remainder was purchased by the US Federal Reserve Bank. The transaction price was 140 shillings and 5 pence per ounce, a decrease of 4 pence compared to the previous day. Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the US government will lower the purchase price of gold. Although President Roosevelt has repeatedly denied this, those who hoard gold everywhere are still selling it off in droves. The reason for this is that sellers believe that the price of raw materials in the United States has risen excessively, and the US government will inevitably raise the value of the US dollar to offset this. In addition, the amount of gold produced by the Soviet Union and sold to the world market in recent years has increased sharply, and its total is only second to the Union of South Africa. All of these are reasons for the decline in gold prices. Regarding this, many British dignitaries have issued statements to stabilize people's hearts. According to private sources, the South African Reserve Bank has also stated that it is willing to purchase gold produced there at a minimum price of 140 shillings per ounce. President Roosevelt has also stated that there will be no change in the current gold policy. Therefore, London bankers believe that the selling trend in the market can be curbed from now on, and British financial circles also believe that most of the gold hoarded by private individuals has been sold off, and the selling trend can be slightly reduced, and gold prices should rebound accordingly, and the difference between the London market price and the purchase price of the US Treasury should also be reduced accordingly. Then, the prices of major commodities, which have a great impact on mutual trade between agricultural and industrial countries, should also return to stability with the stabilization of gold prices.

### Initial Military Liaison Between Germany and Italy

Staff Officers Exchange Opinions Regularly; Saying No Treaty Concluded Under the Pretext of Anti-Communism

[Rome] Well-informed sources here recently announced that as a result of talks between German Defense Minister General von Blomberg and Italian Chief of Staff General Medolaghi, the staff departments of Italy and Germany will regularly exchange opinions in order to cooperate with each other militarily. However, this does not constitute a real military alliance treaty. Cooperation means that both parties do not accept mechanically binding obligations. People here generally believe that regarding the European situation, although there is no need to conclude a military alliance treaty when Britain and France have the possibility of accepting the views of each country, General von Blomberg's visit to Italy is still a warning to Britain and France. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

[London] The semi-official Italian newspaper in Rome recently mentioned a defensive understanding between Germany and Italy, leading to speculation that a new defensive alliance has been concluded. According to reliable sources in Rome, the Italian newspaper's so-called defensive understanding between Germany and Italy does not mean that any new progress has been made since German Defense Minister von Blomberg arrived in Rome, but refers to the existing German-Italian axis. Because this axis contains a defensive meaning, especially in the common defense against communism. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)

[Rome] Authoritative sources here strongly deny the reports from foreign news agencies that German Defense Minister General von Blomberg has concluded a military defensive alliance with the Italian government during his visit to Italy, pointing out that this rumor is entirely fictitious.

[Berlin] Official sources here expressed surprise at the reports in London newspapers that German Defense Minister General von Blomberg had concluded a military pact with the Italian government in Rome, calling the reports completely unfounded. The government announced a few days ago that German Defense Minister's visit to Italy would not result in any treaties, and that German foreign policy has always been based on the open declarations of the Führer Hitler, which fundamentally oppose any military alliance.

### British Empire Conference Discusses League of Nations

Eden Explains British Policy

[London] The British Empire Conference opened this morning to discuss the reorganization of the League of Nations. British Foreign Secretary Eden attended and explained that the League of Nations is currently weak and ineffective, and the failure to deal with the Abyssinian issue was due to the League of Nations itself being weaker. However, at present, it is not necessary to adopt any suggestions to strengthen the League of Nations, which must wait until Britain has completed its entire defense plan. The representative of New Zealand originally advocated that the League of Nations should implement automatic and mechanical sanctions against aggressor countries, but was deeply impressed by the various facts listed by Eden and no longer insisted on his original proposal. Finally, the entire Empire Conference agreed that the reorganization of the League of Nations should be carried out when the time is favorable, and that the League of Nations should maintain the status quo for the time being. It is reported that after the Empire Conference discussed the issue of the League of Nations today, the debate on the Empire's foreign policy has ended, and the work of the conference committees has also ended today. Therefore, the Empire Conference has been scheduled to close on the 15th of this month. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Spain Issue: France and Germany Respond to Britain

Both Put Forward a Number of Reservations; German Ambassador to Britain Returns Home

[London] Regarding the safety guarantee of warships belonging to participating countries in the Spanish waters surveillance operation, France and Germany have issued replies to the suggestions put forward by the British government, and they were delivered to the British Foreign Office this morning. It is reported that although the German reply contains a number of reservations, the negotiating doors are not blocked as a result, and it can be considered smooth on the whole. As for the French reply, in addition to expressing its approval, it also put forward a number of suggestions to revise the original British proposal. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

[London] German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop is scheduled to return home by plane this afternoon to discuss the Spanish waters safety guarantee issue with the relevant authorities of the German Foreign Ministry. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

[Berlin] The British government has put forward to the countries concerned methods to prevent surveillance ships in Spanish waters from being attacked again, advocating that ㊀ both sides in Spain should expand the safe areas for surveillance ships, and ㊁ if the safety of surveillance ships is violated, the naval commanders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy should consult each other to determine appropriate action. The above proposal will probably have to wait a few days before a concrete reply can be obtained. This is only the basis for discussion. It is not guaranteed that general agreement can be obtained until after negotiations. It is heard that Germany and Italy are eager to restore cooperation as soon as possible, so Rome and Berlin are closely studying the British proposal in this sense. What is still uncertain is the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union suspects that the second point of the above proposal is too accommodating to Germany's position. It is heard that the British Foreign Secretary Eden and the German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop have met in London to discuss the proposal together. There is also a suggestion under consideration, that surveillance ships should have common and clear signs that can be clearly identified by the sky and the sea, so as to avoid accidental dangers. It is heard that the British Navy has been asked to make suggestions on how to mark them. The British warships sailing to Spanish waters have always painted huge red, white and blue colors on the turrets and other prominent positions. German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop may arrive in Berlin today to participate in the discussion of the British proposal. According to responsible sources in Berlin, Germany has adopted a friendly and sympathetic attitude towards this proposal. German newspapers criticize it, saying that Germany is unwilling to take risks. One newspaper said that the proposal regarding the naval staff meeting may be useful in the event of an accident, but if a German warship is attacked by a Red Party plane, the German warship commander certainly cannot wait until the meeting before resisting. This statement can represent the general opinion in Germany. At the same time, the Italian government is studying the British proposal. It is heard that Germany and Italy will consult with each other before replying. It has been reported that Italy has rejected the British plan, which has been denied by Italian sources. In addition, Soviet sources claimed that the Soviet Union intends to raise the issue of the German warship shelling the Spanish port of Almeria at the meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee, and believes that Germany has violated international law and acted arbitrarily to retaliate against the Spanish government, and should not be satisfied. In addition, the proposal to impose "sanctions" on the Spanish Republican government if similar incidents occur in the future is even more likely to collapse the entire system of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, which is unacceptable to the Soviet Union. According to reports, Britain and France do not advocate imposing "sanctions" on the Spanish government, but also do not want to submit the Almeria port issue to the Adjustment Committee for discussion, because if the Adjustment Committee condemns Germany's attitude, the result may inevitably lead to the failure of various negotiations. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 4th)

[Berlin] Regarding the safety guarantee of Spanish sea surveillance warships, people in political circles here did not give a good evaluation, and all believed that this method was not thorough, and the guarantees proposed were also insufficient. For the sake of normal defense rights, Germany has dispatched many warships, the number of which is more than double that required for the surveillance operation. As for the British proposal to establish a safe area, although it is possible to implement it, the guarantee must still be provided by both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, thus causing difficulties in principle. Although Germany is prepared to accept the promises that can be provided by the Spanish National Army, the promises that can be made by the Valencia Red government cannot be trusted by Germany. The British also advocate that surveillance ship commanders should consult each other in the event of an incident, which is impossible in practice and hinders the freedom of action and legitimate defense rights of the countries concerned. Therefore, diplomatic circles here believe that it is not yet known when the London Adjustment Committee can resume work after Germany and Italy announced their withdrawal, and there are also hidden concerns about the tensions that may be caused internationally by the current situation. In the German newspapers, it seems that they have been ordered to stimulate public opinion and are engaged in sensationalism. It is not yet known what the goal of this move is, but the German semi-official side is trying to avoid panic and said that Foreign Minister Neurath is planning to visit the Balkans, which shows that the situation will not Zhao be serious. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

[Paris] According to responsible sources, the French view on guaranteeing the safety of warships participating in the surveillance operation can be divided into the following: ㊀ safe areas should be designated in various Spanish ports, ㊁ the international surveillance system should be expanded to the extent possible, and ㊂ combat personnel from various countries currently in Spain should be withdrawn. Regarding the above points, the opinions of Britain and France are completely consistent. British Foreign Secretary Eden is currently negotiating with the governments of the countries concerned to get them to accept the opinions of Britain and France. As for expanding the surveillance system, responsible sources believe that the naval fleets of the 23 countries attending the Adjustment Committee should cooperate, especially the neutral countries, and they should be ordered to participate in sea surveillance, or to order neutral inspectors to carry out inspections on the warships of the countries implementing surveillance. If something happens, before disciplinary action is taken, the participating countries must first consult with each other. As for the German request that participating countries automatically implement collective disciplinary measures, France opposes this, believing that even if disciplinary action is necessary, it should be carried out gradually. The first step should be to issue a warning, and the second step is to demand compensation for damages. As for any violent action, it should be avoided as much as possible. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 4th)

[Moscow] People in political circles here recently expressed their opinion that the German warship shelling the port of Almeria a few days ago caused the work of the London Adjustment Committee to fail. However, the Soviet Union does not intend to withdraw from the Adjustment Committee at present. The Soviet government is not only unwilling to take isolated action on the Spanish issue, but should cooperate closely with Britain and France as much as possible.

### Leningrad to Build Children's Port

[Moscow] A children's port will be built in Leningrad this year. The purpose is to promote children's research on maritime traffic and the development of water sports. The port will be built on the scenic Kirov Islands. The island is bordered by the Gulf of Finland to the west, the Neva River to the south, and the Nevka River to the north. A 280-meter-long dyke will be built between the port and the Gulf of Finland. The port will have a lighthouse, a floating light, and two guiding lights to indicate the course of ships. A yacht club will be built next to the embankment, with a beautiful small waiting pavilion, an open-air corridor, and a reading room. A children's radio station and a marine museum will be built on the shore. In addition, it is planned to build a machine factory, a woodworking factory, and a factory building for building and repairing children's boats. A rescue organization will also be established in the port. The entire port and ships will be managed by children themselves. In summer, all children's captains, sailors, ticket inspectors, and cashiers can play as much as they want and do water sports. This port was successfully designed by the Leningrad Juvenile Camp inviting the Central Water Transport Research Program. (TASS Communication)

### The Qingshan Case in Shantou is Under Investigation

Qingshan Pretends to be Injured: Japanese Consul Files Second Protest, Chinese Side Agrees on Response

Shantou Correspondence: Following the incident of Japanese national Qingshan Qing assaulting a policeman in Shantou, Rear Admiral Okuma of the Taiwanese Navy led four warships, the "Yubari," "Fuyo," "Uzutuki," and "Asagao," to Shantou, where they are still anchored. On May 26th, the Japanese consul lodged a counter-protest with the municipal government, falsely claiming that Qingshan was also injured and making various unreasonable demands. On that day, Qingshan indeed pretended to be injured, bandaging his fist with white cloth and slowly being pulled in a rickshaw to the Japanese-run Bo'ai Hospital. After a sham treatment, he was slowly pulled back to his residence in a rickshaw. Currently, the Yubari warship has returned to report everything to Okuma. On the 27th, Japanese Consul Seichi Yamazaki, upon learning that Shantou Mayor Huang Bingxun had returned to Shantou from the province, went to the municipal government with his secretary Obata at 4 PM, under Okuma's orders, to lodge a second counter-protest. He avoided discussing Qingshan's assault on the police officer, only claiming that Qingshan was injured and wrongfully detained by the police, accusing the Chinese side of violating treaties by entering the residence of a registered citizen and demanding compensation, apologies, guarantees, and punishment of the police officers. The municipal government presented Qingshan's confession at the police station as evidence, stating that he was acting on consular orders and did not need to report entry and exit permits. Municipal government advisor Huang Jing cited Japanese law, the Japanese household registration law, and the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty, which stated "foreign nationals' freedom of residence and business in treaty ports," engaging in a lengthy debate with Yamazaki. Ultimately, facts spoke louder than words, and Yamazaki could only stare blankly, leaving sullenly after 5 PM.

Zhang Yuannan, sent by the provincial government to Shantou to investigate, and Wu Wenxian, sent by the Fourth Route Army, arrived in Shantou by plane around 10 AM on the 27th. On the 28th, Ling Shifen, secretary of the diplomatic commissioner's office, and Yoshiyuke Sadaji, the Japanese vice-consul stationed in Guangzhou, also flew to Shantou. Both sides jointly investigated the truth of the case. The situation has since become more moderate. In the morning of the same day, Wu Wenxian and Zhang Yuannan first returned to the province by plane. Before leaving, they had another close discussion with Ling Shifen, Division Commander Li Hanhun, Administrative Commissioner Hu Mingzao, Mayor Huang Bingxun, Public Security Bureau Chief Xue Hanguang, Municipal Government Advisor Huang Jing, and others. They determined that it was impossible to accept the Japanese side's protest. If the Japanese side had the sincerity to resolve the matter peacefully, they could first withdraw the Japanese warships stationed in Shantou. The Chinese side could make slight concessions to accommodate the situation, but if the Japanese side insisted on unreasonable demands, the Chinese side would spare no sacrifice to maintain territorial sovereignty. With the response policy set, Wu and Zhang flew back to the province around 3 PM to report and submit various important pictures and documents to the Fourth Route Army and the provincial government. On the 29th, Ling Shifen and Yoshiyuke Sadaji jointly went to the site of the incident at the Shenzhen Foreign Company to investigate. However, it was heard that the Japanese warship side was extremely stubborn, and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also respected the opinion of the Japanese warship, taking it as the basis for negotiation. The second counter-protest filed by the Japanese consul was prompted by the Japanese warship. Therefore, the future of this case is not easy to be optimistic about.

### Japanese Plan to Develop Asbestos Mines in Northeast China

Intending to Use Asbestos Board as a Substitute for Iron Plate to Supplement Military Industrial Needs of Various Factories

Shenyang Correspondence: Due to the expansion of military preparations in Japan, the military industry has expanded, and the price of iron plates has soared. As a result, the sales of asbestos boards, a substitute, have recently been booming. In terms of quantity, it has doubled compared to last year. However, Japan has no domestic production of asbestos and must rely on imports from abroad. Japan believes that the Northeast has abundant asbestos mineral resources, so it plans to establish an asbestos mining association to supply the needs of mainland Japan. According to Japanese investigations, asbestos is produced in Rehe and the Eastern Border Road, with Tonghua and Ji'an counties being the center. Nearby, there are extremely rich asbestos veins scattered throughout the region. There are now more than 30 mining areas that have been surveyed and approved by the Japanese for mining. According to the Japanese, this is due to the expansion of heavy industry in mainland Japan and the implementation of the five-year industrial plan in the Northeast, which has attracted the attention of Japanese financial groups and all walks of life. Moreover, regarding the mining of asbestos, some influential figures in the Japanese financial circles in Shenyang have recently acted as initiators. The first phase of the plan has a capital of 500,000 yuan, and the "Manzhou" Asbestos Industry Corporation will be established. The company has purchased 3,000 ping of land in Tiexi, Shenyang, and has begun to build a factory. The company's integrated operation of asbestos mining and processing will not only supply its use to various factories in mainland Japan, but also plans to use this unlimited raw material for consumption by various factories in Japan in the Northeast. The Kwantung Army is extremely supportive and also stated that the association is centered in Osaka, Japan, with more than ten asbestos associations designated by the Navy participating. In addition, the Osaka Naval Supervisory Office stated that the establishment of this type of association is indeed the first time. In the future, it will gather designated asbestos operators in the Kansai region, encourage them to mine asbestos raw materials in the Northeast, and cooperate with other Japanese asbestos operators in the Northeast. The implementation of this matter is currently being planned.

### Kunshan

A Case of Adultery Leading to Murder

Chen Jinyuan, a resident of Tianfu'an in the first district of the county, was over thirty years old. His wife had an affair with Chen Youkuan, a nearby farmer. One night at around 9 PM, Jinyuan caught them in the act. Unexpectedly, the adulterer became enraged out of shame and strangled Jinyuan. Before long, Jinyuan died. Afterwards, the body was thrown into the river in an attempt to cover up the crime. On the morning of the 4th, it was discovered and reported to the police, who arrested the murderer and telegraphed the county government to send someone to examine the body.

### Songjiang

Civil Servants Provide Labor Service

This county's civil servants will continue to provide labor services this year by dredging the Zhongshan Park river. At 9 AM on the 5th, more than 600 people from various party, government, academic, and military organizations gathered at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall for the commencement ceremony. At around 10 AM, dredging began at the designated locations, and it is expected to be completed in three days, on the 7th.

### Wuxi

An Abnormal Gathering of Snakes in Yandai

Since the beginning of summer, the weather in the county has been warm, and hibernating insects have emerged to be active. Yesterday, in the vicinity of the Yandai area of the fifth district, in the river near Beitou Village, a swarm of about several thousand snakes was discovered. Among them, the black wind snake was the most numerous. The crowd moved and swam together, making a whooshing sound, and the weeds on the shore were shaken. Villagers in nearby villages went to watch. The snakes were then scattered by children throwing mud. According to local farmers, this is a sign of a major flood this year.

The Hasty Expansion of Streets and Demolition of City Walls

Since the county construction committee passed the proposal to widen the streets inside and outside the north gate, the Construction Bureau decided that from the 20th of this month, businesses would voluntarily demolish and cede their land within a month. All the Yuecheng at the north gate and the suspension bridge and Cangqiao north of Lianrong Bridge will also be demolished and rebuilt at the same time. Subsequently, some merchants appealed to the Construction Bureau to postpone the widening, but the Construction Bureau could not approve it because the construction matters were decided by the Construction Committee. Director Zhang specifically instructed each department to step up its work as the construction period approached. On the 4th, a group of engineers went to the area inside the north gate to conduct surveys and set up a central stake, notifying all the businesses to be demolished to demolish and cede their land within a time limit.

### Changshu

The Lace Industry Suffers Another Decline

Farmers in the eastern villages of this county have traditionally relied on lace-making as their only side business. As a result, there are many lace factories in Meili, Huxiang, and other places in the eastern villages. In the autumn and winter of last year, sales to foreign firms were profitable. As a result, those engaged in lace-making this spring were like bamboo shoots after rain. Unexpectedly, sales have been sluggish recently, leading to a daily drop in wages. Previously, prices were calculated by the piece, but now they are calculated by the thread (with a prescribed length). The highest price is only four li per thread, and it has now fallen to less than two li, so the daily income of female workers cannot even sustain their lives, and the operators are still suffering huge losses. They now hope that the situation will turn around in the autumn, otherwise, they will all shut down, and the side business of female farmers will be greatly affected.

### Changzhou

Cocoon Prices Continue to Rise

The cocoon markets in the four rural townships of Wuyi have been open for three or four days, and the supply of goods is gradually increasing. Due to the competitive buying, prices continue to rise. The highest prices in places such as Lijiaqiao, Banshang, Donghenglin, and Mahangqiao have reached 60 yuan per dan or 57 to 58 yuan. However, the cocoon markets in the southern towns such as Hutangqiao, Niutangqiao, Chenduqiao, and Yayiura are still priced at around 50 yuan. Farmers are still waiting and watching for a good price to sell, so the daily receipts of each cocoon market are mostly around 100 dan, and the fewer ones are only 50 to 60 dan. This year's spring cocoon market may need to be extended before the market can be closed.

### Yangzhou

Factories Face Shutdown Due to Coal Shortage

The bituminous coal sold by Jiangdu Coal Company, which is usually shipped from Shandong, sells for only 34 yuan per ton and is used exclusively by factories making glass, lampshades, and the like. However, it suddenly ran out of stock. Although the price has risen to 44 yuan per ton, there is still no supply. Factories are in a panic. If there is still no supply in two or three days, they will be forced to shut down.

Expansion of the Improved Area's Jurisdiction

The agricultural and forestry businesses run by the Jiangdu Agricultural Promotion Section have been merged into the Sericulture Improvement Area since the 26th year. The provincial government has already notified the relevant authorities and ordered Yang Rengong, the director and instructor of the area, to liaise with Xu Shuling, the director of the section, to handle the handover matters in order to merge on schedule. It is also heard that from the 26th year onwards, all the cooperative instructors and weights and measures instructors attached to the Construction Bureau's office have also been ordered to be merged into the Sericulture Improvement Area.

### Nantong

Searching and Eliminating Locust Nymphs in the Nantong Area

Due to the lack of snow last year, locust nymphs have been discovered in various counties under Nantong's jurisdiction. The commissioner specifically ordered the county magistrates to supervise the district and township chiefs to urgently search for and eliminate them. Because the discovery was early, the progress is quite smooth.

Arrest of Robbers and Rapists

Recently, robberies and rapes have occurred in the Yanzaogang area of Nantong. The police team has arrested the bandit, surnamed Lu, named Daorong, who has been identified by the victimized women, Xu Gu Shi, and others.

### Hangzhou

The Guanyintang Dam Starts Construction

The Guanyintang outside Qintai Dou in Hangzhou has been gradually showing signs of danger due to the impact of the Qiantang River's massive tides. With the approval of the provincial government, the Construction Department allocated 48,000 yuan to build a waterside dam to resist the force of the water. The project is currently being contracted by Shao Mei Ji. Construction began on the 4th. He Zhitai, director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, made a special trip to inspect and instruct everything.

### Yuyao

Regulations for Yao Salt Private Boards

The Liangzhe Salt Affairs Bureau previously reorganized the field production to seek a balance between production and sales and investigated the Yao field private boards, totaling more than 122,000 pieces. However, if they were all sealed, it would cut off the livelihoods of the salt farmers. In order to sympathize with the salt farmers, it was decided to retain more than 70,000 pieces and seal the rest. It was also stipulated that the amount of salt on the private boards would be purchased by the Wuhe and Minsheng refined salt companies.

### Ningbo

Extension of Deposit Declaration Period

The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Zhejiang Office of the Income Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, stating that there may be unclear declaration procedures or misreporting of deposits by stores, so the deadline for supplementary declarations is extended to the end of June. If the declaration is not made after the deadline, it will be handled according to law. The Chamber of Commerce has notified all its affiliated public stores to check.

### Gleanings from the Yunnan Trip (23)

— 桮捲 (Name)

Hengyang City is prosperous. Four or five-story buildings stand in rows. The main street stretches for ten miles. The Yuehan Railway Station is on the left bank of the Xiang River. The county has a population of 1,360,000 people (surveyed in the 23rd year, now it should be higher). More than 10,000 people from the team lined up to welcome us. More than 10,000 male and female students from primary and secondary schools also participated in the procession. Hengyang has a strong literary style. There are as many as six middle schools. Ms. Wan Heng, a graduate of Peking University Women's College, has great attainments in national studies. She has been the head of Hengyang Girls' High School for three years and is also one of the receptionists today. We all entered the library behind the county government office as our accommodation. The county government office is Wu Sangui's former palace. The flowers and trees in the Tanlin Garden are excellent. All sectors also use the Shengping Theater as the venue for the welcome party. There is a banquet, a drama, and a fundraising event. Kunqu opera and martial arts are all available. After Security Commander Wang delivered a speech, Regiment Commander Chu thanked him and temporarily bid farewell to the entire group, saying that he had to deal with the preparatory affairs for the National Assembly. A telegram urged him to return. The southern comrades of this group took Hengyang as the end point. Therefore, I will go straight to Hankou tonight and not participate in the Nanyue tour, because Chairman He Yunqiao has arrived in Nanyue to wait. Everyone can go there. He also said that he was very grateful to everyone for their companionship and cooperation along the way to complete the entire journey. I have already called Chairman He and will go straight to Wuchang tonight. At that time, He Sui Lv Hongqi and other ten people crossed the river with Chu to the Yuehan Station, while the rest returned to the Hengyang Library.

After we arrived in Lingling (Yongzhou) in Xiang Province, Zhou Fengjiu, director of the Xiang Highway Bureau, and engineer Ouyang Jinghuan (Ouyang was originally one of the group members) guided us very thoughtfully. Zhou is proficient in English and German and handles things honestly. Therefore, the highways in Xiang Province are the best in the provinces. Ouyang adheres to the principle of only doing things and not talking about them. The two complement each other.

On the 50th day (May 24), in the morning, we left Hengyang and traveled 60 kilometers to Nanyue City. We rested at the China Travel Agency. Ouyang and Peng, the magistrate of Hengshan County, had prepared 40 sedan chairs in advance and lined up on the highway. The group first had a meal at the Travel Agency. Mr. Jiang Baili's secretary came to see us, saying that Mr. Jiang and Dr. "Stefani" also stayed here last night and have gone up the mountain. They will return at 3 PM and then go to Hengyang, taking the Yuehan car to Guangzhou that night. I was afraid that we would not meet, so I left a note to greet Mr. Jiang. After the meal, we first passed Nanyue City, which is one and a half miles long. We went to the Nanyue Temple and entered the Kuixing Pavilion. Wang Yansong took a photo. Then we entered the Jiaying Gate and the Royal Book Building to the main hall, which is the "Holy Emperor Hall." The hall enshrines "Chong Heihu," a character from the Investiture of the Gods. The temple is managed by Taoist priests. The incense is very prosperous. The buildings are all stone pillars, which are quite magnificent. The environment of the temple can be found in the Nanyue Guide, Nanyue Travel Notes, Nanyue Tour Guide, etc., which are already eight or nine kinds, so there is no need to describe it again. We left the temple and went up the mountain to "Luosi Pond," which has a waterfall, which is better looking after the rain. We went up again to "Huayan Lake," which is a dam 25 zhang high made of stone between the two mountains to block the upstream stream. The fields above the dam are irrigated, and the water flows slowly below the dam, maintaining the long flow of the waterfall. This is a relatively famous new construction in Nanyue. We went up again to the Halfway Temple. We met Stefani who was getting on the sedan chair. Mr. Jiang Baili had also just boarded the sedan chair. We stood and talked for a few words at the temple gate. We saw Chairman He Yunqiao adjusting the long-lasting rain to clear weather. Everyone's travel luck is very good. There is also a China Travel Agency reception center under the temple. When we arrived in Nanyue, we only saw small woods near this Halfway Temple. The rest was bare. The granite geology makes it difficult to store water, and afforestation is not easy. We went up again and passed "Li Mi's Academy" and walked another three miles to "Iron Buddha Temple." The Buddha weighs more than 600 jin. We went up again to "Danxia Temple" and "Xiangnan Temple" (with Wenshu Cave), and then six miles to "South Heaven Gate." The horizontal elevation is 1,046 meters. The height recorded in the guide is 860 meters, which refers to the height above Nanyue City. Nanyue City itself is already 180 meters above sea level.) Looking south from the South Heaven Gate, the Xiang River flows nine times, like five rivers, rushing towards Nanyue. We saw countless fields interspersed with small mountains, red and green intermingled, which was very beautiful. The fields are rice paddies, a vast expanse of water. The mountains are all red sand, interspersed with green grass, so they complement each other. We went up again and passed "Lion Rock" and "Shuaiwu Pavilion" to "Shangfeng Temple." The temple halls and corridors are completely "iron tiles" and "stone walls." Above the South Heaven Gate, it is already a plateau climate with strong winds all day long. The temperature is 20 degrees different from the bottom of the mountain. Everyone put on extra coats. There are few trees near Shangfeng Temple, all of which are old plantings (very few new plantings have grown). The horizontal elevation is 1,210 meters. Wang Huaizhong brought a barometer, so the inspection was extremely accurate. After entering the temple, floating clouds were dense. Before long, it rained for half an hour. After the rain, there was wind again. All the mountains in sight were covered by clouds and mist, looking like a sea. This is the so-called sea of clouds. The temple governs more than 20 temples throughout the mountain, with more than 750 monks. The abbot, Baosheng, is good at general affairs. All personnel issues are respected by all parties. The main teacher, Kong Ye, is well-versed in the classics and is respected by the monks. The two are one, so they maintain this temple business without decay. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people come to the top of the mountain to worship, so the incense is strong and the temple looks brand new. After our dinner, the sky was clear. Baosheng came to invite us, saying that it is rare to see the sea of clouds today, so everyone can go out and watch. We saw that the mountains in front of us were filled with clouds. The higher peaks were exposed outside the clouds, making it difficult to distinguish the heights. At sunset, the red clouds covered the sky, and the clouds in front and behind the mountains were red and white, which was a great sight. We walked about two miles to "Zhurong Peak," which is the highest point of Nanyue. It is dedicated to Zhurong. The south belongs to fire, and the inscriptions on the steles and plaques all subtly cut the "fire" character and the "Li" hexagram, which are mostly old sayings. The height of Zhurong Temple is 1,260 meters. Behind it is the She Shen Rock, a cliff that is hundreds of meters steep. I have climbed Mount Tai, which is 1,000 meters high, and Mount Lu, which is 1,200 meters high. I have also been to Mount Huang, which is 1,400 meters high. Now Nanyue is 1,260 meters high, which is higher than Mount Tai and Mount Lu, but lower than Mount Huang. The people who designated the Five Mountains did not include Mount Huang back then, probably because people at that time had not been to Mount Huang. It is also true that some of my comrades felt sorry for Mount Huang. The vegetables in the temple are very good. In particular, Kong Ye's lecture for an hour that night washed away the worries of those who had been on the long march, and everyone was very happy.

On the 51st day (May 25), before dawn, Baosheng made an agreement to ring the bell as a signal and went to "Wangri Platform" together to watch the sunrise. The platform was built by former Chairman Zou Zhang Yuejun with a donation of 1,000 yuan. It is all stone and higher than Shangfeng Temple and lower than Zhurong Peak. It is another mountain peak. The view from the platform is empty in all directions. Facing east, it is the widest viewing point in the entire mountain. But this morning there was a strong wind, and the clouds and smoke were obscured. We could hardly see our fingers. Baosheng comforted everyone, saying that the weather on this mountain is changing rapidly, and the clouds and smoke will disappear in an instant. If we stop for a moment, the environment will definitely change. But everyone waited for an hour and a half, and the sunlight had already been revealed between the three poles. So we knew that the time of the first sun had passed, and we were very disappointed. The monks and I had to make another appointment later, cleaned up our luggage, and descended the mountain by bridge. We passed Fuyan Temple, which has one jade Buddha, two bronze Buddhas, and objects from the Six Dynasties. We went to Nantai Temple, where Wang Kaiyun's inscription "Origin of the Japanese Taoist Scriptures" is located. There are also 32 "Bodhi Tree Leaves" with colorful figures painted on them, which are very elaborate. The era is unknown. They are now hanging on the wall of the back building, which is truly ancient art. Nantai Temple has a convenient road to Mijingtai, Chairman He Yunqiao's villa. The villa is in a mountain depression, not far from Halfway Temple. Below are Magu and Guanyin, two bridges to connect the stream. The villa is surrounded by pine and cypress forests, and the roof is covered with glazed tiles. Stefani and Jiang Baili stayed here last night. There are many villas nearby, mostly built by the leaders of the military circles of Hunan Province. The whole mountain is quieter there. Nanyue has few trees, and it is rare to find this place. We went down again to the Bible School, which was run by Christianity. Before Nanyue began to be equipped, Chinese and foreigners all used the Bible School as a place to live. It still maintains its original scale, with two levels of schools and several foreign teachers in charge. After going down the mountain, we took a sedan chair and a car to Nanyue City, traveled 148 kilometers, and arrived in Changsha. On the way, we heard that we passed Heishen Ferry, Zhonglu Town, and Su Yi River to cross the Xiang River (the river is more than 500 meters wide) to the border of Xiangtan County. Many new factories have been built along the way, and many places seem to be future heavy industrial areas. Unfortunately, the speeding car flashed by, and there was no recognition. We went east to Yijiawan, where the highway is parallel to the Yuehan Road.

### People from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Jointly Initiate the Establishment of a Factory to Manufacture Artificial Silk

A Meeting Was Held Yesterday to Appoint Committee Members to Form a Research Association and Designate a Convener to Recruit Technical Personnel

The artificial silk industry associations of the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai believe that artificial silk has been invented for more than 50 years, but our country has not yet manufactured it independently. The annual import volume is about millions of boxes, which is a significant loss. Therefore, they jointly initiated the establishment of a remote silk factory. A joint meeting of the industry associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai was held yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Shanghai Artificial Silk Industry Association at Chongrang Lane, Fuzhou Road. More than 50 people attended, and Pei Yuanding, Kang Xitao, Sun Zhongshu, Mo Jingyong, Zhou Wenjun, and others were elected as the provisional presidium.

After the meeting, Chairman Pei Yuanding first reported the significance of establishing an artificial silk factory, saying that recently, Chinese people have initiated the organization of artificial silk factories. Two factories, Huadong and Zhongque, have been established, and Guangdong also has plans to initiate the establishment of a factory. In the past, our industry has operated with an annual import of about one million boxes, and we have considerable experience in identifying quality and promoting sales. However, for the sake of domestic products in the future, we must seek a fundamental solution for the industry, which is to concentrate our efforts, hire technical personnel, and establish our own factory. However, the required capital is huge. There are only more than 20 companies in Shanghai. If we want to create this huge industry, we must invite colleagues in the mainland to jointly initiate it so that everyone can work together to achieve the goal of self-production and self-sales.

Discussion of Important Matters

(1) A proposal to raise funds to establish an artificial silk factory in order to recover rights and interests, prevent losses, and revitalize industry was resolved to organize a research committee to conduct research and preparation. (2) A decision on the name of the research committee was resolved to be the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Artificial Silk Industry National Artificial Silk Research Committee. (3) A proposal to elect the number of research committee members was resolved to be three people from Hangzhou, Yu Guangxian, Han Shuijing, and Zhou Wenjun, two people from Suzhou, Mo Jingyong and Deng Gengxin, one person from Nantong, Cao Shikang, one person from Shaoxing, Sun Deqing, two people from Shengze, Wei Hongzhang and Shi Jiayan, and eleven people from Shanghai, Pei Yuanding, Zhang Fuquan, Sun Zhongshu, Kang Xitao, Yuan Jingbang, Gu Xiyuan, Li Tingdong, Cao Lanjiu, Shen Laizhou, Ni Nengbai, and Wan Shuming. (4) A proposal on how to raise the funds for the research committee was resolved to be divided equally according to the number of committee members. (5) A proposal to recruit technical personnel was resolved to be handled by the research committee. (6) A proposal to stipulate the number of meetings was resolved to hold a meeting once a month, and it may be convened temporarily when necessary. (7) A request to appoint a convener for the research committee was resolved to appoint Pei Yuanding as the convener. The discussion was completed at 4:00 PM. It is heard that the total capital of the factory is planned to be 4 million yuan, divided into 40,000 shares, each share being 100 yuan. Artificial silk companies in various places will have priority to subscribe, and the shortfall will be recruited from outside. The factory site is currently being selected.

### Municipal Health Bureau's Disease Prevention Campaign

Cholera Has a 90-Year History - Isolation Hospital to Open Next Month

This summer's disease prevention campaign is being actively carried out by the Municipal Health Bureau in conjunction with the International Settlement Health Office and other relevant hospitals and organizations. Our news agency reporter has compiled the following information:

Observation Indicates Cholera Can Be Avoided This Year

Last year, the medical community widely believed it was a year when cholera was likely to spread. However, thanks to the effective disease prevention efforts of the Chinese and Settlement health organizations, they managed to get through it safely. This year, it is widely believed that cholera will not occur. In 1932, when cholera was rampant in Shanghai, the first case was discovered on April 26th. As of now, this summer is very quiet. Hospitals have only treated or admitted a small number of patients with gastroenteritis.

The Origin of Cholera Outbreaks in Shanghai

According to research by the Port Quarantine Office, cholera has been prevalent in China for 120 years. The first discovery in China occurred on the border, introduced by land from India, around 95 years before the founding of the Republic. The first discovery of cholera in Shanghai was 66 years before the Republic, marking the first time Shanghai came into contact with cholera, which is more than 90 years ago.

Active Promotion of Disease Prevention Work

Regarding the current state of disease prevention, one point is particularly noteworthy: the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has strictly prohibited the sale of cut fruit in the city. This measure is highly effective in preventing disease. Unfortunately, due to various difficulties, the International Settlement has not been able to implement the same measures. However, the Health Office will also strictly and thoroughly manage these fruit vendors during this summer and autumn. Furthermore, it is reported that all isolation hospitals in the city will expand their bed capacity from July 1st to accommodate patients with summer illnesses.

### Expansion of Rice-Growing Areas in the County

Intense Effort to Control Rice Stem Borers - Breeding Work for Draft Cattle Has Been Done

Shanghai County was originally a rice-producing area. In recent years, due to food shortages, the number of rice farmers has increased annually. In addition to the local improvement association promoting mechanical irrigation, the Ministry of Industry is also conducting livestock improvement, focusing on breeding draft cattle to make them healthier, stronger, and more efficient in plowing. Recognizing the damage caused by rice stem borers, efforts to control them have also been intensified in recent years. Currently, during the rice planting season, Zhang Fengshan, the head of the Third District, and others are inspecting the fields and instructing township chiefs and bailiffs on how to manage rice paddies and eliminate pests. Farmers are generally able to understand and follow these instructions.

### Interview with Pei Ke Fuli Si, First Swedish Envoy to China

Highly Praises China's Construction, Saying It Is Not Difficult to Turn Weakness into Strength - Embassy to Be Established in Shanghai, Plans to Visit Nanjing First to Meet with Foreign Minister Wang

Sweden has begun to send a full-time envoy to China, and has appointed Baron Pei Ke Fuli Si, the current consul-general in Shanghai, to the position. He received the official telegram of appointment from his country yesterday. Mr. Pei met with a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency at the consulate yesterday morning and said, "This is my first time being appointed to China, so my understanding of your country is superficial. However, since taking office as consul-general in Shanghai on May 1st last year, I have traveled to Peiping, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, and I deeply admire your country's authorities for their efforts to govern and especially their spirit of hard work in construction. In just this one year, there has been tremendous progress. It is clear that it is not difficult for your country to restore its original position and become a major power in the world. Chairman Jiang is truly the only leader of your country, and under his leadership, the future is truly limitless. I am extremely honored to be appointed as the first envoy to China, and I have already notified your country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs that I plan to visit Nanjing first to meet with Foreign Minister Wang. As for the date of presenting my credentials, since Chairman Lin will soon be leaving Nanjing to avoid the summer heat, it will have to be postponed until September. I will serve as the full-time envoy, and the embassy will be located in Shanghai. Another person will be appointed to succeed me as consul-general in Shanghai. The relationship between China and Sweden has always been extremely friendly, and international trade between the two countries has always been balanced. Sweden's exports to China are mostly paper and machinery, amounting to about 12 to 15 million yuan per year. China's exports to Sweden are mostly silk and tea, with a similar value. From now on, I will work even harder to improve this. Swedish expatriates in Shanghai are currently preparing to organize a chamber of commerce, the purpose of which is to promote Sino-Swedish import and export trade."

### The Municipal Council Oversteps Authority in Inspecting Factories

The Factory Association Asks the Ratepayers' Association to Intervene

The Factory Association Asks the Ratepayers' Association to Intervene. The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Association sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we recently received a letter from Mr. Chen Youyun, the manager of the Huadong Woolen Mill, stating that on December 25th, 1936, the Industrial Section of the Public Concession Municipal Council sent investigators with a letter to the factory to conduct an investigation, requesting that the factory make six reforms. We immediately complied with each one. One of the reforms was to demolish the attic above the Yongdao road. After repeatedly requesting an extension, we were finally granted permission to postpone the demolition until the end of April of this year. Unexpectedly, shortly after the demolition, they came to investigate again on May 31st of this year. They made no criticism of the previous six reforms that had been implemented, but then requested that the two-story building also be demolished. This two-story building was already built five years ago when our factory leased it. Now the Municipal Council wants to demolish it, which would cause a great loss. Coming to the factory in such a roundabout way, intentionally making things difficult, is truly unbearable. Therefore, we are writing to your association to investigate and intervene." The letter also stated that the Municipal Council has been making all sorts of unreasonable demands on Chinese factories, and many member factories have reported this to the association. At a time when the factory inspection issue in the concession has not yet been resolved, the council's overstepping of its authority to conduct inspections is already an infringement on our national sovereignty. Yet they continue to press forward step by step, making demands in various ways, which clearly shows a deliberate intention to oppress. This matter concerns the business operations of Chinese factories and is of great importance. We urge you to forward a letter to the Municipal Council to argue with reason and firmly stop them. We sincerely hope for your assistance."

### Huang Ji Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing to Discuss Financing for Guangxi Province

The Central Government Approves the Issuance of 20 Million Yuan in Public Bonds - Plans to Visit Nanjing Again to Discuss Specific Measures

Mr. Huang Ji, the director of the Bank of Guangxi Province, and Mr. Gan Jiehou went to Nanjing a few days ago to request instructions from the central government on how to reorganize Guangxi's finances. Mr. Huang took the night train and left Nanjing the night before last, planning to meet with Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan again to continue negotiations. However, Mr. Xu had already left Shanghai and they did not meet. According to Mr. Huang, he went to Nanjing this time to request instructions from the central government on the reorganization of Guangxi's finances.

The central government has approved Guangxi Province's request to issue 20 million yuan in public bonds to reorganize its finances. However, the necessary conditions for issuing the bonds still need to be negotiated. As for the issue of setting the exchange rate between the national currency and the Guangxi currency, the central government is still considering it. Mr. Huang plans to go to Nanjing again on the 8th or 9th to continue negotiations with the central government. Once specific measures have been agreed upon, he will return to Guangxi to report.

### Fellow Provincials' Associations and Others Initiate Discussion on Tax Exemption

The Ningbo Association in Shanghai and the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai are initiating a discussion on tax exemption. According to Article 2 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the income of legal entities that are not for profit can be exempted from income tax. The purpose of the fellow provincials' associations is to connect with fellow provincials, assist fellow provincials, and carry out public welfare and charitable activities. They are legal entities that are not for profit, and their income should be exempt from taxation according to regulations. However, the Shanghai Income Tax Office has rejected the tax exemption applications, stating that the fellow provincials' associations are people's organizations and are not within the scope of education or charity. This has a significant impact on the finances of the fellow provincials' associations. Therefore, they have jointly sent letters to various fellow provincials' associations in Shanghai to solicit their opinions and will convene a joint meeting to discuss countermeasures.

### Mayor Yu's Speech on Storing Strength and National Revival

The Shanghai Chinese Christian Young Men's Association, in order to awaken the public and encourage joint efforts, held a ten-day strength-storing movement at the Ba Xian Qiao YMCA from June 4th to 13th. In addition to the strength-storing movement exhibition, every evening from 6 o'clock, contemporary celebrities were specially invited to give lectures on various topics, which were also broadcast on the radio. At 6 o'clock the night before last, the first lecture was given by Acting Mayor Yu on the topic of "Storing Strength and National Revival." The following is a transcript of his speech:

The four characters "National Revival" have become a kind of catchphrase that can be heard anytime, anywhere. However, what is meant by national revival and how to revive the nation are probably not thoroughly understood by many. Since those who thoroughly understand are few, those who earnestly engage in revival work must be even fewer. Therefore, before discussing "Storing Strength," I must first briefly mention the current state of our nation. There are four essential elements for establishing a country: people, land, organization, and sovereignty. Among these four, the people are the most important. Therefore, our country has always had the teaching of "the people are the foundation of the nation," and the Three Principles of the People advocated by the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen also prioritize the nation. But what is the current state of our nation? Currently, our nation faces three most prominent crises:

1.  Economic Bankruptcy

Farmers account for three-quarters of our nation's population. Since the Opium War, with the opening of trade ports, the rural areas have been subjected to foreign economic aggression, and handmade products cannot compete with machine production. Coupled with frequent disasters, the rural economy has been declining day by day and is now bankrupt. With rural bankruptcy, farmers lose their purchasing power, and small merchants engaged in rural commerce also inevitably go bankrupt. Consequently, the business of large urban stores also declines. Therefore, not only are the so-called impoverished people in dire straits, but also the so-called wealthy are becoming poorer day by day and gradually unable to support themselves. The entire nation is about to perish as a whole. A look at the current state of industry and commerce can prove that my statement is not false. Therefore, our nation is currently on the verge of economic bankruptcy, and we must focus on economic construction to seek national revival.

2.  Moral Bankruptcy

Our country is currently in a period of transition between the old and the new, a period of "neither fish nor fowl." The old morality has been completely overthrown, and the new morality has not yet been established. Therefore, people regard etiquette as a shackle, religion as superstition, and the rule of law as harsh. As a result, society has lost its cohesion. Consequently, the majority of the people are selfish and self-serving, decadent and greedy, lazy and cowardly, base and frivolous, seeking only to satisfy personal desires, unaware of society and the nation. Ritual and righteousness are nonexistent, and shame has been swept away. Therefore, our nation has reached a period of moral bankruptcy, and we must focus on cultural construction to seek national revival.

3.  Physical Bankruptcy

The physique of our people is weakening day by day, and we have long been called the "sick man of East Asia." If we examine the physical condition of our people, how many are healthy and free from disease? In addition, with moral bankruptcy and rampant human desires, people indulge in various improper entertainment and habits. The elderly are not to be discussed, but most young people are also pale and emaciated, weak and powerless. Therefore, the physical condition of our nation has also reached a period of bankruptcy, and we must establish a clear direction for physical training to seek national revival. The above three crises are all facts that we have witnessed. Even without the oppression of foreign aggression, if we continue unchanged, how can our nation survive? Moreover, the greatest danger to a country lies not outside but inside. Foreign aggression is often self-inflicted. Therefore, Mencius said, "People must insult themselves before others insult them; a country must attack itself before others attack it." The government, upholding the teachings of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen and deeply concerned about the increasingly fierce struggle among nations in the world, understands that without self-improvement, there is no way to survive. Therefore, it advocates the meaning of national revival. The so-called "revival" must have a period of decline associated with it. Without knowing where the weakness lies, how can we talk about revival? This is why I must first talk about the current state of the nation. The current state of the nation has already been mentioned above. So, how should we seek revival? The answer is "Storing Strength." The so-called "storing" means storing up and accumulating. The so-called "strength" means all the power used for action and behavior, including mental, intellectual, physical, and financial strength. To save economic bankruptcy, we must focus on economic construction to seek revival. To save moral bankruptcy, we must focus on cultural construction to seek revival. To save physical bankruptcy, we must establish a clear direction for physical training to seek revival. All these things depend on the government's leadership from above, but even more so on the people's automatic efforts from below, following the principle of "self-reliance" advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to develop one's own strength, accumulate one's own strength, and obey the government's orders to exert it in time to save this dying nation. Now, I will briefly discuss the importance of storing strength and the implementation of methods for storing strength.

1.  Importance of Storing Strength

The enemy of storing is waste. The intelligence and talent, the ability to endure hardship and work hard of our people are no less than those of other nations. The reason why we are lagging behind in everything today and lack vitality is due to the waste of various strengths. This kind of wasteful habit is extremely widespread. From the perspective of mental and intellectual strength, the courage, initiative, perseverance, meticulousness, and thoughtfulness of our people can be seen everywhere. However, they are not courageous for the public good but ultimately for private gain, not used for good but for evil. Therefore, internal wars were frequent in the past, and械斗 (xie dou, armed clan feuds) were common. Today, acts of wrongdoing, tax evasion, and smuggling are heard of every day. What is the harm of this waste of mental and intellectual strength to oneself and the country? From the perspective of physical and financial strength, the weakness of our people's bodies is not entirely due to poor congenital heredity, but mostly due to improper habits and inappropriate entertainment, such as smoking opium and drinking alcohol, which damage the body on the one hand and waste money on the other, leading to the weakening of the race and the decline of livelihood. What is the harm of this waste of physical and financial strength to oneself and the country? In addition, the above two types of waste, both mental and material, are inherently linked and cannot be analyzed separately. Those with impure minds often behave improperly, and those who behave improperly often have impure minds. Therefore, the method of suppressing this should be to address both aspects simultaneously, on the one hand, developing and storing mental and intellectual strength, and on the other hand, developing and storing physical and financial strength. Unless we do this, we will not only be unable to talk about revival, but also be unable to勉强 (mian qiang, barely) maintain the status quo and苟延残喘 (gou yan can chuan, prolong a precarious existence). The greatest danger to a country lies not outside but inside. No nation that engages in the wanton destruction of its own strength can avoid extinction. A tree is not broken by a storm but destroyed by蛀蚀 (zhu shi, woodworm). The reason for this should be deeply considered. Therefore, suppressing the waste of strength and engaging in the storing of strength is the only way to national revival. The importance of this should not be ignored by the people of the country.

2.  Implementation of Methods for Storing Strength

The implementation of methods for storing strength is already fully covered by the economic construction and New Life Movement advocated by our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. If the people of the country can strive to follow each regulation, then our nation will surely be revived. I will now elaborate on one or two aspects, explaining them in four sections: mental, intellectual, physical, and financial strength, to help the people of the country store strength. (1) Storing Mental Strength: The first step in storing mental strength should be to start with eliminating selfish and self-serving thoughts and suppressing selfish and self-serving actions. On the negative side, we should adhere to Confucius's teaching of "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself" and Mencius's teaching of "Respect the elderly in your family, and extend that respect to the elderly in other families; love the young ones in your family, and extend that love to the young ones in other families." On the positive side, we should adhere to Mencius's teaching of "I will rather die to achieve benevolence than live to destroy it" and Jesus's teaching of "not to be served, but to serve," to cultivate the spirit of "sacrificing the small self to obey the greater self, sacrificing the small self to protect the greater self." Only then can we face difficulties without compromise, with one heart and one mind, exert and contribute our strength to obey the leader's command and safeguard national sovereignty. Therefore, in ordinary times, we should memorize the maxims of sages and read the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's works and the biographies of patriotic heroes to inspire patriotic and communal thinking. (2) Storing Intellectual Strength: The starting point is that those who are illiterate should first seek literacy, then read various books that citizens should read, and practice various simple books on science, technology, and life skills. Those who are literate and have received considerable education should strive to study scientific knowledge and learn specialized skills, and should pay particular attention to developing resources and building national defense. Therefore, we should read more science books, read more science magazines, and participate in more science lectures and discussions, and we should also enlighten those who are not yet enlightened and teach those who have not yet learned, based on what we know and what we have learned, to guide other compatriots who do not yet know or have not yet learned, to cultivate and 厚 (hou, thicken) the intellectual strength of the entire nation. (3) Storing Physical Strength: Practice various sports, such as Chinese martial arts, Western boxing, and various labor operations. At a minimum, everyone must walk for one hour every day, and young men and women should especially receive military training and military nursing to prepare to serve the country. (4) Storing Financial Strength: Start by abandoning improper habits or entertainment, breaking down unreasonable superstitions, and refusing meaningless应酬 (ying chou, social engagements) and consumption, and use the money saved each month for savings. Even if there is nothing left to save, we should still practice frugality and save one-tenth or one-hundredth of our monthly income to help the country develop resources and engage in production. At the same time, the unemployed should urgently serve the country and society regardless of the cost, to avoid wasting intellectual and physical strength and increase mental and financial strength.

The above four types of strength storing are not only not mutually exclusive but also mutually reinforcing, so they should be given equal emphasis and stored simultaneously. All of these are just my personal foolish ideas and limited opinions. I sincerely hope that from today onwards, the people of the country can follow Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's New Life regulations, promote the New Life Movement, engage in economic construction, and practice self-reliance, so that the effect of storing strength will be both broad and rapid, and national revival will surely follow.

### The Association of Marine Engineers Requests Immediate Improvement of Treatment

The China Marine Engineers Association, upon receiving a joint request from all the marine engineers of the Sanbei, Ningxing, Hongan shipping companies to improve their treatment last month, sent a letter to the three companies on their behalf to negotiate. The five demands put forward explained that the treatment of marine engineers in the three companies has always been extremely low, with a difference of up to one-quarter compared to other companies. Now that other companies are automatically improving their treatment due to the increase in shipping revenue, the three companies are said to be considering and deliberating on the issue of improving treatment, according to people within the company. The Marine Engineers Association yesterday continued to send a letter to negotiate, demanding an early reply to reassure the crew members.

### The 21st District Branch of the Municipal Federation Opposes the Levy of Additional Property Tax

The 21st District Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, in order to oppose the resumption by the Municipal Council of the property tax levied from 1927 to 1930, sent a letter to the Municipal County Council and the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday, asking them to uphold justice. The original letter reads: "To the esteemed readers, we read with great shock the news on June 3rd that the Municipal Council is resuming the property tax levied from 1927 to 1930. This city has always been known for its prosperity, with bustling markets and a large population. Before 1927, there were no empty houses and no vacant land, and tax revenues were surplus. After 1927, rural areas went bankrupt, the economy became sluggish, and various industries failed and closed down one after another, resulting in rows of empty houses along the streets and lanes. Therefore, tax revenues are short. Now, the Municipal Council does not try to find ways to remedy the situation by boosting the economy, but instead strives to increase the burden on the citizens every day. This is a case of not considering the root and treating the branch. It should be known that the residents of this city are already suffering unbearably from high rents and taxes. To increase the property tax again is tantamount to putting all the citizens of the city to death. In the future, they will close down one after another and move to the interior. The houses in the concession will all become empty, and the Municipal Council will have no taxes to collect. At this time, increasing the property tax is equivalent to a suicidal policy. Our association cannot remain silent and has written this letter to request your association to promptly stop the Bureau from increasing the property tax in order to protect the lives of the people. If the Bureau wants to find a way to balance revenue and expenditure, it can only levy a tax on empty houses. Otherwise, the citizens in our area are willing to sacrifice everything to be the backbone of all the residents of the city. We earnestly request your association to uphold justice and forward this letter to the Bureau to stop the increase in property tax. We await your urgent instructions. (Omitted below)"

### Grain Merchants from Six Provinces and Cities Implement Joint Collective Business Operations

Drafting Regulations and Other Matters to be Discussed at the Meeting　Investigation in Shanghai Suspended

Rice merchants from six provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Shanghai, in order to understand the production and sales conditions of food in South China and Southeast Asia, so as to regulate the surplus and deficiency of national rice and balance market prices, specially organized a National Rice Investigation Team to conduct on-site investigations. They will depart on the 15th of this month. Representatives from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces will travel by the Yuehan Railway, and representatives from Jiangsu and Anhui will come to Shanghai to meet with Shanghai grain merchants. After gathering, they will take a ship to Guangzhou to meet up and conduct the investigation in groups. A Taigongshe reporter recently learned from Shanghai miscellaneous grain groups that the National Rice Investigation Team originally planned to send Gu Xin Yi, Chen Zi Yi, Chen Shi De, and three other representatives from Shanghai to participate. However, due to Gu and others being unable to travel due to their duties in Shanghai, they have declared their withdrawal. As for the matter of the Joint Association of Grain Merchants from Six Provinces and Cities, it is currently being formulated. Once the draft articles of association and outline are drafted, opinions will be sought from the grain industry groups in each province, city, and county, and representatives will be invited to Shanghai to discuss the organization. In the future, through the strength of this group, the economic and financial resources of grain merchants will be concentrated to set up a large-scale grain transportation and sales company as a purely commercial collective business to improve agricultural production, regulate surpluses and deficiencies, and balance market prices.

### The Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Association Cables Fujian to Actively Prevent the Epidemic

The Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Committee, in view of the spread of the plague to various parts of Fujian Province, specially sent an express telegram yesterday urging action, which reads: "To Chen, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, and all county governments and community organizations: Fujian organizations in Shanghai, upon hearing of the outbreak of plague in southern Fujian, immediately convened a joint meeting of various organizations to initiate the organization of the Southern Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Committee, actively carrying out prevention and relief work and petitioning the authorities to quickly eradicate the plague. Charitable organizations in Shanghai also donated medicines to the meeting, and the work is progressing smoothly. Subsequently, as the epidemic spread to various parts of Fujian Province, it was proposed by various organizations to expand the organization. A general meeting of various Fujian organizations and fellow villagers in Shanghai was convened on May 23rd to establish the Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Committee, elect officials, and decide on major issues such as addressing the symptoms and causes. On May 25th, the first standing committee meeting was held to allocate responsibilities and intensify work, and it was resolved to telegraph the county governments and community organizations in the affected areas to quickly organize prevention and relief agencies and maintain close contact with our committee. As this matter concerns the public interest, the counties in the affected areas are particularly aware of the pain. We hope that you will quickly organize prevention and relief agencies and send us the situation in the affected areas at any time. Chairman Xiao Bichuan of the Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Committee bows in respect."

### Representatives from 54 Counties in Sichuan Cable Shanghai, Urging Disaster Relief

Improve Rural Facilities　Implement Troop Reduction and Grain Reduction

The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association and the Shanghai Sichuan Provincial Fellow Villagers Association received a cable yesterday from representatives of 54 counties of the Sichuan South Provincial Fellow Villagers Association, which reads: "The people of Sichuan are unfortunate, and drought is rampant. Grass roots and tree bark are about to be eaten up. Deaths have resulted from disputes over water, and multiple people have been crushed to death while digging for mud. Even盗尸 (dao shi, robbing corpses) for food and entire families committing suicide are common occurrences. Currently, the only solution is for the central government and Sichuan to jointly allocate 2 million yuan for disaster relief, which, when distributed, is a drop in the bucket. What can it do? Unless there is heavy rain, rice transplanting will be missed, and this year's autumn harvest will be hopeless. Please think quietly about what the future of Sichuan will be like. The degree of danger is probably ten or a hundred times greater than it is today. For the sake of the present, it is right for all levels to be of one heart, sincere with each other, and do their best to save the catastrophe together. We respectfully offer our humble suggestions, hoping that you will examine them carefully. We hope that the central and local governments will quickly allocate 20 million yuan of Sichuan disaster relief bonds, guaranteed by the additional levy of one tax in addition to the regular levies of 27, 8, and 9 years of grain, to ensure that it will be repaid on time. Take it from the people and use it for the people. It is easy for the government to do, and the people will be happy to comply. This will be distributed to all the victims, with each person receiving more than 5 jiao (角, unit of currency) of silver to supplement the inadequacy of urgent relief, and detailed measures will be formulated to improve rural areas so that the benefits can be sustained for a while. This is the minimum limit. If you can bestow more grace, reduce troops and grain, it would be even more fragrant prayer. The above has been presented for the urgent needs of disaster relief, but there are certainly omissions. However, we have assessed the situation and believe that it is practical and feasible, and we have outlined a rough outline of self-help and helping others. We hope that those who are benevolent near and far, as well as our fellow villagers, will implement and guide it. We would be very grateful." Representatives of 54 counties of the Sichuan South Provincial Fellow Villagers Association Urge Disaster Relief.

### 16-Year-Old Girl Cannot Sue on Her Own According to Law

Only Arguing on Procedure　Declaring the Case Inadmissible in Court

Xu Qiutang (also known as Xu Yongchun, 35 years old), the owner of Qianxin Machinery Factory at No. 874 Haining Road, a local, was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Feng Xiufeng (currently 16 years old), a 常州 (Changzhou) native and child bride of Chen Yousheng, who resides at No. 23 Youyuli, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, through her lawyer Xiong Fei, for committing the crime of violating public morals under Article 227 of the Criminal Law. The facts are that she had sexual intercourse with him in Rooms 14 and 18 of the Maigen Hotel on Maigen Road on October 8th and October 18th last year, and she had illicit sexual intercourse with him in Room 6 of the Xizang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road on December 31st last year. After receiving the complaint, the court immediately issued a subpoena ordering the tea boys on duty at the Maigen Hotel and the Xizang Hotel to bring the circular books to court to testify in order to refute the two parties involved. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide summoned them in Criminal Court One. The defendant Xu Qiutang did not appear, and his lawyer Wang Xintang appeared on his behalf. Judge Feng stated that the plaintiff Feng Xiufeng was not yet an adult and could not file a lawsuit according to law, so he ordered the lawyers of both parties to argue on procedure, and then declared the case inadmissible.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (27)

(Question) I previously sent an airmail letter from Shanghai to London, weighing about 15 grams. I heard that there are both Sino-French and Sino-British air routes that can reach London from Shanghai. The post office requires the sender to specify the route they want to take, so I indicated on the letter that it should be sent via the Sino-French route. At that time, the post office charged 2.20 yuan for postage. A few days later, I sent another letter, which was lighter, and indicated that it should be sent via the Sino-British route. The post office asked me to affix 2.65 yuan in postage, which was 4.5 jiao (角, unit of currency) more than the previous letter. I don't know why. Are the fees different for each route? How many air routes are there between Shanghai and London now? Are the fees for each route the same? Are the required days the same? Also, how is the postage calculated for airmail postcards sent abroad? I plan to send an airmail double postcard to London, how much will it cost? Please provide detailed information. (Answer) There are currently three air routes for airmail letters from Shanghai to London, namely the Sino-French, Sino-British, and Dutch routes. The detailed information is as follows: (1) Sino-French Air Route: Airmail letters delivered via this route are handed over to the plane flying from Shanghai to Guangzhou every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 6:30 am. From there, they are handed over to the plane on the Guanghe Line every Wednesday and Friday to Hanoi, and then handed over to the French airline's plane that departs every Saturday to Marseilles and then to London. The entire journey takes at least ten days. In addition to the regular postage, the airmail fee is 6.5 jiao for every 5 grams. If your letter weighs 15 grams, it must be calculated according to three units, which is 1.95 yuan, plus the regular postage of 2.5 jiao for every 20 grams, for a total of 2.20 yuan. (2) Sino-British Air Route: Airmail letters delivered via this route are handed over to the Shanghai-Guangdong Line plane every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 6:20 am to Hong Kong, and then transferred to the British Royal Airline's plane to fly directly to London. The entire journey takes at least eleven days. In addition to the regular postage, the airmail fee is 8 jiao for every 5 grams. The weight of your letter seems to be between 10 grams and 15 grams, so it should be calculated according to three units, which is 2.40 yuan, plus the regular postage of 2.5 jiao, for a total of 2.65 yuan. (3) Dutch Air Route: Airmail letters delivered via this route are transported by ship from Shanghai to Singapore, and then loaded onto a plane that takes off from Singapore every Wednesday and Saturday, arriving in Amsterdam on Monday and Thursday of the following week, and then delivered via regular postal routes. The entire journey takes about thirteen to seventeen days. In addition to the regular postage, the airmail fee from Singapore to Amsterdam is 4 jiao for every 5 grams. The airmail fee for postcards sent abroad is the same as for letters. The outgoing journey of double postcards sent abroad can be sent by airmail, but the return journey can only be sent by regular postal routes.

### National Doctor Zhang Ziying Diagnoses Diseases with Three-Part Pulse Method

Traditional Chinese medicine treats diseases by exploring pathology and judging symptoms based on pulse diagnosis on the wrist. Therefore, ancient doctors were all known for their expertise in pulse diagnosis, and there was a saying that the pulse does not deceive people. However, from the Tang and Song dynasties to the present, only one line of pulse is diagnosed on the hand, and the viscera are inferred based on the anatomy of modern physiology, which has become an imperfect diagnosis. Since the entire body of human being has arteries, it is necessary to diagnose the three parts of the hands, feet and neck at the same time in order to understand the changes of the internal organs. Since the famous old Chinese medicine doctor Yao Xinyuan advocated restoring Zhang Zhongjing's pulse method in the Han Dynasty, lecturing at the Buddhist Hospital, and publishing the book Pulse Science Restoration, various medical and pharmaceutical magazines have reprinted it one after another, and the medical community across the country has enthusiastically praised it. After the Central National Medical Museum and the Ministry of Health gave their approval, a glimmer of dawn has been discovered in the diagnosis of Chinese medicine. Mr. Zhang Ziying, the editor-in-chief of the Health Magazine, who is also an enthusiastic member of improving health and hygiene, also agrees with the one-part pulse method and is studying it together, and has gained a lot of insights. I recently heard that Dr. Zhang intends to show by example and use the three-part pulse method for diagnosis. For all diagnoses, if the source of the disease cannot be determined, or if it does not heal after medical treatment, the source lies in the error of diagnosis. If the three-part pulse method is used for diagnosis, the problem can be solved easily. Dr. Zhang's clinic has now moved to Fudeli, the west end of Mahe Road, Edward Road, telephone number 31570.

### Seamen's Party and Other Groups Organize Rowing Competition

To be held at Bansong Garden on the 11th

The Chinese Seamen's Party branch of the Great South Gate in the South City and the Shanghai District branch, in conjunction with the Chinese Seamen's Club, convened a joint discussion meeting of various Chinese seamen's organizations at the aforementioned branch at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the summer rowing competition for seamen. Cheng Yongming was the chairman, and He Zhongyue was the recording secretary. The chairman gave a report (omitted), and then the following items were discussed: ㊀ Participants in the competition will be divided into two categories: units and groups. Units will consist of four people per group, but each group must have a minimum of one participant. This was resolved and passed. ㊁ The date was set for 2:00 PM on June 11th at Bansong Garden. However, participants must gather at the Seamen's Club before departure. This was resolved and passed. ㊂ The uniform for the competition will be a white vest and shorts to show neatness. This was resolved and passed (the shirts and pants must be prepared by each participating organization). ㊃ The vests worn by the participants must have the four characters "中華海員" (Chinese Seamen) on the front, and another white cloth sash with the name of each organization on it for identification. This was resolved and passed. ㊄ The Seamen's Club will produce and issue certificates of merit to the winning organizations. This was resolved and passed. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### Datong Society Actively Organizes National Music

Experimenting with composing national music harmonies, and issuing scout flutes

The Datong Music Society on Songshan Road in this city has a long history and is the only national music group in the country. It usually focuses on organizing national music and making standard musical instruments, with remarkable achievements. Recently, the society has invited Mr. Shen Junwen, a music specialist, to compose and guide the experiment of composing harmony pieces with national music characteristics, fully applying Chinese musical instruments, in order to promote the inherent culture. Once the composition and practice are mature, music circles at home and abroad will be invited to discuss the compilation method of new Chinese music, and those interested in organizing national music are welcome to participate in the practice and work together to promote it. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the matching methods of various Chinese musical instruments in the thirteen major categories have been lost, the society is issuing various standard tone instruments. Five types of scout flutes (bamboo instruments) have been made, with twelve keys, and the pronunciation techniques are unified, suitable for group musicians to use. The selling price is low, only one-thirtieth of that of Western military flutes, and managed for sale by the Commercial Press. Many scout troops across the country have adopted them and are satisfied. Combining flute teams and harmonica teams for ensemble, the sound is even more wonderful.

It usually promotes painting and calligraphy with great effort. At each weekly meeting, the calligraphers and painters all wield their brushes on the spot. Over the years, hundreds of fine works have been collected and gradually mounted, all displayed in the society. It is said that this exhibition of the society has three differences from ordinary exhibitions: ㊀ The exhibits are exquisite and rich, including landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, meticulous brushwork, and freehand brushwork. ㊁ Collaborative paintings are rare outside. ㊂ There are no fake works at all. Lovers of national painting can visit and view, which is truly a rare opportunity.

### Shanghai Literature Exhibition Actively Under Preparation

Classics, books, and paintings are already considerable; historical materials and relics are still being solicited

The Shanghai Literature Exhibition, which will open in the city center on July 2nd, is jointly organized by one city and ten counties (Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Shanghai, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang). The scale is large, and the persons in charge in this city and nearby counties are actively preparing. The latest preparations are recorded as follows:

Counties actively collect and investigate

Since the preparation began, although the time has been very short, the collection of exhibits has been considerable. The soliciting directors of the ten counties, except for this city, have all separately united with various local sectors to organize soliciting associations to carry out collection and investigation work. For example, Songjiang County holds meetings every five days or a week to report on the collection situation. Some county solicitation directors reside in Shanghai, such as Baoshan, Taicang, and Jiading counties. In addition to setting up offices in their respective counties, they also travel back and forth several times a week to facilitate contact. In order to facilitate the submission of items by exhibitors from the county, they have also specially set up a receiving office in Shanghai, which is then sent to the office by the soliciting director, such as Nanhui County. Because the counties are very serious about the collection and investigation work, in addition to public and private treasures, there are also many that have been ignored by foreigners and have only recently been discovered. This kind of unexpected harvest can arouse the public's attention to cultural relics. In addition, well-known libraries in various places have also sent catalogs of classics related to the ten counties, such as Beijing, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places.

This city responds enthusiastically

The Xujiahui Catholic Church Library and the Nanyang Middle School Library in this city, which are the most famous for their collections of books, have many fine editions to exhibit. In other private aspects, such as Zhang Jusheng, Wang Shoushan, Zhang Shuyong, Shen Xinqing, Yao Zhaoli, Zhou Yueran, He Shixi, and Ye Kuichu, all have valuable exhibits to send to the meeting. The major exhibits in this city are revolutionary documents, including relics of the martyr Chen Yingshi, relics of local sages Xu Guangqi, Lu Shen, Li Pingshu, Yao Zirang, etc., and education includes physical objects from Longmen Normal School. In other aspects such as industry, commerce, transportation, charity, and various religions, there are also exhibits. As of yesterday, in terms of classics alone, more than 600 types have been received, many of which are fine editions. Seventy to eighty percent of the historical records of the ten counties have also been obtained. These 600 types of classics were all solicited from outside the ten counties. Although the solicitation directors of the ten counties have not sent a detailed catalog, the number must be very considerable. A considerable number of paintings and calligraphy have also been solicited.

Exhibits are reviewed for authenticity

For the sake of caution, in addition to recommending several experts to review the exhibits in this city, the items solicited from the counties must be reviewed by the solicitation director. Therefore, the items to be exhibited in the future, whether by famous or unknown authors, will be based on authenticity. Suspicious items will be rejected.

Special attention is paid to historical materials and relics

However, the value of historical materials and relics of local sages is very great in the literature. Because they have always been ignored by ordinary people, collection is more difficult. Often, a major event in a local area, which has not been around for a long time, has the worry of insufficient literature to collect. Figures who are highly respected in a township have no physical objects to look up to after only a few hundred years. Currently, the office has notified the solicitation directors of the counties to pay special attention to the above two categories. If some cultural relics cannot be collected in a short period of time, efforts must also be made. The purpose of the association is not only to hold exhibitions to arouse the public's awareness of local literature, but also to promote the awareness of preserving literature in various places due to the holding of exhibitions.

Quick handling and safe storage

The office has more than 20 people, working in four sections in a large room. Every exhibit is sent through four procedures before being returned to the warehouse. There is a strict organization between sections. In addition to registration, cataloging, and explanation, there are also case citations for the exhibit and the exhibitor. Therefore, any exhibit can be retrieved within one or two minutes, which is the latest museum management method. The warehouse is the museum. The first warehouse is similar to a bank's vault in construction, so there is no problem with the safety of the exhibits. Now that the deadline is approaching, more and more exhibits are being sent from all sides, and all the staff in the office are extremely busy. In addition to planning the association's affairs, the president, Ye Yuhu, must also contact all sectors, so he is also extremely hardworking.

Regularly convene collection personnel

On the 15th and 16th, the association will again convene collection personnel and standing directors from various places in Shanghai to decide on various important matters during the display and exhibition. Yesterday, the office also sent letters to the solicitation directors in various places, among which several points are very important to the applicants. The points that should be paid attention to during solicitation: ㊀ The registration form must be sent to the association at any time for cataloging and statistics. If it is not enough, indicate it and it will be sent immediately. ㊁ In addition to the known historical sites and antiquities in various places, please conduct detailed investigation and photography (four inches by six inches), or rubbings are acceptable.

### The Weather in This City Turned Hot Yesterday

The weather in this city has been very mild recently. The temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer is often around 80 degrees, and the timely rain is very beneficial to the farmland. However, it suddenly turned hot yesterday morning, and the temperature rose to over 90 degrees. Therefore, pedestrians on the road were waving fans like dancing, and everyone was enjoying the cool outdoors in the evening, which was quite like the early heat weather.

### Tang Shutian Rapes a Young Girl

The girl could not walk after being injured. Tang was arrested and transferred to the court.

In a shed in Zhangjiabang, Pudong, there is a man from Jiangbei, Tang Shutian, 36 years old, who has been a vendor. Although he is old, he does not have a wife and lives alone. The neighbor is a fellow villager, a woman named Jing Zhang, who is also a vendor selling water chestnuts. There is usually no ill feeling. The day before, after Jing Zhang went out, her fifteen-year-old daughter, Jing Niuxi, was left at home to watch the door.

### The Chinese Association for the Deaf and Mute Holds its Inaugural Meeting Today

Party and Government Instructions Translated into Sign Language; Gradually Implementing Welfare for the Deaf and Mute

The Chinese Association for the Deaf and Mute, since being approved for organization by the Central Training Department, has begun soliciting members and actively preparing for its establishment. Currently, it has 145 members in Shanghai, 28 members in the Peiping branch, and over 20 members each in the Hangzhou and Nanjing branches. The association is scheduled to be formally established today. Details are as follows:

Today's Establishment

The association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting today at 2:00 PM at the Deaf and Mute School of the Qunxue Society on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen, in this city. The agenda includes passing the association's charter, discussing proposals, electing directors, and hearing a speech by Mr. Cai Yuanpei. Representatives from party and government agencies in this city will attend to provide guidance. Wang Xun, Dai Shishi, He Minlin, and others have been appointed as chairmen of the meeting, with Feng Zhongbo as the recorder. According to Wang Xun, the person in charge of the association, who spoke to a reporter yesterday, the instructions from the party and government representatives during the meeting will be recorded by the secretary and then translated into sign language by members to convey their meaning, as all members are deaf and mute, able to see but not hear.

Current Status of the Association

The association was initiated in the spring of the 24th year [of the Republic] by Sun Minsheng, He Yulin, and others, with the support of philanthropist Wang Yiting. They began investigating the names and addresses of fellow sufferers and soliciting founding members. In August of the 25th year, the organization was approved by the Central Party Headquarters, and Chen Jicheng and others involved in deaf and mute education were invited as consultants. A preparatory committee was established to actively recruit members. The recruitment ended on April 15th of this year, and the new address was moved to Yucun, Bair Road. A deaf and mute tutoring school and research classes were established, offering courses in crafts, design, photography, and other subjects. In addition, to universally benefit members, efforts are being made in relief and introduction. Considerable measures have also been taken for the four aspects of education (moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic). A deaf and mute information and writing assistance service has been established, providing members with considerable convenience.

Future Plans

After the association is formally established, it plans to gradually implement the following tasks based on its financial situation: ㊀ Petition the government to establish more public schools for the deaf and mute to universalize deaf and mute education. Request that all state-owned factories give priority to employing deaf and mute workers to alleviate unemployment among the deaf and mute. ㊁ Establish technical research departments for crafts, fine arts, and other skills to develop the deaf and mute's independent skills. ㊂ Promote the four aspects of education to improve the deaf and mute's character, cultivate their intelligence, improve their health, and promote solidarity and mutual assistance to improve their lives and achieve happiness. ㊃ Publish deaf and mute publications to connect feelings, discuss studies, and exchange knowledge.

### Old Clerk Suffering from Syphilis Anally Assaults Apprentice in the Same Workshop

Happened a Total of Five Times; Two Offenders Transferred to the Court for Trial

In the Fuji Leather Workshop located at the west end of Datong Road on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei, there is an apprentice named Xiao Shixiang, 17 years old, from Yancheng. At around 10 PM the night before last, he suddenly ran to his brother, Xiao Shirong, 36 years old, and claimed that Chen Wenyi, 28 years old, from Anhui, and Xiang Guoshun, 32 years old, from Changzhou, who were old clerks in the same workshop, suffered from syphilis and slept in the same bed every night, ordering him to suck their genitals and anally assaulting him five times in total. That night, they forcibly anally assaulted him again, causing injury and swelling in his anus. He fled home to report. After hearing the report, Xiao Shirong observed that his brother had contracted syphilis, so he was very angry. That night, he took his brother to the Taiyang Temple Police Station of the Xinzha Branch Bureau to report. The police were dispatched to arrest Chen Wenyi and Xiang Guoshun, and they were taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation, they were sent to the Xinzha Police Branch Bureau. After further questioning by the bureau officers, the whole story was revealed. Yesterday afternoon, at around 4 PM, Chen Wenyi and Xiang Guoshun were ordered to be transported along with the plaintiff, Xiao Shirong, and the victim, Xiao Shixiang, to the Shanghai District Court for trial.

### Zhu Wengong and Others' Assault Case Under Investigation by the Court

Injuries of the Victims Have Been Ascertained

At the Texaco oil depot wharf near Gaoqiao in Pudong, there were 80 workers, all locals, led by foreman Xie Qiaosheng, specializing in loading and unloading kerosene at the wharf for many years. On the first of this month, Zhu Wengong, a Jiangbei native, led 106 rickshaw pullers, boatmen, peddlers, etc., who had been gathered in advance, each carrying shoulder poles, clubs, axes, iron rods, wooden sticks, etc. They arrived at the wharf on a barge towed by a small steamship and fought with the workers. At that time, all the workers had gone home for lunch. Zhu and his gang, seeing several workers still in the sample room, indiscriminately attacked them with clubs and axes, causing worker Chen Shilin to have his neck broken. Mud mason Yao Guan, old clerk Yang Heshang, and long-term worker Guan Liuxing were injured in their heads, waists, hands, and feet. The delivery room was vandalized. Upon hearing the news, the land police and water patrol immediately dispatched police officers by boat to the wharf, arresting all 106 assailants, including Zhu Wengong, and transferring them to the Procuratorate of the District Court. After a brief interrogation, the assailants, including Zhu Wengong and the others, were ordered to be detained pending verification of the injuries of Chen Shilin and others for further review. It is now learned that the prosecutor handling the case has gone to Tongren Hospital to verify that Chen Shilin's forehead was cut off by an ax and his buttocks were also injured by an ax, which may lead to disability. Yao Guan, Yang Heshang, Guan Liuxing, and others have also reported the case and verified that their heads, waists, and feet were injured by axes and clubs. It was also found that Zhu Wengong was not a foreman at the Texaco Puxi wharf and did not know Xie Qiaosheng. The truth is now being thoroughly investigated for legal action. Therefore, the prosecutor has personally investigated the case in recent days, attaching great importance to it.

### Wuxi Woman Abducted and Forced into Prostitution

Unable to Endure Suffering, She Took Advantage of an Opportunity to Escape; Sent to the Fellow-Townsmen Association for Relief by a Lawyer

Zhu Zhaodi, a 16-year-old woman from Wuxi, used to work in a silk factory in Wuxi, living at No. 163 Houqi Street. In July of last year, she was abducted by a female worker surnamed Chen from the same factory and sold to Wang Linji's Hanzhuang at No. 2 Yinyuli, Gelock Road, Baxianqiao, Shanghai, where she was forced into a life of prostitution. In September, a neighbor caught a glimpse of her and immediately notified Zhaodi's parents to come to Shanghai, who hired lawyer Zhou Yongding to file a lawsuit according to the law. After mediation, Zhaodi was taken back by her parents, but her father was not her biological father and was not a good person. At the end of last year, he resold Zhaodi to Liu Gensheng at No. 14 Xinxingli, Xinzha Road, as an adopted daughter-in-law. Initially, she was only asked to learn dancing, but soon she was sent to the Lido Ballroom to dance as "Sister Chen." However, Liu Gensheng was a rascal who opened a brothel in Shanghai, so he forced Zhaodi to return to prostitution. Knowing that she had been deceived again and unable to bear the suffering, Zhaodi escaped last month and went to lawyer Zhou Yongding for help. Lawyer Zhou, seeing that Zhaodi had not reached the legal age, could not resolve the matter legally, and notified her parents to come to Shanghai, but there was no reply, making it impossible to negotiate. As Zhaodi had contracted syphilis and needed medical expenses, he had no choice but to send her to the Wuxi Sojourners Association in Shanghai for relief. After receiving the letter, the association agreed to help with relief and immediately sent Zhaodi to Sanmin Hospital in Hongkou for treatment.

### Wang Xinshan Accuses Li Jianhua of Fraud

Because the Plaintiff Was Previously Suspected of Assassination, He Privately Entrusted Li to Rescue Him and Now Seeks to Recover the Defrauded Money

Wang Xinshan, a wealthy merchant from Zhoujiaqiao in West Shanghai, was sentenced to death by the collegiate bench of the District Court in March of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] due to suspicion of involvement in the assassination of Jin Menggen. His family was greatly alarmed and ran around seeking rescue. Because he was wealthy, there were many people seeking to exploit him. Among them was a primary school teacher named Li Jianhua, who boasted that he could find a way with the government to release Wang within three days. Wang's wife, unaware of the deception, told Wang Xinshan. Wang, fearing deception, did not agree to a large sum of money but promised payment upon success. As a result, he was still defrauded of over 100 yuan for entertainment expenses. Later, Wang Xinshan's lawsuit was delayed until last year when he was declared innocent by the High Court. After Wang was released from prison, he negotiated with Li to recover the money. Li did not return it, so Wang filed a lawsuit for fraud in the District Court. He was summoned once, but the defendant did not appear. Yesterday, he was summoned again. As the defendant was still in Zhejiang, the plaintiff stated the facts and made considerable accusations. The court adjourned and scheduled another hearing.

As his original residence, the Dadong Hotel, was insufficient for his office, he will move to No. 27 Junyili, Jielu, on the 10th of next month as a place for holding office. From then on, the walls of this room will be full of fine art, and carriages and horses will fill the doorway. The grandeur of the scene can be imagined.

### The Formulation and Implementation of International Labor Conventions (Continued)

— Cheng Haifeng

When under the age of fourteen, one cannot be employed in industrial or commercial work. When under the age of sixteen, one is not allowed to do night work in any industry. When under the age of eighteen, one is not allowed to do night work in most industries. In any industry, working hours cannot exceed forty-eight hours per week. Those employed in the glass bottle manufacturing industry and public works sponsored or subsidized by the government cannot exceed forty hours per week. Anyone who has served for one full year can enjoy annual leave with full pay. If injured due to work or suffering from a serious occupational disease, the law provides compensation and protection, and can be provided with relief from the government-run disease, old age, widowhood, or disability relief funds. Finally, if a person is unfortunately unemployed, there are free employment agencies run by the government to help them find work. During the unemployment period, the living expenses of individuals and families are subsidized by national insurance or relief funds to prevent them from falling into poverty and misery due to unemployment. If their place of work involves international transfer, the vested rights of disease, disability, old age, and widowhood insurance that they are entitled to in their original home country A are not lost due to moving to country B (assuming that country B has also ratified this draft convention). If a person is a sailor, they can request the shipowner and the employment agency run by the sailors to help them find work during the unemployment period. Once employed, they are entitled to all the rights stipulated in the agreement. If a ship is in distress, they can receive a subsidy to return home, and the shipowner must pay compensation during the period of distress and unemployment. When working on a ship, there are prescribed working hours. When ill, there is disease insurance to provide assistance and protection. There are prescribed holidays each year, during which wages are still paid.

### Russian Man Shirkir Sells Pornographic Films

Detective Poses as Theater Representative; Arrested After Second Negotiation

Zhu Shouling, the chief Chinese detective of the Public Concession Police Headquarters, and Bébéning, the Western detective, learned that a Russian man, Shirkir, was selling pornographic and obscene films in Room 226 of No. 131 Museum Road. Zhu, the Chinese detective, disguised himself as a representative of a certain movie theater in Wuxi, planning to purchase the films. He met with Shirkir three days ago. At that time, Shirkir said that there were four films in total, priced at 600 yuan. However, there was only one available that day, so it was immediately screened. Detective Zhu then made an appointment to negotiate again the next morning. The morning before yesterday, at 10:30 AM, the Chinese and Western detectives, accompanied by clerk Yao Tingyao, went and arrested Shirkir, along with the pornographic films, and took them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, prosecuted according to Article 235 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendant Shirkir confessed that the films were old and that he had kept them for more than five years. He was preparing to sell them when the detectives contacted him because he needed money. Judge Ye Shengchao reviewed the confession and ordered the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing. Shirkir was allowed bail of 500 yuan.

### Teachers' Day

— Zhou Ge

Today is June 6th, Teachers' Day. When we think of teachers, we think of university professors, middle school teachers, and elementary school teachers. And these three kinds of "teachers" evoke different feelings in our minds: university professors, pot-bellied, with a large leather bag under their arms, striding high; middle school teachers, much worse than university professors, but much wealthier than the pitiful "elementary school teachers."

Elementary school teachers are the most despised, with demeaning terms like "monkey king" and "sitting on the cold bench" all given to them. The reason why elementary school teachers are despised is because they sit on the "cold bench." Sitting on the "cold bench" is certainly not comparable to pot-bellied university professors or Western-suited middle school teachers. Elementary school teachers wear a bamboo cloth gown or a tight, ill-fitting student uniform. In this modern age that values clothing over people, who else would be despised if not elementary school teachers?

Elementary school teachers can also be roughly divided into three types. The first type is rural teachers, who can be hired for a year for 50 yuan, which is extremely "cheap." The second type is county or municipal elementary school teachers. Although their material enjoyment is still okay, "arrears in wages" will make it impossible for you to support even your wife! The third type is elementary school teachers in Shanghai's alleyway elementary schools. These elementary school teachers live the hardest life. Those with a monthly salary of 20 yuan can be considered "squeaking and squawking." They meow and bark all day long and still have to face the cold faces of the school owners. The fear of "unemployment" often flows in their subconscious. And these elementary school teachers are even more despised. Because not only do their appearances make people uncomfortable, but their personalities also seem not very noble, especially because there are often news stories about them in the newspapers, such as a teacher from a certain school who stole money from a colleague a few days ago to play around at West Lake in Hangzhou and then committed suicide. People only see these superficial phenomena, but underneath them lies a tragic and bitter life.

On the elementary school teacher side, they are always depressed and sighing all day long, with indescribable bitterness. Of course, who would feel happy in such an environment? However, we should temporarily sacrifice our own happiness. Millions of children are waiting for us to educate them well. During the Franco-Prussian War, Prussia's victory was said to be entirely due to the efforts of elementary school teachers. Although this is a bit of an exaggeration, the greatness of the power of elementary school teachers can be seen from this. We must grit our teeth and endure all the hardships of life. Millions of children are ours. We must make them "people"! We must take on the great responsibility of "saving the children."

### "New Earth"?

— Zhi'er

A few days ago, the Soviet Embassy in China invited military and political figures from this city to watch a military documentary "Strike Back at the Strikers." According to those who have seen it, this film not only shows the Soviet Union's orderly and great military strength and equipment but also has a theme that is very fitting to the title: "Strike Back at the Strikers!" It tells us that the Soviet Union has no ambition to invade other countries, but when faced with enemy attacks, it will retaliate even more fiercely. Near the end of the film, it is said that there is a close-up of a representative of our "friendly country" looking shocked after watching the inspection. It seems that, to use a most fashionable saying, this is truly "rather be a broken jade than a whole tile." And it is precisely this spirit of "striking back at the strikers" that made the representative of our "friendly country" unable to help but be shocked!

The Shanghai Grand Theater, which screened this film that day, had been destroyed by the "civilized" Italian army for publicly screening the "Abyssinia Documentary." It is still under renovation and preparing to reopen. But in the Shanghai Concession, which is nominally still Chinese territory, there is a film jointly produced by Japan and Germany, called "New Earth," being screened at the Donghe Theater. Its content is entirely propaganda for the puppet organization, encouraging Japanese people to immigrate to Manchukuo. The film was directed by the famous German producer Dr. Arnold Fanck, and took a year to complete, costing 700,000 yen.

We have heard about this film for a long time. And now, this "New Earth" film, which "promotes the puppet organization and encourages Japanese people to immigrate to Manchukuo," is being screened openly on Chinese territory!

Mr. Shao Lizi once "advised" against the performance of "Sai Jinhua" because it did not conform to the "broken jade" spirit. That kind of bitterness is worthy of our admiration. However, what measures will be taken against the "New Earth" film, which openly promotes the puppet organization and encourages Japanese people to immigrate to Manchukuo? Is it to "preserve friendship" and "keep the tile whole," or to disregard everything and resolutely rise up and "rather be a broken jade"!

Italian soldiers used force to destroy a film that had been "re-examined" and passed by the Central Film Censorship Committee. This has not been resolved until now. For the sake of national dignity, and to be more practical, for the sake of the future of the nation, can we allow a propaganda film that "promotes the puppet organization" to be screened publicly in Shanghai, throughout the country, and around the world?
