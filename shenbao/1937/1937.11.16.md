### British Privy Councillor to Visit Berlin Tomorrow, Engaging in Talks with German Authorities; Belgian King to Visit Britain Today

[London] Privy Councillor Lord Halifax is scheduled to depart for Germany on November 17th. This is the result of consultations between British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Lord Halifax. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden returned here this afternoon from Brussels. He immediately went to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street to discuss Lord Halifax's visit to Berlin with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Privy Councillor Lord Halifax. The Lord is scheduled to depart on the 17th of this month. Furthermore, regarding Anglo-Italian relations, diplomatic circles here recently stated that after the British Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, held preliminary talks with Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano, he realized that there was no possibility of rapprochement between the two sides. Therefore, the formal negotiations that should take place between Britain and Italy may not begin in the near future. (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas)

[Berlin] Regarding British Privy Councillor Lord Halifax's visit to Germany, the semi-official political and diplomatic correspondence agency recently published an article commenting on it, using extremely strong language. It even suggested that Mr. Halifax should postpone his visit. In addition, British newspapers recently published news saying that Germany might abandon its demand to recover its colonies. The political and diplomatic correspondence agency also denied this claim. Diplomatic circles here are very surprised by the agency's remarks. Political figures said that Lord Halifax is scheduled to come to Berlin within this week, and the government has already made preparations to welcome him. Observers believe that the agency is the mouthpiece of Führer Hitler, and its claims are sufficient to represent the views held by the German authorities. Before conducting talks with Britain, Germany had already declared its position, insisting on recovering its former colonies. Therefore, the difficult future of Anglo-German talks can be foreseen. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

[Berlin] Foreign newspapers have made many speculations about the future talks between German Führer Hitler and British Privy Councillor Lord Halifax. German newspapers today specifically published an article by the National Socialist Party's news agency to refute them. Most newspapers say that Britain is willing to make peace with Germany, but none of the newspapers mentioned what the two countries will discuss. As for the issue of Germany's demand for colonies, the newspapers debated fiercely a few days ago, but now they no longer mention a word. According to the National Socialist Party's news agency, the German people already know the opinions of Britain and France on the colonial issue and will now quietly await new developments. As for the claim that Germany wants to contact Western European countries in order to establish four-nation talks, the news agency said that Germany has no disputes with these countries. Germany does not want to cover up the shameful failure of international conferences that are about to collapse (presumably referring to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference) with a new international conference. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)

[Rome] Regarding the separate talks between Britain and Italy and Germany, the Stanpa newspaper here recently commented that British Prime Minister Chamberlain seems to have made up his mind this time to move forward without hesitation. This move is not only based on good intentions, but also because the end of the Sino-Japanese dispute and the Spanish civil war has become clear. Britain's past policies failed to adapt to the reality of the situation. Although the signs of change have only appeared today, it is not too late. As for France, it has felt indignant after being surprised and has complaints. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas)

Qingyang Port as a River Line of Defense, Our Enemy Will Launch a Fierce Battle; Enemy Landing at Baimaokou, We Abandon Taicang; Enemy in Jiashan Defeated by Our Army Yesterday; Stubborn Enemy at Wangjiangjing Under Encirclement and Blockade

For days, the enemy's main force has concentrated on the left wing, fiercely attacking our Fengjing and Jiashan, and then moving laterally towards Wangjiangjing in an attempt to cut off the connection between our Suzhou-Jiashan Road. Our army has closely blocked and intercepted them, and reinforcements are arriving one after another to fight. A fierce bloody battle is unfolding near Wangjiangjing, and the stubborn enemy has been surrounded by us. As for the enemy's right wing, after our defending troops in Jiading voluntarily moved to a new position, the enemy actively reorganized and prepared. At the same time, more than 70 enemy ships gathered in the Liuhe-Baimaokou area, using dense artillery fire to bombard our position day and night. Our fortifications were destroyed. In order to avoid excessive sacrifices, we had to retreat slightly. In the early morning, under the cover of artillery fire, a large number of enemy troops landed at various ports, with a force of more than one division. Villages near Hengjing, Luhe Town, Guijiazhuang, Hejiashi, and other villages have been ravaged. Enemy cavalry charged into Zhitang and looked east along the highway towards Taicang. Another route came from Liuhe Luduqiao. Our Taicang defending troops had built very strong fortifications early on and calmly responded to the battle. The enemy attacked fiercely several times but was repelled. In the early morning, the two sides fought fiercely, and artillery fire filled the sky. The enemy corpses were everywhere. They retreated and advanced repeatedly. Our army, with the first line of fortifications broken by the enemy, had to retreat painfully and join forces with the Jiading defending troops, firmly defending the line of Waigang, Tianfu Temple, and Pengwen Town. The enemy landed in large numbers on the right wing, apparently adopting a large-scale encirclement strategy from the left and right to put pressure on our Suzhou-Kunshan line. Since the night before, dozens of enemy heavy artillery pieces have concentrated on bombarding our positions in Waigang and other places. The enemy infantry, about a brigade, and more than 40 tanks also launched a large-scale attack in separate routes. The two armies fought a bloody melee. For strategic reasons, our army was ordered yesterday morning to move to and defend the Qingyang Port line. The two sides are facing each other across the river, and a fierce battle will unfold within days. The rumbling artillery fire and machine gun fire in Kunshan City can be heard clearly. Our line has strong forces, and everything has been fully prepared long ago, enough to fight the enemy. The enemy's propaganda yesterday claimed to have captured Kunshan, which is absolutely not true. In addition, more than 30 enemy planes flew to Kunshan, Suzhou, and the railway, highway, and river lines along Suzhou and Jiaxing yesterday morning, wantonly bombing them in an attempt to destroy our transportation and transportation. Large fires broke out in Suzhou, Kunshan, and Jiaxing, and the destruction of civilian houses was extremely tragic, but the damage to our military fortifications and transportation was still slight.

Our Army Firmly Defends Qingyang Port; Enemy Troops Landed at Baimaokou; Our Army Slightly Retreats in Taicang

After our army abandoned Nanxiang and Jiading, the enemy gathered a large fleet on the river surface of Nantong Haimen to threaten our rear, with a total of fifty or sixty ships. The night before, the enemy ships first used artillery fire to fiercely bombard the river banks of Liuhe, Baimaokou, and Hupu. Our defending troops were prepared early on and calmly responded to the battle. However, due to the enemy ships' unusually fierce artillery fire, which densely bombarded them all night, our army's fortifications along the river were slightly damaged. In order to avoid excessive sacrifices, they slightly retreated. The enemy troops took the opportunity to land successively at Baimaokou. Our army bravely rose up to meet them and strictly blocked and intercepted them. The enemy troops then collapsed southward, and the villages of Hengjing and Guijiazhuang were successively invaded. Then they fled south to Zhitang and peered at our Taicang along the highway. At the same time, the enemy troops in Liuhe also attacked southwest. Our army in Taicang had extremely strong fortifications. After a day and night of bloody battle, our army firmly defended without retreating and doubled its bravery, killing countless enemies. Finally, because the Taicang position was too prominent, it painfully retreated and joined the troops in the Nanxiang and Jiading area, firmly defending the line of Tianfu Temple and Lujiabang, and confronted the enemy army across Qingyang Port. The iron bridge had been bombed by enemy planes. The Qingyang Port river surface is vast, and our army has strong fortifications along the river. The enemy army will definitely have difficulty crossing. Yesterday morning, a large number of enemy planes were wantonly bombing the Kunshan area, and enemy artillery was fiercely bombarding our Kunshan positions, but the damage was very small. Our army's right-wing battle, since the enemy army attempted to invade our Suzhou-Jiashan Railway, was defeated by our army near Wangjiangjing Station on the Suzhou-Jiashan Highway. At the moment, the two armies are still in a stalemate east of Jiashan Station. The enemy in Songjiang is attempting to invade the Suzhou-Jiashan Railway by waterway, and our army is closely monitoring it.

Enemy Plainclothes Police Survey Customs Interior; Twelve Large and Small Patrol Ships Occupied; Dredging Bureau's Dredgers Also Hijacked

The enemy is rumored to be planning action against the Customs. Yesterday they sent several plainclothes police officers to survey and ask in detail about the internal organization. Their intentions are difficult to fathom. Also, the customs' twelve large and small patrol ships, including Fuxing, Wenxing, Liuxing, and Huaxing Lianxing, were all moored on the Bund outside the French Concession. At 10:30 yesterday morning, the enemy navy seized them and drove the sailors and Chinese and foreign employees ashore without harming them. In addition, the world's largest dredger, owned by the Dredging Bureau, was also hijacked by the enemy, but the employees on board were not driven away.

The English "Great America Evening Post" said that twelve customs patrol boats, including the larger Fuxing, Liuxing, Wenxing, and Huaxing, were all occupied by the Japanese authorities at 10:00 AM this morning (the 15th). Chinese and foreign personnel on the ships were ordered to leave the ships and land. The ships are now moored in the Huangpu River on the Bund of the French Concession, and Japanese naval forces are stationed on them.

Central News Agency said that since our army withdrew from Pudong, the enemy army landed, and unscrupulous people have been acting as accomplices, causing constant disturbances. Residents of various cities and towns have left their homes and fled to Shanghai, gathering in Pubin. The Pudong Township Association has specially dispatched commissioners to work with the police of the Public Works Department to take care of them at the pier and provide vehicles for transportation, and the order is well maintained. It is said that Pudong has a vast area, so the enemy traces are only along the Pu River. As for Yangjing District and Tangqiao District, south to Minhang, Xiao is maintaining its Pudong River transportation. As for Chuansha County and the coastal areas, there are still no enemy troops, and the Shangchuan Railway is still connected from Chuansha City to Xinlu Town.

Eight Enemy Ships Sail into Southern Huangpu

A Record of the Fall of the Pudong South Coastline

Enemy Disguised as Fishermen Landed Through the Wind and Fog; Two Months Ago, the Enemy Occupied Sijiao Mountain

After the enemy landed in Jinshanwei, the Pudong South Coastline fell one after another. News from all sides is like entering a dumb gourd, and it is difficult to get details. Now, according to Wang, an old commissary in a certain soy sauce garden in Nanhui Xinchang who fled to Shanghai, he and others came out on the afternoon of the 11th. Although no enemy traces were found at that time, the situation was tense, and everyone fled. Local hooligans took the opportunity to rob, and the road was blocked. They rested in Datuan and Zhoupu, and met six or seven enemy teams the next morning (the 12th). They were ordered to investigate. At the same time, many people came from Nangiao along the Nanhuangpu River from Zhanggang. According to reports, before the enemy troops arrived, local hooligans robbed door-to-door. They formed a group to escape after the enemy teams arrived. Fengcheng dropped 21 bombs, and it has become a scorched earth. There is less damage in Jinhui Bridge and other places that are far from the sea. As for Caojing and Zhalin, which are close to the coast, Yang Heshang, a farmer, said yesterday that he had crossed Mishidu from Shanyang and Zhangze two days after the enemy ships landed (i.e., the 7th) and took the Red Cross car to Shanghai. According to him, at 4:00 AM on the 4th, when our army was transferring defenses, hundreds of fishing boats equipped with machine guns were used. Dozens of the leading boats were fishermen, and the enemy was lurking in the cabins. In the wind and fog, they landed from Jinshanwei Jinshanzui in the middle, on the north and south coasts. Although the coast is iron plate sand, and fishing boats are occasionally parked on weekdays, there are very few people going up and down. The enemy forced people to guide the way, and they swarmed up. The left wing attacked Caojing from Jinshanwei. A certain marshal rushed to resist and retreated after fighting for two hours. Later, a certain regiment came from Pubin to reinforce and attacked together, intercepting the enemy in Tinglin and other places. The right wing went straight from Jinshanwei to Zhangyan and reached Songyin to reach Mishidu. Before he left, he saw shallow-water speedboats parked in the Jinshanwei Jinshanzui area, and transportation was busy. Twenty-six enemy ships were originally anchored outside Jinshanmen, opposite Jinshanzui. They have successively sailed to Zhapu in Hangzhou Bay. Chenshan (i.e., Jinshan) and Sijiao Mountain, about three or four hundred miles away from Jinshanzui, were occupied by the enemy two months ago. They built docks, highways, and airfields. Recently, planes bombing the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have departed from here. The enemy also has military facilities on Tanxushan and Xiaowangpan Island (about 100 miles away from Jinshanzui). Hundreds of large and small fishing boats that were seized are parked nearby for enemy transportation. The enemy has made this an important base for attacking Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Jiangzhe Rebellion in the Ming Jiajing year also followed this route. Unexpectedly, more than 300 years later, they are still copying the old articles to spy on our hinterland. It is painful to say. As for the nearby cities and towns, such as Jinsiniang Bridge, Jiangzhuang, Shanyang, Tinglin, and the areas along the Pu River, such as Yexie and Zhangze, there was once a battle, and there was a lot of destruction. When he escaped, he was repeatedly in danger. He also encountered an enemy plainclothes team near Zhangze. After checking and confirming that he was not suspicious, he was given a pass written in Japanese on a white paper strip with ink, and he was spared. However, he was still charged a fee before the ferry.

Shanghai Concession Security Issue is Currently Under Discussion; It is Too Early

[London] Regarding the future status of the Shanghai Concession, there is naturally much speculation, but at present, the authorities do not show any signs of wanting to explore this issue. The conditions for discussing this matter at this time are too early. Since the Japanese army has won around Shanghai, the security of the French Concession and the Public Concession has become an urgent issue in the adjacent Chinese territories under Japanese military occupation. Representatives of the United States, Britain, and France at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference discussed this section, but there was no panic. Everyone felt that the contact between the foreign authorities stationed in Shanghai and the Japanese authorities was sufficient to produce the necessary methods of activity. London has great confidence in Consul General Phillips, stationed in Shanghai, who has the ability to consult with Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, and Major General Smallie, Commander of the British Army, to protect British interests, especially since Mr. Howe, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, recently went to Shanghai and was said to have strongly assisted Phillips in successfully establishing satisfactory contacts with the Japanese military and civilian authorities in Shanghai, greatly improving

After our Kunshan garrison retreated, the enemy probed Changshu from two directions, with fierce fighting. A bloody battle raged in Jiashan for three days and nights, after which our army retreated to Jiaxing. Pinghu is still being defended by our army, which has repelled stubborn enemies. The war situation on the Suzhou-Jiaxing line has become relatively stable. The enemy's right wing, after landing in large numbers at Liuhe, Qi Kou, Baibukou, and other places, actively advanced, and the villages and towns of Fuqiao, Hengjing, Luhe, Hupukou, Wujia Shi, Hejia Shi, Guijia Zhuang, Zhitang, Shatou, and Luduqiao were all devastated. Due to strategic considerations, our army withdrew from Jiading and Taicang. The enemy then increased pressure from Penglang Zhen and Waigang. On the main front, they advanced west along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line, crossing Tianfu'an. Our army quickly retreated to Qingyanggang, fighting the enemy across the river. Eventually, due to overwhelming artillery fire, we moved to a new defensive position in Kunshan yesterday morning. The two armies engaged in fierce fighting all day. Last night, a corner of our city wall was breached by enemy mechanized units, leading to intense street fighting. A portion of the defending troops made heroic sacrifices, while the rest retreated to defend the Zhengyi-Miaoting line. Another enemy force, passing through Huchongkou and Meili, probed south towards Changshu. The enemy at Zhitang also crossed the Baimao River to the north, attempting to attack from both sides. The situation in Changshu is extremely critical. Our Changshu garrison is fighting bravely, and the bloody battle continues. The enemy's plan is clearly to capture Changshu and then probe towards Wuxi in one direction and threaten the flank of our Suzhou in the other, achieving a linear connection with their left wing, encircling us from both sides, so that their forces on the main front along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line can advance rapidly. We have seen through their plot and are engaging them on multiple fronts, inflicting heavy casualties. As for the enemy's left wing, which landed at Jinshanwei, one force advanced on Jiashan via Songjiang and Fengjing. Our army retreated while fighting, engaging in bloody battles for three days and nights, and finally retreated to Jiaxing last night. Another enemy force attacked Pinghu from ZhaPu. Pinghu is currently being defended by our army, and the fighting in the vicinity is extremely fierce. The enemy at Wangjiangjing was tightly surrounded by us. A small group managed to break through into Pingwang territory but has been completely annihilated by our forces. As of noon today, the situation on the Suzhou-Jiaxing road is relatively stable. This morning, large numbers of enemy planes carried out indiscriminate bombing in Suzhou, Jiaxing, Changshu, Pinghu, and other places, causing widespread fires and devastation. The scene is horrific.

A Central News Agency dispatch from Hangzhou on the 15th reports that enemy planes have been bombing Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pingwang, and ZhaPu for days, destroying most of the civilian housing. The enemy in Jiashan advanced along the railway line on the evening of the 14th and was intercepted by us near Qiliqiao. Fierce fighting continued until noon on the 15th. The battle situation in Pingwang is also intense. Our position was breached by the enemy but is currently being counter-attacked. The enemy forces are attempting to consolidate their advance on the Suzhou-Jiaxing line.

### Kunshan Our troops withdrew west last night Pinghu is still firmly defended by our troops

After the enemy forces landed at Baimaokou the night before last, they moved south to Zhitang. At the same time, enemy forces from Liuhe and Jiading advanced north, and our army in Taicang, facing attack from both front and rear, had no choice but to make a strategic retreat and defend the Qingyanggang line in Kunshan. The enemy in Zhitang attacked south again yesterday. At the same time, due to the retreat of our troops in Qingpu, Qingyanggang in Kunshan also became untenable yesterday. However, our army remained calm and fought back without showing any fear. Last night, the enemy, with a large mechanized force, crossed Qingyanggang under heavy artillery cover and launched a fierce attack on Kunshan. Although our army was surrounded on three sides, it still defended Kunshan Station and Kunshan City without retreating. After fierce fighting all day and night, both sides suffered extremely heavy casualties. The fighting continued until midnight, and finally, because all the fortifications were destroyed and the corner of the city was bombed, our army reluctantly left Kunshan and moved back along the railway line, where it has already deployed its position on the Zhengyi front line. The enemy forces occupied Kunshan and moved a large force to Zhitang, with the intention of attacking our Changshu along the highway. The Taihu Lake area, with its network of waterways, would be a dead end for the enemy forces if they were to penetrate deep into it.

On our army's right wing, the enemy forces also launched a large-scale attack yesterday. The enemy invaded our Jiaxing and Pinghu lines in two directions. Our army in Jiashan, after several days and nights of bloody fighting, and also because of the enemy's intrusion at Wangjiangjing, also shifted slightly westward yesterday, and is now deploying its position at Jiuli, ten kilometers east of Jiaxing. After being surrounded by us, the enemy at Wangjiangjing fled west along the Suzhou-Jiaxing road to Pingwang. The enemy forces also fled from Songjiang to various places via small roads, attempting to land in Pingwang. Our army in that area has strengthened its surveillance. Our army's fortifications on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway are very solid. The few remaining enemy forces in Wangjiangjing and Pingwang have been surrounded and wiped out by our army. The entire Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway line has now become stable. The line southwest of Jiaxing is also very solid. Pinghu is in the hands of our army. The enemy forces have attacked several times from Xincang and other places, but have all been repelled by our army. Our army has deployed a very strong defensive position from Pinghu along the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway to Changshu, in this lake-filled Taihu Lake area.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy forces on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line attacked from the front and were driven back by our army in Jiashan. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy knew that they could not attack lightly, so they changed their attack from the right wing and attacked Wangjiangjing and Pingwang. These two places are important strongholds on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway line for our national defense line, with very solid defensive fortifications and lakes as their screen. Therefore, although the enemy forces have approached the area, it is very difficult for them to succeed.

The enemy attempted to land between ZhaPu and Haiyan but was repelled

A Central News Agency dispatch from Hangzhou on the 16th reports that on the afternoon of the 14th, a unit of enemy forces took the opportunity to cross the river and land at Shengdiandai between ZhaPu and Haiyan but was repelled by us. Also, on the 14th, a total of more than 20 enemy warships continuously shelled Haiyan and Yaochang, and enemy planes also constantly reconnoitered the coastal area of Yuyao, seemingly with intentions. In the Jiashan area, our army is currently advancing towards Pinghu.

A Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 16th reports that according to Chinese sources today, after the Chinese army withdrew from Jiading and Taicang, it is now fighting the Japanese army near Qingyanggang on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The main force of the Japanese army is currently advancing northwest along the Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway and is said to have been blocked in Jiashan. The Chinese army in that area is currently advancing towards Pinghu. Near Suzhou, a large Chinese army is now concentrated, with its left wing defending the strongholds near Fushan and its right wing defending the positions near Jiaxing and Jiashan. The Chinese army in the Jiaxing area is commanded by Zhang Fakui. The Chinese army's second line of defense is near Wuxi.

The enemy did not land at Zhenhai or Ping'an

A telegram from Ningbo to Shanghai reports details of the bombing

According to Shenshi News Agency, there are rumors in Shanghai that another fierce battle has broken out in the Zhenhai area because the Japanese side attempted to land. However, according to a reporter's inquiries with relevant parties, they have just received a telegram from Ningbo stating that this is not the case. After our authorities blockaded the Yongjiang River a few days ago, the coastal defense in that area is now unusually solid, and any attempt by any party will definitely fail. Therefore, this news is the same as the rumor that the Japanese landed in Guanhaiwei a few days ago.

According to Huadong News Agency, after the news of enemy planes bombing the north bank of the Yongjiang River in Ningbo on the 12th spread, people from Ningbo living in Shanghai were greatly shocked. A certain gentleman from Ningbo living in Shanghai specially dispatched a certain commissioner on the Enderby to Ningbo on the 13th to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Because the Zhenhai port was blockaded, the ship was originally scheduled to dock at Zhoushan, and passengers were transferred to Yong via Chuanshan by car. At 4:00 a.m. on the 14th, the Enderby had arrived in Zhoushan when it suddenly received a report that the Zhenhai port was not completely blockaded. For the convenience of passengers, it sailed back to Zhenhai and went directly to the north bank of the Yongjiang River. The gentleman initially planned to return to Shanghai on the original ship to report the detailed findings to the Ningbo people living in Shanghai. However, the ship received an order from the authorities yesterday, preventing it from returning to Shanghai as scheduled. Therefore, the gentleman was also stranded in Ningbo. A long-distance phone call was made to Shanghai this morning, stating that at 0:05 noon on the 12th, five enemy planes were spotted over Ningbo, taking off from outside Zhenhai Port and flying directly to the railway station, dropping a total of eight bombs. The targets that were bombed included the storage depot on Yongcao Road, the Huaan Hotel, the residence of a certain Qiu family on Hengshan Old Street, Tianfuzhan Alley, the back alley of Hengyuli on Manao Road, Lijie, Delan Pond, the Zheng family's flat, the Ma family's house, and the Tongyun bus station was also bombed. Three bombs were also dropped on Kongpu Station, all hitting their targets. Three sailboats from Yuyao to Ningbo happened to be docked on the river surface at Zhanggongci Pier, and were bombed and sunk. In this incident, more than 200 houses were destroyed, most of them collapsed from the tremors, more than 40 people were killed, and 57 people were injured, all of whom are being rescued and treated by the Red Swastika Society, the Red Cross Society, and various hospitals. The gentleman has prepared a detailed survey form.

A large fire in Pudong destroyed hundreds of houses

After a fire broke out on Laiyidu Street in Pudong yesterday and completely destroyed it, the flames had not been extinguished last night and spread in all directions to the streets behind and to the east and west. More than 80 civilian houses in the areas of Xishou Ferry, Beilu Ferry, Zhonglu, and Ferry Road were all destroyed. On the east end of the street, the fire spread to the Mianfang at the intersection of Police Station Road and Haishang Road. The four-story building, which had been around for a long time, was also reduced to ashes. In total, about 200 municipal houses and more than 300 civilian houses were destroyed in one day and night. This morning, fires were also burning at the east end of Diandang Lane and the Huayuan Stone Bridge, but they were not very intense. In the morning, the enemy forces ordered the poor people who had not escaped to clean up the rubble and charred wood on Laiyidu Street, and each person was released after working for four hours. According to those who escaped from Pudong, only the SongSheng Sauce Garden on Laiyidu was spared because of its high walls, but the oil and soy sauce that was stored inside had been stolen. The post office suffered minor damage due to the solid structure of the building.

Our army has new deployments on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, firmly defending the south bank of the Yellow River

[Jinan] Our army has new deployments for the battles on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and is determined to firmly defend the south bank of the Yellow River. A certain iron bridge was destroyed by us last night. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)

Enemy warships shelled the sea off Zhenhai Three Li

Sailboats attempted to approach the shore but were repelled by our army

[Ningbo] At 11:00 a.m. on the 15th, an enemy warship fired five shots off the coast of Zhenhai Sanlili to cover four sailboats approaching the shore, one of which was sunk by our defending troops, killing several enemy soldiers. The remaining ships retreated with the warship. (Special dispatch on the 15th)

The enemy spies on Nan'ao

[Shantou] At 1:15 p.m. on the 15th, an enemy plane flew from Taiwan to spy on Raoping Nan'ao and circled for a moment before fleeing south. Recently, the enemy has sent a large number of Japanese ronin to sneak into Nan'ao, plotting activities. Upon receiving the report, the authorities ordered the garrison to strengthen its defense.

Jiang Dingwen discusses the war situation

Local advances and retreats are irrelevant to the overall situation

[Xi'an] Jiang Dingwen made a statement to reporters at his official residence on the 15th, explaining the current war situation, the position of Shaanxi, the conscription of soldiers in the countryside, and the management of wounded soldiers. First, he said that our resistance over the past three or four months has fully demonstrated our determination to resist aggression from above and below. The enemy has only gained a line of land along the railway, which may be cut off by us at any time. The so-called deep penetration of the isolated army is extremely dangerous. Our goal is long-term resistance. The longer the front, the more difficult it is for the enemy to support. The longer the war, the more the enemy consumes. Recently, there have been small setbacks, which is a necessary process in the midst of resistance. Recently, a few people have shown signs of decadence, which is due to their limited vision. It must be known that the advances and retreats in the situation and the gains and losses in the locality are irrelevant to the overall situation. We must be determined and united from above and below to resist to the end and achieve final victory. As for the provinces of Shaanxi, Pi, Lin, Shanxi, and Sui, which are close to the war zone, the mountains and valleys are not enough to be dangerous. The people of the three Qins should always be as if they are on the front line, and do not let go of the slightest opportunity to prepare to kill the enemy. Then, we can destroy the enemy and defend the territory. The enemy's dream of galloping across the Yellow River will eventually be shattered by us. He then said that recently, some unscrupulous people in the Shaanxi countryside have taken the opportunity to cause trouble. Although they are a small number of bad apples, they are a stain on the majority. In addition to strictly restricting them, they should be investigated and punished. Finally, Jiang expressed his condolences to the wounded soldiers who came to Shaanxi for treatment and said that if there are a few unscrupulous people who abandon their honor and cause trouble, they should be punished according to the law to maintain discipline and public order.

The Beijing Conference adjourns after passing a declaration condemning Japan

It will reconvene next Monday to decide on a common stance
We demand that the powers impose sanctions on Japan

[Nanjing] According to diplomatic sources, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference believes that if Japan continues to ignore advice, it will decide to consider taking common steps. Recently, rumors have spread that Italy will act as a mediator, but it is understood that there is no basis for this and that the international community does not believe it is possible. China has long been determined to resist the war and expects the Nine-Power Treaty to jointly sanction Japan. (Special dispatch on the 15th)

⊙Brussels After lengthy discussions, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed a declaration today: 1. It expressed regret that Japan refused to attend the meeting. 2. It acknowledged that the current conflict was not a matter to be resolved directly between China and Japan. 3. It stated that if Japan continued to refuse to participate in the talks, the powers would have to consider what common attitude they should adopt. Italy voted against this declaration, while Norway, Sweden, and Denmark stated that they did not object to the declaration but did not wish to vote and therefore abstained. The Italian representative said that this declaration did not facilitate mediation. The conference then adjourned until 3:00 p.m. on November 22nd.

The most important difference between the declaration passed today and the draft declaration submitted on Saturday was that all references to the League of Nations were deleted. When abstaining, the Swedish representative expressed regret that the conference had failed to find a solution, saying that Sweden accepted the wording of the draft declaration in principle, but that Sweden did not have as many vested interests in the Far East as other countries and therefore decided not to vote. The Norwegian representative made a similar statement. The Danish representative spoke, first lamenting the failure of mediation, and then saying that Denmark also considered it appropriate not to vote, but fully agreed with the principles contained in the declaration. The Italian chief representative said that the declaration opened not a door to a solution, but a door to making the situation even more serious, and that Italy fully reserved its attitude for the future. British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden is expected to return to Brussels at the end of this week, at which time he will have the opportunity to continue talks with the US chief representative, Norman Davis, who is currently in Brussels. French Chief Representative Jean Herbette will also return to Brussels at the end of this week. Therefore, by the time the next Nine-Power Treaty Conference convenes, the powers will have fully decided on their "common attitude." The draft declaration was originally drafted by the US delegation, and representatives of all countries except Italy had no objections. The wording of the declaration fully expresses the considered opinions of the participating countries.

In order to encourage the powers to adopt effective economic sanctions against Japan, the Chinese delegation has issued a 12-page document outlining the extent to which the Japanese economy is dependent on the outside world.

The declaration states that South Africa, the United States, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, and the Soviet Union regret that Japan still believes that the Sino-Japanese conflict is not within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty and has repeatedly refused to exchange views to find a peaceful solution. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

⊙Brussels According to conference sources, most of the countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty are deeply aware of the importance of their responsibility in mediating the Sino-Japanese war. Now that Japan's reply has firmly expressed its refusal, the countries can only begin to ban all arms and raw materials from being transported to Japan. This measure will not be established by a secret agreement between the signatory countries, but will be presented for public discussion at the next meeting.

Compensation for damage to British citizens in Shanghai
A question raised by a member of the British House of Commons
The status of the concession will not be shaken

[London] The British House of Commons today discussed the compensation for damage suffered by British citizens in the Shanghai International Settlement due to Sino-Japanese hostilities. The matter was first raised by Conservative MP Patrick Hannon. Hannon asked Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden whether he could instruct the British Consul-General in Shanghai to do his best to assist British citizens in preparing claims for compensation, and that particular assistance should be given to lower-middle-class British citizens residing in Hongkou and Yangshupu, whose property has been completely destroyed. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne replied that he believed that the Consul-General in Shanghai was already doing his best to provide assistance, as the Consul-General had been instructed to assist in the preparation of compensation claims for these British citizens to the extent possible. British citizens in the above two areas whose property has been occupied by Japanese troops should prepare claims for compensation for any damage. Claims may be prepared for all property that has been bombed or that has been lost due to being denied entry. All claims should be sent to the British Consul-General immediately. Conservative MP Sir Bracewell Smith asked whether the Japanese occupation of Shanghai affected the status of the International Settlement. Cranborne replied that the land regulations governing the status of the International Settlement would not be changed by these hostilities and that, with the exception of a few occasional incidents, there had been no interference from foreign troops or representatives.

[London] British Lord Privy Seal Earl of Halifax is scheduled to depart for Germany from here tomorrow afternoon. Labour MP George Mortimer has questioned in the House of Commons whether Halifax's trip is purely private and informal, and whether the Prime Minister can guarantee that an official announcement will be issued to the public regarding the meeting. The Prime Minister replied that he could give that guarantee. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 16th)

An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council discusses the food situation in Shanghai
Not as serious as people think
Progress expected in the coming weeks

The North-China Daily News reports that a Municipal Council official told a reporter from the North-China Daily News yesterday that the food problem in Shanghai should be alleviated as soon as the fighting in Shanghai stops, as the real shortage of various foods, or the high prices caused by merchants profiteering, will be reduced to their original state. The shipping routes to Shanghai are gradually recovering, and vegetables, meat, and various everyday foods can be transported from various places near Shanghai to meet needs and lower prices. Although there is an apparent lack of food at present, it is said that it is not serious and not as bad as the general public imagines.

The source of vegetables in the Pudong and western Shanghai areas has been cut off, which was felt on Sunday, but the situation yesterday has improved significantly. The Japanese authorities occupying these two areas have allowed farmers to transport vegetables into the concession, but they are not allowed to return to western Shanghai and Pudong after entering the concession. The Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities are currently negotiating to resolve this difficulty.

During the fighting, fresh vegetables were transported into Shanghai as usual, but in slightly smaller quantities. Although the sources and supplies near Shanghai were cut off due to the fighting, vegetables were still available from other sources. Large quantities of vegetables have been transported in by farmers in the past three weeks. A large supply had been prepared when the fighting moved to the Hongqiao area and can still be supplied.

Usually, cattle, sheep, and pigs are transported from Songjiang, Minhang, Kunshan, Pudong, and various parts of Jiangsu. Due to the fighting, the sources from these roads have been reduced. Most of the meat has been transported from Minhang and Hongqiao, and vegetables have been obtained from Dachang, Jiangwan, Liuhe, Luodian, Jiading, Fanwangdu, and other places. Later, these places became the front line of the war. Therefore, most of the supplies were changed to being transported from Pudong and other areas in western Shanghai. Fruits are transported from Yantai, Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Ningbo. There was no shortage of fruits during the fighting. Ships along the coast transported large quantities of fruits as usual. The fruit supply situation is now better than it was in September.

Large quantities of fresh fish and some fresh meat are still stored in cold storage in the Hongkou area. Since there is sufficient supply of fresh fish in both concessions, there is no need to ship out these stocks at this time. Canned foods are plentiful and have been imported as usual during the fighting.

Merchants have taken advantage of this to profit in the past three months, and the Municipal Council party has been unable to intervene. Due to the shortage of sources, various prices have risen several times, but in the recent quantity period, it is expected that there will be significant progress in general.

The fire in Nanshi gradually dies down

The fire in Nanshi gradually died down this morning, but the fires in Zhaojiabang Road, Caiyi Street, and Xieqiao Jumen Road inside Dadongmen are still burning fiercely. The areas along Pudongmen Road and Jishui Street have been completely burned down, with only black smoke billowing. The inside of the Fuan Goods Company has been completely burned down, with only the outer shell of the house still standing at the entrance of Xiaodongmen. Furthermore, most of the areas in the south of Nanzhan Station, Lujiabang Road, Dama Road, WaiMa Road, the south half of the Yemiao in Sanpailou in the city, and the Zhonghua Road area facing east of Xiaoximen have been reduced to scorched earth. The fire on Fangxie Road in the Jingjiang Guild Hall area on the side of Heping Road last night was extinguished by the French Concession Fire Brigade driving to the rescue. More than half of the houses were destroyed. The fires in Nanshi were the worst in the past two days. The flames that erupted could be seen from high places in as many as 19 places. Therefore, the losses in Nanshi are no less than those in the Zhabei and Hongkou districts.

Shanghai-Ningbo traffic is completely shut down

The Enderby is still in Ningbo New Beijing changes to Wenzhou

The Deping, owned by the Italian-owned Huayi Company, stopped running to Ningbo yesterday and is now docked in Shanghai. The Enderby, which was scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo today, is also unable to sail in the short term because the ship is still within the Ningbo River blockade. The Taikoo Company's New Beijing has also stopped running on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and has been scheduled to change to Wenzhou at noon on the 19th of this month. The Shanghai-Ningbo traffic has temporarily come to a standstill. In addition, the sudden cessation of the Deping's service to Ningbo yesterday has led to much speculation about the situation there. After inquiries from reliable sources, it was learned that the situation in Ningbo is still very peaceful, but since the bombing of the north bank of the river, people's hearts are somewhat uneasy, and the state of migration is inevitably quite frequent.

Customs authorities are discussing how to deal with enemy-occupied patrol ships

Dozens of small boats towed to Mitsubishi Wharf Customs authorities are planning to deal with it but have not yet expressed it

According to the Central News Agency, the 12 customs patrol ships Fuxing, Wenxing, Liuxing, Huaxing, and Lianxing, which were anchored on the Bund outside the French Concession, were forcibly occupied by the enemy at 10:30 a.m. yesterday (the 15th). In addition to expelling all Chinese and foreign staff from the ships, the enemy troops also raised the Japanese flag on all the ships. Starting this morning (the 16th), the enemy used several small boats to tow one of the patrol ships to anchor at buoy No. 1 in Lujiazui, and three were towed to buoy No. 4. The largest of them, the Fuxing, was also towed by the enemy using three small steamships to the Puxi surface outside Lujiazui at about 9:00 a.m. this morning. It is reported that the patrol ships anchored on the Bund outside the French Concession that have not yet been towed away will also be towed away by the enemy in succession.

According to the Central News Agency, dozens of small fireboats were originally anchored south of the Ning-Shao Wharf blockade in the 16th Concession. Since the blockade was destroyed by the enemy, yesterday and today the enemy used boats to tow our small fireboats anchored in Nanhuangpu to the area of Mitsubishi Wharf. Each boat was flying the Japanese flag. The Zhonghe, a commercial ship of ours that was originally anchored in Nanhuangpu and towed away by the enemy, has now been towed to buoy No. 24.

According to Shenshi News Agency, after the Shanghai war, the 12 customs patrol ships Wenxing, Fuxing, Jiaoji, and Haiguang were not sailed out of Wusongkou to avoid danger, but were anchored on the Puxi surface of the Bund in the French Concession. When the enemy troops suddenly occupied Nanshi in recent days, they completely seized the 12 patrol ships on the 15th. The Chinese tax police belonging to these ships, totaling more than 400 people, and the 50 or so Western customs officials, gathered in the customs this morning to discuss the aftermath and listen to the news. It is reported that the enemy has regarded the patrol ships as spoils of war and has sailed them to Songkou. The ships also have many machine guns and various military firearms for anti-smuggling purposes, which have also been seized. The customs authorities are currently planning ways to deal with it, but are temporarily unwilling to express anything.

Short commentary Phase

The Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed a declaration condemning Japan. But each signatory country has reserved the right to make a joint decision on how to deal with the situation. This still leaves Japan room to maneuver so that it can change its attitude and participate in the meeting. The conference has twice invited Japan to participate, but both times it has been rejected. After the declaration was passed, the decision to reserve the right to make a joint decision on how to deal with the situation is a clear indication that the conference is trying to accommodate all parties. But Japan still refuses to change its attitude. What is its ultimate purpose? Therefore, the London Times said that after the Shanghai war situation changes, Japan has two paths to follow: one is to try to obtain the limited gains that it currently has; the other is to incur unlimited losses in the future. Japan should decide how to deal with this.

The situation after the enemy captured Kinmen
Enemy ships once heavily bombed Zhangzhou and Quanzhou The people of Kinmen were forced to form a maintenance association

Xiamen correspondence, the enemy forces attacked and captured Kinmen on October 26. On the 28th, the number of enemy ships increased from 11 to 23. On the 29th, it increased to 31. The landing troops also increased from 400 to 1,000. Also on the 28th, enemy ships occupied Lieyu Island, which belongs to Kinmen and is located between Kinmen and Xiamen, but the landing troops returned to the ships that evening. On the same day at dusk, enemy ships shelled Guotou, which belongs to Quanzhou, in an attempt to land. On the 29th, enemy planes bombed the main transportation routes between Zhangzhou and Xiamen on a large scale, dropping four bombs on the Jiangliang Bridge on the Jiulong River on the Zhangsong Highway, all of which missed their target. On the same day, they bombed the Wuliting Bridge in Quanzhou, Qingyang, Jinjiang, Anhai, Songxia, and Nan'an, destroying only two stone slabs. On the same day, enemy planes also bombed the Dongshi Qinlun Wharf, which is a joint land-sea transportation hub in Quanzhou Qingyang, and all three bombs landed in the field. On the same day, enemy planes chased the Tongan, a small boat carrying passengers from Tongan City to Xiamen, firing machine guns around the plane, fortunately without injuring anyone. They also chased and inspected the Guchuan and Longsheng small boats from Tongan Maxia to Xiamen, flying at low altitude. On the 30th, five enemy planes bombed the Jiangdong Bridge again, destroying only a four-foot hole in the concrete bridge surface, so it was still open to traffic. In summary, the enemy tried its best to destroy the land and sea transportation between Xiamen and Zhangzhou on the 29th and 30th, still preparing to attack Xiamen. By the 31st, most of the enemy ships had suddenly retreated, leaving only 13 ships, and an aircraft carrier also withdrew at the same time. Since that day, enemy planes have not come out to harass. Most of the enemy landing troops in Kinmen also withdrew with the ships, leaving only more than 300 people. The 13 ships left only guarded Kinmen, and by the 4th, only six ships remained. They have been actively digging trenches and rushing to build fortifications on land, with no other action. The tense situation in Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou at one time suddenly eased. As for the situation in Kinmen, the enemy only occupies Kinmen Island. Although Lieyu is under its control, there are no troops stationed on land. The two small islands of Dadan and Xiaodeng are still in our hands. The Kinmen County Government has moved to Dadan. Kinmen is now occupied by 300 troops led by Masasuke Komura, the captain of the 14th squadron of the enemy fleet, who is also in charge of Kinmen County affairs. The volunteer team organized by Taiwanese, now with 100 people, is under the command of Komura and is no longer commanded by Taiwanese Wu Tianshou. From the day the enemy landed to the 4th, nearly 20,000 refugees have gone to Xiamen and Tongan, most of whom are women. The current population of Kinmen has been found to be more than 50,000, and there are 20,000 Kinmen people from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Therefore, most of the residents of Kinmen are relatives of overseas Chinese. After fleeing to Xiamen, they were transferred to Southeast Asia, and more than 2,000 people have already left in a few days, and there are still many people waiting for ships. Refugees without assets are alone and waiting for relief. The government and community organizations in Xiamen have been working hard to run shelters and send people away. Those who have not become refugees are mostly on the line of disaster victims. Komura, who is in Pingcun Zhenzheng of Kinmen Island, has recently forced 20 strong men to serve as patrol teams to patrol the Biancheng Township. He has also recruited 40 policemen, mostly from local hooligans and prisoners. The armbands are inscribed with "□□ 14th Squadron □□ Police 1," painted with the Japanese emblem. For days, they have been forcing locals to become puppets to organize a "Public Security Maintenance Association." First, they sent invitations. If they did not come, they sent blue invitations, which were like summonses. If they still did not come, they were arrested. After more than a week of coercion and inducement, the "Public Security Maintenance Association" was scheduled to be established on the 4th, with former Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Tinghuan, Chen Taiyi, Xu Xingeng, Zhou Yongan, and Zhou Yongtong as members, and Wang as the chairman. The method of establishment was to convene a general meeting of township chiefs on the island to elect and establish it. Unexpectedly, on the 4th, most of the township chiefs avoided attending, and only three attended, so the meeting could not be formed. The so-called "Public Security Maintenance Association" was temporarily aborted. Komura has been issuing announcements for days, such as ordering the surrender of firearms and ordering the reporting of spies, severely punishing those who hide guns and fail to report spies, and implementing martial law. Land traffic is prohibited from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., and water traffic is prohibited from 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Wood and iron wire are transported from Taiwan, and the people are forced to perform labor to build fortifications, using Japanese money tickets and Manchukuo banknotes. Merchants are afraid to flee and dare not open the market. Since the 4th, people have been restricted from leaving the country, and each sailboat is only allowed to carry six passengers each time, and relatives who have left the country are ordered to return home. After the puppet "Public Security Maintenance Association" is established, it will conduct a census and register the islanders. In the future, entry and exit will require finding a guarantor. Now, whether in the countryside or in the city, the doors of the houses and shops of the Kinmen people must not be closed at night, in order to allow his troops to enter the houses at any time to search. In less than ten days, the Kinmen people have tasted the pain of national subjugation

### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Passes Declaration Condemning Japan

Eighteen Representatives Agreed, Italian Representative Abstained, Each Contracting Nation Will Take Joint Action

⊙Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference convened a plenary session this afternoon to discuss the declaration. With the exception of the Italian representative, the other eighteen representatives unanimously expressed their approval. The declaration was then put to a vote and passed. (Central News Agency, Havas urgent telegram, 16th morning)

⊙Brussels: Regarding the content of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference declaration, "This Evening Paper" recently reported that the declaration will be submitted to a plenary session for a vote today and is expected to pass. Its content is a moral condemnation of Japan, and signatory nations have jointly decided to reserve their rights regarding the method of response. However, it still leaves Japan room for maneuver to change its attitude and participate in the conference. It roughly stated, "The second reply submitted by the Japanese government on the 12th of this month has been discussed by the representatives of the Nine-Power Treaty countries. The Japanese government continues to isolate itself from the Nine-Power Treaty and refuses to exchange views with the countries concerned in order to find a peaceful solution. We are sorry for this. The Japanese government's view of the current situation differs greatly from that of other countries concerned. Japan believes that the dispute between China and Japan is purely a matter for the parties involved, while other representatives believe that the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris are related to all signatory countries and even the world. The Nine-Power Treaty clearly stipulates that each signatory country must abide by certain principles toward China, and the Pact of Paris stipulates that all signatory countries should seek solutions through peaceful means, regardless of any dispute. Moreover, the war between China and Japan has caused significant damage to the interests of third countries, and certain methods of warfare are also heartbreaking for people all over the world. Any country that uses force to interfere in the internal affairs of another country is also not allowed by international law. If we follow the Japanese government's claim that a fair and lasting solution can be found by allowing China and Japan to negotiate on their own, who would believe it? On the contrary, if this case is left to China and Japan to handle on their own, the current dispute will be prolonged indefinitely, which is highly credible. In short, representatives from all countries believe that it will be difficult to find a solution if the parties directly negotiate. Therefore, Japan has been repeatedly invited to participate in the conference or to send representatives to contact representatives of a small number of countries in order to reach a solution. Even at this moment, it is believed that this procedure will be successful. The Chinese representative has declared acceptance, but the Japanese government insists on not consulting with the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. At this point, although representatives from all countries wish the Japanese government would change its mind, regarding the current situation, in essence, the views of one of the signatories of the treaty differ from those of the other signatories, and the actions taken are considered not to cause problems with the implementation of the treaty, thus creating a new situation, and rights should be reserved in order to consider a common attitude."

### The Times of London Says Japan Finds It Difficult to Conquer China

Italy and Germany Cannot Ignore the World's Reaction, Also Welcomes Germany to Mediate

[London] The Times' editorial today stated that while the declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is worded mildly, it is a principled condemnation of Japan. Italy's unwillingness to support this declaration is indeed expected, but Italy and Germany cannot ignore the developments in the Far East and the resulting global reaction. The suggestion of Germany mediating has been discussed and is generally welcomed. The difficulties in the mediation process are great, but have decreased in the past month, because in the eyes of the Japanese people, the Japanese army has won sufficient victories. After the change in the battle situation in Shanghai, Japan has two options: to try to obtain the current limited gains or to incur unlimited losses in the future. Japan may continue to advance, but what will Japan gain from engaging in war deep in the Chinese mainland? Japan cannot defeat China at present and force it to surrender, and may not be able to do so in the future. Each victory of the Japanese army is a consumption that Japan cannot afford. Japan's economic situation is already declining. Japan claims not to want land, but if it does, how will it deal with it? The only possible way is the Manchurian model, which is disguised military occupation. This situation in North China will be extremely uneconomical in terms of manpower and financial resources, and the cost will be so great that it will be impossible to sustain. And the powers that have important relations in the Far East and the Pacific will naturally adopt appropriate or joint plans to protect their interests. If Japan, due to military victories, permanently incurs the deep suspicion of most of Europe and the United States, then this victory is indeed cheap militarily, but the political price will be too high. The News Chronicle's editorial today recounted the recent words of former US Secretary of State Stimson, "What China needs most is not for others to do something to help it, but for foreign countries not to help its enemy again," and said, "We hope that the American people who agree with Stimson's views will remember these words."
