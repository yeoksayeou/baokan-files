### Our Forces' Overall Situation is Superior, Enemy Counterattacks on All Fronts Have Been Repulsed

Central Special Envoy Supervises the Battle, Morale is Greatly Boosted. Enemy Planes Dropping Bombs Everywhere, Two Shot Down by Us

The battle situation on all fronts yesterday was as follows: ㊀ In the Luodian to Liuhe area, our army holds a distinct advantage. The enemy forces are surrounded by our heavy forces. Although the enemy has repeatedly tried to break through, they have failed. A high-ranking official is on the front line to command and supervise the battle, and the morale is high. There is great confidence in annihilating the stubborn enemy. ㊁ On the Wusong front, from morning to night yesterday, the enemy relied on fierce artillery fire and aircraft cover in an attempt to continue landing. After our army fought bravely and fiercely, there was no opportunity to take. ㊂ In the Zhanghuabang area, the remaining enemies repeatedly attempted to break through our army's encirclement yesterday, but due to our strict deployment, they ultimately failed. ㊃ Late at night, the enemy plotted a counterattack on our army's positions in the Baoshan Road area. Both sides bombarded each other with heavy artillery. After a fierce battle, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated. ㊄ In the Nanshi area, although enemy planes bombed, it had no impact on our military affairs.

Yesterday (28th) at 8:00 PM, the official war report stated: ㊀ On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, the Zhalin (between Jinshanwei and Nanhui) sea, there are several enemy ships anchored. On the 26th, more than 30 enemy soldiers were sent to land. Because our garrison pretended not to know, more than 200 enemy soldiers swarmed ashore. While they were still establishing a foothold, our army suddenly swept them with light and heavy machine guns. Except for a few who escaped back, the rest were annihilated. ㊁ The enemy forces in Yuepu have been repelled by our army. ㊂ At 4:00 PM on the 25th, an air battle occurred in the sky over Yuepu. Nine of our planes surrounded four enemy planes. As a result, we shot down one enemy plane. ㊃ The enemy in Luodian has dispersed and retreated. However, traitors and prostitutes dare to fire guns within the restricted area and signal the enemy planes. We are strictly suppressing them. ㊄ In the Zhabei area, there have only been minor skirmishes in recent days. ㊅ The enemy in Chuansha, Shizilin, Wenzaobang, and Zhanghuabang are being surrounded by our concentrated and strong forces, and it will not be difficult to resolve them in the short term.

Confirmed news: The enemy who landed in the Liuhe area has shown signs of collapse after being severely damaged by our army. They are gradually retreating towards the riverbank, and our army is advancing step by step, forming an encirclement. Therefore, the enemy has no power to resist.

In the coastal area of Nanhui, after the enemy forces landed some days ago, they were surrounded and annihilated by our army. They have not dared to invade again. It is now known that several enemy ships and several small boats have been discovered at Dengjia Pier, which belongs to Nanhui County, with the appearance of attempting to land. Our army has been strictly vigilant.

### Last Night Our Army Bombed the Enemy in Hongkou

Accurate Targets, Heavy Enemy Losses. Intense Artillery Fire on Both Sides in the Jiangwan Area

At around 11:10 last night, our forces in Pudong frequently fired heavy artillery at the enemy ships and forces in order to coordinate the offensive of our army in the Wusong and Hongkou areas, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. At that time, the sound was like thunder, shaking the entire port. In 25 minutes, a total of more than 50 shells were fired. Three enemy ships anchored on the surface of the Huangpu River returned fire, but all failed. At 11:40, the firing gradually subsided.

At 0:15 this morning, the enemy forces along North Sichuan Road to Jiangwan Road suddenly launched a sneak attack on our positions in skirmish lines. At that time, our troops were lying in wait. When the enemy soldiers were densely packed, they swept them with rifles and machine guns. As a result, the enemy's plan failed and they retreated in defeat. After our army pursued, they still guarded the original defense and waited in battle formation.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy at the end of North Sichuan Road and the Jiangwan Road area launched a fierce counterattack against us yesterday evening. Our army calmly responded and densely swept with machine guns. After a fierce battle for more than an hour, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in defeat. In the evening, our army bombarded the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road with heavy artillery. The artillery fire was fierce and the targets were accurate. The enemy suffered heavy losses. The sound of artillery gradually subsided after about two hours.

The Enemy's Counterattack at Zhanghuabang Was Thwarted

The intensity of the bloody battles in Zhanghuabang and near Luodian this time is unprecedented since the outbreak of the Shanghai War. According to those who returned from the front, our soldiers did not sleep or eat and bravely fought the enemy for more than two days and nights. The sacrifice was also heroic. However, due to inconvenient transportation and fierce artillery fire, the wounded were lying on the ground, lacking rescue. It is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention to this and urgently seek rescue, so that the strong men can recover as soon as possible and return to the front line to kill the enemy.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area continued to land reinforcements. From the night before to yesterday morning (28th), they counterattacked us several times. They were fiercely and head-on beaten by our army, and the enemy did not succeed.

A part of the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area is still entrenched in the buildings near the station and the two road machinery factories. Under the cover of enemy ships, they have repeatedly attempted to break through our army's encirclement in order to develop their positions. In the end, they failed to achieve their goals due to our army's strict deployment. According to a confirmed report at 2:00 AM this morning, the enemy's actions at the end of Yangshupu and Shanghai University were very busy. Observing their situation, it seemed that they intended to attack the north side of Jungong Road. Our defending troops have paid close attention to it.

Enemy Forces Counterattack Our Northern Position

According to the Central News Agency, enemy planes flew to the North Station at 5:30 PM yesterday to bomb it. Then, at 11:30 last night, the enemy on the North Sichuan Road counterattacked our North Station, which was quite fierce. Our army immediately fought back bravely. After a fierce battle until 0:15 this morning, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated.

Our Army Forms a Large Encirclement

According to the Central News Agency, the focus of the Sino-Japanese War has shifted outward, and the Yangshupu area has become silent. After the central route of our army on this line captured the important stronghold of the enemy's naval training ground on the 17th, it took advantage of the victory to pursue and penetrated deep into the enemy's positions, advancing twice to the Huishan Wharf on East Broadway Road, and attacking in two directions, east and west, so that the front line of the army protruded like a triangle. There is a risk of being attacked by the enemy on the left, right, and front, which is considered a taboo in military terms. For strategic reasons, we retreated the protruding part backward to form a large arc-shaped encirclement and strictly defended it. The situation on North Sichuan Road and Bazihqiao remains the same. Both sides are still facing each other in a strict battle formation.

Two Enemy Planes Shot Down in Wusong

The Central News Agency has just learned from Westerners who arrived in Shanghai on the Lincoln President of the Da Lai Steamship Company that the Lincoln they were traveling on arrived at Songkou yesterday morning. They were waiting for a small steamship specially dispatched by the Tai Lai Company to pick them up to Shanghai, when suddenly twelve Japanese planes were seen taking off in formations from outside the port. After circling once on the surface of the river, they prepared to attack our rear positions in Wusong. They were calmly bombarded by our anti-aircraft guns. Two of the shells hit the mark and hit two enemy planes. One of them crashed immediately. The other was hit in the engine compartment by us. At that time, the plane was still struggling to escape, but it did not fly for long before the fuel tank caught fire and was destroyed. It also fell in the end. It was about 11:00 AM yesterday.

Yesterday Morning, Enemy Ships Bombed Pudong

From 6:00 AM yesterday, 16 enemy ships anchored on the Yangshupu River concentrated their artillery fire on our Pudong area because the enemy in Liuhe, Luodian and other places were repeatedly defeated. They intended to contain our military strength. At that time, our artillerymen retaliated and fought each other for a long time. The enemy thought that our strength was insufficient, so they sent a large number of enemy troops to attack □□□ in Pudong at about 9:00 AM, attempting to land. At that time, our garrison calmly lay in wait, pretending to be unprepared. Seeing the enemy landing, all the ambushes came out, and ten thousand guns were fired at the same time, immediately repelling the enemy. At that time, many people drowned, and our army intercepted a large number of military supplies. Seeing that our side was prepared, the enemy dared not invade again. The artillery fire from both sides gradually subsided, and it stopped completely at 5:00 PM.

Enemy Army Landed to Take Over Defense

According to reports received from relevant parties, enemy reinforcements landed at various docks in the Yangshupu area and transported a large number of weapons and baggage. Because the enemy Marine Corps was severely beaten by us and their morale was depressed, they changed to the army to take over the defense. Last night, there was a fierce skirmish on the Hongkou front to prevent our army from attacking. Now our front line is extremely solid, and the enemy's attempt to counterattack is difficult to unfold.

Large Numbers of Enemy Planes Bomb Wusong

The merchant ship Longshan, flying the flag of convenience, entered Shanghai from Wusong at around 11:00 AM yesterday. When the ship arrived at Songkou, it saw several squadrons of Japanese planes, each squadron consisting of four heavy bombers, flying to Wusong to drop bombs on Paotaiwan and Wusong Station. The rumbling sound resounded through the clouds. The Longshan could not move forward and stopped to avoid the bombing. It is estimated that a total of more than 40 bombs were dropped by Japanese planes, lasting for more than an hour. Each Japanese plane began to fly eastward. The Longshan ship was able to sail from Wusong to Shanghai. According to the crew of the ship, there were only more than ten Japanese ships outside the port of Wusong, and there were also more than ten ships in the Huangpu River. The large transport ships carrying reinforcements to Shanghai were No. 132, No. 150, and No. 160, etc. The troops inside the ships have landed, and the empty ships are still staying at the port of Wusong.

Investigation of Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River Yesterday

The number of enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River suddenly increased yesterday. Most of the enemy ships that had been gathered in Songkou some days ago returned to the Huangpu River yesterday. According to the investigation conducted by reporters at Pukou and Songkou from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM yesterday, only nine enemy ships remained gathered at Songkou yesterday, while the number of enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River increased to 26. The mooring situation is as follows: one cruiser and one destroyer each at the Wusong town Pu surface, one transport ship No. 32 and one transport ship No. 60 at the Wenzaobang, one transport ship No. 150 at the Junpu Bureau Pu surface, two gunboats No. 23 at the Power Plant Pu surface, another gunboat whose name has been painted off, one destroyer at the Gaoqiao Pu surface, two destroyers at the Qiujiang Wharf, one destroyer at the Donggou Pu surface, one destroyer at the Yufeng Yarn Factory Pu surface, one destroyer at the Asia Petroleum Company Pu surface, one gunboat at the Lan Road Pu surface, one destroyer at the Water Plant Pu surface, one destroyer at the New Mitsui Wharf, a total of seven enemy ships from pontoon No. 1 to pontoon No. 9 (including the flagship Izumo still berthed at pontoon No. 2), two destroyers at the Mitsubishi Wharf, totaling 26 ships, plus the nine ships outside Songkou, totaling 35 ships. When reporters inspected the Huangpu River, the situation on both sides of the wharves was very bleak. Except for more than ten enemy soldiers at the Osaka Wharf and a large number of remaining enemy soldiers near Wenzaobang, who were very busy, there was no one else in other places. From time to time, people in the Pudong district were shot to death by enemy soldiers in the Huangpu River, and then their bodies were thrown into the Huangpu River, drifting with the waves. There were a large number of them, and the situation was very tragic. The cruelty and atrocities of the enemy army, and their repeated injuries to our innocent people, are also one of the strong evidences.

The Situation in Pudong is Still Quiet

Yesterday's newspaper reported that more than 50 Japanese plainclothes agents were found in Wufunong, Lujiazui, Pudong. After investigation, the area is extremely quiet, and the rumors are based on misunderstanding. Moreover, our military strength in Pudong is strong, and any plans of the enemy cannot succeed.

The Osaka warehouse of the Nissin Company in Zhangjiabang, Pudong, has been destroyed by two major fires. Because the remaining fire was not extinguished, another warehouse was extended at 3:00 PM yesterday. Because there was no one to manage the warehouse, it burned more and more fiercely, and soon it pierced through the top of the warehouse, with raging flames and black smoke rising into the sky. It burned until dusk before it gradually subsided, but the embers were not extinguished. Also, Mitsubishi Company, which is adjacent to the left, also had a warehouse on fire some days ago, and the loss of goods in the warehouse was quite large.

Our Air Force Launched Two Night Raids

At 11:00 last night, our air force flew to the sky over the Huangpu River to attack enemy ships. The enemy army's anti-aircraft guns were frantically fired in a panic. At about 3:10 this morning, our air force appeared again and hovered in the sky for a long time without leaving. Although the enemy ships' anti-aircraft guns fired like a string of pearls, our planes still calmly circled the high altitude for several weeks and returned safely.

### The Course of Fierce Fighting in Luodian

More Than 3,000 Enemy Soldiers Were Killed or Wounded. Now Facing Each Other Across the River in Zhenxi

The fierce battle in Luodian in recent days has set an unprecedented record in the Shanghai War. More than two-thirds of the town of Luodian has been baptized by artillery fire, and it is a scorched earth. It is too horrible to look at. The enemy army uses planes and heavy artillery to cover the operation, so it always launches a general attack at dawn, while our army advances at night and takes advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to launch a full-scale attack. Therefore, the number of enemies who sacrificed in our night attack is countless. In Muchao town and Shenjiaqiao north of Luodian, fierce battles between the two sides have not ended. Our army is in high morale and can deal with ten enemies alone. The enemy army has no fighting spirit and can never succeed just by relying on the precision of its weapons.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy near Shengqiao, Muchaozhen, Chenjiahang, and Liuhe, under the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft, repeatedly launched counterattacks on our army's positions. After our army bravely advanced, they repeatedly advanced and retreated. The enemy suffered huge losses, and our sacrifice was also huge. As of this morning, the two sides were facing each other across a small river about four miles northwest of Luodian. It is also learned that the enemy in Xiaochuansha has installed heavy artillery on land in an attempt to cover the enemy's advance.

Traitors Assist in Abuses and Open the Door to Invite Thieves

This reporter met with many refugees who escaped from Luodian to Shanghai this morning. According to reports, after the enemy army sneaked in and landed in the area, plus the traitorous assistance and opening the door to invite thieves, the people in the whole town had nowhere to escape, and many were brutally killed. After several nights of fierce battles, the city and stores in the whole town have been destroyed by about three-quarters. More than 2,000 people escaped, all of whom walked more than 100 miles day and night before arriving safely in Shanghai. It is now heard that the enemy army has been driven back to the vicinity of the coast by our army, but there are still many refugees living in various places. Efforts have now been started to concentrate them to convenient transportation areas, and then transport them to Shanghai by car.

A Military Officer Talks About the Course of the Fierce Battle

According to the Central News Agency, the reporter met with a military officer who commanded the battle in Luodian yesterday. He was told in detail about the enemy army's sneaking landing. It is said that after a large number of enemy reinforcements arrived in Shanghai, they repeatedly tried to land without success. Finally, at 9:00 AM on the 25th, guided by traitors, they sneaked across the river and landed, with a total of about 4,000 people in a brigade, while our garrison troops were only 2,000 people. We were outnumbered and in a disadvantageous position, but the soldiers resisted very bravely, rushing forward one after another and sticking to their posts to wait for reinforcements. In the end, they suffered heavy losses and retreated at 2:00 PM. At that time, our losses were two-thirds. After about an hour, our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce attack together. The enemy had not yet established a solid position and was suddenly counterattacked by us. They responded hastily and were also defeated and retreated to Muchaozhen, about eight miles outside the town. In this battle, our army was brave and had no retreat, giving the enemy a heavy blow. It is estimated that about 2,000 enemies were killed or wounded, and we also lost about 800 loyal soldiers. Now the enemy is building fortifications by the small river and sticking to them, and we are also waiting in strict formation. The enemy has been attacking for days with the cover of planes and naval artillery, but has not succeeded.

Enemy Corpses Are Everywhere Outside the Town

Two messengers from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau rode bicycles to Luodian some days ago to deliver telegrams. According to reports, there were no traces of the enemy in the area near the town of Luodian, only enemy corpses were seen all over the ground outside the town. It is conceivable that the battle there was fierce and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. The two messengers returned along the same route after delivering the telegram. Unexpectedly, they were bombed by enemy planes not far from Luodian, and both were injured. Fortunately, the injuries were still light. They returned to Shanghai that night for medical treatment. The spirit of these two people who risked their lives to serve is admirable.

### Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Frontal Operations Force, Promoted to Commander-in-Chief

Another High-Ranking Official Assigned to Command the Coastal Defense Force. Commander Yang Talks About Vowing to Annihilate the Stubborn Enemy

(Central News Agency) Yang Hu, the Shanghai Garrison Commander, issued a statement yesterday, saying that Shanghai traitors have been spreading rumors recently, and the general public does not know the truth and is often in a state of unease. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, thanks to our loyal and brave soldiers who have been working together, the enemy has been retreating and has become exhausted. The battle situation has been smooth in recent days. Commander Zhang Wenbo has been promoted to Commander-in-Chief by the Central Government. Commander Zhang is fully responsible for commanding the Shanghai battle. The date of annihilation of the remaining enemies is just around the corner. As for the left wing of our army, another high-ranking official from the Central Government is responsible for commanding it. Victory is in our grasp. It is hoped that all the people of our city will be calm and steady, not arrogant or discouraged, and do not easily believe the rumors spread by traitors. This is very important.

A battlefield reporter from the Central News Agency went to visit General Zhang Zhizhong at the ×× Army Headquarters at 9:00 PM yesterday. At that time, General Zhang was commanding the troops to fight, and he was extremely busy, but his spirit was very high. The reporter asked about the recent battle situation on the front line, and Zhang replied with a smile, saying, "I was ordered to command the frontal operations force in Shanghai, and recently I was honored to be the Commander-in-Chief of ×××××. Although I think that my talent and strength are weak, at this time of national survival, as a soldier, I can only swear to die and serve the country, rushing to the battlefield, and making killing the enemy and achieving results my only task. The current war is only the beginning of a full-scale battle. In the future, the arduous struggle will depend on the continuous sacrifice of our loyal and brave soldiers and the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country. I am fighting day and night for the mission I have undertaken, and I dare not slack off. Although the enemy is still rampant, the Central Government has made thorough preparations early. No matter what, they will not succeed in the end. I hope the press will inform the people of the country that I can be responsible for guaranteeing that the final victory of the war must belong to us." The reporter continued to ask whether the strength of the coastal defense force was sufficient, and Zhang replied in a firm tone, "The coastal defense force has now been assigned a high-ranking official from the Central Government to be responsible for the command. The current strength can definitely repel the enemy, so there is nothing to worry about." The reporter also asked, "It is rumored that our army in the Hongkou area has slightly retreated backward. Is it true?" Zhang replied, "Our army in the Hongkou area has no reason and no fact to retreat backward now. As for the reorganization and deployment of the original front line, it is a common thing in war and cannot be considered a retreat." The reporter saw that Zhang was handling military affairs, his hands were constantly writing, and his ears were constantly on the phone, so he was inconvenient to bother him any further, so he resigned.

### Yesterday Afternoon, Enemy Planes Bombed Nanshi and Enemy Ships Bombed the South Railway Station, an Unprecedented Catastrophe

The Platform and Overpass Were Destroyed by Bombs. Hundreds of Refugees Waiting for Trains Were Killed or Wounded. Bombs Were Dropped Everywhere in Nanshi.

(Special Report from This Newspaper) At about 2:00 PM yesterday, four enemy planes suddenly flew to the South Railway Station and dropped several bombs, hitting the Chenjiazhai bungalows on Miaochiao Road, destroying more than 100 rooms. They then dropped bombs on the South Station, destroying the entire overpass. The station ticket office was also damaged, and the water pavilion east of the station was also bombed and collapsed, and the water was flowing. Hundreds of refugees waiting for trains there were killed or injured. The exact number has not yet been investigated. Upon hearing the news, the reporter drove to the scene. When the car arrived behind the station, he saw that the station was in a mess, the walls had collapsed, and countless houses of the transport company and civilians in the vicinity had collapsed due to the earthquake. It was a desolate scene. Then, when he arrived in front of the station, he looked at the station from a distance, which was almost a rubble field. All the power lines had also been bombed to the ground. There were still dozens of rickshaws stranded on the street, lying on the side of the road. There were packages and luggage on the cars, and the passengers and rickshaw pullers had been bombed to death and fell to the ground, with missing heads and broken arms, and intestines flowing out. It was too horrible to look at. The wall of the training ground behind the Nanshi Fire Brigade was also bombed and destroyed. An official of the association was seriously injured. Dai Peicheng, a firefighter number 25, was also injured in the face by the bombing. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by an ambulance from the West District. More than 300 injured refugees and residents were sent to the three hospitals of Renji, Baolong, and Guangren by ambulances from the West District, South District, and North District, as well as the Buddhist Ambulance Team, the Red Swastika Society, the Red Cross, and the City Boy Scouts. More than 100 refugees who were bombed to death in the park were transported to Xihu and other places by charity groups and burial teams from Tongren Fuyuantang for burial in batches. By 5:00 PM, the work had not yet been completed. A rescuer from the West District also told the reporter that when they were sending the injured refugees to the hospital for the last time, they were spotted by an enemy plane, which chased them closely in the air. It was not until they chased to Lujiabang that they turned their heads east. Fortunately, the driver drove quickly and was not chased. When the incident happened, the bombed area was on fire, and the fire was extinguished after the fire brigades in the South of Shanghai rushed to the scene and bravely rescued the situation, and did not spread.

Another news: An enemy plane team flew to Nanshi at about 2:00 PM yesterday and dropped bombs and sulfur bombs at Dananmen, Lujiabang, Dadongmen Jiuhua Street, and the South Railway Station one after another, causing a large number of displaced people to suffer calamity, and several places caught fire and burned. When the enemy plane was about to arrive, the defense regiment and the ambulance and fire personnel immediately dispatched all personnel to conduct a detailed investigation of the losses, which is still to be investigated. Yesterday, the refugee train that was originally scheduled to go to Hangzhou was temporarily stopped in Hangzhou.

Another news: Yesterday, enemy planes bombed Nanshi and shot with machine guns, killing and injuring many passers-by. After 1:00 PM, a bomb was dropped near Dongjiadu, injuring several passers-by near Wangjia Wharf. Another bomb was dropped. At about 2:00 PM, a bomb was dropped near Haichao Temple, fortunately it did not explode. A bomb was also dropped in Sanminfang, next to Haichao Temple, injuring several people and destroying several houses. At the same time, enemy planes flew to the sky above the South Station and dropped bombs. One bomb was dropped on the open space in the wooden fence east of the station. At this time, it was the Jiangxi Guild Hall sending refugees back to their hometowns by train. There were many people, and passengers were also waiting to buy tickets here. There were numerous deaths and injuries. A burning bomb was dropped on the shops and houses in front of the station, and the houses in that area were completely burned down. Enemy planes also dropped several bombs around Gaochang Temple yesterday. The houses from the wharf by the river to the Bansongyuan Road tram station and near Chenjiaqiao were mostly damaged. Miaochiao Road, behind the South District Fire Brigade, was bombed by enemy planes and caught fire, burning for two hours, destroying more than 100 rooms. Except for the South Station, this place suffered the most.

After the enemy planes carried out the bombing, our authorities immediately stepped up vigilance to prevent disturbances, notified the citizens to deal with the situation calmly, and announced martial law earlier at 5:00 PM, cutting off traffic. At the same time, the French Concession authorities temporarily opened and closed the iron gates at Old North Gate Street, Nanyang Bridge, Kangti Road, and Xinyiqiao Road to maintain order in the afternoon.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Persevere in Resistance, Without Worry or Fear

— Hua

Since the enemy forces have suffered repeated setbacks in Hongkou and Yangshupu districts, they have had to change their strategy and carry out wanton aggression along the Yangtze River. Some people, seeing the shift in the focus of the war, have suddenly developed a sense of worry and fear. This psychological wavering is partly due to the enemy's use of Chinese traitors to create rumors and confuse the public. On the other hand, it is also because part of the enemy forces have indeed landed in Wusong and Liuhe, once reaching Luodian, and our army's front lines in Jiangwan and Zhabei have also replaced the original offensive with a defensive posture. In addition, the enemy's indiscriminate bombing and the enemy fleet's blockade of the coast have also caused anxiety among some people. However, in this critical period at the beginning of the war of resistance, we must point out that this kind of psychological wavering is absolutely unacceptable. Only by persevering in the war of resistance can we achieve ultimate victory.

Regarding the enemy's strategic changes and the repositioning of our positions, we must first of all know that our country has never had strong coastal defenses. It is inherently difficult to prevent the enemy from landing on a long coastline. The soil along the coast of Wusong, Baoshan, and Liuhe is loose and damp, and it is not suitable for building defensive fortifications. Therefore, our retreat of one or two li is not something to be worried about. And because of the changes in the rear positions, it is natural that the Jiangwan and Zhabei front lines cannot but change from offensive to defensive.

However, in this war of resistance, we must carefully adhere to one principle: that this war of resistance against Japan must be a comprehensive war and must be a protracted war. Only such a war can ultimately defeat the enemy. The enemy's indiscriminate aerial bombing and announcement of a coastal blockade are intended to shake our will to fight at the beginning of our resistance, so that a comprehensive and protracted war cannot be realized. However, in reality, since our country has few bustling industrial cities and no overseas investments, we do not need to have any concerns about this kind of aerial and maritime threat from the enemy, except to prepare for the inevitable sacrifices of life and property.

At present, the most urgent thing for us is to firm up our will to resist and resist the enemy's violent threats. In the January 28th Incident, we fought with the enemy for more than fifty days in the small area of ​​Songhu. Now that we have gone through more than five years of preparation, can we be inferior to that time? We should also know that the war in North China is at least as important in nature as the war in Songhu. And the large-scale resistance on the Jinpu and Pinghan lines has not yet fully unfolded, allowing the enemy to concentrate its forces, threatening Shanghai on the one hand and pressing on Nankou on the other. Therefore, at present, we must not allow a small part of the changes in positions or strategies to cause any worry, but should promote a comprehensive war of resistance with the firmest determination and launch a protracted war of resistance, so that the fierce and barbaric enemy will be driven to final collapse.

Incident of British Ambassador Being Attacked

### British Government Decides to Lodge Strong Protest with Japan

Reportedly of an Aide-Mémoire Nature; British Counselor Comes to China to Assume the Duties of Ambassador

[London] Regarding the injury of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, in an attack by Japanese aircraft, it is reported that officials have stated that Foreign Secretary Eden has had multiple telephone conversations with Prime Minister Chamberlain, who is currently on vacation in Balmoral. It has been decided that the British government will lodge the strongest protest with the Japanese government. The contents of the protest will be announced tomorrow or on Monday. It is said that this negotiation by the British government is of a more serious nature than a normal formal protest. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

[London] Britain today demanded from Japan "full satisfaction" for the wounding of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, by Japanese aircraft. This demand, in the nature of an aide-mémoire, was instructed to be presented to the Japanese government by the British Chargé d'Affaires in Japan. According to reliable information obtained by the Associated Press, this demand forces Japan to choose between "losing face" or incurring the anger of Britain. If Japan rejects this demand, it would be an insult to the personal dignity of King George VI. When this demand will be made in Tokyo has not yet been confirmed here. (National Telegram from the 27th)

[London] Mr. Hall, Counselor of the British Embassy in China, has recently departed by plane for China, in order to take charge of the affairs of the British Embassy during the period when Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's injuries have not yet healed. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch from the 28th)

[London] British newspapers predict that the wording of the protest that the British government will lodge with Tokyo regarding the injury of Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen will be very strong, and may demand compensation. The Times stated that the final detailed report from Shanghai regarding this unfortunate incident has not yet arrived, and should arrive here approximately today, after which the British government will instruct its Chargé d'Affaires in Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. The Times diplomatic correspondent said that if the Japanese side's explanations do not alleviate British indignation, they will only increase British anger at this atrocity. The Japanese army's statement that it learned that senior Chinese military officers were scheduled to travel on the Shanghai-Nanjing highway on that day is tantamount to saying, "We did not want to shoot the British Ambassador, but we plotted to assassinate the head of a neighboring country with whom we have not broken off diplomatic relations." As for the claim that Chinese people were misusing the British flag, it is also not worth taking seriously. In any case, the Japanese side never had any reason to bomb a foreign car simply because of the actions of some Chinese people that the Japanese side did not like. As for the claim that the Japanese fleet is blockading the Chinese coast, this matter remains to be confirmed. The order transmitted by the fleet commander seems to be inconsistent with the statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry that foreign ships would not be disturbed. In any case, there is a crisis lurking everywhere, and it is highly questionable what right Japan has to blockade the coast of a country against which it has not formally declared war.

### British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's Condition is Improving

Hong En Hospital Issued a Report Last Night; North China Daily News Denounces False Japanese Propaganda

(Special Report from This Newspaper) British Ambassador to China, Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, was shot by Japanese aircraft with machine guns while traveling by car from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 26th and was admitted to Hong En Hospital for treatment. People in China and abroad are paying close attention to the ambassador's condition. This morning, a reporter from this newspaper visited Hong En Hospital. According to the English doctor at the hospital, the British ambassador's condition was very good last night and he had several hours of restful sleep. This morning, his condition remains good and there should be no special changes in the short term.

According to the hospital's first announcement of the ambassador's condition at 8:00 AM yesterday, the ambassador had a good night (27th) and was able to sleep peacefully. This morning (28th), his general condition is quite good. Subsequently, at 6:00 PM in the evening, the second announcement was issued, stating that the ambassador's condition was even better today (28th) and that there were signs of improvement in all aspects. People across the country are pleased to hear that the British ambassador's condition is improving day by day.

This time, British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was shot by Japanese aircraft with machine guns while traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai. The Japanese cannot deny this, as proven by the staff of the embassy. Therefore, the spokesperson of the Japanese government in Tokyo and the Japanese authorities in Shanghai both apologized to the British authorities. However, according to a report in the North China Daily News, the announcers of the Tokyo J.V.J. and J.K.J. radio stations broadcast in English at 9:00 PM on August 26, claiming that the British ambassador was shot by violent Chinese soldiers. The North China Daily News, in the interest of fairness, revealed this deception and published a short commentary to criticize it, hoping that the Japanese authorities in Tokyo would take steps to correct this distortion of the facts. It also said that according to telegraphic reports, although the Japanese authorities have formally apologized for the attack on the British ambassador's car, the Japanese public may not yet know the true facts, and the news broadcast in English must have been translated from the information in Japanese that the Japanese authorities used to inform their citizens. If so, then it seems that the Japanese authorities should reconsider their attitude of undermining international etiquette. From this incident, we can see that if the bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft this time had not missed Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's car, otherwise everyone would have died tragically, and there would have been no witnesses. The Japanese authorities would have definitely claimed that it was done by Chinese aircraft, and China would have been unable to defend itself even with a hundred mouths. Furthermore, yesterday's North China Daily News also published an editorial entitled "Blind Foolishness," commenting on the Japanese aircraft's attack on Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's car, and refuting the Japanese authorities' defense of the aircraft layer by layer. However, the wording was mild and far less indignant than the previous commentary on the bombing of the Great World. But there is one sentence in it that is worth noting: "If the occupant of the attacked car had been of lesser importance, then the promptness and speed with which the Japanese authorities issued their apology would probably have been much delayed." Therefore, if the occupant of the car had been an ordinary foreigner, the Japanese authorities would not only not apologize, but would probably ignore it, treating it as an insignificant incident, or even blaming the person for risking driving on the highway during the war, and that being shot by the plane was his own fault.

The Ambassador's Wife and Son Arrived in Shanghai This Morning

According to Shen Shi News Agency, the injury of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is of great concern to all parties. The Ambassador's wife and son accompanied the Ambassador to Beidaihe for summer vacation a month ago, intending to return south with the Ambassador after the autumn coolness. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Ambassador has been traveling south to seek peace, and his wife and son have not accompanied him. After the unfortunate incident occurred, the British Consulate in Shanghai telegraphed them to return south that night. After receiving the telegram, the Ambassador's wife took a specially prepared plane the day before yesterday to a certain place, and then arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. At about 8:00 AM, she went to Hong En Hospital to visit her husband. As of yesterday morning, Mr. Hugessen's condition had not changed. According to doctors, it has now been more than thirty-six hours and there should be no more danger, but because he is weak, the operation has not yet been performed and the bullet has not been removed. The hospital's announcement yesterday morning is recorded as follows: "The Ambassador had a good night last night and slept very comfortably. His condition is even better this morning."

American Sailor Donates Blood

Central News Agency, London, Havas dispatch from the 28th. After British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was injured by Japanese aircraft, he was given a blood transfusion at Hong En Hospital in Shanghai. The blood donor was an American sailor. Officials say that the life of the British Ambassador was saved by the blood of an American, which is very grateful. Furthermore, this further proves the close relationship between Britain and the United States.

Madam Chiang Kai-shek Sent a Letter of Condolence

Since the British Ambassador was injured and admitted to Hong En Hospital for treatment, our officials and civilians have all expressed their concern. Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Chiang, Foreign Minister Wang, Mayor Yu, Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Jinghu Garrison, Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Martial Law Command, and others have all sent personnel or gone in person to the hospital to express their condolences to the Ambassador. Madam Chiang Kai-shek, the wife of Chairman Chiang, also personally wrote a letter to Madam Knatchbull-Hugessen the day before yesterday to express her condolences. The letter was handed over to Yu Ming of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday morning. Director Yu then took Madam Chiang's letter to Hong En Hospital this morning to deliver it to the British Ambassador.

Xin Sheng News Agency said that the Citizens' Union of the First Special District of Shanghai City sent a letter to the British Consul General yesterday morning on behalf of the million citizens of the First Special District to express their condolences to British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. The original letter stated, "Your Excellency, Consul General, this time, due to the Japanese military's atrocities, indiscriminate bombing, and machine gun fire, Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was injured, and the world is indignant, and this association is especially deeply concerned. I am sending this letter on behalf of the million citizens of the entire district to express our sincere condolences to the Ambassador. Please forward this message, and wish the Ambassador a speedy recovery to health. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union."

Zhang Ming, the former special envoy of Nepal who was awarded a medal, came to Shanghai to express his condolences to British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. In addition, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession and the Employment Training Class for Graduates with Patents or Higher also sent letters of condolence yesterday.

The Driver Recounts the Truth of the Bombing

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, a driver who accompanied British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to Shanghai stated, "If the Japanese aircraft had been more accurate in their bombing and machine gun attack on our car, none of us would be alive today, because at that time the Japanese aircraft was only about thirty-five feet above our heads." The ambassador's car was driven by Military Attaché San Fulese. The ambassador's driver was sitting next to Mr. Fuller. The car was a large Austin sedan with Capital license plate number 5015 and Special Diplomatic Corps license plate number 37. Following behind was a car recently rented by the embassy, carrying the ambassador's attendant and luggage. At 5:00 PM, the journey was smooth through Taicang, because the highway directly to Nanxiang and Shanghai was not easy to pass. The two cars turned into the newly built An Ding Highway, about 5 miles from Jiading and about 18 miles from Shanghai. At that time, we noticed an airplane flying in the sky, and suddenly several bombs fell around the two cars. Two Japanese aircraft circled the two cars three times, and finally descended to 40 feet above the ground and fired machine guns. The two aircraft dropped bombs, but fortunately none hit. The machine gun fire rained down like bullets. In this critical situation, the two cars stopped in the road, and everyone in the cars jumped out and lay down in a nearby small ditch. At that time, we did not know that the ambassador had been hit until the plane flew away, when we realized that the Ambassador had been injured. The two aircraft flew away a few minutes after the attack, but we lay in the ditch for a long time before daring to get up. When the planes left, several Chinese soldiers ran from a nearby hiding place and urged us to open the car. However, at that time, the Ambassador's waist was bleeding non-stop, so he was carried onto a Fen Si Ting soda water car and rushed to Shanghai, arriving within three hours. Although the Japanese aircraft fired machine guns at the car, only one bullet pierced the right rear window of the soda car and hit the Ambassador. None of the glass in the car was broken, and the car body and the other small car were not damaged at all. The Ambassador's driver, a native of Shandong, was summoned to the General Police Station this morning to be questioned about the incident. As for the machine gun bullet that hit the Ambassador, it was found in the rear of the car and has been collected and sent to the police station for inspection.

[Nanjing] Since the outbreak of the war of Japanese aggression against our country, the Ministry of Finance has taken various measures in response, considering that finance is the lifeblood of the nation. In order to clarify the true picture of various measures to the public, the reporter visited the ministry. The spokesman of the Ministry of Finance said that since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Shanghai market has been quite tense. At that time, the ministry negotiated with the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks to form a Discount Committee to maintain stability. People's hearts gradually turned stable. When the Shanghai War broke out, the ministry announced seven measures to stabilize national finance during the emergency period in order to control the outflow of funds and secure the national financial system. Since the implementation, the matter of capital flight has immediately subsided, and the market has become more stable. The Shanghai Banking Association, considering that Shanghai is the financial hub of the country and that industries and commerce in various places all rely on Shanghai for adjustment, proposed four additional measures to facilitate the circulation of goods, with the aim of making the market more stable. The ministry approved and implemented them accordingly. However, in order to maintain financial integrity and safeguard legitimate business, it ordered that the joint reserve fund and clearing house established by the two associations be effectively managed by the Central, China, and Communications Banks entrusted by the ministry to prevent corruption. This was immediately implemented. However, the agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial sectors in the interior still need to maintain the circulation of funds in order to maintain enterprises and secure resources. Since the Shanghai remittance plan cannot be promoted in the interior, and the situations in various places are different, in order to stabilize the overall financial system and maintain markets in various places, the ministry again wrote to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, asking them to first establish joint offices in important cities with branches, task them with examining local conditions and formulating appropriate measures, and report them for approval and implementation. Later, in order to invigorate the market, increase agricultural, industrial, commercial, and mining production, and meet the needs of the rear areas, it wired the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks again, asking them to establish joint lending committees in important commercial areas in the interior to handle lending matters. The locations are as follows: (1) Hankou, (2) Chongqing, (3) Nanjing, (4) Nanchang, (5) Guangzhou, (6) Jinan, (7) Zhengzhou, (8) Changsha, (9) Hangzhou, (10) Ningbo, (11) Wuxi, (12) Wuhu. At the same time, the lending measures were approved to be followed. According to the collateral specified in Article 4 of the lending measures, it includes 15 agricultural products, 7 industrial products, 11 mineral products, and bonds issued by the Central Government. For those with local market prices, the mortgage discount is calculated at 85% of the market price. Those without market prices are estimated by the local joint lending committee. Short-term commercial notes and the principal and interest coupons of winning public bonds can also be discounted. Financial institutions can apply for re-mortgages on their original collateral that meets the requirements listed in Article 4 in order to facilitate capital turnover. A detailed interpretation of these measures shows that all agricultural, industrial, commercial, and mining products, as well as short-term notes and central government bonds, can be used to borrow money. The national financial system will be greatly invigorated, which will undoubtedly contribute to coping with the national crisis and increasing resistance. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)

[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources: (1) Since the Sino-Japanese conflict, the market prices of various securities on the Japanese stock exchange had already fallen repeatedly. The recent decision by the army and navy to request an additional 200 million yen in temporary war expenses, coupled with rumors of the government controlling military industries and using public bonds of various companies to forcibly allocate public bonds, has made the market even more anxious. The market prices of various securities have plummeted to an extreme degree. (2) The Japanese Finance Minister will submit a draft law to the Diet soon, calling for the use of public bonds of various companies. Any newly established company with capital exceeding a certain amount must obtain government approval before it can open. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

### Enemy Planes Bomb and Destroy Our Cultural Institutions

Jiangxi Agricultural College and National Central University are Bombed; Hundreds of Innocent Civilians Perish

[Nanjing] Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Japanese pirates have repeatedly suffered defeats, so they sent a large number of planes to wantonly bomb our important cities, including Nanjing, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Hankou, and other places, as well as the lines along the Jinghu, Hangzhou-Zhejiang, and Jiangxi Railways. Enemy planes have dropped bombs repeatedly, and those bombed have mostly been our rear cultural institutions and groups. Many civilian residences in various places have been bombed and destroyed, and many of our civilians have been killed and injured. However, each time enemy planes attack, they are bravely intercepted by our air force, which has shot down more than 40 enemy planes one after another. In addition to the shame and anger of the enemy, its atrocities have become increasingly serious. On the 26th, six enemy planes flew to Nanchang and dropped bombs on the Agricultural College and rural normal schools, destroying many houses. It is said that the books and instruments of the Agricultural College suffered heavy losses. Also, the Nanchang Baoling Girls' School was also bombed and destroyed. Fortunately, it was summer vacation and most of the students had left the school, so they were not injured. However, many civilian houses near the school were bombed and destroyed, and more than 300 civilians were killed or injured. From 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM on the morning of the 26th, more than 20 enemy planes used the cover of artillery fire to attack the southeastern densely populated areas of Nanjing, dropping dozens of bombs and incendiary bombs from high altitudes of several thousand feet. After investigation, the destroyed buildings included the experimental middle school of National Central University, with more than 80 houses destroyed, and many workers and laborers killed or injured. The houses of the Veteran's School and the Provincial Third Hospital in the city were also bombed and destroyed. Also, several places on various streets were hit by multiple bombs. According to statistics, a total of four to five hundred civilian houses were destroyed and burned in various places, and hundreds of innocent civilians were killed or burned to death. Fortunately, our government's defenses are comprehensive. The fire brigade worked hard to extinguish the burning houses, and the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, and the dead were properly buried. These atrocities of the Japanese pirates, like the destruction of the Oriental Library, the largest cultural institution in Shanghai, and the Commercial Press during the January 28th Incident, and the burning of Nankai University in Tianjin and Nankai Middle School this time, are all planned and brutal acts of destroying our Chinese national culture. Their hideous faces of destroying world peace have been completely exposed.

### U.S. Government Reiterates It Will Not Abandon Far East Interests

International Treaties Should Be Strictly Respected; UK, U.S., and France Maintain Close Contact

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull announced today that he has formally notified the Chinese and Japanese governments, stating that the United States is determined to protect its public and private interests in the Far East, and that the Chinese and Japanese governments shall be held responsible for any losses incurred. As for the Japanese navy's blockade of southern Chinese seaports, the statement issued by the Japanese authorities in Tokyo, as opposed to those in Shanghai, is quite different. This may be a probing tactic by Japan to gauge the reactions of various countries before deciding on its next move. However, in terms of fundamental U.S. policy, the U.S. government is determined to take a broad view, that is, to compel all countries to abide by treaties and adhere to international law, and not just to protect the lives and property of American citizens. Hull's statement today proves that the United States is determined not to abandon its interests in the Far East or any part of the world. (National Telegram, 27th)

[Washington] Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, the UK's attitude towards Japan has now become more assertive. In the United States, public opinion is increasingly agitated by Japan's policies, and a similar stance to the UK has been adopted. Although the White House and the State Department are unwilling to issue any declarations that might be construed as warmongering, officials say that if Japan continues to adopt a provocative attitude, it will find itself in a difficult position. Although the United States is primarily concerned with protecting the lives and property of its citizens in the Sino-Japanese war, it also urgently wants to ensure that all treaties signed since 1921, especially the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees equal economic rights for all countries in China, are respected. Since 1931, Japan has repeatedly provided assurances that it would respect the economic rights of all countries within "Manchukuo," but the result has been a broken promise. American businesspeople have gradually been driven out of Japanese-occupied areas. Now, the outcome of the Sino-Japanese war may cause the interests held by the United States in certain parts of China to follow the same path as in "Manchukuo." The United States will learn from past mistakes and is determined not to allow any such situation to occur again. However, the U.S. government has no intention of humiliating the Japanese government. On the contrary, it will do its utmost to help Japan escape its predicament without damaging its prestige. When Secretary of State Hull gave a speech on July 16, he outlined various principles for maintaining peace. All countries, including Japan, have broadly agreed to these principles. However, Japan has made reservations regarding its interests in the Far East. Hull reiterated his position on the 21st of this month, refusing to accept this reservation and explaining that the fundamental principles enshrined in international law should apply to all countries in the world and cannot only apply to a particular country or continent. This is what Japan should understand. U.S. officials also stated that U.S. foreign policy is still based on the principles of goodwill and good neighborliness. However, these principles are sometimes misunderstood by countries inclined towards imperialism, who believe that the United States is unwilling to intervene in international affairs. Secretary of State Hull has made it clear in recent weeks that the United States is concerned about the economic and political recovery of the world and will not adopt a "policy of undermining the recovery" simply because "certain international vagrants" are unwilling to abide by the treaties they have freely signed. As for the strength of the U.S. Navy, political figures claim that for the past five years, the United States has been forced to participate in the arms race to maintain its national defense. Now, its naval power is comparable to that of any other country in the world and is in no way inferior. (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas dispatch)

[Paris] Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, political observers here believe that China may request a discussion at the League of Nations Council's regular meeting on the 10th of next month. What attitude France will take at that time has not yet been decided. However, France still believes that joint action by major democratic countries is urgently needed, and therefore maintains close contact with the British and American governments. French diplomatic circles believe that if the United States can provide assistance when the League of Nations takes action to promote peace in the future, the chances of success will be greatest. Therefore, if the League of Nations can make serious representations to China and Japan, and the United States also makes representations to these countries at the same time, it may be a good solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Regarding Japan's decision to blockade China's southeast coast, French officials are extremely concerned, but believe that this contradicts the fact that Japan has not declared war on China. According to international law, enemy coasts cannot be blockaded unless after a declaration of war. Moreover, according to existing treaties, all countries should maintain an open-door policy in China, and the blockade is still inconsistent with this. However, the Japanese authorities have guaranteed that foreign ships will not be detained, so the French government has no intention of lodging a formal protest at this time. In addition, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has recently invited the ambassadors of the five major countries concerned (UK, France, U.S., Germany, and Italy) to a meeting, and it is expected that Japan will declare its decision to respect international law. In addition, French officials deeply regret the incident in which British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was injured by Japanese aircraft, believing that this may have been a temporary mistake by Japanese air force personnel. It is hoped that this major incident will cause Japan to change its mind and adopt a more compromising attitude towards the recent proposal by the UK, France, and the United States to neutralize Shanghai.

### American People Petition Government

Stop Standing By and Watch Japanese Military Invade China

[Washington] The American League Against War and Fascism today wrote to Secretary of State Hull, urging the U.S. government to immediately invoke the Nine-Power Treaty and change America's policy of observation regarding the Japanese military's invasion of China. (National Telegram, 27th)

### Japan Invites Five-Nation Ambassadors to Meeting

To Discuss the Far East Situation

[Paris] An official from the French Foreign Ministry announced today that the Japanese Foreign Ministry will soon discuss the Far East situation with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to Japan. (National Telegram, 27th)

### Mediterranean War Risk Insurance Rates Increase

### Factory Federation Announces Stepped-Up Production

To Supply Wartime Needs and Maintain Livelihoods of Workers

The Chinese National Manufacturers' Federation of this city yesterday issued a notice to member manufacturers nationwide stating that, as the violent enemy invades and a long-term war of resistance begins, factories of our member associations, except for those in dangerous areas which should immediately relocate inland, should increase production in accordance with wartime needs, both to maintain the livelihoods of workers and to replenish the country's preparations for defense. It is hoped that this will be followed.

The Refugee Repatriation Committee, jointly formed by the Public Concession's Municipal Council, the French Concession's Conseil d'Administration, the Shanghai International Relief Committee, and the Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, and China Merchants Steam Navigation companies, was officially established yesterday. Representatives from the various bureaus and associations serve as members. It was decided that the repatriation of refugees would begin immediately. However, due to the difficulties caused by the enemy's declaration of a blockade of our seaports, it was decided to send a committee member, Jones, to contact various foreign shipping companies. At the same time, efforts are being made to carry out repatriation by train and inland river launches.

### Enemy Destroys Telegraph Submarine Cables

Three Companies' Submarine Telegraph Lines Severed from Yesterday Afternoon

The submarine cables of the Great Northern, Eastern Extension, and Pacific companies were destroyed by the Japanese at Wusongkou at 4 p.m. yesterday, disrupting telegraph communications.

### Western Newspaper Reports Japanese Blockade of Our Territorial Waters

Limited Impact on Chinese Business

The North-China Daily News reported that, according to the Chinese shipping industry, the Japanese blockade of Chinese waters is an action by the Japanese Third Fleet intended to interfere with and disrupt legitimate Chinese maritime commerce. Imports piled up in Hong Kong and Shanghai due to a lack of ships, which will reduce import taxes and seriously affect customs revenue. The Yangtze River basin, the largest market and the largest source of exports, will be cut off from Shanghai as a result of the blockade. Chinese-operated coastal shipping vessels are relatively few in number, so the impact is limited.

### Brief Report on Rear Area Work

Rescue and Relief

The Red Swastika Society rescue team departed at 3:50 a.m. yesterday for Lianyi Villa, Dachangzhen, and other places to rescue seven injured soldiers and police officers, who were sent to the Society's Third Hospital. In the afternoon, when the South Railway Station was bombed, the team immediately took stretchers and went to rescue sixteen injured civilians, who were sent to the First Hospital for treatment.

According to reports, the World Red Swastika Society learned that fierce fighting had been taking place in the area near Zhang Huarong's grocery store for several days. Our loyal and brave soldiers are fighting bravely against the enemy, but all the wounded soldiers lack medical care. Upon hearing this, the Society immediately dispatched a company from Shanghai yesterday afternoon to provide medical assistance, and set up the Third Wounded Soldiers' Hospital in a certain location, with Weng Zhilong serving as the physician in charge of everything, so that our loyal and brave soldiers can recover soon.

The Wujiang Shanghai Native Place Association sent off the fourth batch of more than 100 refugee compatriots the day before yesterday, and yesterday continued to send off the fifth batch, also numbering over 100 people. They were all transported by the Municipal Relief Association to Suzhou, and then transferred to boats back to their original homes.

Repatriation

The Municipal Relief Committee has repatriated over 20,000 refugees back to their hometowns. There are still hundreds of thousands of people waiting to be repatriated. In addition to consulting with transportation agencies and shipping authorities to transport as many as possible, and in view of the fact that the Japanese have recently disregarded humanitarianism and sent aircraft to bomb our refugee transport vehicles and strafe them with machine guns, the committee is currently consulting on concrete measures to ensure the safety of refugee repatriation, so that all refugees can safely return to their hometowns. In addition, the reception group of the committee, together with the repatriation group, sent over 1,000 refugees to Suzhou, and ordered each reception center to clear out a portion of its space in order to continue to accommodate refugees along the roads. The repatriation group has also suspended repatriation for two days so that the reception group can complete the investigation of the refugees' native places and then allocate them for repatriation.

The Donghai Vocational School Service Corps is providing relief to refugees. The corps has recently cooperated with the Cixi Shanghai Native Place Association to send Zhejiang refugees back to Hangzhou by several large buses every day. Zhejiang refugees who wish to return to their hometowns can register at the Cixi Native Place Association at Xiexing Building, 3rd Ma Road. A subsidised gasoline fee of five yuan is charged per person.

The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, upon receiving instructions from the Ministry of Communications regarding inland river transportation during the war, has ordered the joint organization of various groups in the city to coordinate matters. After receiving the order, the bureau established the Shanghai Municipal Inland River Ship Management Committee yesterday, and started with the repatriation of refugees. Yesterday, it specially dispatched three launches, Xie Su, Li Ning, and Li Shun, each towing twelve civilian boats, carrying 3,000 refugees from the Municipal Education Relief Association to Suzhou for dispersal. Today, it will continue to dispatch the Xin Yong'an and Yongping launches to continue repatriating refugees.

The Cixi Shanghai Native Place Association transports Shanghai compatriots back to Hangzhou by many large buses every day. The special bus that departed at 10 a.m. on the 26th safely returned to Shanghai on the 28th. The special bus that departed at 11 a.m. yesterday safely arrived in Hangzhou at 6:30 p.m. last night. Those who wish to return to their hometowns can register at the association's office. A subsidised gasoline fee of five yuan is charged per person.

The Wuxi Jiangyin Shanghai Native Place Joint Relief Association has established five refugee reception centers. The ninth batch of refugees, totaling 800 people, boarded five civilian boats led by Sun Shoubao the day before yesterday to return to Wuxi. Yesterday (August 28th), the tenth batch of 700 refugees boarded six civilian boats led by Yuan Bingrong and others to return to Wuxi.

The Yixing Shanghai Native Place Association is currently handling the registration of Yixing refugees at 128 Shanxi Road. The first batch of 500 to 600 refugees has already been repatriated to their hometowns. The date of the second batch of repatriation can be determined in about two or three days. If there are Yixing refugees in the reception centers who have not yet registered, they can go to that place to request registration.

Donations

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Mrs. Mayor Yu has been working tirelessly for national salvation, donating over 8,000 yuan to the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Women's Association for Comforting Self-Defense and Resistance Soldiers for rescue and relief purposes. On August 27th, Mrs. Yu also donated a gold tripod, a silver tripod, a silver shield, a silver teapot, and a silver airplane globe to the association for use in supporting the resistance against the enemy. On August 28th, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Women's Association for Comforting Self-Defense and Resistance Soldiers received two silver shields donated by Huang Furu, and two reams of white paper from the Cuihua Card Factory.

The Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants yesterday resolved at a council meeting to subscribe to 5,000 yuan of national salvation bonds from the institute's building fund, and sent letters to all 300+ members to do their best to subscribe or raise funds.

The Shanghai Education Association, in order to assist the government in enriching its national power and benefiting military planning for resistance against the enemy, decided through consultation by responsible persons to focus its efforts on subscribing to national salvation bonds for the government. The association has already purchased 2,000 yuan as a first step, and the large-scale fund-raising method has been planned by the responsible persons of the association, Huang Zaoxiong, Zhou Feicheng, Ma Yixian, etc. As soon as the schools start, they will universally solicit donations from the principals of large, medium, and small schools, as well as all teachers and staff, and parents of students.

In addition to the Shanghai Bar Association subscribing to 5,000 yuan of national salvation bonds in the name of the association, all 48 executive and supervisory committee members will each be responsible for soliciting at least 500 yuan of national salvation bonds, the more the better. If they raise 50,000 yuan, they will quickly subscribe to national salvation bonds at the designated bank. From yesterday onwards, all committee members have been actively soliciting donations from relatives and friends, or subscribing amounts themselves, in order to repay the needs of the country.

### Reasons for Delayed Departure of Passenger Trains on Two Lines Yesterday Afternoon

After the railway bureau actively sought solutions, railway traffic is now operating three round trips daily from Shanghai to both Beijing and Hangzhou. Other trains in the Jing Su Kunxi area also operate one round trip each. Many people have been travelling from Shanghai to the inland areas in recent days, and all trains originate from the West Station (Fanhuangdu). The trains yesterday afternoon were delayed due to damage to the tracks and only departed in the evening. All passenger tickets were previously purchased through the China Travel Service, but from today onwards, they will be sold entirely at the station.

### International Relief Committee Rescues Refugees in War Zone

According to reports from various sources, the International Relief Committee learned that there are many refugees in the war zone who have been brutally murdered by the Japanese, which is unbearable to hear, and they are in urgent need of rescue. The committee immediately consulted with the Chinese and Japanese military authorities and obtained their consent. This morning, a large number of vehicles were dispatched in multiple directions to rescue more than 500 refugees in the areas of Jiangwan Road, Dalianwan Road, Beikai'er Road, Jingzhou Road, Kunming Road, Luoshan Road, and Taopeng Road. The association transported them separately to the reception centers at Masinan Road, West Adams Road, and Bailinan Road for food. According to Mr. Zhang, a staff member who went to provide rescue, bodies were piled up everywhere along the way, and packages were piled up like mountains, most of them young and strong. He personally witnessed dozens of people being strafed by Japanese machine guns. The priests and foreign relief workers who accompanied him were all heartbroken, and expressed their indignation at the brutal actions of the Japanese.

Yesterday at 4 p.m., the association held a plenary committee meeting and decided on important issues: (1) Proposal to expand the reception of refugees: It was resolved to find suitable open space to build reception centers to accommodate more refugees. (2) The Chinese Medical Association requested the establishment of a light injury hospital for refugees: It was resolved to provide financial assistance from the association. (3) Reception of refugees should not be divided by nationality: The resolution was passed.

### Foreign Nationals Continue to Leave Shanghai

300 Dutch Nationals Scheduled to Depart; 100 American Nationals Left Yesterday

Dutch Acting Consul General Gaximen held a notice urging Dutch nationals to go to purchase tickets as soon as possible. Those who cannot afford the fare can go to the consulate to receive treatment. It is reported that more than 300 people have already registered with the consulate.

### Murder for 200 Yuan Claimed Three Lives

Wang Peixin and Two Apprentices Were Killed for the Same Reason

The woodworking shop at 65, Lane 84, North Fujian Road, was opened by Wang Peixin (44 years old) from Pudong. Since the Shanghai war, Wang has been living elsewhere, and ordered old partner Ding Fulin from Pudong, and apprentices Yang Gensheng (20 years old) and Zhang Binggen (28 years old) to stay and guard the shop. On the 25th of this month, someone discovered that Wang had been hacked to death with an axe in the shop, and the 200 yuan in legal tender he had on him was also missing. After investigation by Hua Detective Xiang Wu and others from the Huishi Police Station, it was found that Wang had been killed for money, and Ding was strongly suspected. He was arrested and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It has now been learned that the two apprentices, Zhang and Yang, who were staying in the shop with Ding, were also murdered. Their bodies have been found, and the cause of death has been confirmed by Dr. Zhang Yan, a forensic doctor from the First Special Court, to be the same as Wang Peixin: death by axe hacking. The bodies have decomposed and are maggot-infested, indicating that they have been killed for several days. Corpse forms were filled out and orders were issued for burial. The perpetrator, for the sake of 200 yuan, did not hesitate to kill three people. The viciousness of his methods is appalling.

### Strange Lights Discovered in Zhabei

Recently, a strange light has been discovered on the rooftops of Zhabei. It is shaped like a balloon, its color is purple-red, and sometimes green. It is as big as a soccer ball, and is often seen from a distance at high altitudes every night. When this strange light is discovered at closer distances, a faint sound can be heard, and it rises above the rooftops, about two or three zhang high. It lasts for about ten minutes before extinguishing. Those who see it are amazed.

### Residents of Various Lanes Should Quickly Form Residents' United Associations

The Guidance Committee of the Lane United Association of the First Special District of this city yesterday issued a notice to the residents of various lanes in the district, as follows: We have received a joint letter from the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that Wang Manyun, Shen Tianxin, Zhang Yichen, Cao Zhigong, Zhu Yangwu, He Wuliang, Zhou Xuexiang, Jin Guangmei, and eight others have been appointed as members of the Guidance Committee of the Lane Residents' United Association of the First Special District, with Wang Manyun designated as the director, and Shen Tianxin and Zhang Yichen as the deputy directors, etc. In this time of national crisis, the people should have strong unity and unified steps to rise up and save the country from danger. We urge the residents of each lane in our First Special District to quickly come to the association to fill out an application form, follow the organization charter, and immediately prepare to establish lane residents' united associations to strengthen unity without delay. We hereby announce this. The association has also scheduled a meeting of the entire guidance committee for today.

### First Hunan Ship Carrying Goods Arrives in Shanghai After the War

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, for half a month, all Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai have telegraphed coastal merchant ships to suspend their voyages to Shanghai. Even foreign mail ships only arrived at Sanjiashui, and all goods bound for Shanghai were diverted to Hong Kong. Yesterday, the British Swire Group's Hunan ship ventured from Hong Kong and Fuzhou to Shanghai, fully loaded with goods from Hong Kong and Fujian. It is currently unloading cargo. This is the first ship to carry goods from other ports to Shanghai after the Shanghai war. The ship is now planning to carry goods purchased by foreign merchants in Shanghai to Hong Kong.

The North-China Daily News reported that Shanghai merchant ships are gradually starting to operate. The New Beijing, which had been stranded in Wusong for some time, entered the Huangpu River yesterday morning (August 27th) and sailed to Ningbo in the evening with 1,200 refugees. When it returns to Shanghai, it is expected to carry a large number of passengers to Shantou on Monday. Swire Group's Hunan has sailed into the Shanghai port and is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Guangzhou tomorrow. The Shengjing is scheduled to depart for Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai on Tuesday. However, Yangtze River shipping is still unable to operate because the Chinese government has implemented a blockade under Zhenjiang.

### Shanghai District Court Retains Few Judges and Prosecutors to Work

The Rest Are on Leave Without Pay

The daily expenses of the Shanghai District Court are paid from the court's public funds from previous years, which is called "Fa Yu." Because the court is located in a litigation-prone area of Shanghai, the income from litigation fees, fines, etc. is sufficient to maintain it. The court originally had 60,000 yuan in "Fa Yu." 30,000 yuan was reimbursed under the construction of the former President Fu Yuan, and only 30,000 yuan remains. However, there are as many as 40 judges and prosecutors, as well as clerks, recorders, bailiffs, judges, public servants, and the salaries of the custodial center. The meager 30,000 yuan can only last for two months. Now, all the prisoners in the custodial center have been released, and no cases have been accepted from the outside. As for civil litigation, it is feared that none will occur this year. Since the court is not accepting cases, it has no income from litigation fees and cannot maintain itself. Moreover, since there are no cases to handle, these dozens of officials are not needed. Therefore, President Zhou and Chief Du specially convened a court affairs meeting yesterday. All officials above the rank of clerk attended. It is reported that the proposal was to retain three judges and three prosecutors in the court, and six clerks paired with these judges, for a total of twelve people. These twelve people should come to the court every day to work and will still be paid their original salaries. All other officials and bailiffs will be uniformly placed on leave without pay. When the situation is calm, they will be paid retroactively and the matter will be reported to the superiors for record.

### Chamber of Commerce Asks Ministry of Industry for Instructions on Factory and Material Relocation

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Industry: We received a letter from the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association stating that, according to a letter from the association's member, Gong Ji Battery Factory, the current Shanghai war is unlikely to end in the short term. Regarding the relocation of industrial materials, our factory suggests that your ministry quickly devise a plan to move the main raw materials used in battery production, such as lead sheets, zinc sheets, and sal ammoniac, away from the war zone or to the inland, to avoid depleting resources and to meet urgent production needs. Upon deliberation, we believe that the member's statement is insightful, and many manufacturers in Shanghai share this view. We are therefore forwarding the letter for your consideration. We hope that your ministry will promptly formulate a comprehensive plan for relocating industrial materials to facilitate informing and guiding the industry. Respectfully submitted. After investigation, the relocation of factories and materials to safe areas should involve a comprehensive plan. We recently learned that your ministry has established a committee to study this matter. Based on the foregoing circumstances, we hereby respectfully submit this matter to your ministry for review and approval. We hope that this matter will be discussed and instructed for compliance, which would be in the public interest. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce expresses its gratitude."

### Pawn Industry Asks for Flexible Withdrawals to Stabilize the Economy of the Poor

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that it had received a letter from the Shanghai Pawnshop Association: "The association's member pawnshops have previously resolved to conduct redemption in safer areas and have separately written to silver firms for the convenience of exchanging subsidiary currency. However, member pawnshops are now reporting that since the Ministry of Finance announced the seven articles of the 'Emergency Financial Stabilization Measures,' pawnshops can only withdraw 5% of their deposits from silver firms each week, with a limit of 150 yuan. In this situation, it is impossible to resume business. With refugees everywhere, the number of pawns is greater than the number of redemptions. Even with each household pawning only a few yuan or cents, it is impossible to offset the pawns with redemptions. It is essential to rely on the special flexibility and normal transactions of silver firms to cope with the situation and ensure sustainability. We are therefore requesting a special presentation to the Ministry of Finance, seeking flexibility for pawnshops within the seven articles to allow the city's common people and refugees to have economic turnover, which would not only benefit the stability of the rear. We propose that, similar to the example of factories issuing wages, the Ministry of Finance should supplement the fifth item of the 'Emergency Financial Stabilization Measures' to enable the pawn industry to have capital turnover and the poor to maintain their livelihoods."

### Yan Tongyin Hall Donates 10,000 Yuan to Relief Refugees

The refugee camps run by the Joint Charity Relief Association are numerous and in urgent need of funds. Efforts have been made to solicit donations. It is now known that "Yan Tongyin Hall" has generously donated 10,000 yuan in legal tender to the association, designated for the relief of refugees. The association has sent a reply expressing its gratitude after receiving the donation.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Opens Cold Storage Facilities

Commodity Prices Expected to Stabilize

The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that public security within the Shanghai Concession has become increasingly stable, order has gradually been restored, and transportation is gradually resuming. Therefore, all vegetable markets within the concession have been restored to their pre-war state. However, due to a slight shortage of food, prices in the central market are about 20% to 25% higher than usual. To stabilize market prices, the Shanghai Municipal Council has arranged to remove goods stored in its cold storage facilities on Dixwell Road and Chaoufoong Road for sale in various vegetable markets. The Shanghai Municipal Council is working hard to open other cold storage facilities. Therefore, commodity prices in the vegetable market will soon return to their original state.

### Sending Refugees Back to Their Hometowns

Guangdong

In addition to providing relief to refugees and managing refugee camps, the Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai has chartered a Taikoo Shipping's Hunan steamer to send refugees back to their hometowns tomorrow (29th) at 2 PM. The arrangements are as follows: First and second-class passengers should gather at Taikoo Shipping at 10 AM tomorrow, and 15-yuan passengers should gather at the shipping company's inspection room at 8 AM to board the ship together. The association will arrange for special vehicles to transport the refugees from the various refugee camps to the Taikoo Wharf to leave Shanghai for the south.

Yixing

The Yixing Native Association in Shanghai, recognizing the large number of refugees from Yixing seeking refuge in the concession, has established a registration office at 128 Shanxi Road to prepare for their return to their hometowns. On the afternoon of the 27th, the first group of 500-600 refugees has already departed on the Jiangping and Xinyongli steamers via Suzhou to Yixing. Starting today, registration will continue at the original location. Yixing refugees who have not yet registered, as well as Yixing refugees in various refugee camps in the city who have not yet been sent back, are urged to register as soon as possible to avoid delay. It is reported that the departure date for the second batch will be in about two or three days.

### Statistics on Refugees in the Concession

As of the 27th of this month, the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has inspected a total of 97 refugee camps within the Public Concession, housing 51,035 refugees, of whom 2,053 have been vaccinated by the department. The number of dysentery cases among the refugees is gradually increasing, but the proportion of patients to the total number of refugees is not very high.

### Sincere and Wing On Department Stores Resume Business as Usual

### Cracks in Japanese Trade and China's Resistance

— Shiren

Since the North China Incident, Japan, determined to invade China by force, has greatly expanded its military expenditures, thus beseeching the financial community for unified support. Therefore, after the incident, an extraordinary gathering of financial figures was held. Participants included Toshitsuku Juichi (Bank of Japan), Okubo Toshikata (Yokohama Specie Bank), Horae Ichimatsu (Industrial Bank of Japan), Ishii Mitsuo (Hypothec Bank of Japan), Mandai Junshiro (Mitsui Bank), Hayashita Kiyoshi (Mitsubishi Bank), Mori Hirozo (Yasuda Bank), Hasegawa Gen (Sumitomo Bank), Ake Uteruo (Dai-ichi Bank), Kato Keizaburo (Bank of Chosen), and Yamamoto Kenji (Bank of Taiwan), among over twenty others, all prominent figures in the financial world. At this gathering, Finance Minister Kaya explained the government's stance on China and then implored the financial community to prevent a sharp fall in public debt and to support new taxes. The financial side responded with agreement, promising to provide convenience and assistance to the government within the possible scope.

Since the completion of this extraordinary gathering, the Ministry of Finance has roughly glimpsed the intentions of the financial community. Consequently, the additional budget has been repeatedly increased. According to recent rumors, the so-called incident expenses have increased to 7 billion yuan, which must be said to be extremely large. However, this claim has not been confirmed due to recent disruptions in telecommunications between China and Japan. Nevertheless, the two supplementary budgets triggered by this incident are a clear fact. The first supplementary budget amounted to 102 million yen, and the second amounted to 410 million yen, totaling 512 million yen. The financial resources for this expenditure came from increased taxes, new taxes, last year's surplus, and public debt. However, the issuance of new public debt accounted for the largest portion. All of these budgets were unanimously approved by the House of Representatives. However, the Army and Navy Ministries were still dissatisfied with these figures, believing that they were insufficient to cover expenses. After repeated negotiations by the Finance Minister, they reluctantly agreed. Therefore, if the war expands further, further expansion of the budget is to be expected.

According to the latest national census, the total population of Japan is 97,654,628. Therefore, the amount burdened by the Japanese people due to this incident is over 5 yuan per person. However, this is only the huge sum suddenly burdened in one month. If the war extends to half a year or more, the livelihood of the Japanese people will inevitably be severely threatened, and Japan's finances will inevitably fall into ruin. However, this financial crisis is partly due to the expansion of military expenditures and partly due to the impact of the war on trade. If we now observe the state of its trade in the first half of this year and then glimpse its future trends, we can understand the crisis in which Japan's politics and finances are trapped. At the same time, we can prove that if China's resistance can be prolonged, it will inevitably lead Japan to the brink of destruction.

According to accurate statistics, Japan's trade volume in the previous year was 1.602 billion yen in exports and 2.243 billion yen in imports. The trade deficit was over 641 million yen. This deficit increased by four-tenths compared to the previous period's deficit of 314 million yen. It can be said to be the second-largest figure since the Great Kanto Earthquake, following the 683 million yen thirteen years ago. However, the large trade deficit three years ago was due to the purchase of materials for the reconstruction of Kanto. This abnormal situation cannot be regarded as a normal phenomenon. Therefore, the trade deficit in the first half of this year can be called an unprecedented record in the history of Japanese trade. The reasons for this trade deficit are no more than three, namely:

(1) The expansion of finance, especially under the influence of the national defense enhancement plan, led to the purchase of a large amount of materials.

(2) Due to the expansion of productive capacity, it led to the purchase of necessary machinery and raw materials.

(3) Importers, knowing that there would be price increases, increased shipping costs, and depreciation of the yen exchange rate, purchased large quantities in advance.

However, the expansion of the trade deficit is partly due to the increase in import volume and partly due to the soaring prices of goods. In recent years, due to the economic boom, the prices of goods and raw materials in various countries have risen successively. Therefore, in reality, there is often a decrease in quantity, but an increase in value.

Examining Japan's imported raw materials, the largest increase rate is for copper, increasing by 22.6%. The next are rubber and iron. These raw materials are clearly closely related to military supplies, that is, these raw materials are mostly raw materials for manufacturing lethal weapons. However, in terms of its exports, cotton cloth, raw silk, and machinery are the most numerous. From the perspective of the increase rate, machinery is the highest, accounting for 26.5%. Other items such as paper (5.5%) and hats (5.5%) are lower. The export targets for these commodities are mainly the Three Eastern Provinces, Kwantung Leased Territory, North America, and China.

Recently, due to the full-scale war of resistance against Japan by China, Japan's trade with China has suffered a fatal blow. Before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, contracts between China and Japan had been successively canceled. After the Shanghai war, these contracts could no longer be continued. Therefore, trade between the two countries can be said to have returned to a state of severance. If the war is prolonged, Japanese commodities will be equivalent to destroying a major sales outlet, and the export volume will inevitably shrink greatly. Furthermore, Japan's foreign trade in recent years has generally been sluggish. This phenomenon is not due to the suppression or hindrance of various countries (except for the deliberate mitigation of suppressive policies in the Dutch East Indies). It is due to the fact that in recent years, Japanese commodities have lost their special advantage – low prices – due to increased raw material and shipping costs, and have gradually become sluggish in overseas markets. Conversely, in terms of its imports, since they are mostly military raw materials, if the war is prolonged, the import volume of these raw materials will naturally expand further, and the trade deficit will naturally increase. Therefore, if China can resist to the end, Japan's finances, simply in terms of trade losses, will have a phenomenon of being unable to turn around, let alone the large expansion of other military expenditures. Therefore, in order to put Japan to death, we should grit our teeth and fight a long-term war of attrition with Japan. Then Japan's collapse will be inevitable.

### Jinpu Front Gradually Enters Major War

Jinan correspondence, the Japanese army on the Jinpu Line has recently reinforced troops and is actively invading south. Our army defends the country and the land, bravely fighting.

However, there were still some stubborn remnants of the enemy who refused to retreat. Their artillery fire line was in the east, opposite Jinghai Station. Rifle fire could be heard at the station. Our armored vehicles have all been driven to the front to prepare for a fight with the enemy. At the same time, a certain unit of our Machang garrison also drove to reinforce. By the evening, the battle became even more fierce. It was reported that about 2,000 enemy troops participated in the battle, and a certain unit of our reinforcements also rushed to the scene overnight and engaged in battle at the station.

At 3:25 pm, another 22 enemy aircraft, divided into four teams, flew swiftly from the east. Our air force received the report and immediately took off to meet them. Although they were outnumbered, our air force soldiers were a hundred times braver. In the air over Suzhou, they used machine guns to strafe and opened anti-aircraft guns and rifles to shoot at the enemy aircraft. However, two enemy aircraft were shot down by our air force. Both enemy aircraft were burned on the spot after falling, and both Japanese pilots were killed. The other enemy aircraft fled to the east. The battle lasted about twenty minutes.

### Shijiazhuang Captures Traitors

Accomplices Scattered in Various Places Specialize in Spying on Military Intelligence / Organized Plainclothes Teams Attempting to Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Riot / Baoding Also Arrests Several Important Traitors

Baoding correspondence, since the Lugouqiao Incident, the various important locations north of Zhengzhou on the Pinghan Line have repeatedly cracked plots of traitorous activities, which have been severely punished by local authorities to deter future offenders. As Pingjin fell one after another, Baoding has become the only military and political center on the national defense front line. The Yi Provincial Government has repeatedly issued orders to all its subordinate agencies to jointly maintain the security of the provincial capital, and strictly ordered the joint inspection office of the military police and the Baoding Provincial Capital Garrison Headquarters to ban illegal activities and closely arrest traitors. As a result, multiple cases of traitors have been cracked in Baoding and Shijiazhuang in recent days, among which the case cracked in Shijiazhuang is particularly noteworthy. The reason is that Shijiazhuang was originally an important station on the northern section of the Pinghan Line and the starting point of the Zhengtai Line. With convenient transportation, it has become a commercial center on the border between Hebei and Shanxi, and is also valued by the enemy. The enemy sent traitors to lure unemployed people in the area with heavy money to drive them to do their bidding. After the authorities discovered their conspiracy, they sent a large number of detectives to investigate. The literary editor Li Yiliang (also known as Li Duoshan) of the Shimen Zibao and retired soldier Yang Huamin, who were acting suspiciously, were arrested a few days ago. After interrogation, it was proven that they were indeed serving as enemy agents, colluding to establish a newspaper in Zhengding as a secret agency, and had recruited many accomplices in Baoding and Shimen to organize a plainclothes team. The plan was to riot in the Shijiazhuang area when the enemy attacked Baoding. All these conspiracies have been confessed by them. The Shijiazhuang garrison has sentenced the traitors to death in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China. Yesterday, they were tied up, wearing tall paper hats with their names and crimes written on them, paraded through the streets, and then escorted to the Xihua Garden Theater to be executed by firing squad. After the case was solved, Ye Yuling, director of the Shijiazhuang Police Bureau, continued to intensify the search for their accomplices in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Another person, Song Tonglin, 38 years old, from Bin County, Shandong Province, was arrested a few days ago. He was also engaged in illegal activities under the pretext of selling newspapers and was also executed by firing squad. At the same time, in Baoding, two important suspects, Gao Tianzhu and Zhang Jinhui, were arrested. Gao and Zhang claimed to be representatives of the Beijing Reporters Association, who came to Baoding to comfort the wounded soldiers. However, they were found to be carrying a map of the Baoding area with marked symbols and three certificates from the Baoding University Antiterrorist Patriotic Society, but after verification, they were all forged. The authorities are investigating strictly. Judging from the objects they carried and the evasiveness of their words, they are undoubtedly traitors. In addition, the Baoding Police Bureau cracked another case of traitor at a certain place a few days ago. According to the interrogation, there are still three or four accomplices active in Baoding. The authorities have taken strict measures to eliminate the source of trouble.
