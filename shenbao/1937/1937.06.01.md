### Chu Minyi Reports on the Jing-Dian Tour

At the Central Memorial Week Meeting (Continued from Yesterday)

[Nanjing] After we arrived in Kunming, because there were too few branch roads on the highway, and there were no highways from Kunming to Sichuan, nor from Kunming to Guangxi, we had to return to Guiyang in order to split into northern and southern routes. The northern route ended in Chongqing and disbanded after returning to Chongqing from Chengdu. The southern route went around Guangxi and disbanded in Hengyang. Therefore, the route we took this time passed through the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, and a corner of Guangxi Province, entering from the west and exiting from the north. When we went to Hunan Province, it was from east to west, and when we returned, it was from south to north, crossing twice. When we went to Guizhou Province, it was also from east to west, and when we returned, we split into northern and southern routes in Guiyang. Yunnan was from east to west, ending in Kunming. However, after I arrived in Kunming, I and a group of 16 members took the Dian-Yue Railway to Hekou, the border of Yunnan, where it meets French Vietnam. We had to go there once. The Dian-Yue Railway winds around mountains and tunnels through rocks, and the engineering is very dangerous. In the future, we will build the Xiang-Qian Railway and the Qian-Gui Railway, and the Dian-Yue Railway is a very good model. Because when we passed through the junction of Qian and Gui, the car drove up and down on a mountain 2,150 meters high, with more than 20 winding roads each time. The highest point of the Dian-Yue Railway is 2,025 meters. In the future, our Qian-Gui Railway will be even higher than the Dian-Yue Railway. I had two purposes in going to the border of Yunnan: first, to visit the Dian-Yue Railway, and second, to inspect the border of Dian-Yue. Because Yunnan is located in the extreme southwest of our country and borders Vietnam, Myanmar, and Siam, there are consulates of Great Britain, France, the United States, and Japan in Kunming. Recently, the Yunnan authorities have handled border affairs properly, so the relations between the countries are very harmonious. Therefore, we were welcomed and sent off by them both when we went and when we came, especially the French side, who treated our members very cordially, showing us the railway and the fiber factory. After we arrived in Kunming, we originally intended to visit Dali and Jianjiu, but we regretted that we could not fulfill our wishes due to time constraints. The tin mines in Jianjiu are world-famous. Yunnan used to be a province that relied on subsidies, but in recent years, it has been able to be self-sufficient, and recently it has been able to ban opium in stages, transforming into a surplus province. Most of this is due to the help of tin production. Guangxi also produces tin, which is increasing year by year, and also exports tung oil, so it is also considered a surplus province. At a time when the whole country has a large trade deficit, we in the tour group were very happy to hear the news of the trade surplus in these two provinces. Guangxi has also been planting tung trees on a large scale in recent years, like Hunan. Therefore, Guangxi, which has always been plagued by bandits, with the saying "no mountain without a cave" and "no cave without a bandit," is now able to have no beggars and no idlers. Now I can say that Guangxi has "no mountain without a cave, and no cave without wonder." In this beautiful scenery, it is possible to create a good society and reverse the reasons for the weakness inherited from the past, the saying "good iron is not used to make nails, and good men do not become soldiers," and change it to the slogan "good iron is used to make nails, and good boys become soldiers." However, the tin mining industries in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces have not yet been developed on a large scale. In the future, as transportation becomes more convenient, we can certainly improve mining methods, use more machines, and reduce the hardship of manual labor. The future output will definitely increase several times, so the hope for the future is very great. This Jing-Gui highway tour group departed from the capital and returned to Hengyang via the southern route, lasting a total of 49 days. The northern route returned to Chongqing, lasting a total of 51 days. The journey was more than 10,000 li. Before we set off, the members or their relatives and friends were worried about this long journey. Everyone thought that there would be miasma in the Yunnan-Guizhou area, and that those who were not acclimatized would get sick, or that they would encounter bandits on the way, or that the car would crash. These things could not be avoided. However, thanks to the prestige and blessing of the Central Government, although we walked through very high and dangerous mountain roads, and very difficult bridges, and crossed rivers with very rapid currents, and encountered heavy rain and thick fog, we were able to return to the capital safely. When we arrived in Guiyang, we had already passed through some difficult roads, but we knew that the most difficult roads were still in western Guizhou. Therefore, at the welcome meeting held by all circles in Guiyang this month, we indirectly encouraged the courage of the members and directly praised the hard work of the Central Army. That is to say, whenever we went to a place, the people who welcomed us always said things like "traveling thousands of miles, it must be very hard." In fact, we were very embarrassed, because we were sitting in cars and walking on well-built highways, so it could not be considered hard work. The real hard work was done by our armed comrades, who suppressed bandits while building roads, and some of the people who worked hard after cultivating the land braved the wind and rain to enlist. In the past, the warlord's army would destroy a place wherever it went, always causing nine out of ten houses to be empty and the chickens and dogs to be restless. Now, under the leadership of the Central Government, the armed comrades are working for local construction, using military engineering to promote national transportation construction. Compared with the warlord's army in the past, there is a world of difference. This spirit of hard work really makes us admire them. These words are of course praising the armed comrades, but indirectly, they are encouraging the members not to have any fear of hardship. This Jing-Gui highway tour group, the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Council, and the provincial governments through which we passed, prepared for several months, so the preparations were very thorough. The itinerary, description, and reception schedule, as well as detailed records and statistics on local production, administrative conditions, education, and the judiciary, made it very convenient for us to visit and investigate various places, and the impressions we gained were also very good, but also very many. Due to time constraints, I cannot report on them in detail one by one. In the future, after all the members return to Beijing, the Executive Yuan will also set up an editorial committee to compile all the materials we have obtained into a book with rich content and a general report, which will be distributed to various related agencies, or publicly display the photos we have taken and the local products we have obtained. Today, after this brief report, I would like to offer two points to the Central Government: that is, we saw that the culture and economy of those places in the southwest are backward and withered. We believe that the biggest problem in China today is that culture and economy are too concentrated. Culture is concentrated in Shanghai and Beiping. One place has more than a dozen universities, while Guizhou, with the size of the entire province, does not even have one university, let alone a higher vocational education school. The students there often look like middle school students in terms of age, but they are actually still in elementary school. Even if they do well in middle school, there is no place to go to university. Therefore, Guizhou should have at least one university. Although Yunnan and Guangxi have universities, they are incomplete, and Hunan has only one. In short, higher education should also be popularized, especially in the border areas, because the border areas are very poor, and it costs too much money for their children to study in prosperous places, which their parents cannot afford. Moreover, after these children graduate in prosperous places and get used to watching movies and dancing, they are unwilling to go back. Therefore, we must train talents locally so that they can be used locally. Now their culture is backward, mostly because there are no higher education institutions. Even if there are, there is no way to hire good teachers. This is something that the Central Government should pay attention to. The second point is that it is very bad that China's economy is concentrated in Shanghai. One reason is that it is dangerous, and the other is that it is useless for one place to accumulate so much capital, while in the border areas, one dollar is used as a dozen dollars. Mining development and wasteland reclamation can only be abandoned on the ground if there is no money. This is also something that the Central Government should pay attention to. How can we invest the money concentrated in one place in the border areas so that China's economic development can be more balanced? We know that to strengthen the country, we cannot rely solely on the prosperity of one or two commercial ports, and to produce talents, we cannot concentrate a few universities in one place. In the past, I went to the west and came back feeling that why don't we go to the northwest to create jobs, but everyone is fighting for jobs in the southeast? If we are not careful, the jobs will be broken and no one will be able to eat. This time, I have the same feeling after returning from the southwest. If we continue to concentrate culture and economy as they are now, we will definitely not be able to make the best use of people's talents, land, or things. Although we are said to have a vast land and abundant resources, we are still a poor country with a trade deficit every year. I hope that the Central Government will adopt the two points of universal culture and balanced economy, and we will see that talents will emerge in the southwest, and the development of real storage and the prosperity of the country can be expected soon. When we went, we saw that the late rice had not yet been transplanted, and the tung trees on both sides of the highway were already blooming. When we came back, the late rice had already been transplanted, and the tung trees had already borne fruit. I hope that our tour will also have a good result. (Central News Agency, 31st)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Change of the Japanese Cabinet

— Yu

The Lin Cabinet of Japan finally announced its dissolution. Counting from its inauguration on February 2nd to its resignation on May 31st, it lasted only 117 days. Except for the Third Katsura Taro Cabinet, it is the shortest-lived cabinet in Japanese cabinet history. However, although its lifespan was short, the waves stirred up by the Lin Cabinet in Japanese politics were not small. First, it not only failed to ease the opposition between parliamentarism and fascism, but also had a fierce conflict with the established parties of parliamentarians, eventually dissolving the parliament by illegal means, arousing extreme dissatisfaction from all parties. Second, and more importantly, we should note that the Lin Cabinet pulled Japanese politics onto a more reactionary path. The formal establishment of a huge budget accommodated the purpose of the military and fascists' insane arms expansion, making it difficult for the Japanese people to breathe. The so-called eight major policies announced on April 10th, including domestic affairs, diplomacy, finance, economy, culture, education, etc., all focused on strengthening fascist rule. Recently, with the establishment of the Planning Agency and various committees, the fascist ruling mechanism has become increasingly strengthened.

However, the will of the Japanese people is ultimately unwilling to see constitutionalism deviate from the norm. The actions of the Lin Cabinet inevitably received deep opposition from the people. The results of the parliamentary elections at the end of April were the most obvious and fairest judgment of the Japanese people on the Lin Cabinet. After the parliamentary elections, the Lin Cabinet should have resigned in accordance with constitutional practice. However, Lin Xianjuro relied on the particularity of the Japanese political mechanism and still wanted to support it. Recently, he encountered a fierce siege from various parties, and the military, seeing that the domestic situation was not good, was unwilling to support it to the end. Therefore, the Lin Cabinet had to retire.

The successor Prime Minister, Konoe Fumimaro, is a figure who has been mentioned in every cabinet change in recent years. In terms of harmonizing political parties and military fascism, he is indeed the most suitable. It is just that he is always unwilling to be a puppet who is squeezed, so he did not take on this position in the past. This time, the great mandate has fallen on him. How he will clean up the current chaotic Japanese political situation is very worthy of attention.

Now Konoe Fumimaro has formally received the great mandate and formed a cabinet. According to our speculation, in this successor cabinet, the kind of intermediate nature that is biased towards fascism will probably continue. Because the opposition between parliamentarism and fascism may be temporarily eased, but it is not enough to completely eliminate the friction between the two sides by relying solely on Konoe Fumimaro's qualifications.

That being said, from the perspective of peace in East Asia, we cannot but express considerable expectations for this new cabinet produced after the parliamentary storm. During the Lin Cabinet, Foreign Minister Sato had made a statement on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations on an equal footing. Unfortunately, his words and deeds did not match. If the successor cabinet can thoroughly recognize our country's position and promote the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations in the spirit of genuine equality and fairness after removing various obstacles caused by past acts of aggression, this is what we deeply hope for.

### The Japanese Political Situation Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse, Konoe Receives the Mandate to Form a Cabinet

Uniting Political Parties, the Military, Financial Groups, and Bureaucrats – The Army Minister Remains in Office, Hirota Will Take Charge of Diplomacy Again

[Tokyo] Duke Konoe Fumimaro, the president of the House of Peers, entered the palace to meet the Japanese Emperor at 5:30 PM today. He immediately received the great mandate to form a new cabinet and requested time to fulfill his mission. He left the Imperial Palace at 5:50 PM. The financial community expressed a warm welcome to Konoe's acceptance of the great mandate to form a cabinet and believed that Konoe would be able to form a powerful national cabinet to reconcile the current conflicts between the military, political parties, and the government. (Central News Agency, 1st)

[Tokyo] Konoe, who has begun forming a cabinet, first met with Army Minister Sugiyama Mutsumi at 8:30 PM and asked him to recommend a successor as Army Minister. Army Minister Sugiyama then visited the Kanin Palace at 9:10 PM with Commander Terauchi. As a result of the meeting of the three chiefs, it was decided to ask General Sugiyama to remain in office. General Sugiyama then replied to Konoe with this intention. As for the retention of the Navy Minister, the heads of the departments unanimously agreed as a result of the meeting on the evening of the 1st. They will report to Prince Fushimi on the 2nd and can reply to Konoe. (Domei News Agency, 1st)

[Tokyo] Konoe has established a cabinet formation headquarters in his official residence. Under the direction of Kawarada, he began receiving people from all walks of life to quickly form a new government. The former Prime Minister, Hirota Hiroki, is highly likely to be appointed as Foreign Minister again. Japan's future diplomatic policy is very important. Hirota and Konoe are very close friends. The former served as Prime Minister after the February 26 Incident, which was recommended by Konoe. Therefore, it is very likely that Hirota will accept the invitation. Tsuda Shingo, the general manager of Kanebo, will serve as the Minister of Commerce and Industry and has left Osaka for Tokyo. Yuki, Sugiyama, Yonai, and Nomi can remain in office. Kawarada will remain as Minister of Home Affairs or be reassigned as Chief Secretary. Konoe has met with representatives of the Minseito party to discuss the issue of political parties joining the cabinet. It is said that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties will each send one person to join the Konoe cabinet. The new cabinet is expected to be fully formed tomorrow. (Central News Agency, 1st)

### Konoe Fumimaro, Who Has Received the Mandate to Form a Cabinet

### Konoe's Remarks

The Focus of Cabinet Formation is on the Minister of Finance

[Tokyo] Konoe, who was ordered to form a cabinet, made the following remarks at the cabinet formation headquarters at 6:15 PM on the 1st:

I was summoned to the Imperial Palace and honored with an audience, where I received the Imperial command to form a cabinet. I requested a short delay before accepting the command and then left the Emperor's presence. I was not prepared to form a cabinet. Although I have a wide circle of acquaintances, I have no particularly close friends. Therefore, I am now considering candidates for cabinet ministers and the Chief Cabinet Secretary. In my meeting with Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa, he specifically inquired about my health. My physical condition has not changed much over the years. Because I have never had the qualifications or preparation to take on political affairs in my daily life, I lack confidence in this regard. However, I intend to dedicate myself to the country regardless of success or failure. Regarding the ministers in the Hayashi cabinet who wish to remain, I am now considering this. Cabinet formation cannot be handled so simply. I cannot predict whether it will be completed by tomorrow (the 2nd). The key point in forming the cabinet, as I see it, lies with the Minister of Finance. As for relations with political parties, I intend to resolve all conflicts of power within the country, with the so-called spirit of national unity, abandoning notions of party members and bureaucrats, and gathering talented people to dedicate themselves to the progress of the nation. Whether this can be done, I do not know, but I am determined to make my best effort. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] Konoe answered questions from reporters at the cabinet formation headquarters at 11:00 PM as follows:

Question: Are there any requests regarding the retention of the Minister of War?

Answer: There are no requests, but he presented his views in extremely abstract terms.

Question: What are these so-called views?

Answer: Emphasizing national defense, especially focusing on aviation. He wrote down four or five conditions regarding this matter.

Question: Will members of political parties be appointed to the cabinet?

Answer: In the end, yes, but the number of people is still under consideration.

Question: Does this mean adopting representatives of political parties?

Answer: It does not mean representatives.

Question: Is leaving the party a condition?

Answer: That kind of formality is quite meaningless.

Question: When adopting from political parties, will you express your intentions to their presidents?

Answer: It would be better to adopt individuals.

Question: Will the cabinet formation be completed by tomorrow?

Answer: Currently, I am only in contact with the Army and Navy. There is no other preparation. It will probably be difficult to complete it by tomorrow.

Question: Are there any cabinet members from the Hayashi cabinet who will remain, other than those from the military?

Answer: Perhaps, it is unknown.

Question: What about the Minister of Finance?

Answer: I am currently seriously considering this issue. It is unknown whether he will remain.

Question: Will Home Minister Kawarada remain?

Answer: Mr. Kawarada is only assisting me and will not enter the cabinet. It is also not yet known whether he will be appointed as Chief Cabinet Secretary.

Question: Will the Chief Cabinet Secretary be decided soon?

Answer: I have no particularly close acquaintances, and there is no particular need to decide early.

Question: Is the Osaka Prefectural Governor Yasui's visit to the capital related to the cabinet formation?

Answer: It is somewhat related.

Question: Are all the cabinet positions assigned?

Answer: It is planned to assign them all.

Question: Will you announce the platform and policies immediately?

Answer: We will announce them immediately after they are finalized. It will probably be difficult to do so tomorrow. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

### Goto Announces Cabinet Formation Policy

Adopting a Principle of Concentrated Talent

[Tokyo] Konoe's cabinet formation headquarters is located at the official residence of the Speaker of the House of Peers in Nichigaya. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] Goto, a member of the cabinet formation headquarters, made the following remarks at 9:00 PM:

Konoe has returned from the Imperial Palace and has generally discussed the cabinet formation policy. He intends to adopt talented people from both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, as well as other fields, as the cabinet formation policy. He has already asked the Army and Navy to recommend successor ministers. Konoe returned to his residence at 10:00 PM and will come here again with us tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. He does not intend to invite anyone to talk tonight. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] Former Home Minister Kawarada, a cabinet formation advisor, said at the cabinet formation headquarters at 8:30 PM: This morning, I visited the Minister of War because Konoe wanted to know the situation regarding the Army. Discussions are currently underway regarding cabinet formation. I will be able to talk about the substantive facts later. I have a close relationship with Konoe, so I came to the cabinet formation headquarters. I bear the heavy responsibility of Home Minister, so I cannot act on his behalf, nor can I be called an advisor. Whether I will remain in the cabinet is also difficult to say at this time. The Chief Cabinet Secretary has not yet been decided. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

### Political Party Attitudes

Seiyukai and Minseito Hold Executive Meetings and Decide to Cooperate in Supporting the New Cabinet

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai held an emergency executive meeting this afternoon to discuss the party's countermeasures for the current important situation. In view of the previous joint statement between the two parties, it was decided to strengthen the friendly relationship between the two parties and jointly overcome the difficulties. However, if the new cabinet is indeed advancing towards opening up the situation in accordance with constitutionalism, then cooperation should not be spared. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] The Minseito held a temporary executive board meeting on the morning of the 1st to discuss the political situation of the Hayashi cabinet's general resignation. The result was decided as follows: The Hayashi cabinet ultimately decided to resign en masse. From now on, in view of the situation, a cabinet of national unity should be realized to overcome the difficulties. Our party should cooperate with comrades across the country to help the new cabinet in accordance with the joint statement with the Seiyukai. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

### Financial World Welcomes and Hopes for Ketsuki's Retention

[Tokyo] The entire financial world has expressed its welcome to Konoe's being ordered to form a cabinet, as the establishment of a cabinet of national unity will give the political and economic world a sense of stability, so they are strongly hoping for its appearance. The financial world believes that Konoe is a very suitable person who can smoothly deal with both the military and political parties, and can form a powerful cabinet to live up to expectations. They are particularly concerned about the selection of the Minister of Finance. In short, Konoe's appearance can avoid friction in all aspects, and there will be no drastic changes. They are even more looking forward to the implementation of a new policy in all administrations. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] The financial world viewed the Hayashi cabinet's general resignation as a matter of time. Yesterday, Prime Minister Hayashi suddenly resigned, but they maintained a calm attitude. The Hayashi cabinet had long exposed its fragility, and its financial policies could not be changed immediately. Its policy of expanding productivity will still be implemented by the succeeding cabinet. Therefore, the Hayashi cabinet's general resignation has no major impact on the financial world. According to the opinion of the financial world, many hope that Finance Minister Ketsuki will remain in the new cabinet. In any case, whoever takes office as the new Minister of Finance, they strongly oppose adopting an artificial low-interest rate policy regardless of the current situation of rising interest rates. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

### Military Supports

Hopes for Political Parties' Awareness

[Tokyo] Minister of War Sugiyama summoned Vice Minister Umezu, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Kogu, Military Affairs Section Chief Tanaka, Commander of the Military Police Nakajima, and other important figures on the afternoon of the 31st to discuss the Army's policy towards the political situation with a cautious attitude. Regarding the new cabinet, the Army authorities hope to realize a reform policy through a strong cabinet jointly formed by the military, political officials, civilians, and various circles. If political parties recognize the situation and cooperate in implementing the reform policy, the Army may not attack them. In short, the Army hopes that a powerful cabinet will appear that will implement the Army's advocated policies of enriching military preparations, expanding productivity, equalizing the national burden, and other important policies. According to its specific opinions, it welcomes Konoe Fumimaro to organize a cabinet of national unity. As for the new cabinet's Minister of War, the theory that Sugiyama will remain in office is strong. (1st Day, Domei News Agency)

### The Future of Japanese Politics

Harmonizing Political Struggles is the Urgent Task; The Nature of the New Cabinet Will Not Differ Greatly from the Previous One

[Tokyo] According to the consistent observation of various parties here this morning, no matter who the future new cabinet is, the new cabinet must be a strong cabinet of national unity, melting representatives of political parties, military cliques, bureaucrats, and financial cliques into one. Otherwise, it will not only be unable to continue to implement the policies that Hayashi Senjuro was actively pursuing, but it will also be difficult to enjoy a longer lifespan. The situation when the Hayashi cabinet was formed was mainly dominated by personnel issues. The current situation is mainly to consider how to harmonize and realize the requirements of a high degree of national defense, and the contradictions between the various camps within the ruling class. The struggles within the ruling class have been exacerbated by Hayashi Senjuro, who lacks political experience. If the two parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, obtain one or two cabinet seats, they will unconditionally agree to the military's program. This is generally considered to be undoubtedly true. The Ministry of the Army held a meeting of key leaders yesterday, and it is said that it was decided that the future new cabinet should be a continuation of the Hayashi cabinet in terms of policy and perspective, and does not oppose the participation of political party representatives. This can reduce the resistance encountered in the Diet by various planned mobilization bills. The main members of the financial community unanimously hope that the new cabinet's financial policy will be the same as Ketsuki's and will not be changed. Therefore, except that representatives of political parties may reappear in the cabinet and their influence will temporarily harmonize the sharp opposition within the ruling class, the nature of the new cabinet will not be greatly different from that of the Hayashi cabinet. It is generally expected that Sugiyama Gen and Ketsuki Toyotaro will remain as cabinet members. However, Foreign Minister Sato, because he has fulfilled his responsibilities, is planning to improve the poor international atmosphere caused by the anti-Comintern pact between Japan and Germany, so his successor must be a more useful person to the military. Regarding this, this morning's newspaper reported that the former Sato, in view of the military's blaming him for being too weak in breaking the Japanese diplomatic stalemate, especially towards China, had intended to submit his resignation to Hayashi Senjuro. Since the candidates for the new Prime Minister are still a problem, it is too early to predict what kind of real policy the future new Foreign Minister will adopt towards China. However, no matter how different the attitude expressed by the new Foreign Minister in the future, it can be carefully observed that he will follow the diplomatic route adopted by Sato. This opinion is especially confirmed by the fact that military and economic mobilization plans have encountered great difficulties and require a certain amount of time and extraordinary political efforts to overcome. (1st Day, Central News Agency)

### Konoe's Brief History

[Nanjing] The brief history of Konoe Fumimaro, Speaker of the House of Peers, is as follows: Konoe Fumimaro was born in the 24th year of Meiji in Tokyo. He is a descendant of Fujiwara no Tadahira, and was originally called Fujiwara. Starting with Motozane, the eldest son of Fujiwara no Tadamichi, the name was changed to Konoe. He is currently 47 years old. At the age of 14, he inherited the title of Duke from his father. At the age of 26, he was appointed as a member of the House of Peers. At the age of 27, he graduated from the Department of Politics at Kyoto Imperial University. The following year (i.e., Taisho 7), he was appointed as a member of the Ministry of Home Affairs and dispatched to Europe and America for observation. In February of Taisho 8, he was appointed as an attendant to the plenipotentiary commissioner of the European Peace Conference, accompanying Kinmochi Saionji to attend the conference.

He is particularly dedicated to the cultural enterprise plan for China. He has been trusted by Saionji due to his generational achievements, and has extraordinary insights into politics. At the same time, he also has considerable friendship with military and political circles. His wide range of contacts and the well-informed public opinion can be said to be unique in today's Japan. After the February 26th Incident, upon Saionji's recommendation, the Emperor ordered him to form a cabinet. All members of society supported the proposal. However, he declined on the grounds of physical weakness and immediately resigned on the same day. As a result, Saionji recommended Hirota Koki to form a cabinet. He is the president of the Kayokai (organized by members of the House of Peers with the title of Marquis and Duke) in the House of Peers, and has always been ambitious to reform the House of Peers. He enjoys reading books and playing golf, and has written books such as "The Upper House and Politics" and "Records of Observations in Europe and America". (1st Day, Central News Agency)

### Spain's Coastal Surveillance; Britain and France Decide to Continue as Usual

Germany and Italy Absent from the Non-Intervention Committee; Britain Works with Various Countries to Clarify the Situation

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden declared in the House of Commons today that although Germany and Italy have stated that they will withdraw from the Spanish coastal surveillance plan and the Non-Intervention Committee, other international plans are still valid for the two countries. He also said that he was very disappointed with the decisions of Germany and Italy, but would continue to work hard to prevent the situation from deteriorating. The British government is in contact with other governments to discuss what steps to take to restore normalcy. What to do with the Spanish coastal surveillance tasks previously undertaken by Germany and Italy is also a question. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 1st Day)

[London] According to sources here in Binton, the British government advised countries to adopt a moderate attitude in today's diplomatic talks. It is said that the goal of the talks is to determine an effective plan to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents to the Deutschland incident, and to clarify the situation after Germany and Italy temporarily withdraw from the surveillance plan. (1st Day, Guomin Hai Tong)

[Paris] Political figures here are very optimistic that the situation in Spain has eased. The statement made by Germany regarding the bombing of the Port of Almeria is considered here to be an indication that Germany will not take other actions. At the same time, Germany's withdrawal from the Non-Intervention Committee may not be permanent. In other words, the German government is willing to continue to cooperate with the committee after implementing retaliatory measures. On the other hand, the fact that the Spanish government did not submit the matter to the League of Nations is also considered an optimistic point here. (1st Day, Guomin Hai Tong)

[London] The withdrawal of Italy and Germany from the Non-Intervention Committee's surveillance plan has created a major crisis in Europe. The Non-Intervention Committee convened a subcommittee meeting at 4:00 PM today. Representatives from Germany and Italy were not present, so the plenary meeting originally scheduled for 4:30 was also temporarily canceled. British Foreign Secretary Eden stated to the House of Commons that he had met with the German Chargé d'Affaires and requested that Germany not make the current serious situation worse. German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop wrote to the Non-Intervention Committee stating that the German government would stop participating in the committee's surveillance plan and all other discussions unless it received sufficient guarantees that such incidents would not happen again. (31st Day, Guomin Dian)

[London] The subcommittee of the Coordination Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War concluded its meeting at 7:00 PM after meeting this afternoon. According to those in charge, the subcommittee decided on the following measures: ㊀ Notify the governments of the countries in the Coordination Committee of the positions of Italy and Germany on the current situation; ㊁ British and French warships will continue to conduct surveillance in the coastal area of the Spanish National Army. After the subcommittee meeting today, the temporary chairman, the Under-Secretary of State for Overseas Trade of the United Kingdom, Wallace, announced that Germany and Italy would temporarily not participate in the surveillance work and would not attend the Coordination Committee. French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Corbin spoke, expressing regret for the actions of Germany and Italy, and said that French commercial aircraft had been attacked by National Army aircraft near the Port of Bilbao, and the city of Hanergue in French territory had also been bombed by National Army aircraft. However, France has always taken legal measures to deal with it. (Central News Agency, Havas, 31st Day)

[London] Committee Chairman Wallace submitted a letter from the German representative to the subcommittee. The letter stated that he was instructed by the government that Germany could not participate in the surveillance plan or join the meetings of the international committee until the German ships performing surveillance duties were fully guaranteed. Wallace also said that when the subcommittee was about to meet, the Italian representative also stated that he could not attend for the same reason. Representatives from Britain, Belgium, France, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, Sweden, and the Soviet Union attended the meeting on the same day. The representatives asked the chairman to convene the meeting again at an appropriate time. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 31st Day)

### Spain's Note to the League of Nations

Only Explains the Process; Does Not Request a Meeting

[Geneva] Valdes, the Spanish representative to the League of Nations, has reported the details of the German warship's bombardment of the Port of Almeria to the League of Nations and requested that it be distributed to all member states. However, the issue of convening a special meeting of the League of Nations will be decided after the Non-Intervention Committee discusses it. The Spanish note stated that on May 29, Rear Admiral Sesskir, commander of the German fleet in the Mediterranean, notified the Spanish government that if Spanish government aircraft flew over German warships exercising their duties within the surveillance area, he would order the warships to take appropriate measures to deal with it. The Spanish Minister of Defense replied that if surveillance was carried out in compliance with the regulations of the Non-Intervention Committee, the warships of the countries concerned would not be bombed by government aircraft. However, if these warships entered the center of rebel activity, harbors, and ports without reason, the Spanish government could not guarantee this. The Spanish government could not stand by and watch this type of case. The note also stated that the German cruiser Deutschland bombarded a Spanish government reconnaissance plane outside the Port of Ibiza, and the planes retaliated with bombs. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 31st Day)

### Germany and Italy's Relationship with the Non-Intervention Committee is Ambiguous

If There Are Guarantees, They Can Still Participate; Both Countries Prepare to Send More Warships

[Berlin] Political circles here stated that the withdrawal of the German representative from the Non-Intervention Committee does not mean that the German government rejects the international surveillance system or the Non-Intervention Committee. (1st Day, Guomin Hai Tong)

[London] German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop recently submitted an official note from the German government to Wallace, the temporary chairman of the Coordination Committee for Non-Intervention Measures. The note first described the bombing of the German cruiser Deutschland by Spanish government aircraft. The wording was largely the same as the communiqué issued by the German government last night. Then, it stated the position taken by Germany, which is divided into three points as follows: ㊀ If Germany cannot obtain guarantees to prevent such incidents from happening again, the German government will not be able to participate in the surveillance plan or the various discussions of the Coordination Committee; ㊁ What steps should be taken to respond to this incredible and heinous attack will naturally be decided by the German government itself. The German government has now issued orders to its warships. Under such circumstances, if Spanish aircraft or warships approach German warships, they should be driven away by firing cannons; ㊂ As a retaliatory measure for the vicious attack by aircraft from the Valencia authorities on the German cruiser "Deutschland" anchored in the Bay of Ibiza, Germany specifically ordered several German warships to bombard the port of Almeria, where there are fortresses, this morning. After destroying the fortress and related port engineering, the other side stopped firing back, and this retaliatory action was concluded. (Central News Agency, Havas, 31st Day)

[Berlin] Political circles here recently criticized the statement made by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons this afternoon, earnestly stating that Germany's retaliatory actions against the Spanish government had ended with the bombing of the Port of Almeria. Berlin political circles believe that the Spanish situation is serious, but do not admit that it can cause international disputes. German leader Hitler is still continuing discussions with Minister of National Defense Blomberg, Minister of Aviation Goering, and Minister of the Navy Raeder. German ports are currently very active, as German warships anchored in various ports have been ordered to immediately depart for the Spanish sea. According to reliable sources, three or four German warships will be ordered to depart to replace the warships returning to their home countries. However, it is not yet known how many ships will depart and what kind of ships they are. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 31st Day)

[London] It is heard here that responsible officials on the German side announced that Germany's current position on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is divided into two points as follows: ㊀ If no new incidents occur, Germany's retaliatory action will end with the bombing of the Port of Almeria; ㊁ If a safe area is designated in the Spanish sea as a berthing area for the warships of the surveillance countries, this method is not yet sufficient, but if the countries participating in the surveillance plan can reach an agreement to form a relationship of solidarity between the fleet from each participating country, and if the fleet of one country is attacked by either side of the Spanish civil war, the fleets of all other countries will provide assistance, then Germany can still participate in the surveillance work and rejoin the various meetings of the Coordination Committee; ㊂ Germany does not intend to withdraw from the constraints of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Therefore, German merchant ships sailing near the Spanish sea will still anchor in the designated ports in accordance with the original method of the surveillance plan for inspectors to board the ship and inspect it. Finally, the responsible official also learned that the government has now taken the same attitude as Germany. Although Italy is not participating in the surveillance work, its ships should still anchor in the designated ports in accordance with the provisions of the surveillance plan for inspectors to board the ship and inspect the intercepted goods. (Central News Agency, Havas, 31st Day)

[Rome] Responsible parties stated tonight that Italy and Germany are absolutely united in their position on the Spanish situation. The Italian representative to the Non-Intervention Committee will follow in Germany's footsteps and will not attend the conference. The reason is the same as Germany's, that is, to obtain a guarantee that there will be no more bombings in the future. Italy also does not want to withdraw its warships patrolling the Spanish sea because it is not participating in surveillance measures, and intends to send more warships to the area when necessary. However, German and Italian warships will continue surveillance operations to prevent military supplies from being transported to ports controlled by the Spanish government, and can freely silence any aircraft that they deem threatening. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to return to Rome tomorrow to personally preside over foreign policy. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 31st Day)

[Paris] According to responsible sources, regarding the demands made by Italy and Germany that the warships of each country receive security guarantees, the British and French governments studied today what kind of guarantees should be given to allow the United States and Germany to return to the Non-Intervention Committee. It was considered to establish a safe zone in the Spanish sea or designate a location on the Spanish coast as a safe area. Regarding this matter, Britain, France, Italy, and the United States will negotiate with both sides of the Spanish Civil War. However, even if the above plan is realized, it must be observed by the warships of various countries to take effect. As for when the German cruiser Deutschland was bombed, it was indeed within Spanish territorial waters. Its anchoring in the Bay of Ibiza was neither to carry out the surveillance plan nor was it necessary to add fuel. However, the Spanish government's claim that the Deutschland fired first has not been confirmed. (Central News Agency, Havas, 31st Day)

### Eden Warns Germany Not to Aggravate Situation

British House of Commons to Discuss, French Foreign Minister Meets with Envoys

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today, in response to questions from members of Parliament regarding the international situation arising from the Spanish government aircraft bombing of a German warship and the warship’s retaliatory shelling of Almería, that Britain has advised Germany not to take any action that would escalate the current serious situation. The atmosphere was quite tense during the House of Commons session. The Leader of the Opposition, Attlee, asked the Foreign Secretary if he had any statement to make regarding the above incidents. Eden replied that he had heard that the German cruiser "Deutschland" was bombed by aircraft on Saturday while docked in the Bay of Ibiza, and unfortunately, a bomb exploded on the deck of the mess hall, causing many deaths and injuries. As detailed information has not yet been received, he did not wish to say much at this time. He also received a report from the British warship, learning that the German warship "Admiral Hipper" had fired on Almería from 6:30 to 7:00 this morning. When he met with the German Chargé d'Affaires in London this morning, he asked him to convey to the German government the British government's urgent hope that it would not take any actions that would further aggravate the current serious situation. Attlee further asked if the British government would propose an investigation by the League of Nations. Eden replied, "Members should know that I have not had enough time to consider this situation, and I do not wish to say more." The Communist Garro asked the Foreign Secretary to release information about the shelling of Spanish aircraft by the German warship. Speaker FitzRoy intervened, saying that the Foreign Secretary had already stated that he had no statement to make. Garro persisted in his request, but Eden did not respond. (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters)

[Paris] It was learned today from a reliable source that the British and French foreign ministries, after consulting with each other in London and Paris throughout the day, have warned German leader Hitler that if Germany does not abandon retaliation against the Spanish government forces, it may provoke a European war. Britain and France also suggested organizing a neutral commission of inquiry to investigate the responsibility for the bombing of the cruiser "Deutschland," hoping to reduce the repercussions of the incident through a policy of delay. France seems to believe that the bombing of the cruiser "Deutschland" by Spanish government aircraft and the shelling of Almería by German warships were both acts of war. Britain, however, believes that the German warship’s docking at Ibiza was its own fault. At the same time, British and French diplomatic circles are very dissatisfied with Germany’s unilateral retaliatory measures. (31st, National Telegram)

[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos met separately this afternoon with German Ambassador Welczeck, Polish Ambassador Łukaszewicz, Spanish Ambassador Van Wyhe, Belgian Ambassador Gillieaert, and Chairman of the French Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee, Scapini, to discuss the situation arising from the bombing of the German cruiser "Deutschland" and the shelling of the port of Almería by German warships.

[Paris] The Naval Ministry recently issued a statement saying that the French merchant ship "Cap Corse" was sailing ten miles off the coast of Mallorca in the Mediterranean Sea yesterday morning when a Spanish Nationalist armed fishing boat suddenly approached and attempted to interrogate it. The French torpedo boat "Sirocco" arrived to provide protection, and the "Cap Corse" was able to continue its voyage safely. The statement also said that the French Atlantic Fleet will sail to the ocean for exercises tomorrow, and the Mediterranean Fleet will continue to exercise and will stop along the coast of Africa.

The British Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Le Rougetel, wrote to the Minister of Defense, Prieto, to express his gratitude, saying that the Spanish government's measure was courteous and that the senior commander of the British fleet in Spanish waters was deeply impressed by it.

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Will Not Harm Chinese Interests

British Foreign Secretary Reiterates in the House of Commons, Yoshida Expresses Willingness to Befriend China

[London] The British House of Commons today discussed issues such as Chinese copyright law, Anglo-Japanese talks, the status of British property owners in Shanghai, and the handling of the British Boxer Indemnity. Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Conservative MP Wardlaw-Milne, saying that he knew that the Chinese government was currently unwilling to amend the copyright law. He had advised British publishers in China to take advantage of the limited protection that the current copyright law could provide. If the questioner could inform him of any specific cases he knew of, he would consider them. Wardlaw-Milne said that British merchants were suffering great losses due to the current situation. Eden replied that he knew that British merchants had long had complaints and that he would investigate them. Conservative MP Moreing said that a well-known British publishing company had lost thousands of pounds in the past few years. Eden did not respond to this. He then replied to Wardlaw-Milne’s other questions, saying that the situation regarding the talks between the British and Japanese governments was still the same as he had announced in the House of Commons on May 6 (note: the Foreign Secretary stated on that day that Britain did not want to restore spheres of influence in China). He would carefully remember the need to fully protect Chinese interests. Eden later replied to another question from Wardlaw-Milne, concerning the investigation of a case in which a British person was detained in the Shanghai International Settlement for 400,000 yuan worth of property, and three cases filed by British property owners in Shanghai, and said that he could investigate the assertion by Shanghai British property owners that the Chinese law allowing creditors to proceed with the sale of property without a judgment had not been implemented, and hoped that the member would provide details of each case. Eden finally replied to a question from Conservative MP Davison regarding the British Boxer Indemnity, saying that the fund was still being handled in accordance with the 1920 exchange of notes, and the results were very satisfactory.

[London] Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Yoshida, said today when meeting with a Reuters reporter that Japan was willing to be friendly with China. Regarding the East Hebei issue, Yoshida said that it could be resolved at the same time as the North China issue and that there were no difficulties. Yoshida said that the Japanese people understood the importance of a strong China to them. When asked if Japan would participate in the loans provided by Britain to China, Yoshida said that Japan was eager to help China in various ways, or that Britain could provide financial assistance to China, and Japan would provide assistance in other areas. Yoshida continued, saying that when he was Vice Minister ten years ago, he was committed to restoring Anglo-Japanese friendship, and Uchida's visit to Britain in 1928 was unfortunate because the timing was not good, but now there had been great improvements, and those in power in Japan knew that establishing an understanding with Britain was an important part of Japanese foreign policy, and the government could change, but this goal would remain unchanged. Yoshida also said that formal negotiations had not yet begun, although he had been engaged in informal inquiries and contacts to prepare for future negotiations, but to say that they could begin after the end of the Imperial Diet was without basis. Yoshida concluded by saying that he was optimistic about the relations between Britain and Japan and between China and Japan, and that he firmly believed that there was a great opportunity to guarantee peace in the entire Far East, which would greatly benefit world peace.

⊙ Gibraltar: The cruiser "Deutschland" unloaded twenty-four bodies here today and buried them in the local cemetery. Among the remaining sixty-two injured, four also have no hope of survival. The warship immediately sailed back to Germany for repairs. (31st, National Telegram)

Gibraltar: After the German cruiser "Deutschland" was bombed by Spanish government aircraft, resulting in many deaths and injuries, another person has died from severe injuries, bringing the death toll to twenty-four.

### More Clashes Between Muslims and Hindus in India

Three Dead, Over a Hundred Injured

⊙ Bombay: Clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims early this morning, resulting in three deaths and over a hundred injuries. The situation is gradually worsening, and the authorities are continuing to increase security forces to prevent the recurrence of incidents. The conflict initially occurred in the Kamathipura district in the city, the epicenter of the riots last October, and quickly spread to other areas. Police were forced to open fire on the mobs. Although the police were reinforced, they still had difficulty coping. The clashes started when a Hindu wedding procession passed by a mosque. A young Muslim man demanded that the procession stop playing music, and the Hindus complied. Unexpectedly, the young man had an argument with bystanders, resulting in injuries to three people. Police arrived and dispersed the mobs, but soon there were many cases of people attacking each other with knives and throwing stones. (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters)

### Outrageous Claims by Japanese Residents in Shantou

Made at Meeting on Japanese Warship, Investigation into Aoyama Assault Underway, Japanese Side Will Seek Other Pretexts to Create Incidents

Shantou Correspondence: Regarding the case of the Japanese national Aoyama Kiyoshi assaulting a police officer in Shantou, the Japanese side has exaggerated the matter, lodging protests with both Nanjing and Guangzhou. They have also dispatched four warships – "Yūbari," "Fuyō," "Asagao," and "Kuretake" – to Shantou to intimidate the local authorities. However, Aoyama Kiyoshi confessed directly to the police headquarters that he had been ordered by the Japanese consulate to reside in the city without reporting, and admitted that assaulting the police officer was wrong. Therefore, the Shantou municipal government also protested to the Japanese consulate, demanding that the assailant be punished, medical expenses be compensated, and a guarantee be given that such incidents would not occur in the future. Until the 26th, the Japanese Consul Yamazaki Seiichi personally went to the municipal government to lodge a counter-protest, stating that when Aoyama was detained on that day, he was bound and escorted by a large number of police officers, as if dealing with prisoners of war and offenders caught in the act, insulting subjects of the Empire. The municipal government, based on a one-sided report from the police, made a protest and demand to the Japanese side without considering investigating clearly, which was difficult to accept. He further stated that Aoyama was also injured by the police officers at the time, demanding that our side punish the culprits, compensate the bereaved, and provide guarantees, while rejecting the protest lodged by the municipal government on the 23rd and reserving the right to continue to demand. Such counter-protests are extremely unreasonable. Commander of the 5th Fleet of the Taiwan Defense Force, Ōkuma Masayoshi, arrived in Shantou on the 26th, and that evening convened the captains of the "Fuyō," "Asagao," "Kuretake," and other ships for a meeting on board the ship. Leaders of the Japanese residents in Shantou were also invited to attend the meeting. At the meeting, the chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association provided Ōkuma and others with the resolutions of the meeting: ① Based on the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, Japanese people have the freedom to reside, trade, and operate businesses in treaty ports and should not be bound by any local regulations or unilateral tax systems, infringing on the vested special rights under the treaty; ② After Japanese merchants' goods are declared for import at customs, their sales are hindered by local taxes, and they are often detained by anti-smuggling officers; ③ Japanese people renting houses and residing often face obstruction and eviction; ④ They will not comply with household registration and move-in and move-out certificates, and must maintain the special status of the past; ⑤ Regarding the incidents of assault cases, rust bombs, and the Aoyama case that have occurred in the past, they are considered malicious anti-Japanese actions, demanding punishment, compensation, guarantees, and thorough implementation of the special status of the commercial treaty. It is said that the result of the meeting that evening was to lodge protests with the Shantou municipal government based on the resolutions of the Residents' Association. However, Zhang Yuannan and Wu Wenxian, who were dispatched by the provincial authorities to Shantou to investigate the truth of the incident, arrived in Shantou on the 28th and immediately began their investigation to seek a solution. The municipal government has also reported the details of the incident to the provincial government and denied that Aoyama was bound, shackled, or beaten. Aoyama himself admitted to assaulting the police officer, and the injured party is currently being treated by Dr. Li Xixiang. Aoyama himself was not injured. At present, the case has begun to be negotiated in Shantou, but what the Japanese side has proposed is completely beyond the scope of this case, so it has been sternly rejected by our side. The Japanese side is afraid that they will not be able to fully exert their schemes, or will seek other pretexts to create other incidents. Therefore, they have secretly dispatched a large number of Japanese nationals to sneak into the Chaoshan-Meizhou inland areas, which seems to have a deep meaning.

### Major Fraud Case Involving Illegal Fundraising Occurs in Capital

Total Reaches Over 100,000 Yuan, Ring Leader Mrs. Xu Has Fled

Nanjing Correspondence: A major fraud case involving illegal fundraising has recently occurred in the capital, with a total amount of about 100,000 yuan, which is unprecedented in the capital. About 200 people have been defrauded, mostly teachers, staff, and family members of missionary schools and businesses in the Beidouqiao area. The main perpetrator of the fraud, Mrs. Xu, is on the run, and her son, Shaozhou, was detained by the court on the 27th. The victims are jointly pursuing legal action. According to Sun Hebin of Zhongshan Photo Studio, who was defrauded of more than 7,000 yuan, the ring leader was Mrs. Xu from Anhui, but her son, Xu Shaozhou, was the front man. Shaozhou is a doctor and lives at No. 31 Guanjia Lane, Zhongshan Road (self-owned). His medical practice is not very prosperous on weekdays, but he built a city house behind his residence a few years ago, but it was mortgaged out a few months ago. Judging by his intentions, he may have had a pre-planned intention to defraud. Most of those who were defrauded are family members of professors and staff of missionary schools, such as Huaiwen Girls' High School, Ginling College, and Ginling High School, as well as merchants in the North Gate Bridge area. There are also many rickshaw drivers and servants who have saved up their hard-earned money and joined his club. Mrs. Xu often used her eloquent tongue to repeatedly ask for help, and those who were repeatedly asked for help repeatedly introduced others, so the number of victims reached nearly 300. Some people even joined Mrs. Xu's club without knowing what kind of person Mrs. Xu was. Sun Hebin also said that there were about six people with fixed payments of 2,000 or 3,000 yuan, and 15 bidding clubs. The bidding clubs were divided into two types, six yuan and ten yuan, with the number of people ranging from more than 50 to more than 120. The club period was once every half month and once every 20 days (fixed payments were outside). Very few people had joined the previous club. I (Sun referred to himself) had a total of more than 18 clubs, amounting to more than 7,000 yuan. Xu not only served as the ring leader herself, but also often used multiple pseudonyms. In fact, Xu was in each club more than three or four times. Therefore, someone often bid 3.2 yuan (ten yuan club example) in this club to get the club, but Xu would say that so-and-so (actually her own pseudonym) bid 3.21 yuan. Because the large number of people did not attend the meeting when it was held, they only sent the club money and bids. Therefore, Xu took advantage of this opportunity to defraud. A group of people had never known her inside story. May 15, 17, 18, and 3 were club dates. Those who won the bid went to collect the club money. Xu always made excuses that the club money had not been received temporarily, and asked them to wait a few days and she would send it to their residence after collecting it. Until the 20th, this Mrs. Xu and Chen the dwarf, who managed the club accounts and club books, disappeared. The club dates of the 21st and 24th, which followed one after another, had already arrived, and there were even more people asking for the club money. They gathered at Xu's residence every day, but her son, Xu Shaozhou, claimed that he did not know where his mother had gone. The crowd was in an uproar, so they twisted Xu Shaozhou into the police station in that section, and he has now been sent to the court. The victims jointly elected Yu (Sun refers to himself), Sun Yuhong, the Director of Dining Affairs of Huaiwen Girls' High School, Zhang Decai of Fuxing Milk Shop, and Jiang Lanfang as representatives, and have hired Lawyer Zhang Yuangu to file a lawsuit.

### Lvxin Cigarette Factory Reports British American Tobacco Company for Evading Cigarette Tax

Totaling 129 Large and Small Boxes, Songjiang District Procuratorate Begins Investigation

Songjiang Correspondence: The Lvxin Cigarette Factory, opened by Shandong native Yu Lvxin at No. 665 Belle Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has recently received a tip-off that the British American Tobacco Company in Shanghai often secretly transports tax-evading cigarettes to the interior. Multiple cases have been successively seized in Pinghu, Zhejiang, and other places. Recently, a large batch of Old Knife brand and Fairy brand cigarettes from the British American Tobacco Company were transported to the Fuxiji store on Xikuo Street in Songxi for sale. The factory owner Yu Lvxin found out about this and rushed to Song on May 27 to report to the county police station and request that officials be dispatched to thoroughly investigate. The county police station immediately dispatched Inspector Chief Wang Kaichen, along with inspectors Yang Jingjiang and several police officers, to inspect the Fuxiji store. As the owner of the store was out, they supervised the clerk Mai Diankui and the boat owner Sun Rongsheng to count the number of cigarette boxes transported to Song, totaling 129 large and small boxes, and 296 large boxes. Upon checking, only waybills Nos. 137638 and 137536 stated 71 boxes, which did not match the inventory. Moreover, the box surface stamp numbers were not filled in on both waybills, and the deadline for transportation was not specified. Furthermore, there was no inspection stamp of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau on the back of waybill No. 137536. The wooden box stamps were all blurred, and the paint was smeared, making it impossible to prove the date of production. There were many discrepancies, clearly indicating tax evasion. The informant Yu Lvxin took photos and requested that the transportation permit and the stored cigarettes be detained for record. The police station, considering that the case involved smuggling and evading national taxes, immediately had the defendants Mai Diankui and Sun Rongsheng sign guarantees for both their residences, and the cigarettes were sealed by the bureau for Mai Diankui to keep in custody. On the 29th, the police station transferred the case and documents to the county procuratorate for investigation. It is heard that the district procuratorate will summon the owner of the Fuxiji store and other relevant persons to begin the investigation in the near future.

### Beginning an Investigation into Omissions from the Yunnan-Sichuan Collection (20)

— By Bei Juan

The 43rd day (May 17th): We departed from Bangjiang. Yang Junchang led the vanguard, and Principal Feng Huang saw us off to the Sanmenjiang Ferry. President Wei Yongcheng accompanied the team. The first ferry across Sanmenjiang, and the first ferry in Rong County, both used small tugboats to carry us. The third ferry was narrower, and wooden boats were used. After crossing these three ferries, we arrived at Luzhai Town, where there was a large, fort-like building, about five stories high. When asked, we were told it was a "pawnshop," with the words "Xiang Ya" (Military Pawn) written on it. It was equipped with battlements, a permanent fortification to prevent bandits. Another 40 kilometers brought us to Liujiang County, where we ate at a primary school. Liujiang produces fragrant mushrooms. Wang Zhenxiong Qun, the commander of the team stationed in Liujiang, had been a chess friend for five years, and we hadn't seen each other. Our joy at meeting again can be imagined. Another 80 kilometers led to Lipu County. The county magistrate, Zhang Qun, who studied in Russia, shared the hardships of the people and was praised by the county residents. Li Bai and Huang San praised his ability and rewarded him with a major merit. Xu Hao, Shen Yuanming, and He Hanwen, three members of our group, were classmates of Zhang's. We stayed in Lipu for three hours, pouring out our accumulated feelings. The first ferry crossing Lipu was the Maling Ferry. The boatmen, about fifty people, were former subordinates of Deputy Commander Bai Jiansheng who had contributed during the suppression of the Erke bandits years ago. Bai had promoted this ferry crossing to provide a livelihood for the old couple. Last month, Bai passed through here and only saw the old boatman, not his wife. When asked, he said that half a month earlier, she had been murdered for her money. Bai asked why he hadn't reported it. The boatman replied that he had no money. Bai immediately gave him thirty yuan to report the crime and telegraphed Yanghu County to solve the case within a month. As a result, the murderers were apprehended within the deadline. Today, the old boatman happily told people that his revenge had been taken and he could now serve at the ferry in peace. North of this ferry, the scenery gradually became more picturesque. Every house was neat and tidy. At the first ferry, named Qing'e Ferry, the water was as clear as a mirror. The mountains surrounding this flat, green field were all strangely shaped. Li Jishen had bought land here, built a small house, and planted a thousand persimmon trees. Pan Yizhi Qun had also built a small house by the stream as a place to rest. (The land price was only twenty Guizhou dollars per acre, equivalent to eight or nine French francs. There was plenty of land, and Xu Beihong Qun also planned to settle here.) The area resembled a natural park. In front was the "Piercing Mountain" cave, with people living inside. To the right was the "Moon Mountain," a cave shaped like a full moon. To the left was "Goat Horn Peak," with two peaks leaning against the roadside. Dozens of other peaks rose abruptly from the ground. "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world, and Yangshuo's scenery surpasses Guilin." This was indeed no exaggeration. There were originally seven ferries from Liuzhou to Guilin, but because two ferries had already built bridges, there were only five ferry crossings left. When we crossed the first ferry at Sanmenjiang, we immediately noticed that there was a lot of wasteland along the way. Only one-third of it was cultivated. This was the case all along the way. Five years ago, the provincial authorities invested only 20,000 yuan in planting tung trees. Last year, the fifth year, the tung oil produced was valued at 100,000 yuan, showing the profitability of productive construction. This year, the provincial government is using 600,000 yuan worth of tung seedlings to distribute and plant throughout the province, stipulating that each village must plant one catty of tung seeds. At two o'clock, we arrived at Yangshuo County Station. We climbed the mountain to admire the beauty of the Tan River. Fishing boats were moored on the streams. Corps Commander Chu's camera was busy. He couldn't bear to leave, taking an especially large number of photos. Another 60 kilometers brought us to Liangfeng Township. Liangfeng was originally Cen Xilin's villa, which Xilin gave to the local community. The local community turned it into a park, planting precious plants such as "red beans." In the park, we met Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Shiwang, who said that the vegetable oil vehicle would be repaired soon, and they would drive to Hunan together. Ten miles further on was General Bridge, which commemorates a Qing general named Sai who died here during the suppression of the Hong Yang Rebellion. "White Dragon Cave" is located beside this bridge. Five kilometers further, we arrived at Zhulin Nanguan. Li Delin, Bai Jiansheng, the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander, and Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu had already arrived here to greet us. We shook hands and entered the city in a line. Troops, teams, and students lined the road for three and a half miles, welcoming us into the city. We went to Huanhu Inn for a short rest. The inn was well-equipped, and the bathhouse was especially luxurious. Even the bathhouses in Jiangnan were rarely so clean. The reception we received in Guilin was completely different from that in Yishan and Liujiang. It seems that Li Bai and the other gentlemen felt that the reception methods in Liujiang were slightly naive, so they sincerely and naturally advised the staff. As a result, the mood between the guests and the hosts was much more cordial. Since entering Guilin, the local political situation we have seen can be determined that the work of promoting autonomy in various counties during the constitutional period can be said to have already had a considerable foundation in Guangxi. Corps Commander Chu also expressed that Guangxi's Three Self-Policies are indeed a good path in the advancement of the Three Principles of the People. Li Delin was as humble as before, with shining sleeves. Bai Jiansheng was fatter than when he was in Beiping. In recent years, he has served the local community, worrying too much, and the hair on his forehead has thinned. Huang Xuchu was smaller in stature but had a meticulous mind, not speaking empty words. These two always showed up together whenever there was a slightly important matter in the province, taking joint photos. The most common occasion for the three to participate together can also be said to be a "Trinity."

He Sui had served as the principal of the Guangxi Provincial Military Academy and had many generals as his students. He treated us to banquets and entertainment, working tirelessly from morning till night. He often took his friends on boats to Tan River, reciting poetry and painting in the middle of the river. There used to be many boat girls on Tan River, but recently they have been restrained. A "special district" has been designated outside the city in the southeast corner, allowing several clubs and singing girl flower boats to operate, supervised by a police sub-bureau, managed by the donation and licensing bureau, and separated from normal society. This is also a way to write prohibition in the levy, facilitating crackdowns.

The 44th day (May 18th): In the morning, a welcome meeting was held at the southern suburbs square. Up to 6,000 troops first held a military parade. Li Delin chaired the meeting, reporting on the meaning of the welcome. In the end, he said that he wished to mobilize the army and teams of Guangxi—1.3 million people—to dedicate to the central government for scorched earth resistance. Corps Commander Chu responded that since arriving in Guilin, he had seen all the construction and the enthusiasm of the people's patriotic sentiments, which proved that the country's future had hope. The Communist Party and the enemy had previously spread rumors that Guangxi's resistance claims were only lip service, and they also criticized the central government as compromising with Japan. These were all divisive tactics. Now the Guangxi Inspection Group had carefully examined the central government, and we have come to Guangxi to see the situation with our own eyes, further proving that our foreign policy is completely consistent and there is no estrangement. This is called unity. He Sui then spoke about the achievements of Guangxi's military, militia, and school construction, and the effectiveness of the Three Self-Policies, with no expert unemployed in the province, no beggar, and no bandit. Next, Mr. Lin Shimuo spoke about the importance of mineral resources, hoping that Guangxi would develop its underground treasures as soon as possible, which would not only stimulate the social economy but also benefit national defense construction. Next, Mr. Chongxing Bai spoke about party affairs and the country's progress in recent years. The central government's clear results in handling diplomacy last year were intended to make the officials and people of Guangxi trust the central government. Finally, he shouted eight slogans and dispersed.

In the afternoon, we went in groups to visit "Fubo Mountain" and "Returning Pearl Cave." The mountain has a Ma Yuan Ancestral Hall. Below the mountain is a cave called Returning Pearl, which can be reached by boat. The cave can accommodate dozens of people and has many ancient steles. The more valuable ones are the inscriptions by Lu, the commissioner of the Song Dynasty's Zhiping second year, and Liu Shu, who handled public affairs. The boat we were on belonged to Xin Lian, and the reception office specially arranged for us to cruise the Li River, paying more than ten yuan a day. The boat was newly built, with Xin Lian's guest's poems and couplets hanging on it, signed "Lotus Obsessed," but we don't know who it is. The punters are both male and female. Xin Lian is only responsible for pouring tea and wringing towels. After visiting Returning Pearl Cave, we went up the river to "Elephant Trunk Hill," which has a cave that connects to the river called "Water Moon Cave." The mountain is shaped like an elephant, with a stone hanging down into the river, hence the name Elephant Trunk. There is a pagoda on the back of the mountain, like a vase on the back of an elephant. Then we abandoned the boat, landed, and entered the city through the South Gate. In the evening, Li, Bai, and Huang hosted a banquet at the Lequn Society. During the banquet, we met Lei Yin, the Director of Civil Affairs, who was a speaker in the old National Assembly and was acquainted with us in peacetime. We talked about Guangxi's civil affairs, which rely entirely on the power of the teams to promote them, such as the organization of townships, towns, villages, and streets, and the appointment and training, and storage, and land reporting. The original amount of land tax was more than 5 million, and now it can be increased to more than 10 million. We also talked about the gambling tax, which originally brought in about 6 million yuan a year. Now, with the implementation of the ban on gambling, it can be eliminated. The opium tax originally brought in about 10 million yuan a year, but now, with the ban on smoking, only 6 million yuan is taken from transit taxes. This year, 260,000 yuan of miscellaneous taxes have been cut. We also talked about the Yao people, saying that there are only more than 260,000 people scattered in the border areas of Guangxi-Yunnan, Guangxi-Guizhou, and Guangxi-Hunan, all living in the mountains. Those who have already assimilated need not be referred to as Yao anymore. We are now working on changing their costumes, intermarriage, and education, but they have not yet been given the opportunity to participate in the military and militia. According to a certain gentleman, the Yao people are accustomed to living in high mountains and are not used to living in lowlands. The land is infertile, and they often kill their own babies. For example, when the third child is born, the parents feel unable to support them and put them to death at birth. This is also a disguised "Malthusian" policy. Therefore, twenty years ago, there were nearly one million Yao people in Guangxi, but now there are only more than 260,000. During the banquet, Li, Bai, and Huang were all good drinkers, and the guests and hosts were extremely enthusiastic. Li Pinxian, Liao Lei, and Pan Yizhi were responsible for hosting each seat. After the meal, there was a performance of national martial arts and a rehearsal of a drama by civil servants. The plot was mostly tragic, and it satirized humiliating diplomacy to move the people of the country. Chu's performance of Tai Chi was the finale.

### Songjiang

Electricity Rate Approved by Construction Committee

The electricity rate dispute in this county was investigated by the Central Construction Committee, which sent personnel to Songjiang. After mediation by local figures, a temporary solution was reached. It is known that the Construction Department has forwarded the Central Construction Committee's order, approving the revision of the county's electricity rate to 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a tiered system reducing the rate by 0.2 cents per level. This will be implemented from July. (That is, 1.1 cents, 1.9 cents, 1.7 cents, and 1.5 cents.) After receiving the order, the county government forwarded it to the electric company for compliance the day before yesterday and instructed the Chamber of Commerce to notify all users.

Parricide and Matricide Case

Zhang Jiaxiang, a villager from Beidou Outer Shengsheng Bridge, North Tongbo Town, Daibao Fourth Jia, Sixth Household, was 41 years old. He made a living repairing firearms and had some savings. He married Xue and had a son named Shigu, who is now 21 years old. In March of this year, Shigu married Song. However, Shigu suddenly devoted himself to roaming around and neglected farming. His father repeatedly reprimanded him, but he did not listen and was instead hated. On the 25th of last month, Shigu had a quarrel with his father and ran away, not returning that night. Around 8 p.m. on the 27th, Jiaxiang suddenly heard dogs barking outside the door and suspected there were thieves. He opened the door with a shotgun in hand to investigate. He saw three people standing in the darkness under the fence outside the door. Jiaxiang immediately asked who they were. The other party suddenly fired a shot, which missed. Suspecting they were thieves, he also fired two shots in return. Both sides fired two shots each. Jiaxiang, fearing that he was outnumbered, closed the door and went inside. Nothing happened. Around 8 p.m. on the 29th, Jiaxiang was at home when he heard dogs barking outside the door again. He opened the door, and with a loud bang, a shot hit him in the chest, causing seven wounds. He fell to the ground and died. The murderer fled without a trace. After the incident, Shigu was highly suspected. The police station's water patrol team arrested Shigu and seized a shotgun. The prosecutor from the local prosecutor's office led the police to inspect the scene. On the morning of the 31st, the prosecutor conducted a preliminary hearing at the team headquarters. Shigu confessed that he had twice used a gun and seven screws to fire gunpowder at his father. The county bureau has transferred the case to the local prosecutor's office for further questioning.

### Jiading

Reorganization and Continuation of the Dyeing and Weaving Factory

The Jiading Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Beidou Nei has been closed for more than two years. Now, someone has re-raised a capital of 30,000 yuan to take over and continue its operation. Because the old factory had suffered too much loss, the entire capital and property were not enough to compensate. Therefore, the former manager, Cheng Dechang, invested 13,000 yuan to purchase the old machinery and property to end the operation. At the same time, Cheng individually added the value of this property to the new shares. The new manager is Hu Fenglai from Changshu. He and Mr. Junliang took over the factory on the first day, recruiting workers and starting the machines.

### Nantong

Inspection of Wheat in Northern Jiangsu

The wheat yield in various parts of northern Jiangsu Province is extremely abundant. In order to improve the quality of wheat and eliminate malpractices, the Ministry of Industry, in conjunction with the provincial government, has set up inspection stations in the wheat-producing areas of Nantong, Rugao, Taixian, and Taiyu.

### Changshu

Wheat and Rapeseed Prices Rise Abnormally

The local wheat and rapeseed have already entered the market. This year, due to more rain and snow, the harvest of these products has been generally poor, resulting in abnormally high prices. Recently, rapeseed has been priced at 10.5 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), and wheat is also around 10 yuan. (Note that this is the price for delivery to the warehouse, including the actual cost of drying in the sun, which is called "warehouse body" by experts.) According to rice merchants, this high price of wheat and rapeseed is unprecedented in 20 years. The reason is that the weather has caused a sharp decline in production, and there is not much stock. At the same time, other ports have the same phenomenon. All parties urgently need goods, resulting in a state of demand exceeding supply. Based on current observations, there seems to be no intention to fall back. As a result, the new oil and flour will also rise accordingly when they enter the market this year.

### Changzhou

Land Tax Revenue Pilfered

Wuyi County Government checked old tax rolls and found that officials in charge of the East and West cabinets had embezzled over 390,000 yuan in land tax revenue. They are currently being watched and secured to recover the embezzled funds. However, the amount owed by each person in the West cabinet has not yet been determined. The land tax revenue embezzled by each person in the East cabinet must be repaid by May 31, otherwise their positions will be replaced by others. In addition, after checking the tax tickets for reed taxes, a shortage of over 15,000 yuan was also discovered. The embezzled funds should be the responsibility of the deceased reed tax official. In addition, Mei Zhiren, the official in charge of the East cabinet who embezzled over 40,000 yuan, has not yet reported to the authorities due to illness. On the 31st, the county government issued a warrant to arrest him. After a hearing, he was ordered to compensate for the loss.

### Zhenjiang

Adoption of Improved Silkworm Seeds

The Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Management Committee recently stipulated measures to promote silkworm breeding in various regions, requiring all silkworm farmers in the province to use improved silkworm seeds and prohibiting the breeding of native silkworms. It also stipulated that the adoption methods of raising and drying silkworm cocoons should be guided by cooperatives, and sales should be based on the principle of public bidding.

Excess Revenue from Deed Tax in Four Counties

The deed tax revenue in Yangzhong, Shuyang, Baoshan, and Taixing counties in Jiangsu Province exceeded the quota in February and March. Yangzhong's revenue from January to March exceeded the quota by more than 2,300 yuan, Shuyang's by more than 3,300 yuan, and Taixing's by more than 1,590 yuan. The Finance Department specially issued a commendation order.

### Jiaxing

Reconstruction of Ji Street into a Road

The houses on Ji Street in Jiaxing City are closely packed together, and the residents are numerous. The street is about half a mile long, and the sports field and lecture hall are located at the end of Ji Street. The current authorities believe that the street is very important and that the road is not wide enough for cars to pass through smoothly. They plan to reconstruct the street into a road to facilitate traffic. On the morning of the first day, the construction department of the county government sent personnel to measure and set up wooden stakes. In general, the residents of the street believe that this construction will cause too much damage and will jointly submit a request to the authorities to delay the reconstruction. It is not known whether it will be approved. It is also rumored that the most prosperous North Main Street will also be reconstructed, and the news is currently in the planning stage.

### National Products Hygiene Exhibition Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday

Mrs. Li Ting'an, Director of the Health Bureau, and others Cut the Ribbon, More Than 5,000 Guests Attended, Including Chu Minyi

The National Products Hygiene Exhibition, sponsored by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall, held its opening ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday in the meeting hall. Zhou Yichun, Vice Minister of Industry, and representatives from the city's party and government agencies attended and delivered speeches. Representatives from all walks of life and the public attended, with no less than 5,000 people. The details are recorded as follows:

Assembly Order

At 2:00 PM, the opening was announced by the military band dispatched by the Municipal Police Bureau. After the ceremony, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered the opening speech, followed by Xu Xiaochu reporting on the purpose and preparation process. Then, representatives from the Municipal Party Committee Mao Yun, Municipal Government Counselor Lin Zifeng, Health Bureau Director Li Ting'an, Social Bureau Representative Ye Weiyi, Central Committee Member Chu Minyi, and guests from all walks of life such as Lin Kanghou delivered speeches. Finally, Zhou Bangjun delivered a thank-you speech.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Wang Xiaolai said in his opening speech: The Commodity Exhibition Hall of our association has been established for seventeen years. The mission of the exhibition hall is to arouse public attention to national products, so that they can go from understanding national products to loving national products and believing in national products. Therefore, we usually hold an exhibition once a year. Human material needs are advancing with the times, especially in urban areas, which are changing with each passing day. For example, in the past, people used to hold melons and fruits to relieve the summer heat and use sha medicine to prevent epidemics. Now, due to the advancement of hygiene knowledge, needs can no longer be so simple. However, on the one hand, we must consider the hygiene standpoint, and on the other hand, we must consider the national economic standpoint. We should ensure that the money spent on hygiene is beneficial to ourselves and does not harm the national economy. In other words, we should not only seek enjoyment and increase leakage. For hygiene products that can be replaced by domestic products, we should use domestic products as much as possible. This valuable task should be undertaken by three types of people. The first type is manufacturers. For hygiene products needed by modern society, those that have not been imitated in terms of quantity should be imitated as soon as possible. Those that have been imitated but are not enough should expand production as much as possible. In terms of quality, they should understand the psychology of customers, measure the standards of imported goods, and strive for excellence to achieve a leading position. The first type is consumers. When they need a certain hygiene product, they must first ask whether it is a domestic product. If they have not asked clearly, do not be vague. If there are any doubts, it is better to be cautious and clear, that is, to pursue domestic products with the attitude of pursuit, and to passionately love domestic products with the psychology of passionate love. The third type is introducers. Manufacturer A may be ingenious in the production of their own products and strive to be upstream, but they may not be able to carefully collect the products of manufacturers B, C, D, and all similar manufacturers and make a comprehensive comparison. The responsibility of the exhibition is to be an introducer for these countless manufacturers, so that they have the opportunity to learn from each other and compare. Secondly, we hope that consumers can pursue domestic products and passionately love domestic products, but consumers are scattered everywhere and have no connection with manufacturers. Therefore, pursuit is the second step, passionate love is the third step, and understanding is the first step. The responsibility of the exhibition is to introduce manufacturers and consumers, so that they can enter the first stage of deep understanding from being strangers. As for the success after this, it depends on each person's conscience and their own efforts, so that consumers and domestic product manufacturers can be permanently combined to revive our Chinese nation. This is a small contribution of today's exhibition opening. I hope that all guests will give more advice.

Mr. Xu's Report

Then, Xu Xiaochu, director of the Commodity Exhibition Hall, reported on the preparation process, briefly stating that Shanghai is the largest commercial port in our country. Commerce is prosperous and travelers gather. Few people in various places pay attention to hygiene knowledge. In view of this, our hall specifically initiated the "National Products Hygiene Exhibition" in accordance with Article 4 of the General Regulations and the Regulations on Commodity Exhibitions of Various Industries, with the purpose of jointly studying and improving the manufacturing of domestic hygiene products and instilling hygiene knowledge to the public, so as to avoid the outbreak of diseases and promote the progress of domestic products. Due to the rush of time, we were unable to prepare fully. There were inevitable difficulties in the process of formulating rules and regulations, submitting them to the bureau for record, planning the venue, soliciting manufacturers, and other important matters. The exhibits of this exhibition are limited to domestic medicines, new medicines, cosmetics, food and beverages, and products related to the summer season, which cannot be widely collected like other national exhibitions. Currently, the participating manufacturers in the new medicine industry include Zhongfa • Zhongxi • Wuzhou • Xinya • Xinyi • Zhengde • Minsheng • Jiufu • Yong'antang • Nanyang • Huaying • Pacific • Hongxing • Twenty-nine companies, the domestic medicine industry includes Hu Qingyu • Cai Tongde • Xu Chongdao • Tong Hanchun • Feng Cunren • Wang Daji • and other eleven companies, the cosmetics industry includes China Chemical Industry Co. • Family Industry Co. • Yonghe Industry Co. • Guang Sheng Hang and other nineteen companies, the food and beverage industry includes Taikang • Guanshengyuan and other seven companies, and the utensil industry includes Yilan • Standard • Maochang and other three companies, totaling more than sixty companies. With a limited exhibition, it can achieve such results. This is all due to the enthusiasm of the manufacturers for domestic products and the strong support of the committee members. This exhibition also received donations of products from various manufacturers, advertisements were donated to Mrs. Wu Shuxian, the wife of the Health Bureau Director, Mrs. Hu Baozhen, the wife of Chairman Wang, and my wife Huang Gengbao for cutting the ribbon. The Boy Scout troop of our association maintained order, the military band of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau played music, and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the General Association of the Chinese Red Cross injected vaccines. I am deeply grateful and express my sincere thanks. However, although this exhibition was able to open as scheduled, there are inevitable omissions. I hope that all attendees will give detailed guidance based on their love for domestic products and promotion of hygiene, so that domestic products can be revitalized and diseases can be reduced. This is my greatest expectation.

Party and Government Speeches

First, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech, briefly stating that he was very honored to participate in the grand ceremony of your association today. As for the purpose and significance of the association, the chairman has reported in detail, and I would like to share some thoughts with you. I believe that this move is not only a health movement but also an economic movement. The improvement of hygiene products and the awakening of the general public to equip themselves with various hygiene products is to ensure health. From an economic point of view, in the past, various new medicines and new medical equipment mostly came from foreign countries. Now, domestic manufacturers can promote self-made products, so the leakage can be gradually stopped. Therefore, this association has supreme significance. I hope that you will work hard and move forward. Then, Lin Zifeng, Counselor of the Municipal Government, delivered a speech, briefly stating that the meaning of hygiene is to protect people's lives, and its importance is also known. In the past, our country had the so-called theory of warding off evil spirits, which was intended to seek hygiene. However, the eating habits of our country really need to be substantially improved. In my opinion, there should be two pairs of chopsticks when eating, which is more hygienic. Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, gave instructions, briefly stating that in recent years, the promotion of hygiene movements by all sectors of society and the formation of hygiene concepts have gradually reduced the general epidemic diseases, which is quite remarkable. Your association's promotion of hygiene products is an extremely important task in the hygiene movement. In the future, I hope that colleagues in your industry will strive to develop manufacturers of hygiene products, and the hygiene industry will improve day by day. Ye Weiyi, representative of the Municipal Social Bureau, gave instructions, briefly stating that public knowledge is not only increased by books, but also by holding various sports, which is enough to increase public knowledge. Hygiene is a very important matter, so your association's move has a profound meaning.

Guest Speeches

Central Committee Member Chu Minyi gave a speech, briefly stating that the importance of hygiene is known to all, but I believe that hygiene and physical education are equally important. Hygiene focuses on the passive aspect, and physical education focuses on the active aspect. Hygiene prevents the occurrence of diseases, so that people do not have the pain of diseases. Physical education is for exercising the body, not only to prevent people from getting diseases, but also to make people physically strong. The government's current promotion of strong men training, scout training, and military training is based on this meaning. If the body is healthy and strong, the spirit will be full, the efficiency of work will be increased, and the production industry can be further developed. Therefore, this is a measure to enrich the country and strengthen the people. Then, Lin Kanghou, Pang Jingzhou and others gave speeches (length omitted). After the speeches of representatives from all walks of life, Zhou Bangjun gave a thank-you speech.

Ribbon-Cutting and Door Opening

The presidium led the representatives of various agencies and guests from all walks of life out of the meeting hall to the front of the exhibition hall. The exhibition door was tied with red and green ribbons. Then, Mrs. Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Mrs. Wang Xiaolai, and Mrs. Xu Xiaochu performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony in the sound of military music. After the ribbons were cut off, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Xu Xiaochu, Director of the Exhibition Department, performed the door-opening ceremony. After the door was opened, the presidium led all the guests into the exhibition hall in an orderly manner. The various exhibits were arranged elegantly and the colors were dazzling. After the visit, tea and snacks were provided, and the meeting was adjourned.

### Record of Current People's Whereabouts

Wu Dingchang • Chu Minyi • Fu Rulin • Took the night train to Beijing last night.

Wu Zhihui, took the night train from Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.

### Yang Hucheng is Scheduled to Go to Lushan Tonight

Summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Ask for Instructions Before Going Abroad Within a Month

According to reliable information from the New Sound News reporter, Yang Hucheng, the former Director of the Xi'an Pacification Office, was summoned by telegram by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and has decided to take the Zhaoshangju Kuaili ship to Lushan tonight to pay his respects. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 12:00 midnight. The date of Yang's departure abroad now awaits an audience with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions and decisions. The private residence of Qi Qi Road is also being rented by Yang's private secretaries for accommodation, with a lease period of only one month. Therefore, it is anticipated that Yang's departure will not exceed one month, as his private secretaries will accompany him.

### Gan Jiehou Entered Beijing This Morning

Negotiations in Shanghai Completed, Now Accompanied by Huang Ji

Li Zongren • Bai Chongxi • Representative Gan Jiehou, went from Guilin to Shanghai to Beijing, and has been here for three weeks. Huang Ji, representative of the Guizhou Provincial Government, has also been in Shanghai for several days. Recently, there have been repeated reports from the outside that Gan and Huang have gone to Beijing from Shanghai, but they are still staying in Shanghai. The Central News Agency reporter learned from all parties yesterday that the reason why Gan and Huang have been delayed in going to Beijing is that Gan Jiehou had an audience with a certain authority in Shanghai to report on the military and political situation in Guangxi, and to ask for instructions on everything, and also visited Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Commission, to discuss the construction of railways and financial issues in Guizhou Province. The results were very satisfactory. As for the various materials and forms for financial issues, it was necessary to wait for Huang Ji, General Manager of the Guangxi Bank, to bring them to Shanghai before further consultations could be carried out. Huang arrived in Shanghai last Thursday, carrying a letter from the Guangxi Provincial Government to the Ministry of Finance, and all the materials. Gan then planned to go to Beijing with Huang on Friday last week. Later, he learned that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Zhang Gongquan, Minister of Railways, had arrived in Shanghai. Gan needed to visit President Sun to discuss the development of the Guizhou Province economy, and also needed to meet with Minister Zhang to discuss the construction of railways in Guizhou Province. At the same time, Zou and Xu, the two Vice Ministers of Finance, gave a detailed report on the financial issues in Guizhou Province, so he also stayed in Shanghai. Now that Gan and Huang have completed their business in Shanghai, they are scheduled to take the Capital Express this morning to enter Beijing together. It is reported that Gan will ask Chairman Wang for instructions on everything, and after visiting Acting President Wang and the central authorities, he will return to Shanghai to wait for the ship and return south first. Huang Ji will stay in Beijing and Shanghai temporarily to continue to discuss financial issues with the financial authorities.

### Redemption and Lottery of Three Types of Public Bonds

Workers from Meiya Main Factory • Jingwei Factory, located at No. 153 and 33, Riyun East Road, South Shanghai, formed a hunger strike group in the factory workshop yesterday morning due to the factory's closure and the loss of livelihood. They all went on a hunger strike to urge the factory to realize and open the factory as soon as possible. Otherwise, they are determined to wait for death. After receiving the news, the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, which is in charge of the area, was afraid of accidents and immediately sent a bureau member, Zhang Huantang, to persuade them, asking the workers to ask the party and government agencies to mediate and provide relief. Meiya Factory No. 5 • Factory No. 6, located at No. 679, Xueshi Road, and Factory No. 7, located at Qu Zhenren Road, obtained Jingwei raw materials yesterday and worked as usual.

### Shanxi Drought Disaster Seriously Telegraphs Shanghai for Relief

The drought in Shanxi this year is serious, with widespread starvation and a miserable situation. The disaster situation is more serious than in other provinces. Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, telegraphed the Shanxi fellow villagers in Shanghai for relief. The original telegram is recorded as follows:

(Above omitted) Shanxi Province is unfortunately experiencing successive disasters. Last spring, the communist bandits disturbed and cruelly ravaged more than 30 counties. Families were displaced and villages were turned into ruins. The counties that were not reached by the bandits were also exhausted of manpower and resources due to the need to organize defenses, supply provisions, and provide labor services. In the summer and autumn seasons, they suffered from floods, droughts, windstorms, hail, insect pests, and other disasters. More than 60 counties were affected. The rest, although not affected, also had poor harvests. They suffered two disasters in one year. Fortunately, the central government frequently issued relief funds, and various parties also donated relief funds repeatedly. The benefits were universally praised. However, the distribution was small, and it was only enough to avoid starvation. We were hoping for a recovery in the summer this year. However, drought demons wreaked havoc, and rain was delayed. All counties in the province presented signs of disaster. Especially in the counties in southern Shanxi, there was a lack of rain since last autumn, and there was no snow in the winter. Winter wheat was barely sown, and most of the roots and stems were not developed. Since the beginning of spring, there have been frequent strong winds, and 90% of the wheat seedlings have withered. Cotton is not easy to plant, and even if it is planted, the seedlings are very sparse, making it difficult to grow. Looking at the fields from afar, the bare land is dotted with red. Looking at the fields nearby, the withered yellow is everywhere. Although the season is just the beginning of summer, the scenery is like late autumn. Moreover, the livelihood of the people in the counties in southern Shanxi has always depended on wheat and cotton. Now that both have become empty hopes, the people's livelihood has suddenly lost its support. In addition, after the disasters, the people have no surplus of grain. It is difficult to fill the stomach with thin wheat porridge. The digging of grass roots and tree bark is limited. The people of Shanxi are attached to their homeland and have deep-rooted habits. However, according to reports from various counties recently, the poor are helping the old and carrying the young, leading to the exodus of famine victims, which is heard every day. The second wheat has not yet been harvested, and the situation is already like this. The future is long, how can it be endured? If relief and comfort are not urgently planned, the future is difficult to imagine. Although the counties have been ordered to distribute grain from the granary to temporarily relieve the urgent need, it is only a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. Moreover, this disaster area is vast, and there are many victims. A large amount of relief funds is needed to provide relief and avoid displacement. The above situation has been personally inspected by the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, and verified by special commissioners. All are true. In addition to the efforts of the Provincial Government to make plans and report separately, I pray that you will consider the imminent death of the disaster victims who are waiting for relief, and quickly allocate large sums of money to be distributed and avoid displacement. I am overwhelmed with gratitude and await orders. Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, bows.

### WENXI PAPER MANUFACTURING COMPANY OPENS INAUGURAL MEETING YESTERDAY

Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industries Addresses the Meeting; Director Reports on Preparatory Process

The Wenxi Paper Manufacturing Company held its inaugural meeting yesterday on the fifth floor of the Banking Club. One hundred and forty-nine shareholders were present. The official shares were represented by Minister Wu and Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Industries. The meeting began at 3:00 PM, with Minister Wu as the chairman. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech (text attached). Next, Zhou Yichun, the director of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparatory process, the gist of which was: (1) A total of 33,000 shares were fully subscribed; (2) Shareholders subscribed to a total of 3.2 million yuan in national currency; (3) The promoters had no special interests; (4) No property other than money was used to offset the shares; (9) The establishment expenses to be borne by the company amounted to 24,064.29 yuan in national currency. After the promoters' unpaid report, when the articles of association were read, it was decided to add the character "市" (city) to "Shanghai," which would be added during the next revision of the articles of association. The remaining articles were passed one by one. Subsequently, the list of official shareholder directors and supervisors was announced, including the official shareholder directors Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Xu Kan, Cheng Tiangu, Zhou Yichun, Chen Shizhang, Wang Lengbo, and Kong Lingkan; supervisors Yan Shenyu, Liu Haiping, and Qin Guchun.

The elected commercial shareholder supervisors were Lu Feibohong, Zhou Zuomin, Lu Gaoyi, and Hu Zhengzhi, totaling four people, with Liu Minzhai as the candidate. A photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. The chairman's opening speech is recorded as follows:

Chairman's Speech

Today, the Wenxi Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is holding its inaugural meeting convened by the promoters for all shareholders. Our company relies on the enthusiasm of the promoters and the support of the shareholders to complete its organization, which is extremely gratifying. Paper manufacturing was first invented in our country, but unfortunately, later generations adhered to traditional methods and failed to promote it, resulting in today's backwardness. The currently popular wood pulp paper is merely a continuation and evolution of our country's invention. Moreover, wood pulp raw materials can be fully supplied in China, which has vast forests. However, due to the inability to utilize and manufacture them ourselves, most of the printing paper required for general national culture relies on imports. The total value of imported foreign paper reaches over 50 million yuan annually. Looking back on the past, how can we not be filled with emotion? Therefore, the late Premier Sun, in the "Printing Industry" chapter of his industrial plan, gave clear instructions regarding the paper manufacturing industry. President Chiang, recognizing the decline of national economic construction, has made every effort to promote the National Economic Construction Movement, especially repeatedly urging the progress of the paper manufacturing industry. Fortunately, with the enthusiastic support of you gentlemen, the Wenxi Paper Manufacturing Plant, which has been planned for the past two or three years, is established first. In the future, we should continue to plan and gradually build paper mills in provinces rich in wood pulp raw materials, to directly develop the economic industry and indirectly develop the cultural industry. Furthermore, national economic construction focuses on the national entity, and the government is only in a position to promote and assist. Therefore, I would like to announce to the people the two principles that I hold for government-commercial joint ventures: First, in light of our country's national situation, regardless of politics, military affairs, diplomacy, national defense, or economy, the government and the people must stand on a united and cooperative front to fight for survival. Even in the paper manufacturing industry, a small part of economic construction, we must carry out our plans with this spirit. Second, the government's intention for all ordinary economic construction projects is to promote and assist, not to compete with the people for profit. For all such government-commercial joint ventures, the government shares that have been determined can be transferred to the people at any time, so that more people have the opportunity to participate, thereby facilitating widespread benefits. On the occasion of the company's founding, I would like to briefly explain the significance of the government-commercial joint venture in establishing a paper company and the prospects for national economic construction. I hope that all colleagues in our company will work together to make the business thrive. This is what I hope for.

Preparatory Process

Zhou Yichun, Director of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the preparatory process, saying: "Investigations show that our country's printed publications, pictorials, and books all use foreign wood pulp paper, with annual imports exceeding 50 million yuan. Given our country's vast territory and abundant resources, it is inappropriate to not have wood pulp paper mills and to passively allow money to flow out. In the past, although the government vigorously promoted it, it was difficult for the people to raise the huge amount of money needed to build a factory, and it has not been realized for a long time. Previously, the Shanghai Book Trade Association petitioned the government to establish a state-run or government-commercial joint venture in the forest areas to produce wood pulp paper to meet urgent needs. The Ministry of Industry believed that the Shanghai book industry was very concerned about the paper manufacturing industry, and that the establishment of this paper mill would be easier with the joint efforts of the government and businesses. Therefore, it immediately consulted with the leaders of the book industry on cooperation methods, and sent personnel to hire experts to investigate domestic industrial resources that were abundant, suitable in quality, and conveniently located in various forest areas to prepare for the location of the factory. The report pointed out that the Zhenshan and Liushan industries in the Wenqu area of eastern Zhejiang were very rich and very suitable for the manufacture of newsprint. The forests in Longquan, Qingyuan, and Xiaoning counties were old and could be used as papermaking materials. They were not only cheap and of good quality, but also an inexhaustible source. It was also appropriate to expand the land to build a factory in Wenxi, 90 li away from the county seat of Yongjia, where land and water access were available via the highway and the Daxi and Xiaoxi streams. The Ministry of Industry believed that since there were no problems with raw materials and factory sites, it submitted a request to the Executive Yuan in February of the 23rd year to allocate the British Boxer Indemnity funds that the Ministry of Industry could borrow as government shares for the establishment of the paper mill. After being submitted, it was passed by the 148th Executive Yuan meeting. The factory construction plan was sent to the Board of Directors for the Management of British Boxer Indemnity Funds for review. At the end of that year, the Ministry of Industry separately hired more than ten members of the Preparatory Committee to organize the Preparatory Committee, which was responsible for the preparations. In the 24th year, Mr. Stott, a British papermaking expert, and Mr. Perfurth, a Swedish hydroelectric expert, were hired to conduct on-site inspections and made slight modifications to the original plan to make it more perfect. Later, for the sake of prudence, at the beginning of the 25th year, wood was taken to a paper mill in Sweden for testing. It was considered to be a very good raw material for papermaking. The detailed plan was sent to the Chinese Institute of Engineers for review and was highly praised. In the spring of this year, Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Industry invited experts to revisit the factory site and forest area in Wenxi and other places, and they were all satisfied. In the past month, the Preparatory Committee of the factory convened a meeting of promoters and made appropriate revisions to the company's articles of association: ㊀ The original name of the "China Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd." was changed to "Wenxi Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd." ㊁ The total amount was set at 3.2 million yuan, with government shares accounting for 1.5 million yuan and commercial shares accounting for 1.7 million yuan. When the commercial shares exceeded the quota, the government shares would be transferred, limited to 10,000 shares. ㊂ When the company was established, it was presented to the Ministry of Industry for approval to transfer the 4 million yuan borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to the company, with the company's entire assets as collateral. After a detailed review by the Ministry of Industry, although there were slight changes in the company's name, capital, and loan method, the sufficient capital and the construction of the factory were still convenient, and the business prospects were especially promising. With the consent of the Board of Directors for the Management of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, the company's articles of association were specially submitted to the Executive Yuan and passed at the 312th meeting. In addition to approving the company's articles of association for record, the Ministry of Finance was ordered to allocate 1.5 million yuan for the government share capital. Now, the payment of government and commercial shares has begun according to the prescribed date, and the company's founding meeting is scheduled to be held. Matters such as factory construction and machinery purchase will be handled by the company in the future. The Preparatory Committee for the Wenxi Paper Mill will be dissolved immediately. As for the expenses incurred during the preparatory period, from May of the 24th year to May of the 26th year, a total of 24,064 yuan and 20 cents was used for raw material investigation and testing, and factory site inspection. Other items such as rent, wages, and miscellaneous expenses were small in number. This paper mill, which has been prepared for several years, will definitely be completed in a short period of time after the establishment of the company, which is also gratifying."

### VARIOUS QUARTERS RELIEVE SICHUAN DISASTER

Hechuan Appeal

The Shanghai Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association of this city received a telegram yesterday from the Hechuan County Government, saying: "To the gentlemen of the Shanghai Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association, Hechuan has been repeatedly hit by disasters, as previously reported to Lie Feng in detail. Last spring's wind, hail, and earthquake damaged agricultural production. Since the beginning of summer, the River God has wreaked havoc, causing significant losses to residents along the river three or four times. Most critically, drought has plagued us from summer to winter, with rice and sorghum dying. The sweet potatoes also have no chance of survival. Looking around the countryside, the fields are all red. Even drinking water is difficult for the villagers to find. The severe drought is even worse this spring. With the arrival of the Beginning of Summer, there is no rain, and the rocky fields are parched, making plowing difficult. The beans and wheat are withering, and rice seedlings cannot be planted. Families have already consumed their stored food, and the poor cannot find porridge to eat, becoming starving corpses. The bark and roots of trees and grass are almost completely stripped, and some are even fighting for white clay to temporarily fill their stomachs, leading to deaths along the fields and paths. The current situation is such that relief is impossible, and the hidden worries about the future are extreme. Robbery of rice and grain is heard of every day. If villains take advantage of the situation, local security will be in imminent danger. Your concern for our homeland has always been admired. We respectfully submit the disaster map and list of disaster victims, sincerely urging you to appeal to the authorities and provide relief to the remaining victims. The 700,000 people of Hechuan will definitely buy silk and embroider your portraits. Wang Xigui, Magistrate of Hechuan County, Sichuan, and Chairman of the Relief Branch, Wang Xizhang, Secretary, leading various agencies, legal entities, and 700,000 people, bow and sign."

Donations for Relief

Hu Bijang of the financial sector in this city, seeing the severity of the Sichuan disaster, generously donated 1,000 yuan in national currency to handle emergency relief. His enthusiasm for relief work is truly admirable. In addition, Li Yihe, the manager of the Haobaixiang Fish Store at 311 Julida Road in the French Concession, voluntarily donates 10% of the daily sales revenue to the Sichuan disaster relief fund from today, limited to one month. Mr. Li's approach is very appropriate. It is hoped that all businesses in this city will follow this approach to promote charitable acts. Even though the Sichuan disaster is severe, it will not be difficult to overcome with human effort.

Donation of Medicines

The various circles of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association of this city, due to the severe disaster in Sichuan and the prevalence of epidemics, sent letters to various charitable organizations in this city, requesting donations of medicines for prevention. Yesterday, the Shanghai China Jisheng Association donated 3,000 bottles of Jisheng Pills, 1,000 bottles of Baoan Pills, 1,000 bottles of dysentery medicine, and 1,500 boxes of Guanyin Relief Pills. In addition, Yaohua Shide donated 1,000 bottles of Shenggong Jizhong Water. They will be sent to Sichuan by the Association in the coming days to prevent the rampant spread of epidemics.

Business Supporting Relief

The Qihua Hairdressing Company on Guizhou Road in Shanghai, which has been in business for more than ten years, has repeatedly improved its equipment and hired specialized personnel over the years. Recently, all the colleagues of the company, in view of the severe disaster situation in Sichuan Province, with people crying for food and sorrowful sounds everywhere, should all make every effort to contribute. Therefore, yesterday they specially submitted the entire day's business income and the small accounts earned by all the colleagues to the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Association. Although this is a drop in the bucket, it is hoped that colleagues in the industry can continue to donate, and accumulating small contributions may be a blessing for the disaster victims.

Classmates Saving Disaster

The Sichuanese professors and students of Daxia University in this city, in view of the extremely severe disaster situation in their hometown and the unprecedented tragic situation, convened a meeting on the 12th of the month at 10 Xincun, Daxia, by Lu Jizeng to discuss fundraising and rescue measures with students Gui Rongfen, Ma Zongheng, Li Sijing, Liu Shuhe, Wu Youxiong, Wei Funan, Wu Derang, Li Jikai, Liu Zhengxuan, Yang Mingyu, etc. Subsequently, Fan Jizhou, Chen Jingwei, Song Daishu, Yang Huichuan, Wang Zhuojiu, Chen Shengren, Pang Huilong, Huang Xiaoyuan, Liu Kaiji, He Songru, and other classmates separately solicited donations from all faculty, staff, and students of the school. Now, 369 yuan and 70 cents in cash have been raised. The remaining collections will be completed within the next few days to facilitate the collection of funds to be sent to Sichuan for relief.

Performing Arts to Help

The Shanghai Sichuan Fellow-Provincial Students' Disaster Relief Association in this port, in view of the severity of the Sichuan disaster, prepared a charity performance in the previous month. It is now learned that preparations have been completed, and it is scheduled to stage a drama at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge for two days starting from June 7. All ticket income will be used to provide relief to disaster victims. From now on, a ticket sales team will be organized to promote the sale of tickets to banks and businesses.

### TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION REQUESTS FRENCH POLICE DEPARTMENT TO GUARANTEE SAFETY

Ruan Yaoji Sewing Machine Company Illegally Searched and People Detained by the French Concession Police

Ruan Yaoji, located at 30 Zhengjia Muqiao in the French Concession, has been engaged in various domestic sewing machine businesses for more than ten years. Unexpectedly, it was recently jealoused by the foreign company Singer, which accused Ruan Yaoji of counterfeiting trademarks to the Shanghai Local Court. While the Local Court was investigating, suddenly on the morning of May 14th at 9:00 AM, the French Concession Police dispatched a large number of detectives to the company to conduct a search without asking for reasons. Because the shopkeeper, Ruan Guiyao, had returned to Ningbo for business, the accountant Feng Wujin was arrested and detained for twelve hours. Ruan Yaoji sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association calling for relief and assistance. The Fellow-Provincial Association forwarded it to the French Concession Taxpayers Association, requesting that it be forwarded to the French Police Department for negotiation. Yesterday, the Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the French authorities. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully, we received a letter from the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Provincial Association, (omitted above). According to the representative of the Ruan Yaoji Sewing Machine Company, a fellow-provincial of our Association, our company is located at 30 Zhengjia Muqiao in the French Concession, engaged in various sewing machine businesses for more than ten years. We have always been law-abiding. Recently, due to business competition, we have specially manufactured domestic sewing machines for social use. Unexpectedly, this has aroused the jealousy of the foreign company Singer, which falsely accused our company of trademark infringement. The case is under investigation by the Shanghai Local Court, and our company has been summoned for questioning. Our company believes that the matter is a false accusation and that the truth will eventually come out. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 14th) at 9:00 AM, the French Concession Police suddenly dispatched a large number of detectives to our company to conduct a search without asking for reasons or showing any evidence. Because the owner, Ruan Guiyao, had returned to Ningbo, the accountant Feng Wujin was arrested and detained for twelve hours. Later, Feng was released due to illness, and police were stationed at the company. The incident is extremely bizarre. We believe that our company is a legitimate and legal business entity, and the French Concession Police have a duty to protect it. Now, they have listened to the one-sided false accusations of foreign companies without investigating the truth, resulting in destruction, which is deeply shocking. Moreover, since the case has been examined and tried by the Shanghai Local Court, it should be handled according to law. The actions of the police affect not only the business losses of our company, but also the commercial reputation that has been illegally attacked. Our company pays municipal taxes every year, but has not received the benefits of protection, but has instead suffered illegal oppression. The actions of the police are truly inappropriate. For this reason, we report and seek correction. We respectfully request your Association to consider the difficulties of businesses and provide assistance. Please forward to the Police Department West Inspector a consistent appeal to correct the situation according to law and ensure commercial security. We are deeply grateful, etc. Upon approval, our Association immediately sent personnel to investigate. According to the report, your department did indeed dispatch a large number of detectives to the company on the 14th to conduct a search, but did not hold a search warrant from the Special Second Court. The procedures seem to be inadequate. It has been found that the company and Singer have a lawsuit in the Local Court. Right and wrong are determined by law. If the matter does not warrant an emergency disposition, why should a search be conducted without going through the court, causing the residents within the concession to lose the security of their residence? This Association deeply regrets this incident. We hope that your Police Department, except in cases of public danger that require emergency disposition, must abide by the concession agreement and handle ordinary searches in accordance with the law. We are deeply grateful. To the French Concession Police Department."

### ZHEJIANG PROVINCE COCOON MARKET CLOSES, ALL SILK FACTORIES IN THIS CITY RESUME WORK

A Total of 38 Factories with Over 8,000 Spinning Heads; Poor Cocoon Harvest Leads to High Prices, Making Profitability Difficult

The spring cocoons in Zhejiang Province have come onto the market, and because they are earlier than those in Jiangsu Province, they have all been weighed and closed. The silk factories in this city that went to collect cocoons have also returned to Shanghai one after another and have all resumed work yesterday. However, this year, due to the poor spring cocoon harvest and the increase in cocoon costs, operations are extremely difficult. Our reporter is now investigating the situation as follows:

Zhejiang Province Cocoon Prices Completely Closed

The cocoon-producing areas in Zhejiang Province include Wuxing, Wu Yu, Wukang, Jiaxing, Yuyao, Haining, Haiyan, Lin'an, Yuqian, Fuyang, Xindeng, Shengxian, Jiaxing, Hangxian, Xinchang, etc. Their spring cocoons come onto the market in mid-May, which is earlier than those in Jiangsu Province. Most of the raw materials used by the silk factories in this city rely on supplies from Zhejiang Province. The products of Jiangsu Province are all purchased by silk factories in Wuxi and other places. This year, the silkworm cocoons in Zhejiang Province have suffered a poor harvest due to weather conditions. The total number of products, including local varieties and improved varieties, is more than 30,000 dan, which is one-third less than last year. The Shanghai silk factories have collected about 10,000 dan of silkworm eggs, and the rest have been purchased by cocoon merchants and Zhejiang silk factories. Now the cocoon markets in various parts of Zhejiang Province have closed, and the cocoon purchasing factories in this city have also returned to Shanghai one after another.

Silk Factories in Various Districts Resuming Work

As of yesterday, the silk factories in various districts of this city that have resumed work include: in Zhabei District, Yutai (200 spinning heads), Qin Yi (416 spinning heads), Meifeng (416 spinning heads), Shaoxing (240 spinning heads), Xinchang (208 spinning heads), Yufeng (228 spinning heads), Xinglun (240 spinning heads), Yinyi (100 spinning heads), Jiating (42 spinning heads), etc., totaling nine factories; in Xinzha District, Tongyu (240 spinning heads), Yixing (240 spinning heads), Haifeng (240 spinning heads), Dafeng (208 spinning heads), Chengfeng (424 spinning heads), Jincheng (214 spinning heads), Yuanshunxiangji (222 spinning heads), Tailun (240 spinning heads), Fuchang (416 spinning heads), Yonghe (208 spinning heads), Jiufeng (180 spinning heads), Jiyu (436 spinning heads), etc., totaling eleven factories; in the Concession District, Alabast Road Xinchang (204 spinning heads), Chengdu Road Yi (500 spinning heads); in Hunan District, Baotai (320 spinning heads); in Hongkou District, Qiaoyuan (120 spinning heads), Xingchang (208 spinning heads), Baoyu (108 spinning heads), Liyuan (126 spinning heads), Xiangcheng (272 spinning heads), Yifeng (272 spinning heads), China (112 spinning heads), Changji (240 spinning heads), Yuanxing (228 spinning heads), Yulunheng (216 spinning heads), etc. In total, there are 34 silk factories operating in the city, with 8,658 spinning heads. In addition, Hongyi, Gongda, Yufeng in Xinzha District, and Hetaisuyuan in Zhabei District are still in the process of organizing the workshops and will resume work later.

Increased Cocoon Costs Make Profitability Difficult

This year's spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have suffered poor harvests, and the future supply will still be insufficient for the silk factories. Therefore, the initial opening price of improved varieties of spring cocoons in Zhejiang Province was 37 yuan per dan, but it later increased to more than 40 yuan. The spring cocoons in Jiangsu Province have also opened, and recently the price has risen to more than 50 yuan per dan. According to industry insiders, three dan of fresh silk are equivalent to one dan of dry cocoons. If the price of fresh cocoons is calculated at 45 yuan per dan, then the dry cocoons must be 135 yuan per dan. If four dan of dry cocoons are reeled into one dan of silk, then the cost is 540 yuan per dan. In addition, adding the cost of drying fresh cocoons at 13 yuan per dan, the cost is more than 150 yuan. Adding the cost of transportation and miscellaneous expenses at 3 yuan per dan of fresh cocoons, the cost is 66 yuan. The total cost of reeling silk is about 760 yuan per dan. Currently, the highest price of American white silk is only 800 yuan per dan. Based on this calculation, it is already difficult to make a profit. If the cost of cocoons increases further, it will be difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, the future of the silk industry this year is bleak.

### XU SHIYING RETURNS TO SHANGHAI YESTERDAY

Ear Ailment Cured, Fully Recuperated; Will Return to His Post in the East Immediately After Leave Expires

Xu Shiying, our country's ambassador to Japan, previously suffered from otitis media, and the illness was very serious. After being treated by Dr. Li Gang, an ear specialist, and undergoing surgery, he gradually recovered. However, because the illness was caused by years of accumulated fatigue and his spirit was exhausted, he followed his doctor's advice and moved to a small residence on the coast of Wusong for a quiet recuperation. However, because there were too many friends and relatives visiting, and the responses were very troublesome, he was again advised to take a river cruise to avoid the noise. After about ten days, the effect was quite noticeable. It is now learned that Mr. Xu returned to Shanghai yesterday and immediately sought an examination of his ear ailment. It has been confirmed that he has completely recovered, and his body is also stronger. However, due to years of hard work and lack of physical fitness, it is necessary to take advantage of this initial recovery to make full adjustments and continue to decline social engagements and rest with all his heart. It is heard that the procedures for going abroad have now been prepared, and he will return to his post in the East immediately after his leave expires.

### Meilong Defense Corps Cracked Counterfeit Currency Machine Organization

Three Machines and Ten Model Blocks Were Searched Out, Four Bags of Counterfeit Paper, and Two Criminals

Mei Hongyuan, the platoon leader of the Meilong Town sub-defense station of the Shanghai West Caojing District Defense Corps, led the team members on patrol to the No. 2 Bridge on Hu Yue Road at 8 pm the day before yesterday. He glanced at a small boat with suspicious traces and immediately stopped it for investigation. Sure enough, three bags of white paper (the paper was white and slightly textured) and one bag of Shidai newspaper were found at the bottom of the boat. When asked, the boatman panicked. After repeated interrogation, he confessed that Ma Yougen, who lived in Majia Youchezhai, had hired him to transport them, and he did not know the rest. The platoon leader, according to the confession, carefully examined the seized white paper and found that it was obviously used to make counterfeit money. He immediately notified the police station in the town and sent the boatman to the station for custody. After learning about it, Wang Biao, the police chief of the station, led the police to meet the team members at about 10 pm that night, and ordered the boatman to act as a guide to the home of Ma Boyu (local, 29 years old), a farmer at No. 37, 11th Jia, 2nd Household, Majia Youchezhai, Hengxi Township, Xinzhuang District, Songjiang County. It was midnight. After knocking on the door, people inside found three banknote making machines in the back room (two foot-operated machines were made by Xintaixiang, one was made by Yao Gongji). After searching for about three or four hours, a total of ten large and small models (one-yuan version of the Central Bank), fifteen semi-printed counterfeit banknotes, six copper coin tubes, sixteen cans of ink oil, one oil pot, one can of machine oil, and one cutter were seized. The criminals Zhang Dongquan (alias Zhou Xingyuan, 41 years old, residing at No. 7, Dong Li Jiazhai, Zhangjiatang, Caojing District) and the landlord Ma Boyu were arrested, along with the seized machines, and taken to the station by hired workers. Unexpectedly, the boatman who was captured first took advantage of the police's search and fled out of the house and jumped into the river to escape. When the police found out, it was late at night, and there was no way to find them. Afterwards, after a collective discussion by the police and the team, in addition to sending the police to guard and arrest the remaining party members, the seized machines and white paper were escorted to the Caojing Police Station yesterday morning. After Director Luo's proposal for preliminary trial, the two criminals confessed their crimes and confessed that Ma Yougen was the leader. After the director's confession, he ordered the police to strictly arrest the fugitive principal offender Ma Yougen, and sent the entire case to the court for trial yesterday afternoon.

### A Strange Rowing Boat Suspiciously Attached to the Jiangxin Steamer

Its whereabouts are secretive and unpredictable, and it is under thorough investigation

When the Jiangxin Steamer of the National Zhao Shang Bureau left Shanghai on Saturday, a rowing boat was actually attached to the outside of the steamer and followed it. It was at 2 o'clock at night, and few people knew about it. When the ship arrived at the Yangshupu River, the captain was reported, saying that a strange rowing boat of unknown origin was privately attached to the outside of the Jiangxin Steamer and was moving forward with the ship. The captain was shocked when he heard the report, because the rowing boat should give way when the steamer is sailing. Why was it attached to the ship? What was the reason? He hurried to check, but the rowing boat had already disappeared at this time. It is not known where it went or whether it was in danger in the Huangpu River. He immediately summoned the rowing boat boss Wang Abao on the ship to investigate the whereabouts of the boat. According to the investigation, the boat came before the Jiangxin Steamer set sail. Someone on the ship inquired about the people on the boat, and it was said that they were acting on the orders of the Japanese consulate. Later, because of the busy departure, he did not know its whereabouts. It is difficult to say whether the one attached to the outside of the ship is this boat. The captain became more worried when he heard this, because if the Japanese consulate was handling the case, it should have notified the shipowner first, but he was not informed, which was very strange. Therefore, when the steamer arrived at Wusong, he ordered Wang Abao to return to Shanghai and report to the head office. According to the report of the bureau, fearing that there was something else going on, it is now conducting an investigation based on the shipowner's report.

### Mr. Haihut is Old But Still Enthusiastic About Aviation Travel

A 70,000-Mile Trek is Probably the Last Opportunity

The Continental News reported that Mr. Haihut, a well-known lawyer from Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, recently made an aviation trip to circumnavigate the world. Three weeks ago, he visited Japan, Manchuria, and North China. On May 25, he arrived in Shanghai from Ping by China Aviation Corporation's plane and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. On Sunday afternoon, a representative of the Daguo News went to interview him. Mr. Hai said, "I am seventy-seven years old. I am making a trip around the world by air. I think this is probably my last chance. You should know that I am old and will soon be unable to withstand the long journey." Mr. Hai is short in stature, but he is a good talker. He has been a lawyer for ninety years. Now he is on vacation, traveling the world to broaden his horizons and fulfill his youthful aspirations. Mr. Hai took a plane from New York to San Francisco on April 20. Two days later, he took the China Clipper Flying Boat to Manila, and then on May 6, he went to Hong Kong. Then he took a boat to Japan to visit Tokyo, and then took a plane to Dalian. He took a train to Shenyang, and then from Shenyang to North, and then came to Shanghai by air. He could not satisfy his desire for a grand tour without staying in China and Japan for a while. Mr. Hai is now planning to visit Hong Kong again, take a British Airways plane, take the route of Singapore, Calcutta, and arrive in Delhi, stay in India for a few days, and then fly to Egypt. Then he will take an Italian plane to visit famous cities such as Rome. Then he plans to travel to Oude. He has not been able to plan his itinerary after arriving in Germany. Mr. Hai also said, "I still have a ticket for the Hindenburg airship. Fortunately, I started slower, otherwise it would have been." I had hoped to complete my voyage by flying, flying across the Atlantic and arriving in the United States. Now there is only the German airship, and after the Hindenburg accident, it will make me unable to fulfill my wish. But I hope that when I arrive in Frankfurt, Germany in July, there will be another airship flying from Lakehurst to the United States, otherwise I will have to take the Da Xu Bolin airship to Ba Sijing City first, and then return to New York along the Lin Bai flight route. The reason why I don't want to do this is because I have already flown through this route when I set off, so I don't want to fly over it again." Mr. Hai calculated that he would fly about 70,000 miles when he arrived in New York, which can be called a long march. Mr. Hai is one of the oldest people in the United States to travel by plane. In recent years, he has always taken planes to handle law cases in various places in the United States. He will not take boats or cars unless he has to. Therefore, when he announced his plan to travel the world by air, American Airlines and Pan American Airlines specially arranged everything and gave him preferential treatment.

### Yongle Hotel Tea Room Attendant Killed

Shen Heshang Was Cut Several Times, Song Xiaokui Fled in Fear of Crime

At 9:00 AM yesterday, a bloody case occurred on the mezzanine on the second floor of the Yongle Hotel at No. 2 Zijinfang, at the intersection of Fujian Road and Guangdong Road in the Public Concession. The old tea room attendant of the hotel, named Shen Heshang, was 39 years old and from Suzhou. He was honest and loyal, and had been in the hotel for three years. Two years ago, Shen had a fellow villager named Song Xiaokui, who came to Shanghai from his hometown and begged Shen to find him a place to live. Later, Shen recommended him to work as a waiter in Yongle. At first, their relationship was very good, but recently, Song was found by Shen to be greedy for small profits and was reprimanded by Shen. Therefore, Song became angry and resentful. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, Shen and Song were both on the night shift. Later, they suddenly quarreled on the second floor mezzanine. Later, the companion suddenly heard a cry for help from the mezzanine and immediately led the ladder to look around. He saw that Shen had fallen in a pool of blood, with one knife in his head and neck, two knives in his shoulders, and two knives in his waist. Blood was splashing everywhere. He touched his limbs and found them cold. He reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which sent Bao Tan No. 230 to the scene to investigate in detail. At this time, Song had fled without a trace. Later, a wallet containing more than ten yuan in legal tender was found on the deceased, which was also stolen by the murderer, apparently seeking money and fleeing in fear of crime. Later, the detectives transported the body to the Fei Lun Road autopsy room for autopsy, and sent a telegram to urge the family members of the deceased to come to Shanghai for the funeral. The police are now closely tracking down the murderer for investigation.

### A Socialite, Chuan Wenhao's Home Suffered a Robbery Last Year, One Thief Was Recently Caught

Seen by a Woman Living with Him in Front of the Cinema, He Was Arrested and Sent to the Court for Interrogation and Arrest of Accomplices

Chuan Wenhao (Ms. AA), a well-known socialite in Shanghai, is 35 years old and lives in a Western-style four-story building at No. 72 Albert Road, French Concession. She is the owner of the property. The first film produced in China in large quantities, "The Ancient Well is Redrawn", was starred by Fu. At about 6 am on July 21 of that year, Chuan's house was robbed by two young students who claimed to be studying at the Jin Shenfu Road Dapuqiao School of Political Science and Law, who were tenants on the four-story pavilion, and colluded with a bandit, carrying three pistols. Fu and two tenants, Huang Youliang, were tied up, and they searched at will. Clothes, gold, pearls, and diamond jewelry worth three or four thousand dollars were robbed and fled. Later, Fu Wenhao listed the losses and reported to the French Police Station, requesting that the stolen goods and thieves be investigated. This case was reported in this newspaper. It has been nearly a year since the incident. Suddenly, at 6 am the day before yesterday, Cheng Tiantian (18 years old, from Hangzhou, currently studying), a female tenant of Fu Wenhao's house, saw one of the robbers in the robbery in front of the Paris Grand Theater at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Beidi Road. Cheng Tiantian informed her brother Cheng Jingfa and summoned Chinese police Cui Jushan and others to arrest the bandit in Hefang Lane, Lufei Road. The bandit was taken to the police station for custody and sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Chen Shuoying提审 inquired about the case, according to the lawyer of the Police Department, Yuan Shouxi, stated the case. The accused, Lin Fuyao, was arrested by the complainant Fu Jiaohao and others on the road. The complainant claimed to the police department that at about 6 am on July 21, 25th year, the accused, together with four others, carried three pistols to the complainant's home and robbed property worth three or four thousand yuan and fled. The accused was the tenant in the four-story pavilion of the complainant's home. It is said that he was a student of the School of Political Science and Law. He moved in on July 16, and the monthly rent was 17 yuan. On the day of the robbery at the complainant's home, the accused left and never returned until yesterday, when he was met by the complainant on the road and arrested. The police station had mixed the accused among more than ten people of similar age who wore four-skillers, and asked the owner to identify him again. Now the police station still needs to investigate and arrest the accomplices and request a postponement of the interrogation. Then, the owner Fu Wenhao投称 said that at about 6 am on July 21 last year, the accused went to my studio on the second floor, and a gunshot was heard. He shouted to the selling xxx goods, we want to kill him, and then drove me to the third floor and tied me up. There were also three thieves who came to the third floor to search and rob diamond rings, gold watches, gold chains, clothes, and other items. Huang Youliang, a tenant on the third floor of Fu's house, also testified that he was 24 years old, from Fujian, and worked in the Navy Department. He moved into Fu's house in February last year. At 6 am on July 21, there were four thieves holding three pistols who first went to my room and robbed clothes, ancient coins, fashion watches, and other items. After Cheng Tiantian, Cheng Jingfa, and Hu Mengzhang相称 supplied testimony, the accused Lin Chuanyao, 29 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong, was interrogated. He worked in a certain agency in Nanjing and came to Shanghai on official business. Last night, when he was walking near the Paris Grand Theater, he mistakenly stepped on Cheng Tiantian's foot to avoid vehicles, causing a quarrel. I apologized to her, but she did not respond. Passersby persuaded them to disperse. Later, I went to Hefang Lane to urinate. Cheng Jingfa and the complainant's monk巡捕 came and pointed me out as a thief and arrested me. I denied the robbery. After verifying the confession in court, it was announced that the re-trial would be held at 9 am on the 7th. The defendant was taken into custody.

### Continued Reports on the Texaco Oil Depot Tragedy

Chen Shilin Dies from Serious Injuries

Regarding the tragic incident that occurred the day before yesterday at the Texaco oil depot pier in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, which has already been briefly reported in this newspaper, further details have emerged. It is understood that the depot employs eighty local workers, managed by foreman Xie Qiaosheng. The monthly wage for senior workers is twenty-four yuan, while short-term workers receive two thousand eight hundred cash per day, primarily for transporting kerosene. Recently, Zhu Wengong, the foreman of the Texaco pier in Puxi, claimed to have a verbal agreement with foreman Xie, stating that Xie must transfer his position to Zhu after serving as foreman for three years. However, Xie has been in the position for five or six years and denies the agreement, refusing to relinquish his post. Seeing his goal unmet, Zhu harbored resentment. At 10:00 AM the day before, he hired the Jinjiang tugboat to tow pier vessel No. 6144 to the middle pier. He had previously gathered one hundred and six new workers, each armed with carrying poles, shoulder poles, axes, iron bars, and other weapons. They boarded the two vessels and arrived at the depot pier at 12:30 PM to forcefully seize control of the work. At the time, the old workers had all gone home for lunch. As soon as the new workers landed, they confiscated the carrying poles and sticks of the old workers and stormed into the shipping room. Upon seeing several people, whom they suspected were old workers remaining at the depot, they attacked indiscriminately with clubs and poles, breaking the neck of Chen Shilin, a ten-year depot supervisor. Guan Liu, a goods inspector, and Ou were wounded in the head. Yao Yi, a mason, was beaten and injured in the waist. Yang Heshang, the old steward, was wounded in the foot. The door and windows of the shipping room were smashed with axes, damaging six or seven sections. The depot immediately telegraphed various agencies to report the incident. Tang Jingshi, the director of the Gaoqiao branch bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched seventy security team members and twenty-four long-term police officers to suppress the violence. Seeing the police arrive, the new workers scattered and fled to the vessels, intending to escape. Coincidentally, the Customs Water Police also arrived with a large number of detectives led by head officer Li, aboard several small vessels. They intercepted the new workers from the water, capturing all one hundred and six and confiscating forty carrying poles, eleven shoulder poles, five axes, five iron bars, and one wooden club. They were taken back to the police station. Chen Shilin, who was most severely injured, was rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment but succumbed to his injuries, dying at around 6:00 PM that evening. His body was taken back for a coroner's examination. The captured new recruits, along with their leader Zhu Wengong, were transferred from the Gaoqiao branch bureau that evening and transported by city ferry yesterday morning to the police bureau for further investigation.

### Pirates Rob a Ship Outside Wusong Estuary

Recently, pirates have reappeared in the waters both north and south of the Wusong Estuary. Around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, two cargo ships, Chen Gujin and Zhou Alai, were passing through the Huashi waters when they were suddenly intercepted by three pirate ships, which fired shots to block their path. Upon seeing this, the two cargo ships quickly raised their sails and attempted to flee. As a result, Zhou Alai's ship was caught and hijacked by the pirates, while Chen Shunjin's ship managed to escape safely. However, two crew members, Chen and Xu, sustained severe gunshot wounds. The whereabouts of the hijacked Zhou Alai ship are currently unknown, and the lost cargo is estimated to be worth over twenty thousand yuan.

### Zhu Genquan Accused of Embezzlement in Slaughter Tax Case

Allegations of Collusion with Zhu Yong'an in Fraudulent Activities - Prosecutor Launches Thorough Investigation

Accounting staff Zhu Yong'an and Li Shengchao from the Finance Bureau, along with technician Xiang Tingxuan from the Health Bureau, were accused of embezzling over four thousand yuan in slaughter taxes from pig slaughtering in the Nanshi area. The District Court sentenced Zhu Yong'an to two years in prison and ordered him to repay all embezzled funds. Li Shengchao received a sentence of one year and six months, while Xiang Tingxuan was sentenced to one year. However, due to extenuating circumstances, Li and Xiang received suspended sentences. Zhu Yong'an, facing a severe penalty alone despite the same crime, hired a lawyer to appeal to the Jiangsu High Court for relief. A hearing was held the day before, and he remains in custody due to lack of bail. However, the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office suddenly received a complaint from Zhu Genquan (also known as Zhu Zhigao), chairman of the Fresh Meat Industry Association, committee members Wang Yexin and Yan Zhifang, and Xu Ahe (also known as Xu Jianzhang), chairman of the Slaughtering Industry Association, and Zhang Rong, a pig slaughtering boss. They stated that Zhu Yong'an and others were convicted based on the use of "one ticket for two purposes." They claimed that the sale of slaughter tickets has always been the responsibility of meat industry members, while the collection of tickets has always been the responsibility of slaughterers. Therefore, using one ticket for two purposes would require collusion between ticket sellers and collectors. They requested an investigation into this method of operation. However, the prosecutor summoned the plaintiffs twice but failed to reach them. The judge stated that regardless of the existence of the plaintiffs, given the case, it was the prosecutor's duty to investigate the defendants to determine whether they were guilty of the alleged crime and to uncover the truth. Therefore, summonses were issued to the accused parties to appear for continued questioning on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month.

The meeting was chaired by Ye Yuhu. The chairman first reported on the following: (1) Since the association began soliciting submissions from various regions, only two weeks have passed. Not only have we discovered many previously unheard-of and unseen cultural relics, but the enthusiastic collection efforts have also led to the discovery of significant cultural relics previously overlooked by local residents. Examples include the Tang Dynasty Jingchuang stone carvings near Nan County and the stone carvings at Chengjian Temple in Jinshan. These unexpected discoveries not only enhance our association but also hold significant value for local literature. (2) Recently, there has been duplication in the submission forms received from various regions, while some important cultural relics have been overlooked. The association hopes that collectors will avoid collecting duplicate items while ensuring that no important local cultural relics are missed. Therefore, we request that those responsible for collection invite relevant individuals in their respective regions to exchange ideas and conduct preliminary interviews or surveys of local cultural relics. The first step is to identify which cultural relics should be collected, the second is to determine from whom or where a particular item should be collected, and the third is to submit a registration form for all items. By proceeding in this manner, duplication can be avoided, and omissions can be prevented. (3) We are grateful that various regions have been willing to assist with the solicitation process. However, some individuals remain concerned about the safety of their items, given the results of previous exhibitions. In the past, exhibitions, especially those during the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republican era, relied on a few enthusiastic individuals and temporary assistance, resulting in unsound organization and unsafe display methods. As a result, exhibitors were often disappointed. Currently, the association is managed by staff from the museum and the gazetteer office, which are permanent institutions. This permanent organization conducting temporary exhibitions differs from the past. Furthermore, all exhibits will be displayed in steel-framed, thick-glass cases, ensuring a higher level of security. The techniques used in managing the exhibition will also be different, as they are handled by trained professionals. We hope that everyone can further explain this to the exhibitors during the collection process, allowing us to showcase the full spectrum of cultural relics from the city and ten counties. (4) Regarding the scope of submissions, it was decided at the previous meeting to include Taicang. Taicang's cultural relics are highly regarded. However, due to the late inclusion, various regions are not yet aware of this. We hope everyone will pay attention to this during the collection process. Also, due to historical changes in county names, such as Luoting now being Songjiang and Lou County previously being part of Songjiang, those responsible for collection should be aware of these changes. In addition, portraits of local sages, ancestral documents of prominent families, township maps, and relics of local worthies are often overlooked by ordinary people but hold great value for literature. The registration forms and letters reporting submissions from various regions are currently lacking in these items. We hope everyone can find ways to supplement them. (5) The association's scope includes the city and ten counties. While Shanghai is known as the only major metropolis today, it is often mistakenly believed to have little historical significance in the past. We know that Xu Guangqi, who diligently introduced Western learning for three hundred years, was from Shanghai. Similarly, the starting point of material civilization in the last hundred years has been Shanghai. From the construction and demolition of the Songhu Railway to the issuance of the legal tender by Wang Yongsheng, these events have had an impact on the entire country. If we can present them, they would be valuable historical materials. Westerners residing in Shanghai in the past have paid close attention to this, while Chinese people have often overlooked it. As a result, there is concern about the lack of historical documentation regarding the changes and evolution of Shanghai in the last hundred years. Therefore, we hope that those responsible for collecting in Shanghai city and counties, as well as other staff members, will make every effort to seize this opportunity to gather various cultural relics, so that the three million citizens who have grown up in Shanghai can recognize the full picture of Shanghai in the last hundred years. Afterwards, the directors and collection directors from various regions expressed their opinions. Finally, Chen Duanzhi from the organizing committee gave a report. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. It was also learned that the deadline for receiving submissions is June 20th.

### Husband Sues Co-habiting Wife for Divorce

Principal Suit and Counter-Suit Concluded - Judgment Scheduled in Seven Days

Chen Huazhang, a local resident of 4 Route Frelaut in the French Concession, is over fifty years old and made his fortune by engaging in real estate construction, accumulating assets of hundreds of thousands of yuan. He was previously sued in the Special District Court No. 2 for a dispute with a certain bank. Due to his refusal to accept the summons and judgment, he insulted the process server, and the prosecutor initiated a public prosecution. As a result, he was sentenced to a fine. After appealing, he was declared acquitted. Chen has no sons, so he adopted his nephew, Chen Guobao (also known as Gengsheng, twenty years old this year), as his heir. In 1935, with the help of a matchmaker, Guobao married a Shaoxing woman named Yuan (Hongwan, the same age as Guobao). The young couple had a good relationship after marriage, but a conflict arose between the father-in-law and daughter-in-law. Yuan left home to temporarily stay with relatives. In January of last year, she hired a lawyer to file a private suit in the Criminal Court of the Special District Court No. 2, accusing her father-in-law, Chen Huazhang, of inciting suicide. After two trials, he was declared innocent. However, Chen Yuan has not returned home. Chen Guobao has hired a lawyer to file a suit in the Civil Court of the Special District Court No. 2 against Chen Yuan, seeking cohabitation and the return of clothing, jewelry, and cash she took away. The defendant has also hired a lawyer. After one court hearing, the parties were advised to settle out of court. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiaoke presided over a continued hearing in Civil Division No. 7, with lawyers representing both parties. First, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the case, stating that the defendant had not come to a settlement. The defendant's lawyer stated that they were requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's suit. The defendant filed a counter-suit, requesting a judgment of divorce, stating that after the defendant married the plaintiff, their relationship was harmonious. However, her father-in-law engaged in inappropriate behavior towards the defendant. When his wishes were not fulfilled, he fabricated love letters to frame the defendant. Therefore, the defendant filed a suit for inciting suicide. Although there is no direct evidence, there is a factual basis. The defendant is unwilling to cohabitate with the plaintiff, so she had no choice but to leave, otherwise an accident might have occurred. The defendant did not take anything when she left the plaintiff's home. They are now requesting the dismissal of the suit for cohabitation and the return of property, and the granting of the counter-suit for divorce. The plaintiff also expressed opposition to the counter-suit for divorce. The court declared the debate in both the principal suit and the counter-suit concluded and scheduled the judgment for the 7th of this month.

### Bank of China Research Department Compiles the National Banking Yearbook

Fourth Edition

The Economic Research Department of the Bank of China's General Administration has been publishing the National Banking Yearbook annually since 1934, and this has been the case for three years. It has been praised by people from all walks of life as the only reliable reference for studying the banking industry. The compilation methods have been carefully studied by the editors and have been revised each time to ensure that the content is accurate and convenient to use. The department's 1937 Fourth National Banking Yearbook has been completed and is being printed. Pre-orders will begin on May 30th, and the book is scheduled to be published by the end of September. Upon hearing the news, a reporter visited the person in charge of the department, who said that the yearbook has been consulted with domestic and foreign experts for each edition, which has been very beneficial. With the experience of the editorial staff in the past, major revisions were made during the compilation of the third yearbook. This year, the same format as last year will be used, and further revisions will be made to meet the original intention of compiling this book. It took nearly a year to complete, which is fortunate. The entire book is divided into three volumes: upper, middle, and lower. The upper volume is an overview, the middle volume is a financial survey of various regions, and the lower volume is statistics, laws and regulations, and other information, totaling twenty-four chapters. The contents are as follows: (1) The upper volume consists of ten chapters, with the first chapter covering banks and finance, divided into current situation, legal provisions on the operation of financial problems, etc.; the second chapter covers central and chartered banks; the third chapter covers provincial and municipal banks; the fourth chapter covers commercial banks; the fifth chapter covers savings banks; the sixth chapter covers agricultural and industrial banks; the seventh chapter covers specialized banks; the eighth chapter covers overseas Chinese banks and all Chinese-owned banks, providing a brief history, recent list of directors and supervisors, location of branches, financial status of assets and liabilities in 1936, and the total number of employees; the ninth chapter covers foreign banks, providing their nationality, establishment process, list of directors and supervisors, location of branches in China, and financial status of assets and liabilities; the tenth chapter covers other financial institutions, providing a brief history, list of directors and supervisors, location of branches, and financial status of assets and liabilities for trust companies, savings associations, silver companies, postal savings and remittance bureaus, and official money bureaus. (2) The middle volume consists of eight chapters, which comprehensively detail the financial situation, financial institutions, guilds of silver and money dealers, market statistics, and other matters in East China, North China, Central China, West China, South China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and foreign countries. Each chapter is a region, each region is divided into provinces, and each province is divided into counties. This volume was specially revised in the third yearbook. At that time, it was a new creation and contained a trial nature, so many aspects did not meet the ideal level. This year, a slight supplement has been added, and the departments of the nine major cities have been merged into their respective provinces. A new chapter on West China has been opened, which merges the original Gansu and Shaanxi in North China and the four provinces of Sichuan and Guizhou in Central China. The description of each chapter focuses on the central location and increases the content of the general overview to provide a general overview of the financial situation of each province. However, this system is far from the planned plan, and readers are still expected to provide more guidance so that we can know how to improve it next time. (3) The lower volume consists of six chapters, including Chapter 19 on bank statistics, which is divided into five major categories: general business, issuance of bills, exchange, and financial markets; Chapter 20 on banking laws and regulations, which specifically contains the current banking laws and regulations promulgated by the government, as well as monetary and other laws and regulations related to banks; Chapter 21 on banking regulations, which newly publishes the articles of association, organizational rules, and business regulations of various banks, which are completely different from the previous edition and are very suitable for reference; Chapter 22 on bank annual reports, which publishes detailed business reports of various banks in 1936, which are important historical facts of modern banks; Chapter 23 on bank diaries, which is compiled from the news advertisements of various newspapers and magazines in 1936 and the reports of the branches of this bank, and includes all major events in the national banking and financial industries; Chapter 24 is an index of bank treatises, which lists the books and newspapers that banking scholars must have for reference. Looking at the entire book's materials, except for a part that refers to the books and newspapers collected by the department and has been corrected to be accurate, most of the materials are the result of the department's own collection over the years and recent direct investigations. Among them, some are investigation forms filled in by various banks, or investigation reports from the bank's branches, which are usually not easily collected. Now they are all used as much as possible. It can be seen that the yearbook not only strives for excellence in compilation and completeness but also pays great attention to the universality of application. It is intended to be used for experts to research, and it is also a necessary reference for professors, students, and banking practitioners. It is truly a masterpiece in the financial world. In addition, since last year, the department has reduced the price of the yearbook from eight yuan to six yuan, and the pre-order price has been reduced from five yuan to four yuan, reducing the burden on readers by more than 20%. Those who are interested in studying the banking business should have one copy per person. The department has samples printed, and all sectors can send letters to request them.

### Iron Lung Patient Mr. Snatte Arrives in Shanghai from Peiping This Morning

Accompanied by 25 People, Temporarily Residing at Kung Chi Hospital, to Return to the United States on the Coolidge Liner on the 7th for Recovery

American Chicago tycoon, Mr. Snatte, 26 years old, set off from the United States last spring for a round-the-world trip. After arriving in Suzhou, he unfortunately contracted paralysis en route from Shanghai to Peiping. All his muscles became stiff and lost their elasticity, threatening his lung's respiratory function and endangering his life. It was then learned that Peiping Union Medical College had a trial device for an iron lung (i.e., respirator) to assist lung respiration. Mr. Snatte requested the hospital to treat him. After the doctors used the iron lung, it was very effective, and Mr. Snatte was able to maintain his life with its help. It is learned that Mr. Snatte has stayed in the hospital for 14 months. Recently, his health has gradually improved, and he longs for home after living abroad for so long. He decided to return to his country a few days ago and took the Shanghai-Peiping train No. 301 to Shanghai in the afternoon of the day before yesterday. He arrived at the North Station at 7:40 this morning. After arriving in Shanghai, he will temporarily reside at Kung Chi Hospital, No. 190 North Suzhou Road. He is scheduled to take the President Coolidge liner to San Francisco on the 7th, and then take a train directly back to his hometown of Chicago for rest and recovery. The following are the details obtained by the reporter from the Ta Kung Pao:

Accompanied Personnel

Mr. Snatte traveled south from the north, specially booking a dining car and a sleeping car on the Shanghai-Peiping train. In Mr. Snatte's room, in addition to an electric motor, there is also a manual air pressure device to prevent panic in case the electric motor suddenly breaks down. It is also learned that after Mr. Snatte fell ill, he telegraphed his family, so his parents and others also came to China last winter. Those accompanying him this morning included his parents and sisters, Dr. and Mrs. Faulkner and their two children, two bandage assistants, two cooks, one iron lung management engineer, one physiology specialist, six male nurses, and two female nurses specially hired from Chicago. In addition, there are also Mr. Snatte's friends Dillon and Miss Jizeng, totaling 25 people.

Preparing to Return Home

After Mr. Snatte and his party arrive in Shanghai, they will temporarily reside in the special ward on the fifth floor of Kung Chi Hospital. They will entrust Dr. Strong, the president of the hospital, to gather famous doctors in Shanghai to examine him together, hoping to alleviate his suffering as soon as possible. Mr. Snatte and his party will not stay in Shanghai for long. After the President Coolidge liner arrives in Shanghai on the 5th, they will take the liner on the 7th to return to their country. It is heard that the cabin rented by Mr. Snatte on the liner has also been specially equipped so that the patient's life will not be hindered along the way. After arriving in San Francisco, they will disembark and transfer to a train directly back to Chicago, and then to Florida for careful treatment.

Overview of the Iron Lung

Regarding the so-called iron lung, the Ta Kung Pao reporter consulted medical experts for details. According to them, this iron lung is also called a "respirator." Although it is novel to have this equipment in Chinese hospitals, it is not surprising in Western countries. Its function is to use electricity to drive muscle contraction and relaxation, so that the lungs can perform respiratory movements, thereby preserving the lives of patients with paralysis. Its structure is a box-shaped cylinder made of steel and glass, 44 inches wide and 74 inches high, weighing 1,100 pounds. There are holes on both sides, and a large hole on the top. The patient lies supine in the box, with his head extending out of the box. The circumference of the hole is surrounded by a sponge rubber ring to prevent the patient's head from suffering and to prevent the air pressure in the box from leaking. When massaging the body is needed, the nurse can also step into the box to perform the operation. However, the application of this respirator requires at least 110 volts of electricity to start, pushing air into the box and simultaneously using the air pressure in the box to push air out of the patient's lungs. When the air in the patient's lungs becomes a vacuum, the outside air can directly enter the patient's lungs. By constantly adjusting this 15 times per minute, the patient can rely on it to help breathing and maintain life. Conversely, without this equipment, the patient will die within five minutes.

### China Book Magazine

Issue 53 Published

The China Book Magazine, with a history of seven years, has established a solid position in Chinese book newspapers with its continuous improvement. Its content keenly reflects the times, and it uses exquisite and rich book photos to introduce the truth of the current domestic and international political, economic, military, and cultural sectors.

In terms of photos, such as the real photos of smuggling in eastern Hebei, the fierceness of the Japanese in Fengtai, the Li and Miao people and objects on Hainan Island, and the information on the life stage and screen of the Sichuan Rong people, are all valuable materials. In terms of text, there is Ling He's biographies of world stars, Zhao Jingshen's saying about the Kunyi Society, Zhang Ruogu's past and present of the Huadi Palace, and Hei Ying's Forget-Me-Not, which can truly be said to be "pictures and texts are beautiful." Each book costs four corners of national currency, and a full year's subscription of twelve issues costs four yuan and four corners. The general distributor is the New China Book Company, No. 71 Huanlong Road, Shanghai.

### Progress of the Pudong Native Place Association's Amateur Club

### Lawyer He Haiyan

### Renovation Stage Manager Zhou Xiaoqing and Others Accused of Embezzlement

After Investigation, Four Items of Responsibility Were Identified; the Court Ordered the Actor Gao Xueqiao to Testify

Zhou Xiaoqing, manager of the former Lin Ji Renovation Stage on Niuzhuang Road in this city, and Hu Jingan, the accountant, were recently sued for breach of trust in the criminal court of the First Special District Court by shareholder Weng Xieyao, represented by lawyer Xu Jiashi. The Special Court has summoned them once. The details have been recorded in this newspaper yesterday afternoon. The case was continued by Judge Fu Lin in the eighth criminal court. First, Xu Weishi stated that during the period of adjournment, after checking the accounts, it was discovered that the defendants should bear criminal responsibility for the following items: ㊀ The defendant Zhou Xiaoqing's monthly salary reached 1,000 yuan. An investigation revealed that the monthly salary of the manager of the Grand Stage was only 150 yuan, and the monthly salary of the manager of the Tianzhan Stage was only 200 yuan, while Zhou's monthly salary alone reached a huge amount of 1,000 yuan. ㊁ The actor Gao Xueqiao received a total salary of 1,061 yuan and three corners and two cents from April to December last year, while the defendants listed 3,927 yuan and nine corners on their accounts, a difference of more than 1,000 yuan. ㊂ The defendants listed 1,000 yuan for preparatory entertainment expenses on their accounts, but the detailed usage was not specified, and there was no record of this in the cash book. ㊃ The shareholders' meeting approved the office expenses of 3,360 yuan, but the accounts showed an expenditure of more than 3,900 yuan. The above are only those found during the investigation. However, the defendants did not submit important account books such as the cash book, so it is difficult to present whether there are any other embezzlements. It should be ordered that the defendants submit the account books for investigation. Zhou Xiaoqing replied, "When I worked at the Renovation Stage in Zhabei, my monthly salary was 2,000 yuan, which has now been reduced by half. This is because I managed both the front and back stages and the scenery." As for the other points raised by the plaintiff, they are all based on evidence or approved by the shareholders' meeting. Then, the court summoned shareholder Tang Ziliang to testify. Afterwards, the court changed the date and waited for Gao Xueqiao to appear in court for further questioning.

### City News

Accountant Huang Peichong Concurrently Handles Income Tax Accountant Huang Peichong recently expanded his business, and the original address was insufficient for office use.

The Liming Battery Factory Opens The sales of dry batteries in the interior are booming. This is because the electric lighting projects in the interior have not been widely established, so most residents use dry batteries instead. In the past, imported goods monopolized the market. Although some people have emerged to catch up in recent years, they have failed to achieve the goal of low prices and high quality. Now, Mr. Zhou of the industry has used his years of research to establish the Liming Dry Battery Factory at the junction of Xie Shi Road and Jumen Road in the Nanshi of this city. Before long, dry batteries with good quality and low prices will be launched, which is good news for compatriots who love to use domestic products.

Brief Remarks

### Do Militaristic Countries Also Need Peace?

— Xing An

Rome Electric: "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with American diplomatic reporter Sims and said that if President Roosevelt convened an international conference, Italy would sincerely support it, and all countries in the world would participate. The current arms race is far from sustainable. If it is not stopped as soon as possible, the whole world will fall into economic bankruptcy. Italy also needs peace to develop its existing resources."

The current world has reached a crossroads. It must either maintain peace or move towards war. From an international perspective, countries are preparing for war very intensely. Once the fuse is lit, a major disaster may erupt at any time. But on the other hand, the call for peace is also endless, because people's minds mostly hate war and love peace.

Italy was originally a militaristic country, and everyone thought so. But now, according to what Mussolini said, Italy also needs peace. The word "peace" from the mouth of a militaristic country is bound to make people suspicious. Mussolini has always adhered to power politics, looking down on the world, and everything he has done has been by force. Last year, he launched a large-scale invasion of Abyssinia, carrying out massacres in East Africa. At that time, the European political situation was almost affected, drawing in a second war. Therefore, Mussolini's words can only be regarded as "diplomatic rhetoric."

However, from another point of view, Italy may need temporary peace at the moment. The ambition to annex Abyssinia has been fulfilled as desired. The urgent task for our country today is to develop resources. Therefore, it cannot be carried out without a peaceful period. This is the reason why Italy needs peace.

To prove this with the example of Japan's attitude towards China, it is recently rumored that the Japanese authorities have decided on a new policy, one of which is: "Although China and Japan are in a stalemate in the political sphere, business relations are surprisingly satisfactory. This can be proven by the fact that Japan's exports to China in the first four months of this year increased by 50% compared with the same period last year. Therefore, the authorities believe that they should prevent the occurrence of new frictions and maintain the current stability of small well-being." Japan's attitude is exactly the same as Italy's need for peace.

It can be seen that the peace in the mouths of militaristic countries is not reliable at all. Their peace is for themselves, not for the world. As soon as there is a new attempt, peace will be destroyed immediately. The reason why the world is restless today is that the recklessness of militaristic countries is the culprit.

"Italy also needs peace." This boast can be said by Mussolini.

### The One Who Leaves the Group

— Fang Hei

A farewell cup of wine is always a moving story.

Groups of wine glasses gathered from all sides, like a hundred birds facing the phoenix, to toast the bitterly smiling loner.

It feels like a kind of intimacy and casualness are lost from now on, and the farewell has become a personal oppression. The playful words that were used to in daily life are taken back before they reach the mouth, so they gradually become impatient with the obstructive etiquette, and all words and deeds become temporary, accommodating, and not straightforward. Passing a lit match is often received only after burning a finger, and when pouring wine, you have to stand up with a bend in your waist, with an awkward smile on your face, before you can sit down with peace of mind.

But there are also straightforward and cheerful people. They are affectionate and mischievous, gulping down the wine, in order to shift the depressing atmosphere of the banquet. And in their secret hearts, they always harbor regret and anger for such an unfortunate farewell.

This is a resolute friend who joined our group only about a year ago. I remember that because of the fraud in the student union election, he actually stood up and exposed everything. In this vast group, he gradually became noticed.

At first, when we met on the road, we nodded to each other perfunctorily and walked away. However, a sudden opportunity brought us together. We started cutting red and green paper strips, started writing the same slogans, and started approaching ink and mimeograph machines. Because we knew that we wanted to be masters of our own land.

He was doing enthusiastic work, but he was always a silent person. He didn't talk much to people, but he often used stern eyes to supervise the diligence and laziness of each worker.

Among a group of young people, there are always female embellishments, and because of the coordination in work, ambiguous phenomena have occurred. He was unwilling to take care of trivial matters, but he was harsh on these people. Not hesitating to damage personal affection, he would rebuke them in front of everyone and utter vicious curses. And his reasons were not given, and he buried his head again to continue his work.

In this way, he led a group under the same banner, shouting the same slogans, and singing the same songs. He received everyone's respect, encouragement, and comfort. But now, in this vast group, he has lost his foothold. He is being expelled, and his student status is lightly crossed out with a pen.

Tomorrow he will have a world of seawater. His destination is a remote village. There he plans to bury himself for a while.

Now, sitting in front of the banquet, his face is flushed, and the heavy smell of alcohol is spewing out of his breath, as if there is some depression, and as if he is maintaining stubbornness.

He also exchanges conversations with others. He wants to tell, he wants to resent, but except for himself, he forgives everyone. Slaves should rise up and bear all the ambitions, all the hardships, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. He does not approve of those secretive deeds and should be the master of their own land. He complains about his own hesitation, complacency, and procrastination.

But he was arranged at the farewell banquet, forced to be pushed out of this circle. Tomorrow is the continuation of today, but tomorrow and the days after tomorrow are vastly different from today. Thinking of this dark wine, it will always be a moving story.

He took a hard sip of the wine, swallowing it into his stomach cup by cup. The wine flushed his face, the red patch extending to the roots of his ears, and even the sclera of his eyes was densely covered with red threads. His voice became hoarse, and he couldn't speak clearly between his teeth, and it was hard to hear, but those were guessable.

He was drunk.

He shouted, exploding every heart.

Grinding his molars, clenching his fists, but his eyes suddenly widened, like crazy. He jumped up from the support of others, patted his chest, and shouted frantically, uttering terrible curses. He grinned and laughed for a while, but then suddenly howled and cried.

On the table, the harsh plates and dishes were cleared away.

Everyone secretly felt that this farewell dinner was not over yet.

Because they believe that the one who leaves the group will always have a day to return.

### Rain

— Zou Heng

The heart, as calm as a lake, was stirred by the footsteps of the rain, causing slight ripples.

Pulling open the window screen, the mind is willing to embrace the green rainwater and kiss it, but separated by a layer of glass, and it is also dusk, in order to avoid disturbing its beautiful sound, so the lights were extinguished, and I listened quietly:

"Drip-drop, drip-drop..."

The courtyard is a dreamlike silence, I can't bear to leave the window, I teach the walking alarm clock to stop its steps, this world, in addition to silence, is willing to hear a little sound of music is drip-drop, drip-drop...

A wisp of light wind floated in from the window seam, it taught my loose hair to float slightly, it seemed to say to me: Child, it is late at night, it is time to sleep.

I asked silently with a pious heart:

"Have these stars of raindrops, and those pieces of east wind, ever flown over my hometown? Have they ever seen my mother with her white hair disheveled, also wandering in front of that ancient window on this early summer rainy night, thinking of her son who has wandered to the distant place?"

I shed tears sadly, it has been three years, the mother in my hometown, she has a lonely heart, hoping that her son who has drifted to the south will return...

The night outside the window is thicker with the sound of the rain.
