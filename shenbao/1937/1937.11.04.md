### Important Pivot for World Peace: Nine-Power Treaty Conference Officially Opens

Representatives from Nineteen Nations of Europe, America, and Asia Attend, Devising Sound Strategies to Jointly Mediate the Sino-Japanese War

⊙Brussels The Nine-Power Treaty Conference officially opened this morning at 11 o'clock before nineteen world statesmen. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak announced the opening, delivering a brief opening address, welcoming the attending representatives, and stating the reasons for convening the conference. Spaak was then elected chairman. The venue was set in the Marble Hall of the Duke of Orange's palace, arranged neatly and solemnly. The walls were hung with large Belgian masterpieces. A large table was placed in the center, covered with felt, and surrounded by red velvet chairs. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

⊙Brussels The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was attended by a total of nineteen countries. The list is as follows: ㊀ The original eight signatory countries: China, the United States, Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal; ㊁ Five British dominions and territories: Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and India; ㊂ Five countries that signed on afterward: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Bolivia, and Mexico; ㊃ One non-signatory country: the Soviet Union. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 3rd)

⊙Brussels The United States, Britain, and France today advocated for international action at the first meeting of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to eliminate the Sino-Japanese War. U.S. Chief Delegate Davis spoke before the delegations of the eighteen participating nations, offering the complete cooperation of the United States to resolve the Far Eastern conflict, and appealing to the conference to give the Far Eastern situation a "fair adjustment," believing that this move is related to the safety of the world. British Foreign Secretary Eden responded, saying, "Britain completely agrees with every word of Mr. Davis. The Far Eastern situation has a significant relationship with all countries. A single spark can start a prairie fire. We gather here as the most relevant countries to jointly discuss peaceful solutions. Even if Japan does not participate, we cannot slacken our efforts." French Foreign Minister Delbos followed, emphasizing that treaties must not be violated, and that the meaning of the Nine-Power Treaty is especially important, saying, "We deeply believe that adhering to the treaty as a basis will surely achieve a peaceful solution." Italian representative Macurdy then spoke, with an undertone of harboring different intentions, saying that this conference can only invite China and Japan to attend, and cannot "isolate" Japan, nor can it take coercive measures directly or indirectly. These were the main points of the representatives' statements. In addition, U.S. representative Davis also warned those who strive for economic self-sufficiency, saying that such a policy will abandon the benefits of international trade and financial relations, and will create a situation that threatens world peace, saying that the United States is prepared to cooperate with all countries to seek a peaceful solution to the Far Eastern situation. The United States is bound by the Nine-Power Treaty and has no other constraints, but even without such a treaty, the interests of the United States in the Far East cannot be ignored. The current war in the Far East is not only closely related to China and Japan, but also has a serious impact on all countries in the world. Recalling when the Nine-Power Treaty was established, the signatory countries all believed that China would have the ability to strengthen and renew itself. In recent years, China has made great progress, proving that the expectations at the time of the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty were not in vain. We deeply believe that cooperation between China and Japan is most beneficial to both countries, and this cooperation should be developed with the spirit of friendship, fairness, and mutual trust. Therefore, the solution to the Sino-Japanese problem cannot favor one side over the other and must be acceptable to both parties. (National Telegram, 3rd)

⊙Brussels Chairman, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, stated in his opening address, in brief, that world peace should be determined by major countries and their international policies and political ideologies. As for smaller countries, they can only exert their moral strength to contribute to human society. Regarding this responsibility, Belgium has never neglected it. Spaak then listed the negotiations conducted before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the replies from the invited countries, saying, "Germany and Japan have refused to participate in the conference, which is most regrettable in terms of our duties." Spaak also mentioned that Germany's reply stated, "Germany is prepared to take action at any time for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between China and Japan," and specifically revealed this, saying, "Therefore, I hope that Germany's refusal is not absolute. I dare say that Japan's absence from the meeting makes this meeting encounter real difficulties, because only frank explanations can dispel misunderstandings and gain practical benefits. Moreover, this meeting is not regarded by the representatives of the participating countries as an international court, forcing Japan to appear in court and accept conditions that conflict with its dignity and honor. This is what I can assert. What we desire is not to take such measures, but to restore peace and establish justice. We believe that there is no conflict in the world that cannot be resolved through reconciliation, mediation, or arbitration. All wise and upright people in all countries deeply hope that our ideal can be realized. We firmly believe that we will not be disappointed." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 3rd)

### British, American, and French Representatives Still Hope to Appeal to Japan to Repent

Even if Japan Does Not Attend, All Countries Will Not Slacken Their Efforts; Britain and the United States Advocate Complete Agreement, While Italy Alone Speaks Up for Japan

⊙Brussels The Nine-Power Treaty Conference opened at 11:00 this morning and adjourned at 1:00 in the afternoon. It will continue at 4:30 in the afternoon. At that time, Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo will deliver a speech. The characteristic of this conference is that the opinions of the British and American representatives are completely consistent, but Italian representative Macurdy alone advocates dissent. After the opening ceremony, Chairman Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak delivered an opening speech, stating in brief that the Belgian government convened this meeting with no other purpose than to help create peace. The world has already been plunged into turmoil by the tragedy in Spain, and cannot bear to see the painful war in the Far East. Therefore, everyone is panicking and asking each other, "Will the center of the distant flames be the beginning of a universal catastrophe? If this catastrophe is realized, it is like child's play compared to the tragedy of 1914." The refusal of Germany and Japan to participate is particularly worrying for the progress of the conference. Spaak then quoted Germany's reply refusing to participate, saying that he hoped Germany's refusal was not absolute, but was caused by some special circumstances, which could be changed. Germany's reply was very long and important and would be distributed to the representatives. Japan's failure to attend made the conference feel real difficulty, but it was hoped that after further discussion, some misunderstandings could be dispelled. This conference must not be regarded as an international court, summoning Japan to court to explain its actions in China in a state inconsistent with its dignity and honor. Spaak concluded by saying that our goal is to find a way to end the war and restore peace and law and order.

After Spaak finished his speech, he suggested that the plenary meeting should be held publicly, while the committee meeting should be held in private, which was approved by the participants.

Then, U.S. Chief Delegate Davis initiated a general discussion, saying that the difficult problem of Sino-Japanese relations must be resolved on a fair and acceptable basis for all parties. The longer the war lasts, the more difficult a constructive solution will be. The U.S. government's participation in this conference is not bound by anything other than the treaties and principles that have been repeatedly and clearly stated. The U.S. government is prepared to work with other countries to discuss peaceful solutions within the scope of these treaties and principles to end the war in the Far East and restore peace. Hostilities in the Far East have serious implications not only for China and Japan but for the entire world, as the impact of armed conflict is no longer limited to the countries involved. Japan has undergone great changes in recent decades. People in the East and West alike are impressed by the amazing achievements of the Japanese people. China, on the other hand, has also struggled in recent years to cope with important reforms from the old to the new. The world admires its efforts and pays sympathetic attention. Unfortunately, China and Japan have had hostilities that have had a detrimental impact on the world. The United States is now participating in this conference, not hoping to achieve a miraculous achievement, but with the desire to appeal to reason. We clearly advise China and Japan to adopt peaceful means. We believe that Sino-Japanese cooperation is necessary for the interests of both countries and the peace of the world. We are confident that this cooperation must be developed with friendship, fairness, and mutual trust. Then, British Chief Delegate Eden said, "The magnificent and thorough speech just made by Mr. Davis has clarified our work without leaving any room for improvement. I hope to add nothing. I express my deep sympathy with everything that Mr. Davis has said. We cannot help but regret that one of the parties to the dispute is unable to attend. This is a great obstacle to our efforts to create peace, but we will work hard and not slacken our efforts because of this. If someone tells us that our hope of success is very slim, we will never shirk our responsibility to ourselves and to the world. If we are afraid of encountering possible failure, we will not be able to reach the path to success. We hope that the conference will be transformed into a working committee with very little delay and hold on to its work. Eden also said that the maintenance of peace is important to all countries. He went on to say that war is contagious and can spread in all directions. In any event, the inevitable loss of prosperity in one country will have a negative impact on all countries. Since we are countries directly related to the Far East, even without the basis of a treaty, we should discuss together whether we can help the hostilities to end as soon as possible and see the stable state restored as soon as possible, which is a matter of course. However, since there is now a treaty and a moral obligation, we are not indifferent bystanders, but signatories bound by international treaties. Eden concluded by saying that Britain is prepared to offer its fullest cooperation to promote the success of the conference. We should work harder because the business we are engaged in is encountering difficulties."

French Chief Delegate Delbos then rose to speak, saying that the urgent responsibility at present is to end the conflict in the Far East. No one can be unmoved by the accumulating cruelty in the Far East. If we do not try to stop the inhuman and irrational massacre, we are directly complicit. Since we are all committed to safeguarding the laws and regulations on which civilization depends, we bear the responsibility of unity and justice.

Italian Chief Delegate Macurdy claimed that Italy must have some reservations, that is, what this conference should do is to bring the two sides closer, and only then can the conference be successful. However, no matter how peaceful the method used, if it does not take into account the reality of the situation, then this conference will only be buried in empty resolutions and become a new proof of ineffectiveness.

### If the Conference Fails, It Will Be Handled by the League of Nations

At that time, a Certain Article of the Covenant May Be Implemented; Representatives of Various Countries are Busy Contacting Before the Conference

⊙Brussels Well-informed sources here recently declared that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will immediately mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. If this effort fails, the application previously submitted by China to the League of Nations will still be handled by the League of Nations. At that time, it is not impossible to implement certain clauses of the Covenant to deal with the aggressor. In certain aspects of diplomatic circles, it is intended to issue an invitation to Japan again, asking it to reconsider whether to participate in the conference. U.S. Chief Delegate Davis was heard to have mentioned this matter when he spoke with Chinese Chief Delegate Wellington Koo yesterday. The U.S. delegation is even considering organizing a committee, with the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty (except China) as members, to invite Japan again to send representatives to participate. In short, the delegations of the countries concerned have agreed that the purpose of this conference must be mediation. Some have said that Britain and the United States will take the lead. On the Chinese delegation side, it was said that Dr. Wellington Koo met with Soviet Chief Delegate Litvinov yesterday and agreed that all procedural issues could be discussed at length, but all resolutions must be based on existing treaties before they could be accepted. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 3rd)

⊙Brussels This conference has not formulated a rigorous and unchangeable procedure. The first step is to find out whether Japan is willing to communicate with the conference and whether it can declare under what conditions it is willing to cease hostilities, and to ask the Chinese government under what conditions it is willing to discuss reconciliation. Only after the above prerequisites are established can the opportunity for a solution be estimated. According to sources from Japan, the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs inquired with the Japanese embassy yesterday whether it was willing to send observers to the conference. It is said that the Japanese ambassador has replied that he does not advocate any contact with the conference. It is also heard that the Italian representative also visited the Japanese ambassador last night for a long talk. At the same time, the Japanese side denied the rumors here, saying that Japan is willing to consider British and American mediation. Chinese representative Wellington Koo gave a broadcast speech last night, saying that the main fact of the current situation is that the Nine-Power Treaty has been violated by Japan, and this matter not only involves China alone, but is closely related to other signatory countries. On the eve of the opening of the conference, everyone's eyes were focused on U.S. Representative Davis. Since arriving in this capital, Davis has been in contact with various delegations, running around busily in an attempt to draft a plan, but so far all parties have denied that any concrete plan has been established. However, representatives of certain countries said that this conference will exchange opinions as much as possible and then adjourn, handing over the mediation duties to certain countries. However, if the conference cannot decide on a method of ceasefire between China and Japan, then at least it will be able to issue a declaration, reaffirming the dignity of the treaty and condemning the act of aggression. Although this declaration may not have a substantial effect, at least it can morally record the attitude of the participating countries against Japanese military actions. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

⊙Brussels British Foreign Secretary Eden held talks with U.S. Chief Delegate Davis at 11:30 this morning. Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Moffett, both counselors of the U.S. delegation, were also present. The British and American representatives had lunch together at noon and continued their talks until 3:00 in the afternoon. Eden then went to meet with Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, while Davis held talks with Chinese Chief Delegate Wellington Koo. Koo also visited French Foreign Minister Delbos. At 5:00 in the afternoon, Spaak, Eden, Delbos, and Davis held an informal meeting. It is reported that the results of the meeting have proved that the opinions of the four countries' representatives are completely consistent, and future actions will also be consistent. In addition, although the Belgian cabinet crisis has not yet been resolved, it is heard that Spaak has agreed to the request of the representatives of Britain, France, and the United States to serve as chairman of the conference. In any case, Spaak will host the opening ceremony tomorrow as the host, delivering a welcome speech to the representatives of all countries, followed by speeches by Eden, Delbos, and Davis. It is estimated that Chinese Chief Delegate Wellington Koo will also speak after them. In short, the entire time of tomorrow's meeting will be spent by representatives of all countries giving speeches, and at the next meeting, all documents of the meeting will be used to study the views of China and Japan.

### Britain Decides to Protect Concession Security with Force

British Public Organizations Write to Foreign Secretary to Prevent Interference with Concession Authority; British Territories Agree

[London] Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha answered a question from Communist MP Gallacher in the House of Commons today, saying that the British government's policy has not changed, and there is no favoritism towards Chinese or Japanese troops. The government's orders, wherever they relate to the safety of British soldiers, whether it be Chinese or Japanese troops, are treated the same without distinction. In short, whenever British soldiers are attacked, they will rise up to defend themselves. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 1st)

[London] When the House of Commons met today, Liberal MP Colonel Nathanial asked the government whether the Empire had consulted with the various dominions regarding its attitude towards the Sino-Japanese conflict. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne replied, "Regarding the Far Eastern situation, especially the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the government has exchanged views with the governments of Canada, New Zealand, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Union of South Africa. Since all dominions have sent representatives to attend the conference, the British delegation will maintain close contact with these representatives." In short, the British attitude towards the Far Eastern situation is decided after consulting with the various dominions. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 1st)

[London] In order to protect the interests of British merchants in China, the Federation of British Industries, together with the China Association, the Chambers of Commerce of London, Manchester, and Bradford, held a joint meeting in September this year and decided to establish a mixed committee to pay attention to the Far Eastern situation and study measures to protect the interests of British merchants in China at any time. The mixed committee is extremely uneasy because Japan "continues to encroach" on the authority of the Shanghai Municipal Council. It wrote to Foreign Secretary Eden today, listing the interference of Japan with the agencies of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and proposed that the matter be submitted to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference for discussion so that the countries concerned could establish a common policy for the Shanghai International Settlement and prevent either China or Japan from profiting from it at the end of the war. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 2nd)

Another letter stated that at the time of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the opportunity should be used to discuss with the representatives of the countries concerned what principles should be used as the basis for determining compensation for losses suffered in the Sino-Japanese War. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

[London] President of the Board of Trade Stanley answered a question from Communist MP Gallacher in the House of Commons today, saying that since the Japanese army attacked Shanghai, the losses suffered by British commerce in and around the Shanghai area cannot be estimated from the current reports. Stanley also answered a question from Labour MP Alexander, saying that according to the monthly trade statistics, trade with China has obviously declined, and the Foreign Office is collecting claims for compensation for losses in Shanghai, but this information is not yet public. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### League of Nations Advisory Committee Meeting Postponed

Chinese Representative Suggests That It Should Not Exceed the 21st

[Geneva] The League of Nations Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Problems was originally scheduled to meet on November 7. However, since the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is opening in Brussels, and there is no need for the Advisory Committee to meet immediately before there are results, the chairman of the Advisory Committee proposed to postpone the meeting and asked the members to submit their suggestions before the end of this week. The members have agreed to the postponement. The Chinese representative suggested that the meeting should not be postponed later than November 21. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

### Eden's Speech

A Clarification from the United States

[Washington] Regarding British Foreign Secretary Eden's statement yesterday that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was initiated by the United States, U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles issued a statement today, saying that this was a misinterpretation by newspaper reporters. According to the original text of the speech, Eden only said that the United States first advocated that Brussels be the location of the conference. (National Telegram, 2nd)

### Full Text of the Nine-Power Treaty

The United States of America, Belgium, the British Empire, the Republic of China, the Republic of France, the Kingdom of Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Portugal, desiring to adopt a policy designed to stabilize conditions in the Far East, to safeguard the rights and interests of China and of all States, and to promote intercourse between China and the said Powers, have resolved to conclude a Treaty for that purpose.

Article 2. The Contracting Powers agree not to enter into any treaty, agreement, arrangement, or understanding, either with one another, or individually or collectively, with any Power or Powers, which would infringe or impair the principles stated in Article 1.

Article 3. With a view to applying more effectually the principle of the open door or equality of opportunity in China for the trade and industry of all nations, the Contracting Powers, other than China, agree that they will not seek, nor support their respective nationals in seeking:

㊀ Any arrangement which might purport to establish in favor of their interests any general superiority of rights with respect to commercial or economic development in any designated region of China;

㊁ Any such monopoly or preference as would deprive the nationals of any other Power of the right of undertaking any legitimate trade or industry in China, or of participating with the Chinese Government, or with any local authority, in any category of public enterprise, or which by reason of its scope, duration or geographical extent is calculated to frustrate the practical application of the principle of equal opportunity.

It is understood that the foregoing stipulations of this Article are not to be so construed as to prohibit the acquisition of such properties or rights as may be necessary to the conduct of a particular commercial, industrial, or financial undertaking or to the encouragement of invention and research. China undertakes to be guided by the principles above enumerated in dealing with applications for economic rights and privileges from governments and nationals of all foreign countries, whether parties to the Treaty or not.

To this end the Government of the United States will make the necessary communications to non-signatory Powers and will inform the Contracting Powers of the replies received.

### Enemy Forces on the Suzhou Creek Are About to Be Completely Annihilated

The remaining enemies are expected to be completely eliminated soon. Our troops in the southeast of Nanxiang have recovered Zhuyuan. Advances of one kilometer have also been made in the Guangfu area.

Enemy forces along the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, from Chenjiadu in the east to the east bank of Shenjibin in the west, have been attempting to forcibly cross the Suzhou Creek to the south bank since October 30th. There have been more than a dozen attempts, with the most intense activity occurring over the past two days (December 2nd and 3rd). In total, more than a thousand enemy soldiers have attempted to cross, using Zhoujiaqiao Town, Chenjiadu, Majiazhai, and Houjiadai as their crossing points. At dawn on the 1st, they attacked our positions at Liujiazhai, Beixinjing, Qujiaqiao, Wujiaku Tingtou, Yaojiazhai, etc., on the south bank, using artillery fire and smoke screens to obscure their targets. However, our troops on the south bank were well-prepared and did not hesitate due to the smoke screen. They immediately deployed troops to block and attack, and the enemies at Majiazhai, Houjiadai, Zhoujiaqiao Town, and Chenjiadu were quickly wiped out by our forces. Many enemy soldiers drowned in the river, and our troops captured a large number of enemy weapons. However, the enemy's ambition was not extinguished, and they returned around 4 a.m. on the 2nd. Our troops were incredibly brave and continued to fight, causing the enemy to suffer more losses and retreat. Seeing no opportunity to exploit and knowing it was difficult to attack again, the enemy moved their heavy forces to the intersection of the Suzhou Creek on the east bank of Shenjibin yesterday morning, launching a fierce attack on Yaojiazhai, while a small unit harassed our Tingtou and Wujiaku positions on the south bank from the area between the Suzhou Creek and Xibin. Approximately 400 enemy soldiers managed to cross at Yaojiazhai. Our troops saw through their plan and waited patiently, launching a three-pronged attack when the enemy reached the south bank and had not yet established a firm foothold. Many enemy soldiers were caught off guard and annihilated by our forces. At the same time, our troops at Wujiaku and Tingtou also launched a counterattack on the south bank, jointly encircling and suppressing the enemy. The enemy also desperately sent reinforcements, and the artillery fire from both sides was unprecedented. However, thanks to the bravery of our troops, the enemy was trapped in a three-sided encirclement. The enemy suffered heavy losses and quickly collapsed and retreated, but had already suffered countless casualties. As of midnight, only 200 to 300 remnants of the enemy remained in that area, and they are being fiercely attacked by our troops. The enemy in all other locations has been completely eliminated. Our troops are calmly defending the south bank. Only in the Liujiazhai area, across the river from Chenjiadu, are there still 40 to 50 remaining enemy soldiers who have been cut off and are resisting stubbornly inside nearby Western-style houses. However, they have been surrounded by our troops and are being wiped out, which is no longer a problem. Our rear artillery fire is densely bombarding the enemy positions opposite Liujiazhai, Tingtou, and Yaojiazhai, and has continued throughout the night. The enemy is in a dire situation, suffering heavy casualties and on the verge of collapse. In addition, our central route from Xiaonanxiang to Guangfu Town saw the enemy launch a fierce attack on our position at Qiujiazhai, east of Xiaonanxiang, yesterday, but they were ultimately repelled by our forces. At the same time, Zhuyuan, between Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao, has been recovered by our troops, and because of the close connection established, it gives our army an extreme advantage in military terms. In the Guangfu Town area, our scouting teams advanced one kilometer to the east, approaching Xinmuqiao. Our main force will then move in to observe the enemy forces in that area, which appear to have largely moved south, focusing on attacking the Suzhou Creek. However, this further shows that the invading enemy forces in Shanghai are moving east to compensate for the west, making coordination difficult.

### Enemy Crossing the River Dealt With Separately by Our Forces

Enemy troops surrender weapons in two locations.

A reporter from the Central News Agency with the army reported at 12:00 AM on the 3rd that enemy remnants are scattered in foreign houses from the Hopeland Road intersection to Beixinjing along the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. Our division is searching and advancing and has surrounded them separately. The number of enemy soldiers is not large, and their forces are weak. Moreover, their communication has been lost, so they are not worth worrying about. Our army has ordered them to surrender their weapons to be spared from death. In two locations, they have already abandoned their weapons and surrendered. We confiscated more than ten rifles, one light machine gun, and one pistol. The stubborn ones will be severely punished and are currently being besieged.

Two Attempted Crossings Repelled

A reporter from the Central News Agency with the army reported at 9:45 PM on the 3rd that at Majiazhai on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, directly opposite our position at Beixinjing on the south bank, a unit of enemy soldiers was preparing to cross the river at 2:00 PM today. Our army discovered this and concentrated mortar fire on them, with many hits. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated. Also, in the morning, the enemy attempted to cross the river at Zhoujiaqiao but was also repelled by our forces. Therefore, today, east of Beixinjing, except for a few remaining enemy soldiers near Liujiazhai, there are no traces of the enemy in other places.

Enemy at Liujiazhai to be Eliminated Soon

A reporter from the Central News Agency with the army reported at 9:45 PM on the 3rd that after our army surrounded and suppressed the enemy forces that had crossed the river at Liujiazhai on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, all the enemy forces along the coast had been eliminated. However, there are still about a hundred remaining enemy soldiers who retreated northwest and are hiding in foreign houses. Their retreat route has been cut off, and they cannot be reinforced because they are under our close surveillance. They have become turtles in a jar, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them completely. A reporter from the Central News Agency with the army reported at 12:50 PM on the 3rd that the remaining enemy forces in the Liujiazhai area on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek are still entrenched in the foreign houses along the west coast. Our army bombarded part of them with artillery yesterday. Today, we switched to using direct-fire artillery to destroy their walls, and the infantry also heavily surrounded them, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

We Have Recaptured the Western Part of Tingtou

According to military news, the enemy troops recently crossed the Suzhou Creek in a sneak attack, advancing on Wujiaku, Tingtou, Yaojiazhai, Caijiazhai and other places. After our encirclement and suppression, more than one hundred enemy soldiers remained, hiding in the Tingtou village, fighting while exhausted. The day before yesterday, another approximately one thousand enemy troops, under the cover of artillery fire, crossed the river forcibly on flat-bottomed civilian boats, landing along the coast of Wujiaku, attempting to connect with the enemy forces in Tingtou. To eradicate the enemy's forces on the south bank, our army advanced eastward from the Yaojiazhai area, and the soldiers fought bravely, advancing without retreat. They rushed into the Tingtou village and engaged in street fighting with the enemy, climbing over walls and crossing through houses, displaying extraordinary bravery. The enemy troops retreated steadily, defending the eastern half of the village and confronting us.

Our Three-Pronged Attack on the Enemy at Wujiaku

A reporter from the Central News Agency with the army reported at 12:50 PM on the 3rd that although the enemy forces at Wujiaku on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek had been intercepted and killed by our troops, yesterday the enemy continued to use smoke screens to cross the river and reinforce their positions, numbering approximately seven hundred. They were densely concentrated in one area, building fortifications and laying barbed wire around the perimeter, attempting to establish a base for attacking southward. To eradicate the enemy's forces, our army launched a heavy artillery bombardment at 4:00 PM yesterday (December 2nd), with many hits. Then, we dispatched troops to attack in three directions. By 8:00 PM, the fighting was at its fiercest. Although the enemy was stubborn, our soldiers were determined to die, advancing wave after wave. By around 10:00 PM, they had approached Wujiaku, with the closest point being only thirty to forty meters away. The fierce fighting continued all night, and as of this morning, the enemy is still surrounded by our troops. Many enemy soldiers have been killed, but our side has also suffered considerable casualties. A certain regimental commander personally commanded the front line and was unfortunately hit by artillery fire and died for his country. Two other regimental commanders were also wounded on the front line, demonstrating the intensity of the fighting at that time. This morning (December 3rd) at 10:00 AM, the enemy, under the cover of airplanes and artillery, attempted to launch another attack. Our army has dispatched a large force to block them.

### Our Troops in the Southeast of Nanxiang Recapture Zhuyuan

Fierce fighting occurred near Tuditang. The enemy was repelled and we are awaiting an opportunity to counterattack.

According to military news, our troops in the southeast of Nanxiang launched a counterattack against the enemy on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, defeating the enemy forces entrenched in the Zhuyuan area and recovering the area. This is of great importance to the connection between our troops in Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao Town.

It is said that the Committee has also made the same request to the enemy side.

### Shortening of Study Periods at Japanese Military Schools

Tokyo Rumors Rampant, Hearts Uneasy

[Nanjing] According to a certain foreigner who came to China from Tokyo, the Sino-Japanese war has been prolonged, and the casualties among Japanese military officers are quite heavy. The Japanese military authorities, deeply worried about the inadequacy of reserves, have uniformly shortened the study periods at various military schools. For example, the officer candidate school, which had already been shortened by two to four months, is now further shortened by two to eight months. The preparatory course for the management school, which had already been shortened by four months, has recently been changed to a reduction of four months to one year. The undergraduate course has also been shortened by two to five months. The Japanese military also, due to the insufficient number of military doctors at the front, recently issued a new ordinance requiring reserve army medical personnel, stipulating that all medical officers who are called up for service shall be assigned to the rank of lieutenant in the medical corps. The aforementioned foreigner also stated that the Japanese people are now suffering unspeakable hardships under the high pressure of the military authorities, and are liable to violate military law at any time. According to a Tokyo broadcast report, there have been fourteen cases of violations of the Military Secrets Protection Law since the outbreak of the incident.

### China's Development of National Consciousness Has Limitless Prospects

French Historian Comments on the Far East War - China Will Surely Win the Final Victory

[Paris] Mr. Guyot, a professor at the University of Paris and a renowned historian, recently published an article in the "Capital Weekly," stating in brief: The current struggle in the Far East cannot be judged solely by the military strength of China and Japan. China has a population of 400 million. If it can fully develop its national consciousness, even if it can currently gain victory, its future is truly immeasurable. China's recent progress has already been very great. After being forged by iron and fire, if its national consciousness becomes even more developed and strong, then even if Japan occupies Peiping, Zhangjiakou, and part of Shanghai, and establishes buffer states in the provinces of North China and Inner Mongolia, similar to what it has done in Manchuria, the final result will not be Japan absorbing China, but China absorbing Japan. Throughout history, there have been countless instances of foreign races invading China and being assimilated by China. Conversely, if China internally splits again after the end of the war, then Japan will not only be able to maintain its vested interests, but will also be able to control everything in China, just as a small number of British people did in the vast territory of India in the past. This is definitely not a blessing for China. Guyot continued, "Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, created the Three Principles of the People, and advocated equal land ownership and the control of capital. Since 1925, the prestige of the Kuomintang has increased day by day, and the people's patriotic spirit has been stimulated. The transformation of China into a modern nation is all due to the power of the Kuomintang. For this reason, Japan believes that if it does not act at this time, it will have no opportunity in the future. With regard to the current war, the bravery and heroism of the Chinese National Army in resisting the war near Shanghai has been admired by the whole world, and the barbarity of the Japanese army's methods of warfare and its brutal massacre of civilians has aroused international indignation, and the impact has caused the world to take notice. It is entirely possible that what was once regarded as a miracle will become a reality." (Havas dispatch of the 2nd from the Central News Agency)

### Chen Jitang Donates Funds to Resist the Enemy

At the same time, domestic people's organizations also telegraphed him to return. At that time, Chen was in Italy. Since his anti-Japanese stance for many years had finally been realized, he immediately telegraphed the Central Government, generously donating 7 million Hong Kong dollars to support the war effort against Japan. The funds were directly remitted to the Central Government by the Bank of China on October 24th. It is reported that the Central Government

### Enemy Warships Invade and Occupy Kinmen

All Villages on the Island Are Burned and Looted, Strong Men and Women Are Massacred, Enemy Warships and Planes Also Harass Tan and Quanzhou

Xiamen Communication: Kinmen County is an island east of Xiamen, about thirty miles away. On October 26th, it was suddenly invaded and occupied by enemy warships. On October 28th, enemy warships again advanced and occupied Lieyu Island, west of Kinmen, approaching the port of Xiamen. On the same day, they also attacked Weitou Port, which belongs to Quanzhou. It was discovered that after the enemy warships attacked Xiamen and Yongning Town, which belongs to Quanzhou, on September 14th, there was not much action. After October 17th, two enemy destroyers stationed outside the port of Xiamen, close to Kinmen, spent a week using speedboats to survey the harbors along the coast of Kinmen. On October 24th, two enemy speedboats suddenly entered Houzhupu Port and headed straight for the coast. At that time, the Jinxing Small Wheel was docked at the Tongan Ferry Terminal, preparing to open to Xiamen. When the passengers saw this, they all went ashore immediately. The enemy boats still rushed to Jinxing, attempting to land at An Ferry Station. The county security police and militia on the shore ambushed on the side of the dock bridge and opened fire to fight back. An enemy sailor, holding a punting pole, stood at the bow of the boat and fell into the cabin in response. The punting pole fell into the water. The enemy boat immediately opened fire with machine guns. After more than ten minutes of mutual fighting, the enemy retreated. Only one of our militiamen had two fingers broken due to excessive firing causing the gun barrel to explode. On October 25th, nine more enemy warships suddenly arrived, bringing the total to eleven, including two cruisers, one small aircraft carrier, six destroyers, and two transport ships. On the morning of October 26th, at about 4:00 AM, the enemy first used eight warships to bombard the coast of Kinmen, firing more than forty rounds in total for more than an hour. At the same time, they also bombarded the port of Xiamen. Our Xiamen port fortress artillery also fired at the enemy warships to provide remote support to Kinmen. After dawn, three enemy destroyers sailed into Houzhupu Port and opened fire on the shore. At the same time, two enemy light bombers flew low along the coast, bombing to cover eight large enemy speedboats carrying about three hundred enemy marines, advancing in two directions, mostly towards the Tongan Ferry Terminal in Houpu, and a small part towards Qianmian (place name), using machine guns to sweep and force a landing. Kinmen originally had no regular troops stationed there, only the county government's security police force of less than a hundred people and two companies of civilian militia, about a hundred people, armed only with rifles, mostly old-fashioned. However, they still resisted bravely and fought fiercely for more than an hour. In the end, due to the disparity in numbers and equipment, and under the combined attack of our sea and air forces, they could not hold out. The enemy first landed in front and the security team retreated first. The militiamen still fought in blood, but in the end, they also could not hold out and retreated. The enemy in Houzhupu Port also landed, with a total of 400 people. They planted the Japanese flag at the Tongan Ferry Terminal and occupied the county government, setting up a marine corps battalion headquarters, opening the prison and releasing the criminals, and issuing absurd announcements and leaflets. Kinmen then reported its fall. In this battle, the militiamen resisted the most fiercely, and more than twenty were killed in battle. County Magistrate Kuang Han led all the personnel of the county government on the Jinxing Wheel, which had been prepared, and retreated to Kinmen, and moved his office to Dadeng Island. Because the militiamen resisted strongly, the enemy hated them to the bone. In the afternoon, they searched and robbed Houpu City and the nearby villages of Houpu, Gugeng, and Shuitou, looting the people's gold and silver jewelry, rice, flour, and kerosene. Militiamen who were caught were shot. Five or six people died. More than ten Taiwanese people, such as doctors and photographers who had worked in Kinmen, were used as guides, so they were very familiar with the geography and personnel of the places they went. The enemy landed in Kinmen between 9:00 AM and 10:40 AM on the 26th. A light bomber flew three times over the northern part of Xiamen Island, dropping a total of six bombs in the fortress area. Our anti-aircraft machine guns fired fiercely, and they did not dare to fly low. The targets were inaccurate and all fell in the wild, only injuring a grass-cutting woman, breaking her right leg, and dying soon after. The city issued three alarms. The people were unusually calm and the order was excellent. At 5:00 PM, three enemy planes reconnoitered Wutong in the northern part of Xiamen Island and Aotou in Tongan across the sea, and then left. The enemy in Kinmen began searching and looting the four villages on the 27th, still using Taiwanese people as guides. In addition to looting, they searched for military equipment very strictly. Militiamen who were caught were first subjected to torture to force them to confess where the guns were hidden, but whether they confessed or not, they were shot. Women and young people were mostly taken away and raped. In the morning, they searched and looted Qionglin Village, and in the afternoon, they searched and looted Panshan Village, and so on. Every time they arrived at a village, they first sent bombers to fly and show their power, and then rushed in with machine guns, so they fell wherever they went. Both parts of Jin Island were occupied. Some of the militiamen retreated to the villages of Xiyuan and Shawei in this part and defended them. The people also helped the old and the young and retreated north with the militiamen. On the 28th, the enemy continued to advance north. The militiamen had very few weapons, and even if they had one or two, they were old rifles. Still, they fell wherever they went. On the 26th and 27th, thousands of refugees fled by sea to Xiamen, and three or four thousand fled to Tongan across the sea. Xiamen and Tongan are separated from Kinmen by a narrow stretch of water, only twenty miles away. The price of a boat reached fifty yuan, and the cost per person reached two yuan. On the 28th, sailing ships were also not easy to travel, and very few escaped. Kinmen fellow villagers in Xiamen formed a rescue team. On that day, they sent personnel to Kinmen to find ways to help the refugees escape danger. By the 29th, the northern villages had almost all fallen into enemy hands. Militiamen and those suspected of being militiamen were shot. If they were not militiamen, they were detained, and women were taken away in even greater numbers. On the morning of the 28th, at 9:00 AM, the enemy again occupied Lieyu Island, west of Kinmen Island, belonging to Kinmen County, close to the port of Xiamen. They also shelled it with four cannons from three enemy warships, followed by two enemy planes flying low to threaten it, covering eight speedboats dragging sampans carrying 200 enemy marines, landing at Nancuo. Two spies, Taiwanese brothers Fa Dashan and Xu Ting, were used as guides, and planes flying low a few feet above the ground were used as vanguards, followed by Donglin, Xifang and other villages, searching, killing, and occupying, just like in Kinmen. When they attacked Lieyu, they also used four warships to bombard the Baishen Fortress in Xiamen twice, firing a total of seven rounds, all of which fell into the water at a distance. This was also done to cover the attack on Lieyu. On that day, more than 300 refugees from Lieyu fled to Xiamen.

At 5:00 PM on the 28th, two enemy warships sailed from Kinmen to Weitou Port in Quanzhou, north of Jin Island, firing on Weitou Tangdong, and using two planes to sweep low, covering more than ten speedboats carrying array battle teams to attack, attempting to land. Our defending troops and militia teams immediately greeted them and fought fiercely for more than an hour. The enemy fired dozens of rounds of artillery, and retreated at about 6:00 PM. We only injured nine militiamen. Weitou is located in Jinmen County, one mile from the coastal side of the south gate of Quanzhou, also known as Weitoujiao. It is a point where Jin, Xiamen, and Tongan meet, and is on the Shanghai-Hong Kong route. The location is extremely important. After the enemy occupied Kinmen and Lieyu, they dug wells in Kinmen to get water, transported cooking utensils and cars to the shore, and frequently used planes to conduct reconnaissance on the coasts of Xiamen Island, Siming, Haicheng, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou. On the 29th, enemy planes frequently passed over Xiamen City, issuing four alarms. At 11:00 AM that afternoon, an enemy plane flew to the Songqi Erlu Diagram and bombed the Jiangdong Bridge on the Jiulong River. Because our anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, it dropped four bombs and left. Two small wheels, Tongan and Houchuan, were pursued by enemy planes on the 29th at noon on the way from Xiamen to Tongan and back to Xiamen, flying low and staring closely, and circling around the Tongan Wheel, firing with machine guns. Fortunately, none of the passengers were injured. At 12:00 PM, an enemy plane flew along the coast of Quanzhou, dropping three bombs on the Wuli Bridge between Anhai in Jinjiang County and Shuitou in Nan'an County, only destroying two stone slabs, injuring three civilians. The bridge can still be used. Anhai and Shuitou are located in a low-lying swamp filled with seawater. The bridge is five miles long, and it is used to cross this swamp. It is not a road for cars, but only for pedestrians. It is one of the two major projects in Quanzhou, along with Luoyang Bridge in Hui'an, and it is also a historical site. At 11:00 AM, an enemy plane flew to Dongshi Town, east of Anhai, and dropped two bombs on the wheel wharf, both of which fell in open spaces. At the same time, the enemy also used speedboats from Kinmen to spy on the sea surface between Wutong and Tongan, but did not dare to get close. Wutong and Aotou are located at the northern entrance of the port of Xiamen. The Quanzhou-Xiamen road crosses the sea here.

According to continuing reports, eight more enemy warships arrived in Kinmen on the 29th, bringing the total to 31. The number of enemy soldiers who landed reached more than a thousand, but only 400 were regular marines. The rest were pseudo-troops organized by Taiwanese vagrants who had withdrawn from Xiamen and southern Fujian, led by Taiwanese Wu Tianshou (Wu was originally a photographer in Kinmen). A false command headquarters was established in the Houpu City Yuan Yiyong Zhuangding team. There were four or five hundred pseudo-troops stationed there. Pseudo-sub-team headquarters were set up in Qionglin and Shawei, each stationed with more than a hundred people. Eleven Taiwanese people, who used to be Western doctors, dentists, and photographers in Kinmen, and Han traitors Xu Tingfang, Chen Yongkang, Wu Haishui, Xu Du, Hong Qingchi, Hong Dashan, and others, were important figures. By the 29th, the entire Kinmen Island had fallen into enemy hands. On the 28th and 29th, the enemy continued to loot, rape, and kill even more fiercely. For example, the three wives of Chi Township were raped to death, two wives in Shuitou were gang-raped for several hours before being released, a foster daughter of Xu Gang in Houpu was raped, and when she refused, she was killed. Two other young girls were stripped naked and gang-raped, the 18-year-old daughter of a teacher surnamed Zhang in Shuitou was raped, and when she refused, she fought back and scolded the bandits, and was disemboweled and killed. An old deaf woman was also killed. The bandits searched the villages in teams of more than ten people, and no household was spared. Gold and silver ornaments, guns, and flashlights were all looted, and women were all ravaged. Many young people were tied up and taken to enemy warships. Stores and homes were not allowed to close at night, and the bandits broke in at any time. It was almost entirely a tragic hell. On the 29th, the Xiamen Fellow Villagers Relief Team chartered ships to try to rescue the refugees who escaped to Xiamen and Tongan by sea. It is estimated that from the 26th to the 29th, more than 8,000 refugees escaped, and more than 30,000 remained in Kinmen. Although Kinmen is a small place, many of its people live in Nanyang, about 30,000, and only their families remain registered. Therefore, the population of Kinmen is mostly women. On the 29th, Kinmen overseas Chinese in Singapore telegraphed 5,000 yuan to Xiamen, instructing them to provide relief and continue to evacuate people. However, the enemy in Kinmen is now prohibiting people from escaping, searching house to house, and ordering the militiamen who have escaped to be arrested and returned. The 300 people who occupied Lieyu on the morning of the 28th returned to the enemy warship that night. They did not land again on the 29th, but the enemy warship was still parked next to Lieyu. Also, Kinmen County Magistrate Kuang Han arrived in Zhangzhou on the 28th and will be detained and investigated for fleeing to Dadeng before the enemy landed.

Kinmen Island is isolated in the sea, looking east to Taiwan, northeast across the Tutou Bay and Jinjiang Nan territory, north and Nan'an Shijing Fan looking at each other, northwest and Tongan looking at each other, west shielding Xiamen, when Xiamen's Hu Li Shan, Bai Shi, Pan Shi, and other fortresses, for the danger of the land, manage Taiwan, Penghu, Xiamen, Zhang Quan, the coast of the pivot, the East China Sea and the South China Sea, that is, by the sea opposite Haicheng Zhenhaijiao division, and Xiamen is even more interdependent. Kinmen has been lost, Xiamen certainly feels a great threat, because it is just the north and south ports of Xiamen, so from the 27th, from Xiamen to the mainland small wheel, except the port to Shi Ma, Zhangzhou, Bai Shu Ying, and Tongan, the port to Xingquan Zhang various parts of the small wheel are suspended, all relying on land transportation, to Shanghai, Fu, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Nanyang sea ships, are foreign merchants, then still normal access, consecutive days of enemy warships, although the threat to Xiamen, but our defense is extremely solid, not the enemy's marines can succeed, a general observation, Kinmen Xiamen from the military, political, economic, transportation, are not affect our overall situation, and not a great impact on the Min province, but Kinmen Xiamen is only two hundred and twenty nautical miles from Hong Kong, warships can reach more than seven hours, the plane is only more than an hour, the enemy occupied Kinmen spy on Xiamen, obviously for Hong Kong's demonstration, the British navy and air force are in Hong Kong from the 25th to the 29th to hold large exercises, the enemy suddenly occupied Kinmen on the 26th, also can think deeply.

### Shanghai Groups Discuss Countermeasures to the Beijing Conference

The Shanghai Professors and Writers Association, the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, the Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff, and other groups, considering that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will have a significant impact on our country's diplomacy, have decided to hold a meeting today (the 4th) at 2:00 PM to discuss countermeasures to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Yesterday, they sent invitations to the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Joint Association of Universities, the Daily Newspaper Association, the Journalists Association, the China Vocational Education Society, the Accountants Association, the Lawyers Association, the Physicians Association, the Joint Associations of Citizens, and others, inviting them to send representatives to participate. It is expected that there will be a great deal of important discussion at that time.

Municipal Farmers' Association, etc.

The Municipal Farmers' Association and two other groups in this city jointly telegraphed the representatives of the countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, requesting them to uphold justice. The original telegram stated: "To Ambassadors Gu, Guo, and Qian, Chinese representatives in Beijing, and to the esteemed representatives of all countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference: Japan has been violating the Nine-Power Treaty for more than six years. This conference, to which you, representatives, are sincerely participating and advocating fairness and upholding peace, is eagerly anticipated by all people who love justice throughout the world. We earnestly request that you, representatives, unanimously advocate the strict implementation of the sacred obligations stipulated in the treaty and the maintenance of past resolutions of the League of Nations. We also request that you immediately adopt collective methods to impose economic sanctions on Japan as an effective deterrent, thereby maintaining world peace. The telegram is urgent and awaits your instructions. Sincerely, The Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, The Joint Association of Shanghai Native Place Associations, and the Shanghai Gongren Society."

Women's Comfort Branch

He Xiangning, Chairperson of the Chinese Women's Comfort Branch, telegraphed the Nine-Power Treaty Conference requesting sanctions against the violent Japanese, stating: "The violent Japanese disregard the Nine-Power Treaty and disrupt peace in the Far East. We pledge to defend the integrity of our territory and sovereignty to the death. We urge your conference to uphold world peace and the sanctity of treaties and to immediately decide to implement economic and military sanctions or other collective punishments against Japan. We will never accept conditions that are humiliating and detrimental to our country. Please quickly stop the violent Japanese aggression in order to maintain world peace."

Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles

The Chinese Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles National Salvation Association, in response to the holding of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, in addition to organizing propaganda teams to lecture to various sectors, also sent telegrams to relevant parties in China and abroad, requesting them to uphold the authority of the treaty, respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity, and prevent the international community from falling into a state of lawlessness.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Order Prohibiting the Use of Enemy Currency

Violators will be Punished for Endangering the Republic of China

The Shanghai Municipal Government issued instructions to its subordinate agencies yesterday, stating: "The following secret telegram from the Ministry of Finance (30 Qian Hu Mi Dai) has been approved: According to a secret report, the enemy forces are experiencing delays in the issuance of public bonds, making it impossible to supply military needs. The Japanese Ministry of Finance has urgently minted new gold coins and issued new banknotes to meet military requirements. These were transported from Dalian on the 3rd of this month at 5:00 AM and distributed by the Bank of Korea in denominations of ten and twenty cents. It has been determined that, in accordance with past practice, banknotes issued by banks not approved by the Central Government shall not be accepted or used. Violators will be severely punished. The Ministry issued an order on August 20th of this year to the Joint Office of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, as well as to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Banking Guild, instructing them to comply with this provision. Given the current situation, all enemy currency of this kind must not be accepted or used if discovered. Violators will be punished for endangering the Republic of China. In addition to issuing telegrams, a special telegram is sent requesting investigation and instructions to subordinates to pay close attention." This has been approved. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is issued for compliance and to instruct subordinates to pay close attention.

### Military Training Personnel Purchase National Salvation Bonds

Landlord and Tenants of Hua'e Fang Make Long-Term Donations, Worthy of Praise

The officers of all levels of the National Military Training Committee and the Social Military Training Corps of this city, recognizing that promoting National Salvation Bonds is the most powerful national salvation movement in the current war of resistance, yesterday launched a campaign to donate salaries to purchase National Salvation Bonds. Within half a day, over three hundred people, from Li Xiangqi, Chairman of the Military Training Committee and Commander of the Social Training Corps, to Tao Yishan, Full-Time Member and Commander of the Police Reserve Corps, as well as all battalion commanders, military training instructors, social training chief instructors, and officers of all levels, unanimously donated one month's salary and submitted it to the Training Headquarters, requesting that it be converted into National Salvation Bonds.

Hua'e Fang

Overseas Chinese citizen Zheng Chongrui, recognizing the severity of the national crisis and the government's launch of a full-scale war of resistance, believes that all Chinese should contribute their wealth for national use. Therefore, he previously sent a letter to the Anti-Enemy Association, stating his willingness to donate all the monthly rental income of over 3,700 yuan from the Hua'e Fang property on Jiujiang Road, owned by his brothers, nephews, and children, along with approximately 20,000 yuan in previously owed rent, to be used as a national salvation donation until the end of the war. This sincere patriotism is truly admirable. However, as the Anti-Enemy Association had already been ordered to cease collecting national salvation donations, he changed his approach and contacted the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Association to discuss purchasing National Salvation Bonds with the proceeds from the property. After the Xingye Trust Company commissioned the First Special Zone Group of the Municipal Citizens Solicitation Corps to assist in this matter, the Group Director, Mr. Lin Kanghou, repeatedly convened all the tenants of Hua'e Fang to convey the landlord's sincere national salvation intentions, hoping that the tenants could jointly support its completion. Now it is understood that the tenants, upholding the principle that every citizen is responsible for the fate of the nation and that renting houses is a normal commercial transaction, have enthusiastically agreed to cooperate. Currently, the methods for transferring the owed rent portion and future monthly rent (until the end of the war) to purchase public bonds are being finalized and will soon be implemented. At a time when the purchase of National Salvation Bonds by the real estate industry has not yet been widely promoted, the landlord and tenants of Hua'e Fang are truly models for the citizens.

Rubber Industry

The National Rubber Products Industry Association of this city had previously subscribed to over 102,000 yuan of National Salvation Bonds. Recently, the association has raised an additional 5,035 yuan from individuals, including Wu Zhesheng (3,000 yuan), Xue Yunlong (1,000 yuan), the Rubber Industry Association (300 yuan), Wei Zhaogeng and Ye Xuxin (200 yuan each), Yu Xuezheng, Yu Xuezhuang, and Yang Shuyin (100 yuan each), and Weng Zupei (35 yuan). This amount was remitted to the general association yesterday. It is also reported that the association will continue to make efforts to solicit further donations.

### British Defense Forces Commander Inspects West Shanghai Defenses

Major General Smurthwaite Visits Caixuan Road

Following the westward shift of the war's focus, the British military defenses in western Shanghai have been strengthened. British troops along Caixuan Road and the Zhaofeng Garden area have been stationed in greater numbers. Major General Smurthwaite, commander of the British Defense Forces in Shanghai, personally visited the Caixuan Road area yesterday afternoon to inspect the defense situation of a unit, spending a considerable amount of time there.

### Cotton Vests

Still Insufficient, Continued Donations Requested

The entire Chinese staff of Reiss & Co. in this city, recognizing the increasingly cold weather and the urgent need for winter clothing for the soldiers on the front lines, yesterday gathered 340 yuan in national currency and sent it to the Shanghai Comfort Committee, requesting that 500 cotton vests be made and forwarded to the front lines for use. This sincere patriotism is truly admirable. Although the cotton vest effort has received enthusiastic donations from all sectors, the need is still great. Continued donations are requested to meet the demand. Furthermore, Chen Ma, a female employee of the Sanshanyuan Candy Store on Yuqiaqing Road, yesterday donated her entire month's salary of five yuan to the Comfort Committee to express her support for the soldiers on the front lines.

### Father Zhao Leads Salvation Army to Songjiang to Rescue Refugees

Since the outbreak of the war of aggression by the Japanese pirates in Shanghai, enemy aircraft have been bombing extensively in the areas of Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo. Songjiang has suffered tremendous damage, and many refugees have been left homeless. It is reported that Father Jacques Combe, a French national, out of his passionate desire to rescue our suffering compatriots, decided to go to Songjiang yesterday with the Salvation Army of various countries to find ways to rescue our Chinese compatriots.

### Refugees in the Yinxiang District Urgently Need Clothing and Bedding for Warmth

The Fellow-Villagers Association of the Distressed in Yinxiang District of this city, recognizing that severe winter is approaching and the weather is getting colder, and that the majority of the distressed fellow-villagers in various shelters lack cotton clothing and bedding, find it difficult to describe the sad and miserable conditions under the onslaught of the cold wind. The association, due to its economic difficulties, is at a loss and urgently hopes that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will provide assistance. If anyone wishes to donate old clothing and bedding, please notify the association immediately, and they will send someone to collect it. The association's office is located at 11 Jingyuan Street, Edward Road, telephone number 93512.

### Boy Scout Service Corps Members Go to the Inland to Serve

Branch Offices Established in Various Locations

The Wartime Service Corps of the Boy Scouts of China in this city, in order to thoroughly implement the spirit of "Resisting to the End, Serving to the End," as the Shanghai-based military hospitals are gradually moving inland, has dispatched members to serve in military hospitals in various locations. In addition to the previous batches led by Captain Zhang Jiazhen and others to Huzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, and other places, last night, another 50 members, led by Ms. Hong Liyuan, went to Taicang to establish an office and engage in rescue work. Furthermore, the Editorial Committee of the Corps History, in order to expand its propaganda efforts, has specially edited a "War of Resistance and Boy Scouts" pictorial, which will be published every Friday in the local Dagong Bao. It is reported that the inaugural issue will be published soon.

### British Military Authorities Deny Bombing of Japanese Aircraft

The Four Wounded Soldiers are Recovering Well

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the four British soldiers who were recently wounded by shells in western Shanghai are being treated in a British military hospital and are recovering well. All four are members of the Royal Ulster Rifles. They are expected to be able to rejoin their unit before it leaves Shanghai at the end of this month. The British military authorities deny the rumors circulating yesterday that British soldiers used a gun mounted on the roof of a villa lookout in West Park to fire on Japanese aircraft. It is now believed that this must have been caused by the testing of an anti-aircraft gun, which was misunderstood by people. Furthermore, a soldier named Haugh of the Royal Welch Fusiliers was fatally wounded in the head when a fellow soldier accidentally fired a gun in the Suzhou River Apartments at around 10:00 PM on Sunday and died fifteen minutes after being admitted to the hospital.

### Shi Zhaoji Lectures on the Signing of the Nine-Power Treaty

Second Luncheon of the International Friendship Society

The International Friendship Society held its second luncheon at the International Hotel yesterday at noon. Dozens of members and guests of the society attended. After the luncheon, President Liu Zhan'en introduced Shi Zhaoji, who reported on the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty. Shi, who was the chief representative of China at the time, provided a detailed account of his first-hand experience, which was very well received. Subsequently, Danish Minister Osvald and Belgian Chargé d'Affaires de Kerchove delivered brief speeches, wishing the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which is being held in Beijing today, a complete success. The gathering concluded happily at around 2:00 PM.

### Refugee Work Design Committee Collects Ideas from All Sectors

Hopes for Introduction of Refugee Work

Various relief organizations such as the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the Charity Relief Committee, and the Red Cross, have been sheltering refugees since the outbreak of the war. Although they have tried their best to find ways to send them away, there are still over 100,000 people being sheltered, including 40,000 to 50,000 able-bodied men. If they continue to remain idle, it will not only be difficult to provide for them, but it will also be detrimental to the country, society, and themselves. Therefore, the Refugee Work Design Committee has been established to plan and enable refugees to find appropriate work. In addition to actively proceeding to implement this plan, we also hope that people from all walks of life will offer ideas and suggestions to gather wisdom and knowledge, and that they will do their best to introduce refugee work opportunities. According to a reporter's investigation, an American is currently in contact with the International Relief Committee, planning to establish a textile company in a safe area of this city to provide employment for our refugees.

### People's Food Regulation Committee Generously Donates Relief Funds

Eagerly Awaits Unified and Enthusiastic Donations from Local Groups

The Shanghai Relief Committee, located at 856 Xinzha Road, is responsible for coordinating all matters related to the relief of wounded soldiers throughout the city. It has established over a dozen relief hospitals with 5,000 beds. The monthly cost of all expenses for the relief of wounded soldiers, such as medicine, provisions, food, and transportation, is 100,000 yuan. Although the committee has received enthusiastic donations from all sectors and has entrusted various banks to collect donations on its behalf, it still finds the funds to be insufficient. Therefore, it has repeatedly sent letters to various agencies and organizations to find ways to solicit donations in order to supplement the relief efforts. It is reported that the Municipal People's Food Regulation Committee, due to its efforts to economize on various expenses, has accumulated considerable surplus funds from market fees collected. The committee's seventh meeting decided to donate 5,000 yuan to the Municipal Relief Committee. This amount was personally delivered by Sha Houxin, director of the Audit Section of the committee, yesterday. In addition to immediately sending a letter of thanks, the Municipal Relief Committee urgently hopes that other groups and individuals from all walks of life will unite and enthusiastically donate.

### Traitor Chang Yuchun Engages in Secret Activities

Widely Recruits Followers to Carry Out Extortion

Since our military changed its strategy and the battlegrounds of Dachang and Zhabei shifted and retreated, it has been reliably learned that the ignorant ruffian Chang Yuchun has been instigated by the enemy to engage in activities in a certain location. It is also learned that the traitor Chang intends to widely recruit followers and establish multiple secret organizations in various locations to engage in traitorous activities and carry out extortion. It is hoped that local authorities will pay close attention.

### Anti-Enemy Association Sends Letters to Various Organizations to Intensify War of Resistance Efforts

The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association sent a letter to various organizations yesterday to strengthen the war of resistance efforts, stating: "To whom it may concern, since the launch of the full-scale war of resistance, our country has been moving forward without retreat, and we must resist to the end. All our citizens should maintain an attitude of 'not being arrogant in victory nor discouraged in defeat,' responding to changes calmly and working courageously. The association stated this repeatedly at the beginning of its establishment. Our military's retreat to the second line of defense for strategic reasons has no bearing on the overall war of resistance. Even if we unfortunately retreat further, our citizens must strengthen their spirit of resistance and continue their war of resistance efforts to achieve final victory. If the military retreats and the people immediately become discouraged and submit, then the past war of resistance has only been a 'military war of resistance' and not a 'national war of resistance.' Therefore, we hereby request that your association strictly supervise its staff to actively intensify their work in order to strengthen morale and benefit the war of resistance. We sincerely hope for your attention."

Shanghai War Special:

### Our Troops Kill Enemies on the Banks of the Suzhou River, Spectators are Thrilled

A Foreigner Praises Enthusiastically, Declaring it Spectatular; The Bravery of Our Troops Far Exceeds That of Western Soldiers

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that a certain foreigner who had experienced war extensively during the World War witnessed the battle situation near Luobiegen Village on the banks of the Suzhou River one night. He stated that Chinese and Japanese soldiers engaged in fierce fighting, not hesitating to sacrifice their lives to kill the enemy, and their bravery far exceeded that of Western soldiers. Japanese infantry repeatedly attempted to cross the south bank under the cover of tanks. Tanks arrived continuously on the north bank of the river, firing fiercely at hastily constructed defensive works of the Chinese army. European soldiers would not have been able to stand their ground under such intense fire, but the Chinese soldiers calmly fought back, refusing to easily abandon an inch of land. When the Chinese gunfire weakened and it seemed that no one was alive in the trenches, the Japanese soldiers began to cross the river. However, the Chinese soldiers resisted with machine guns. After six such attempts, the Japanese infantry finally gained a foothold on the south bank. However, the areas that were initially thought to be devoid of life unleashed a hail of machine-gun fire. The Japanese soldiers either perished completely in their weak foothold after several hours, or they were forced to retreat to the north bank. After the Chinese artillery units accurately targeted the tanks left on the riverbank, they also quickly withdrew. The battle then came to an end. The Japanese army ultimately failed to maintain a position on either bank of the river that night. The foreigner also stated that he had witnessed many battles in his life but had never seen soldiers from both sides fight so bravely. Both sides suffered heavy losses in this battle. In any offensive-defensive battle, the losses of the attacking side are usually three times greater than those of the defending side. However, since the Japanese artillery was about three times stronger than the Chinese artillery, it is feared that the losses of the Chinese army were almost equal to those of the Japanese army. However, the Chinese army was able to kill enemies effectively even under such unfavorable circumstances, and its bravery is especially commendable.

### The Gun is My Life

— Wang Jinqi

On the morning of October 4th, Chen Long, a private second class in a certain company of the Huang Division, and another brother were assigned to defend a position near Yaomou Bridge. The position line had been heavily bombarded by the enemy's firepower and was mostly destroyed. In order to avoid excessive sacrifice, the soldiers defending this line were withdrawn several hundred meters to the rear, but Chen Long was left behind. After enduring seven days of hardship, he was able to return, still carrying his gun, accompanied by two brothers. He was only sixteen years old, short in stature, but looked very capable. When he saw his superior, his pale face revealed an endearing smile. In a loud voice and with clear articulation, he reported on his seven days of ordeal. He said, "When I was defending a position, I aimed and fired at the enemy in front. Suddenly, I noticed an enemy coming from behind, approaching our position. Perhaps he didn't see me at this time. I turned my gun and fired two consecutive shots at the approaching enemy. However, the gun had already fired fiercely and could not fire again. The enemy also returned fire several times, staying there for about four or five minutes. I took this opportunity to drag my gun and crawled out of the position to the side, pretending to be dead on the grass by the roadside. The enemy approached my side, touched my feet, and poked my waist with his foot. I pretended to be dead and didn't move at all. It wasn't until nightfall that I carefully discerned the direction of the gunfire from our position and crawled step by step towards it. However, because I had to crawl to our position, I had to go around a very large circle, and I couldn't move during the day, only slowly crawling at night. I crawled like this for seven days before reaching our position. I saw many enemy corpses piled up in the fields along the way. I saw the artillery shells fired from our position accurately landing in the enemy's position, and the enemy would fall down in response. I heard the enemy's leather shoes, the enemy's voices speaking and singing. Sometimes I felt hungry, so I picked beans in the field to eat. On the 12th, near dusk, I saw our position, saw the brothers wearing the blue sky and white sun hats. I shouted, 'Comrades!' I cried, 'Help!' But my voice was hoarse. I still carried my gun, screaming and crawling towards the trenches. The brothers protected me and brought me back." I asked him, "You have struggled so hard for seven days, why did you still drag your gun? Didn't that make your movements even more troublesome?" He replied passionately, "The gun is my life! Without the gun, I have no life! So, before I leave this world, I must hold my gun tightly to defend our motherland! Now I want to continue stepping into our trenches and risk my life again against the enemy!" These words can never be erased from my mind. We thank Heaven for protecting such a brave and dedicated soldier, safely returning from the enemy's clutches. He will surely continue to display his spirit of resistance, and he will surely be able to establish greater achievements for the motherland. ○ ○ ○

The members of this association recognize that the war of resistance by the literary and artistic circles is an important task in the full-scale war of resistance. Literary and artistic members must now recognize the current crisis and rise up to carry out a literary and artistic national salvation movement. In launching this movement, they must not forget the following three principles: (1) The principle that the war of resistance is above all else. All literary and artistic works should abandon all factions' ideologies and feelings that may shake the war of resistance front and divide the war of resistance forces, placing factional interests below national interests. (2) To give full play to the spirit of unity in writing against the foreign enemy. (3) To broadcast the awareness of scorched-earth resistance. Using the light of culture and the heat of art to awaken the broad masses to believe in the government, support the government, and sacrifice everything to resist the garden until the final victory. The association firmly believes that our literary and artistic members will be able to put forth their best and greatest efforts to fulfill their own mission of war resistance. This is our declaration, we hope for your careful consideration.

Telegram of Condolences to the Leader

To Chairman Chiang in Nanjing: The entire membership of the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles deeply believes that under our Supreme Leader, we will surely defeat the powerful enemy, promote our national prestige, wash away a century of humiliation, and build an immortal industry. We pay our highest respects and hope for your consideration.

### Nanshi Has Never Had Troops, Misinformation Regarding Retreat

Today, the Shanghai-based North-China Daily News reported that our security team in Nanshi had retreated. According to a reporter's investigation, Nanshi has never had troops stationed there.

### Each Industry Should Pay Close Attention To False Claims of Selling Enemy Goods

Using the Pretense of Agency Auctions to Sell Sugar, Coal, and Seafood; Report Enemy Goods and Eradicate Them Completely.

Recently, due to the launch of the economic boycott against Japan, the sale of enemy goods has become relatively difficult. Although unscrupulous merchants are active, they are met with no buyers, leaving them sighing in despair. Now, it is heard that some people have come up with a bizarre idea, falsely claiming agency auctions to openly sell enemy goods, especially enemy sugar, enemy coal, and seafood from the south. In reality, seized private goods should be sent to the customs for disposal. The Military Affairs Commission has already sent a telegram to inform them. As for other agencies, they legally have no right to intercept goods and auction them for their own benefit. The Japanese market's disposal of enemy goods is also handled step by step according to the regulations of the National Economic Boycott Against Japan Committee, and there is no auctioning behavior. It is heard that various associations have taken note of this matter and have earnestly notified their members not to be deceived.

The First Special District Citizens' United Association of this city held its ninth executive committee meeting yesterday. The resolutions included: ㊀ The draft of the organization outline for the comfort association was discussed, revised, and passed. ㊁ The selection of the chairman and vice-chairman of the comfort association and the chairmen and vice-chairmen of various groups was immediately determined. ㊂ The letter from the National Economic Boycott Against Japan Committee was approved, requesting consistent action. It was resolved to organize a small committee to report enemy goods, thoroughly report them to the citizens according to the principles stipulated by the Economic Boycott Association, and eradicate the roots of enemy goods to maintain the strength of the war of resistance. ㊃ It was announced to the citizens to do their best to jointly defend Greater Shanghai. It was resolved to publish a letter to the citizens. ㊄ The association has already prepared many brocade banners for the soldiers who are bravely resisting the war. It was resolved to send members of the standing committee along with Zhu Qizhen and others to present them on a scheduled basis. ㊅ It was resolved to send condolences to the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai and thank them for protecting the disaster victims. ㊆ The Yang Ying, Xie Tuan, and others guarded Zhabei courageously and commendably during this battle. The two committee members, Song Shirang and Gu Yucang, suggested erecting a monument to commemorate their great achievements. It was resolved to first send a letter of condolence.

### Shanghai Has Sufficient Food and Fuel Supplies

Striving for Regulation and Price Stability

Food, fuel, sugar, and salt are daily necessities. A reporter from Xinqi News Agency specially inquired about the details from the above industries yesterday and recorded them as follows: ㊀ (Food) After the Shanghai Citizen Food Adjustment Committee made every effort to regulate, rice prices gradually fell. The price of first-class rice is now 13.6 yuan and 6 jiao. Although the western part of Shanghai, the Suzhou Creek, has fallen into the war zone, Jiangsu Cangxian rice boats still change their routes and arrive in Shanghai. It is believed that this year is a year of abundant rice harvest throughout the country, and there will be no shortage of food for Shanghai citizens. ㊁ (Fuel) After the government organized the Fuel Management Committee, the transportation of firewood and coal from various places to Shanghai remained smooth. Coal briquette factories in the safe zone of the concession have started work and are working day and night. Therefore, there is no other worry about fuel in Shanghai. ㊂ (Sugar and Salt) A large amount of domestic cane sugar exists in the China Merchants Huazhan and other places in Pudong. Except for a part that was destroyed by enemy artillery, the rest has been transported to safe areas for storage. Regarding the 43,836 bags of imported sugar, the association has organized a public sales office to implement public sales. After the salt affairs agencies made every effort to regulate, the salt stored in Pudong and Liuhe was successively transported out and piled up in a certain place in large quantities, enough to supply for four months. Due to the effective regulation of the various management agencies, the prices of the above goods are gradually stabilizing.

### The Japanese Side Expresses Apology for Seizing Rice Boats

The Rice Boats Have Been Returned

The Shanghai Times reported that a Japanese naval officer visited Commander Baumon of the American Navy on the 2nd afternoon and expressed regret for the Japanese army's seizure of Chinese civilian boats unloading rice in the American military defense zone on the south bank of Suzhou Creek. Therefore, the case has come to an end. At a press conference with foreign reporters at the Capital Hotel on the morning of the 2nd, a Japanese naval spokesman even claimed that the Japanese army detained the Chinese civilian boats because they did not comply with the order to stop at that time. Now, the rice boats and the rice they were carrying have been allowed to return to the south bank of Suzhou Creek. It is also heard that the Japanese side has assured Commander Baumon of the American Navy that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. Furthermore, the US Bureau has urged the Japanese side to pay special attention to the Japanese army's shooting in the American military defense zone and has lodged a second protest with the Japanese side for this matter. At 12:03 noon on the 1st, a rice boat in the American military defense zone on the south side of Wuzhen Road Bridge on Suzhou Creek was unloading rice when two soldiers of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed at the Jiaotong Bank on the north bank opened fire. Immediately afterwards, they rushed from the bridge to the south bank, jumped onto the rice boat, and used ropes to drag the boat to the north bank, where it was moored beside the Shanghai-Taichang Long-Distance Bus Company. Although the American soldiers and the Chinese and Western police officers of the Xinzha Patrol Room all witnessed their illegal behavior, they were afraid of causing unnecessary conflicts, so they did not argue with the Japanese soldiers. Later, after the American soldiers reported to Commander Baumon of the Second American Naval Regiment, who made representations to Commander Hasegawa of the Third Japanese Fleet, the Japanese side admitted that they were in the wrong and immediately expressed their apology and promised that similar incidents would not happen again in the future. Therefore, at about 5 pm yesterday, the American Naval authorities, together with the Xinzha Patrol Room of the Public Concession, sent the rice boat back to the south bank of Suzhou Creek, where it is still moored beside Wuzhen Road Bridge, awaiting the boat owners to retrieve it.

### Kinmen Compatriots' Rescue Hometown Movement

A Letter to Compatriots Published Yesterday

The Kinmen Overseas Compatriots Association published a letter to Kinmen compatriots at home and abroad regarding the fall of Kinmen, saying: Dear elders, brothers, sisters, after the Japanese Empire's crazy attack on North China, Shanghai, and other places, it is now launching a large-scale attack on South China. The enemy's vicious plan is to make us kneel down and be their slaves forever. We are not pessimistic or panic-stricken because our hometown, Kinmen, has fallen into the enemy's bloody hands. On the contrary, we have increased our determination to resist the enemy. At the same time, we want to point out that the enemy's conspiracy to seize Kinmen this time is a greater attempt to attack Zhangzhou, Xiamen, and annex South China. At this time, we can only strengthen our own vigilance and fight the Japanese pirates with an indomitable fighting spirit. And we must always cooperate

### Chamber of Commerce Writes to the French Municipal Council Requesting Facilitation of the Passage of Commercial Goods

Difficulties in Obtaining Passes for the Transfer Industry; Please Strive to Simplify Things for the Convenience of Merchants and People

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, saying: Dear Sir, According to the letter from the Transfer Industry Association, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, it has been more difficult for our association members to transfer passengers and goods. Later, we received a commercial goods transportation pass issued by your council, which considered the difficulties of the merchants and provided convenience. We also obtained a certificate from the Pinghui and forwarded it for operation. Due to the situation at the time, the traffic on the Suzhou Creek was blocked, so we changed to loading and unloading in the South City. However, it is difficult to obtain the necessary passes for freight cars passing through the French Concession. The transportation of goods by our members will also be suspended as a result. How should we provide relief to facilitate the passage of goods? We hereby send a letter to request instructions. We respectfully ask you to examine and verify this matter and promptly reply so that we can comply. Shanghai commerce has always been of concern to friendly countries conducting trade in China. During this war, you have shown sympathy and assistance in maintaining the commercial status quo and enhancing the relationship between China and foreign countries. The above-mentioned situation regarding the difficulty of obtaining passes from your council should be given special consideration and efforts should be made to simplify the process. This is what we earnestly hope for.

### Declaration of the Volunteer Army Formed by the Chinese Youth Anti-Enemy Salvation Corps

We Want to Survive, We Must Drive Out the Enemy; Let Us Arm Ourselves to Defend Greater Shanghai

Fellow citizens of Shanghai, the bayonets of the Japanese robbers are stained with the blood of our compatriots, and thousands of people are bankrupt, unemployed, homeless, fleeing, and lost. If we want to survive, we must drive out the Japanese robbers. Shanghai is the center of our country's economy and culture and the gateway to the capital. We cannot watch our ancestors painstakingly build it, and the great Shanghai, condensed with the blood and sweat of our compatriots, be occupied by the enemy. Our lives and property cannot be destroyed by the enemy. We must arm ourselves to defend Greater Shanghai. Our central government is resolutely leading the war of resistance. The soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles, and for the survival of the nation, they will not easily give up even an inch of territory. We, the people, should help the front and consolidate the rear and make active self-defense. Arm ourselves, the unemployed and employed workers, refugees, suburban farmers, students, and citizens, all who are willing to take up arms to defend the country should receive military training, strive to participate in the war, or assist the military and police, be responsible for guarding, eliminate traitors, strengthen the strength of the war of resistance, support the long-term battle and strive for the final victory. In order to adapt to this serious and urgent repentance, our corps has specially organized a volunteer army and opened a military cadre training camp. Compatriots from all walks of life who are interested in participating voluntarily can come to the corps to register, form teams, and receive training. Our corps also hopes that various salvation groups will cooperate closely for this purpose, jointly plan to proceed, and quickly complete the organization of all Shanghai people and Wu Pei. Our corps calls on the citizens of Shanghai to organize, request the government to issue arms, form a volunteer army, and help the national army fight. Only by arming ourselves can we protect our lives and property and improve our tragic lives. Compatriots, precisely because we want to support the government's national policy of resisting the enemy and support the government's war of resistance to the end, we must only prepare for military action with utmost urgency and automatically organize a volunteer army and ask the government to arm us immediately, defend Greater Shanghai, and drive the Japanese robbers out of Shanghai, November 3, 26th year.

The association highly appreciates the enthusiasm of the refugees.

### The Situation in Nanshi Turned Stable Yesterday

30-40% of Shops Open for Business; Police Maintain Order with a Calm Demeanor

Since the news that the enemy would bomb Nanshi spread, the residents of Hunan did not comply with the Ningchu and moved away one after another. According to the Dagtong News Agency reporter's detailed inspection of the various sections of Minguo Road, Zhongyi Road, Fuyou Road, and Xiaodongmen in the afternoon yesterday, except for the vehicles full of furniture, which were quite crowded, the general situation was still good. Three or four out of ten shops were open or half-open for business. Many pawnshops freely opened windows for customers to take and sell pledges. Small food stalls along the street were still scattered and visible. Old goods stalls were the only decoration, while the police and defense corps maintained order in sections with a calm demeanor, which was not much different from normal times.

When the Dagtong News Agency reporter went to Nanjing this morning to inspect again, he saw that the number of residents moving out of the alleys had decreased compared to the previous few days. Shops in Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen, and other places had opened for business. The general pedestrians were very calm. In addition, the police authorities were making every effort to maintain law and order, and they were careful and thorough in handling the registration of residents' relocation. Therefore, the various situations turned out to be good.

In order to fully resist Japan and protect the brave soldiers of southern Jiangsu, launch a fierce counterattack against the Japanese invaders and take back our hometown. Because we all recognize that taking back Kinmen is a prerequisite for protecting southern China. In the weeks after the fall of our hometown, the enemy's adultery, looting, and massacre were unbearable to watch and hear. Our dear compatriots are now fighting stubbornly against the atrocities of the Japanese robbers. This heroic act of resisting and defending our homeland also shows that if we do not hurry up to help them and jointly carry out the work of taking back our hometown, then our hometown may become a "slaughterhouse" and a "devil's cave", and the crisis in the Zhangzhou and Xiamen area will inevitably become increasingly serious. The brutal war actions of the enemy and the fighting actions of our brave Kinmen compatriots have aroused even more intense protests from all Kinmen overseas compatriots and southern Chinese compatriots. In order to make this struggle a huge force for protecting southern China, our compatriots at home and abroad should quickly unite under the important task of "recovering Kinmen" and "protecting southern China" and, in coordination with the current war of resistance situation, organize "rescue hometown volunteer teams" and "rescue hometown dare-to-die teams" and unify them in the entire war of resistance force to give the Japanese invaders a strong counterattack. Come, everyone, let's immediately take action to support the recovery of Kinmen, or return to China to participate in the war of resistance, and hope to donate as much money as possible to actually support our anti-enemy troops and fight to recover our hometown. Finally, we earnestly hope that our compatriots will resolutely implement the slogans put forward below: ㊀ Compatriots at home and abroad, everyone, quickly organize. ㊁ Those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength, and work together to rescue Kinmen. ㊂ We must arm ourselves and immediately take back Kinmen. ㊃ Protect our hometown, protect the graves of our ancestors. ㊄ Participate in the anti-enemy troops and defend southern China ㊅ Only by driving out the Japanese robbers can we have a life.

### Various Aspects After the Fall of the Former Capital, Part 3

— Zhu Jingxin

Seventy-Odd Days of Observations

㊄ Bankruptcy of the Newspaper Industry

The newspaper industry in Peiping was once extremely developed. After the Japanese army entered the city, they certainly could not allow this mouthpiece of the people to operate freely. Therefore, my colleagues and I were devastated and forced to become propaganda tools for the enemy. Thus, the newspaper industry was completely bankrupt. The first to cease publication after the incident was the North China Daily, which represented the central government. On the evening of the 25th Army's withdrawal from Peiping, the newspaper voluntarily ceased publication, and all its staff fled. The next day, Chinese traitors colluded with Japanese and Korean stragglers to enter and inspect the premises, and all the belongings were taken away. The Peiping branch of the Central News Agency continued to send out dispatches after the Japanese army entered the city. On the evening of August 6, the Japanese instructed the police bureau to send police officers to inspect the premises, and the editor, Zhan Rusheng, and more than a dozen messengers were arrested. The radio station was also taken over. Later, after various parties interceded, the messengers were released, but Zhan Rusheng alone was sent to the court and sentenced to imprisonment. From then on, the World Daily and the Peiping Morning Post were reorganized one after another. The president of the World Daily, Cheng Shewo, left in advance due to the unfavorable situation. The Peiping Ping Bao, originally sponsored by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, also ceased publication at the same time. The Real News, which had the widest circulation in North China, was also inspected on the 13th, and its president, Guan Mao, was arrested. Guan managed to escape temporarily, barely saving himself. In addition, among those arrested in the newspaper industry were Zheng Fangzhong of the Republic Daily and Weng Nairong, an employee of the news inspection office. After the suspension of various newspapers, traitors instigated the Japanese to take over. The North China Daily was taken over by Zhu Shang of the Shin Shin News (a small newspaper run by the Japanese). The Peiping Morning Post was taken over by Song Jie, and the World Daily was taken over by Wei Chengzhai. All three newspapers were subsequently published. The Real News was taken over by He Tingliu, who forced Li Chengyi, a former colleague, to take responsibility for management. Li, under duress, endured humiliation to preserve the managed property. After more than a month, he had managed to rescue nearly ten thousand yuan worth of assets. This was discovered by the traitors, who, on the basis of alleged communication with the enemy, ordered his arrest. Li escaped and managed to save himself.

Currently, all newspapers in Peiping have uniformly become propaganda organs for the Japanese. The source of news is solely provided by the Domei News Agency. They refer to the National Government as the Ning Government and the National Army as the Ning Army or the Party Army. The daily content is all anti-China propaganda that no one believes in, causing the circulation of newspapers to plummet. The most circulated newspapers only have two to three thousand copies (readers mostly say that it is better not to read than to waste money on anger).

In addition to the Domei News Agency, the Japanese military attaché's office in the Japanese Embassy has also established a propaganda department, which orders reporters from various newspapers and news agencies to publish news every month. The rumors are even worse than those from the Domei News Agency. On one occasion, they published a report that Hu Shih had been assassinated in Beijing and ordered all newspapers to publish it uniformly. That evening, the Domei News Agency sent a telegram stating that Mr. Hu was in Shanghai and about to go to the United States. Other contradictions are countless. Regarding military affairs, they only report victories and never defeats. They exaggerate any victory on any front, but otherwise, they do not mention a word. After the Battle of Shanghai, there were more than ten days in mid-September when they did not mention a word, as they were suffering defeats in the invasion of Shanghai and therefore avoided mentioning it. Citizens have completely lost faith in the local newspapers and no one believes their rumors and anti-China propaganda. As a result, wireless radios have become extremely popular, with every household purchasing one to listen to the news broadcast by the Central Radio Station every day. The Japanese also hate this and have established the North China Radio Station in Tianjin, broadcasting absurd news and jamming the Central Radio Station's waves to make it impossible to listen clearly. Recently, in order to completely cover the eyes and ears of the world, they have severely cracked down on the installation of radios.

㊅ A Glimpse of the Japanese Army's Atrocities

After the fall of Peiping, Japanese troops poured into the city, and my 1.6 million compatriots entered hell. The Japanese army's illegal atrocities were everywhere. The most prominent of these were forced labor, grabbing cars, looting, buying goods without paying, and raping women. The practice of forced labor was common in the era of warlords. In the past ten years, we had not heard of forced labor. After the Japanese army entered the city, they began to forcibly recruit civilians to carry out transportation work. Not only were poor compatriots at risk of being forced into labor, but also those who were well-dressed and wore Western suits were not spared. The whole city was in turmoil and everyone felt threatened. As a result, the trend of armbands arose. Any organization or group issued a white cloth armband with the name of the organization written on it for identification.

Due to the heavy transportation demands, the Japanese army did not have enough vehicles and forcibly requisitioned the automobiles and heavy vehicles of local organizations. The police bureau seized more than 20 new 1937-style automobiles during the incident, but they were also discarded by the Japanese army. The Japanese army also implemented car grabbing on the streets. Cars, trucks, and large vehicles, whether privately owned or commercial, were seized and sent to the front line for transportation. Usually, when Japanese soldiers went out in groups, they would also forcibly seize rickshaws on the street. Sometimes they would order the police to hire them, but the fare was less than 10%. Those who were seized had no place to complain. Otherwise, if they incurred their wrath, rifle butts, leather shoes, and bayonets would come at them.

Japanese soldiers often did not pay when they bought goods, or the price they paid was less than 10% of the actual value. Ordinary shops felt extremely painful about the patronage of Japanese soldiers. Therefore, they secretly hid their goods to prevent them from being seized. Eight or nine out of ten stores, large and small, announced their closure. The area outside Qianmen, which used to be the most prosperous, is now unusually deserted. Every evening, there were hardly any pedestrians on the streets.

The most outrageous atrocities of the Japanese army were the insults to Chinese women. Residents near the locations where troops were stationed moved away to avoid harassment. They raped women walking alone at night, and there were also incidents of kidnapping women into their camps.

In order to satisfy the sexual desires of their soldiers, the Japanese ordered the police bureau to instruct the eight brothels in the city to send three women each to serve them. The prostitutes were panicked by the news. Some fled to the Tianjin Concession, while the rest were sent by the police bureau to the Japanese Military Club (located at the west entrance of Rongxian Hutong inside Xuanwumen), where they had to put on makeup and force smiles every day, subjected to the bestial trampling of these soldiers.

Various pacification offices also recruited female pacification officers, clerks, and office workers on a large scale. Most of the applicants were prostitutes, down-and-out female entertainers, and unemployed waitresses. The so-called office work was just a facade. In reality, they were used for teasing and for the sexual gratification of higher-ranking Japanese officials. They even instructed newspapers to publish advertisements for female teachers of the Soviet language, which had the same meaning as the recruitment of female staff by the pacification offices. This kind of insult to Chinese women is infuriating to hear.

The Japanese are also good at fabricating public opinion. On the morning of August 24, the Japanese army entered Baoding. However, in Peiping, they announced the occupation as early as the night of the 23rd. They then held a citizens' rally at Tiananmen at 2 p.m. on the 24th. The Japanese and Koreans each held iron cans and broken lids, pretending to be gongs and drums, and sang and danced wildly, displaying their ugliness. At a time when it was raining heavily, the rally was dispersed. At 4 p.m. that afternoon, they held a celebration rally at the First Theater. A group of big and small traitors went on stage and scolded their own country and their ancestors. Citizens who did not know the truth and went to watch were forcibly detained inside the venue. The police bureau ordered each business in the city to send one person to attend the meeting. After entering the venue, the police sealed the gate, allowing only entry and no exit, to prevent the crowds from dispersing. After a strange drama ended, they staged a lantern parade. The people were filled with resentment and left in anger after leaving the venue. In the evening, they ordered all businesses and households to hang red lanterns in front of their doors and post absurd slogans celebrating the fall of Baoding. The citizens were heartbroken but helpless.

㊅ Activities of the Righteous Army in the Suburbs

After July 27, the 29th Army soldiers and the Hebei-Northeastern Security Brigade (Shi Yousan's unit) hastily moved south during the resistance war in the suburbs of Peiping. There were still a small number of stragglers who joined forces with the righteous Hebei-Eastern Security Brigade. Having personally suffered the bombings and massacres by the Japanese army, they united and gathered in the mountains around the city, forming a strong anti-Japanese force, known as the Anti-Japanese Righteous Army. Students from national universities, unable to escape and unwilling to live peacefully in the city, also joined them to engage in guerrilla warfare. Even after the Japanese army entered Peiping, they did not dare to cross the line. They had to travel along the railway lines or highways when they left the city. At the beginning of autumn, when the sorghum fields were growing tall, the patriotic righteous army used them as a natural barrier to ambush the enemy. Not only did the Japanese soldiers not dare to travel in groups of three or five, but even large groups were often at risk of being killed. Therefore, the Japanese ordered the police bureau to instruct the farmers to forcibly harvest the autumn crops under the guise of preventing bandits. Most of the farmers in the suburbs, who were victims of the war, fled into the city and dared not return to their villages to harvest. The righteous army used guerrilla tactics to fight the Japanese soldiers, attacking the enemy's unpreparedness in groups of three or five, achieving great results. The Japanese army suffered countless casualties and lost a large amount of military supplies. Furthermore, due to unfamiliarity with the terrain and the betrayal of the people, they dared not go and suppress the righteous army. They could only send aircraft every day to scout and bomb. Many civilian farmer associations were destroyed. The military supplies of the righteous army were completely dependent on the Japanese army. It was recently heard that a certain unit had only three hand grenades left and was still struggling to survive. However, there was no concrete solution to the problem of food and supplies. The Japanese army was mostly stationed in the city and could not implement a strategy of seizing grain from the enemy. The farmers in the suburbs of Peiping were very poor and it was difficult to continue to rely on them for supplies. Moreover, the composition of the righteous army was mostly scattered soldiers and vagrants, and the elements were quite complex. If proper leadership were given, they would be a formidable force. If they were left to suffer from hunger and cold, they would easily turn into bandits. Although they lacked food and weapons at this time and could not achieve great results, when our army counterattacks and wins in the future, we can use this latent force to provide them with supplies and carry out guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines, which will not only disrupt their morale but also cause the enemy's death. Their power should not be ignored.

### Using the Spirit of Resistance to the End to Utilize the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

— Zhang Naiqi

From the perspective of national liberation, the Nine-Power Treaty is not a glorious international agreement. However, today, we can use it as a beneficial diplomatic tool. The main purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty is the eight characters: "Open Door, Equal Opportunity." To achieve this goal, it could not but have provisions to maintain the territorial, sovereign, and administrative integrity of China. To put it more clearly, its purpose was to keep China in a semi-colonial state for a long time, becoming a piece of fat shared by the international community. However, at a time when Japanese imperialism wants to monopolize China as its "exclusive preserve," the provisions to maintain the territorial, sovereign, and administrative integrity of China can become a beneficial diplomatic tool for us. This does not mean that we now want to regain our semi-colonial status. Rather, it means that after breaking through the Japanese imperialist attempt to monopolize China, we will certainly become an independent country. When we become an independent country, we can then use the eight characters "Open Door, Equal Opportunity" in a proactive position, welcoming foreign investment. The meaning will be different from what it is now. A weak country is definitely not without diplomacy. However, the diplomacy of a weak country only has the four characters: "Utilize Contradictions." Seeing the favorable point in the unfavorable conditions and fully utilizing this favorable point to turn the unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions is the epitome of "Utilizing Contradictions."

Why did the League of Nations decide to convene the Nine-Power Treaty Conference? This is because the League of Nations is no longer an effective body for handling the Far Eastern problem. The main defect is that the United States will not participate in the League of Nations, and the secondary defect is that Japan and Germany have withdrawn from the League of Nations. To compensate for this defect, it is necessary to convene the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Therefore, the most favorable point of this conference is the active participation of the United States in international collective action to deal with the Far Eastern problem. Although Japan refuses to participate, this refusal is beneficial to us. This further proves that it is a country that disregards the dignity of treaties. Why is Germany not participating? This is a predetermined plan of the three fascist countries, and the details will be explained below.

The United States has always been relatively active in dealing with the Far Eastern problem. The reason is that the United States has relatively few existing investment interests and colonial relations in the Far East, but has great expectations for the future. Its position in the Americas is also relatively solid. Therefore, it does not have as many concerns as the British gentlemen. We can see this from Stimson's activities in 1931. Stimson's activities, because of British non-cooperation, ultimately failed. This is a matter that the British Conservative government has been condemned internationally and by its own domestic public. In recent years, the British actions of bribing aggressor countries have not only made the Far Eastern problem even more unmanageable, but also made the Mediterranean problem a complete mess. British gentlemen probably cannot help but regret it now when they think back to it, right? Or perhaps it is precisely because of some regret that they have been relatively active in dealing with the Italian-Abyssinian War, and are even more active in dealing with the Spanish problem. This activeness is naturally not enough, but compared to the attitude towards the Far Eastern problem in 1931, it is different after all.

Just as Britain cannot but abandon its policy of befriending Germany and Italy and suppressing France and the Soviet Union in the Mediterranean, and instead turn to wooing France and the Soviet Union to deal with Germany and Italy, it cannot but abandon its policy of bribing Japan and excluding the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East, and instead turn to wooing the United States and the Soviet Union to deal with Japan. Of course, we are not saying that Britain will abandon its basic policy of compromise. However, Britain will realize that Japan is not its loyal watchdog, right? Then, it is certainly not an overestimation to say that it is currently willing to support the United States as a leader in dealing with the Far Eastern problem.

What is the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Far East? We cannot deny that it is very concerned and sympathetic to China, but it is also particularly cautious. Naturally, China's affairs mainly rely on ourselves, and friendly assistance is limited. Who would be willing to be unnecessarily drawn into the vortex of war because of helping China? Neither the United States nor Britain wants the Soviet Union to gain a leadership position in the Far East. Germany and Italy are even willing to use the threat of war to prevent it from being too aggressive in any international issue. If the Soviet Union's attitude is too aggressive, the current Mediterranean disputes and the Far Eastern disputes may turn into an international anti-communist war between morning and evening. For example, if the Soviet Union openly joins the Chinese war, Germany, under the constraint of the International Anti-Communist Pact, cannot but openly help Japan in the war. The attitude of the United States and Britain at that time would also be difficult to say. That would be unfavorable to the Soviet Union, and whether it would be beneficial to China would also become a major question. Therefore, its current attitude towards the Far Eastern problem is probably only to help China through the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and it is willing to solve the Far Eastern problem under the leadership of the United States, rather than taking the lead. As long as the United States' attitude towards the Far Eastern problem is relatively active and the estimate is correct, it may not be a problem for Britain and the Soviet Union to become active as well.

However, can we have great expectations for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference? We cannot. The methods stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty are only mutual consultations. We can only hope that it can determine that Japan has violated the treaty, and hope that the countries participating in the conference, except for the few countries allied with Japan, namely Italy, can take further common actions beyond the treaty. We cannot hope that the treaty itself will exert practical power. Such common actions, at present, we can only hope that they will give Japan a diplomatic threat on the one hand, such as recalling ambassadors to Japan, and give China material and technical assistance on the other. In addition, such as economic sanctions, military sanctions, and even the establishment of a Pacific collective security system, we should demand them now, hope to achieve them in the future, but cannot hope to achieve them quickly.

Under the meaning of "not forgetting danger in peace," we not only cannot have extravagant hopes, but also must have considerable vigilance. First of all, in the military aspect, the enemy is taking the opportunity to use all its strength to simultaneously attack on both the eastern and western fronts, which has already been seen in the facts. Secondly, in the political aspect, a small number of pro-Japanese elements want to carry out peace compromise movements at this time, which is also inevitable. In addition, in the international aspect, Germany is also brewing a peace compromise movement, and this movement echoes the peace compromise movements of domestic pro-Japanese elements.

It is said that a German business leader in China has already made the following suggestion to the German diplomatic authorities:

"The war between China and Japan near Shanghai is a typical modern war. It is unexpected that the Chinese army can cope with this war and can support the first line of defense for more than two months. China has a large reserve of manpower and a wealth of resources. What is lacking is only arms. However, it is impossible for Japan to cut off the supply of arms to China from the powers. Therefore, it is not a problem for China to maintain this war. If this war can be maintained for six months, Japan's military strength will be consumed by more than half. Then, what is cheap is the various countries of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union, and what is most disadvantageous is Germany. First of all, the Soviet Union can transfer half of the land and air forces of the Far East to Europe to deal with Germany and Italy. Secondly, England and France no longer have to fear Japan's military power in the Far East and can take a tougher attitude in Europe. Furthermore, the United States has also eliminated a threat in the Pacific. In that case, France's future development in Europe will fall into major difficulties, and during the continuation of the war, it will also make the advantage of German trade in China, which has been created with great difficulty, fall into ruin. In order to turn this unfavorable situation for us into a favorable situation for us, we must quickly lead a Far Eastern peace movement. We must step up cooperation with the Chinese moderates (?) to complete this peace movement. Then, we can replace England in the future, grasp the hub of Chinese politics, and develop greater economic interests in China."

Who are the so-called moderates? They are undoubtedly pro-Japanese elements. From this suggestion, we can also know that the three fascist countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy have a predetermined division of labor at this time. That is: Japan intensifies its armed aggression, Italy participates in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference as Japan's spokesman, and Germany launches another peace movement to confront the Nine-Power Treaty Conference.

How should we use the Nine-Power Treaty Conference?

We should face it with the determination to resist to the end. Some say that our international sympathy is obtained by moderate diplomatic policies. We oppose this view. We must recognize that our international sympathy is exchanged for by the strength of resistance. If moderate diplomatic policies can exchange for international sympathy, then past diplomatic policies were only more moderate than now. Why is there international sympathy only now? The so-called strength of resistance does not necessarily have to be hard-fought on a certain front, but the main thing is the determination to resist to the end. As long as we continue to resist after retreating from a certain front, we can instead show a greater determination to resist to the end.

We do not oppose that China's diplomatic policy should be more moderate, but moderation has a limit. Exceeding this limit, it becomes an international coward. No one will sympathize with an international coward. Rather than saying moderate, it is better to say reasonable and firm. That is to say: we need peace, but at the same time, we need to maintain the dignity of international treaties and the public reason and justice of mankind. Only in this way can we achieve true peace. In order to maintain the dignity of international treaties and the public reason and justice of mankind, we must have the determination to resist to the end.

Before the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly expressed his determination to resist to the end to foreign reporters. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also made solemn refutation to Japan's excuse for refusing to attend. Our representatives to the conference also stated that although they do not flatly refuse mediation, they cannot accept any mediation plan that violates the spirit of the treaty. This can be said to be completely consistent with the demands of the people of the whole country. We must understand: mediation that does not violate the spirit of the treaty is impossible mediation, and Japanese imperialism will refuse it first.

In short, since the Lugouqiao Incident, hundreds of thousands of soldiers have shed their blood, and tens of millions of people have suffered the disaster of family destruction. What is this sacrifice for? For the bright future. Now, whoever speaks of compromise betrays the soldiers and people who have suffered, and is a public enemy of the whole country. Therefore, mid-way compromise is impossible. At this time, on the one hand, we should have more trust in the overall national policy of resisting to the end and not be easily moved by rumors. On the other hand, we should naturally also pay as much attention as possible to the few people who want to use the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to carry out shameless compromise, preventing them from using this to shake people's hearts, confuse people's minds, and indirectly help the enemy.

### The Social Bureau Obeys the Order of the Ministry to Strengthen Trade Union Organizations

Those that have not been established should be organized quickly, Leading workers to strive for production

The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau obeyed the order of the Ministry of Industry. At the time when our country is engaged in a comprehensive war of resistance, it should guide the trade unions of various industries to strengthen their organizations. Those trade unions that have not been established should be organized quickly so that the trade unions can lead the workers to strive for production. It is reported that the director of the registration section, Lan Simian, and the director of the civil training section of the Municipal Party Department, Zhou Funong, have consulted on concrete measures. According to the reporter of New Sound News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union is divided into two types: industrial and occupational. Those approved by the Municipal Party Department and approved by the Social Bureau total about 100. Since the outbreak of the war, the affairs of about 60 trade unions have been virtually suspended.

### International Relief Society to Discuss Refugee Colonization Today

Refugee Resettlement Committee Plans Detailed Measures

Mr. Yu Lidong, a representative of the preparatory office of the War Zone Refugee Resettlement Association, recently suggested to the International Relief Society that it focus on refugee colonization. The International Relief Society believes this matter is indeed important, and most committee members agreed. A meeting is scheduled for today to discuss it. The draft proposal prepared by the Refugee Resettlement Association is recorded below. It roughly states that since the outbreak of the war, the number of families ruined and livelihoods lost is extremely large, and a fundamental solution must be sought. The official wastelands in Jiangsu Province are an excellent basis for solving this problem. It also states that passive relief is temporary, while active maintenance is long-term. Without the need for huge amounts of funds, it can accommodate a large number of refugees in production. Without the need for sophisticated technology, but only relying on common sense and labor, the best way to do things is through resettlement. As for the detailed plan for land reclamation, there are also decisions. The original text is as follows: A. Location of land reclamation: First, a pilot refugee land reclamation project will be carried out on wasteland in Gaochun and Liyang counties. Gaochun has 15,000 mu of reclaimable wasteland, and Liyang has 20,000 mu. A plan will be formulated with reference to the land reclamation methods of various counties. B. New village organization: The new village will implement a cooperative production system, with 250 people forming one village (averaging five people per household, about 50 households, including 100 men and women, and 190 elderly and young). Reclaim 2,500 mu of land, and combine four villages into one village (about 200 households) with a total of 1,000 people, reclaiming 10,000 mu of land. C. Production estimate: The wheat planting season for this winter has passed, so only the rice planting in the coming spring is calculated. Each mu yields an average of one shi of rice, worth seven yuan. Ten thousand mu will produce a total of 10,000 shi of rice, worth 70,000 yuan. D. Budget estimate: Based on the standard of one village with 1,000 people reclaiming land, the expenses are as follows: ① Food expenses for 1,000 people for eight months: 24,000 yuan. ② Construction cost: 2,440 yuan. ③ Agricultural tools and furniture equipment cost: 3,800 yuan needed for 1,000 people. ④ Cattle: 10,000 yuan. ⑤ Seeds: 4,000 yuan. ⑥ Fertilizer: 5,000 yuan. The total cost of land reclamation for one village is about 50,000 yuan. E. Fundraising methods: ① Private donations. ② Assistance from relief organizations and charities. ③ Private investment. ④ Request the central government to allocate disaster relief reserves or special funds in accordance with the outline of the emergency period relief for refugees that has been promulgated. ⑤ Borrow from financial institutions and groups during the planting season.

### Silk and Satin Transit Tax to Be Levied Ad Valorem

Various Colors and Prices Vary, Ad Valorem Taxation Ensures Fair Burden

Regarding the collection of transit tax on the silk and satin industry, the Ministry of Finance yesterday replied to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce by telegram, saying, "To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, I have carefully read the telegram. The purpose of this reorganization of the transit tax collection method is to increase tax revenue and subsidize finances during the emergency period. The silk and satin item is stipulated as an ad valorem tax in the revised transit tariff, so it is inconvenient to approve the original specific duty rate to collect taxes, which would damage tax revenue. The colors and types of silk and satin are extremely complex, and the prices vary greatly. The ad valorem tax can be expected to bear a fair burden, which is also beneficial to silk merchants. As for the valuation procedures, the customs has always handled them impartially in accordance with regulations, so there is no need to worry about it. Please inform the silk merchants to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations and share the difficulties together. This is what is expected." Stamped with the Seal of the Ministry of Finance.

### Private School Registration Continues

Upholding the Spirit of the "Last Lesson," Maintaining Education Without Neglect

Education is related to the foundation of the country. Even in times of emergency, the authorities still uphold the spirit of the "last lesson" and do not allow progress to be slackened. After Shanghai was reduced to a war zone, the schools have moved to safe areas to try to open as usual. The Ministry of Education also sent Section Chief Guo Lianfeng to Shanghai to inspect a few days ago. Accompanied by personnel from the Bureau of Social Affairs, they visited the schools separately and then returned to Beijing to report. In addition, the Bureau of Social Affairs is continuing to handle the registration procedures for private primary and secondary schools due to additions or reorganizations among the schools and has temporarily established a temporary review committee for private school registration to preside over it.

### Wang Yiting Goes to Hong Kong to Raise Funds for Refugee Relief

Mr. Wang Yiting, Chairman of the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Custody Committee and Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association, in view of the increasing number of war zone refugees being accommodated in Shanghai, the lack of supplies from time to time, and the huge amount of funds needed, took the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde" at 9:00 yesterday morning to Hong Kong to solicit donations to expand relief. The association's chairman and vice-chairmen, Qu Wenliu and Huang Hanzhi, the secretary of the relief committee, Xie Jiaqian, Tao Fuqing, Zhu Zigan, and Wang's son, Jimei, and others all went to the Customs Wharf to see him off.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Report

Shrapnel Wounds One Chinese Person, Large Fire in Heavy Rain on East Jiaxing Road

Yesterday (2nd), the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade lookout reported ten fire alarms and the ambulance brigade dispatched ten times. Including the patients sent to various hospitals, there were a total of eleven people. One Chinese person was wounded by shrapnel and was sent to the hospital by the Putuo Road Patrol. The fire truck was dispatched four times, one of which was to the intersection of East Jiaxing Road and Fengtian Road. At that time, it was raining heavily, but the fire was quite fierce. About 30 Chinese-style houses were destroyed by the fire. It took the firefighters more than an hour to extinguish the fire.

### Public Concession Rickshaw Issues

Membership Fees Appropriately Reduced During Curfew, Vehicles Damaged by Shelling Allowed to Be Rebuilt

The rickshaw industry in this port has experienced problems due to the war, and the Municipal Council has paid attention to it. The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association, in order to maintain the operation of the association, requested that rickshaw owners still pay a monthly membership fee of one yuan and five jiao per vehicle as usual. However, the rickshaw owners stated that the rent they can collect recently is much different from the seven jiao and seven fen (including the mutual aid association fee of seven fen) approved by the Municipal Council per vehicle. The rickshaw owners said that due to the curfew in the concession and the reduced area where rickshaws can operate during the day, they had to reduce the rent. At the same time, the rickshaw industry has suffered heavy losses due to the reduction in rickshaw pullers and the damage to vehicles. Based on these reasons, the rickshaw owners claimed that they could not pay the membership fees. The mutual aid association fees for September and October have been reduced, and therefore the amount of rent has also been reduced accordingly. Since both sides held their own positions, the Municipal Council appointed Chinese directors Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, Deputy Secretary-General He Dehui, Deputy Director of the Finance Department Middleton, and Director of the Rickshaw Management Office Stebbing to form a committee to consider this issue. After discussion, the committee submitted the following recommendations to the board of directors, which were adopted by the board of directors at a meeting yesterday (3rd):

"The mutual aid association fee for November is set at five jiao per vehicle, and from December until the night curfew is lifted, it will be one yuan per vehicle. Thereafter, it will be one yuan and five jiao per vehicle as before. During the period when five jiao and one yuan are collected, the rent collected by the rickshaw owners should be lower than the amount approved by the Municipal Council."

The Board of Directors adopted the above recommendations for two reasons: first, to provide temporary relief to the rickshaw industry during this emergency period; second, to ensure that the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association's work to benefit rickshaw pullers can continue within the possible scope.

The Municipal Council originally planned to implement the renewal of licenses for public rickshaw pullers starting in October. However, the rickshaw owners requested a postponement on the grounds that 80% of the rickshaw pullers who had previously obtained licenses had left Shanghai for other places and could not make up the original number until after several months. In view of the current special circumstances, the Municipal Council has allowed rickshaw pullers without licenses to temporarily pull rickshaws. However, it has now been decided to hold the registration of rickshaw pullers for 1938 starting from November 1st. After the registration procedures are completed, public rickshaw pullers who pull rickshaws without licenses will be immediately banned by the police.

A large number of vehicles have been damaged by shelling. For the sake of public interest, the Municipal Council has also considered whether it should allow rickshaw owners to add new vehicles to replace these vehicles. All the directors of the bureau believed that the rickshaw owners had already suffered losses at this time, and the bureau should not take this opportunity to reduce the number of vehicles. Therefore, it was decided to allow rickshaw owners to manufacture new vehicles to replace the damaged old vehicles. As for the time limit, it has not yet been determined, but it will be considered by the Municipal Council in the future.

Recording Conversations with High-Ranking Leaders, Proving Our Army's Determination to Resist to the End

This time, when the reporter went to Liuhe, I was introduced by my colleague Mr. Huang Zijian, hoping to hear Mr. ×'s high opinion after practicing resistance against Japan. Unfortunately, Mr. × was on official business elsewhere, so I did not have the opportunity to meet him. However, "under a strong general, there are no weak soldiers." I had a pleasant conversation with his chief of staff ××× and other brothers, and the information I obtained was also very valuable. Since mid-August, when this unit was ordered to take charge of the defense of Liuhe, the enemy has attempted to land there a total of four times. Each time, they used more than a dozen warships and twenty to thirty transport ships, stretching for miles, fully loaded with enemy soldiers. They also used more than a hundred small steamboats and sailboats equipped with steel armor, under the cover of airplanes and artillery, attempting to force a landing. Each time, they started intensive shelling from 10:00 a.m. to destroy our defensive fortifications. They attacked until the tide rose at night, and then they wanted to swarm ashore. However, our army calmly responded and used fierce firepower to target the enemy's swarming steamboats and sailboats, sinking them one after another to the bottom of the river.

Our brave and heroic soldiers often do not limit themselves to the trenches, and they often win by surprise. On September 16, the day the enemy launched a large-scale attack, it was also the most intense and dangerous day of the battle of Liuhe. Under the roaring artillery fire and the layers of dense smoke, the enemy soldiers had swarmed ashore like a tide. Unfortunately, one bunker was hit by a shell and collapsed with a roar, crushing thirteen soldiers. The rest, under a command, bravely jumped out of the trenches and rushed to the riverbank with irresistible force. The enemy soldiers, who were just standing on the riverbank and unable to retreat, suddenly encountered a fierce enemy like a dragon emerging from the ground and a tiger descending from the mountain, and they were all at a loss. Some of them were driven into the water in groups like ducks, reaching thousands, which was really a ridiculous death!

Recently, due to the loss of Dachang and the abandonment of Chuanbei Jiangwan by the Shanghai Occupational Bureau, the original defense line of Suzhou He and Nanxiang was solidified. People who do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of the "protracted war" have become suspicious and speculated about the results of the war. Some say that Shanghai will be abandoned, while others say that the light of peace is about to arrive. I feel that if such words that do not examine the facts and spread false information are not corrected, they will be very likely to shake the resistance front. However, the reporter does not need to express his opinion from a subjective standpoint. Just extract a few paragraphs of the frontline senior officers' remarks related to the above questions, and the problem can be solved easily.

"In order to ensure the survival of the country, to fight for the freedom of the nation, to save the country and the nation from danger, and to resist the invasion of the warlord Japan, this time we are determined to launch a united national resistance, vowing to fight the Japanese pirates to the end until we achieve final victory!

"Everyone should know that since we lost the four northeastern provinces on September 18, the people have suffered pain and the country has lost land. Have we ever forgotten this humiliation for a moment? What have we been enduring, not retaliating when cursed, and not fighting back when beaten, for these past few years? We really wanted to stabilize the interior, complete unification, and strengthen our national power, and now we are at the final moment to resist the war and wipe out the shame!

"Now that the time to kill the enemy to repay the country and wipe out the shame and revive the country has arrived, we must be firm and calm, loyal and courageous, and give full play to the supreme and invincible power of our revolutionary army to eliminate the brutal and barbaric Japanese pirates, so as to recover the lost territory and wash away our heavy national humiliation!"

The above is the great theory expressed by a certain supreme leader of mine on one occasion: and he also said: "On this united front of national resistance, if anyone is willing to compromise halfway and seek to preserve oneself, he is a traitor, and we can deal with him with the means of dealing with enemy traitors!" This is such a resolute and powerful great theory! Now, after just over two months of fighting, and with a slight change in the position, some people are suspicious and superstitious, mistakenly believe in rumors, and disrupt the line of defense, is it not a great strange thing?

The reporter turned to a small but energetic commander-in-chief in a water cloud town. The appointment time was only ten minutes. At that time, there was a Shen Bao, which was probably just delivered, on the table. He even talked while reading, spending more time. The wording was precise and sharp, which was very exciting to listen to!

At first, he defined this resistance war as follows: "This resistance war against the violent Japan is not a war between strong countries, nor is it a war between weak countries and strong countries, but a revolutionary war of oppressed nations against aggressive countries. The so-called revolutionary war, the material must be far inferior to the enemy, but looking at the achievements of the Northern Expedition and the history of the world, the revolutionary war must often win the final victory; this is nothing else, because it has the revolutionary spirit that comes from the chest, fills the world, and cannot be resisted by any material!"

He also said: "In the initial stage of the war of resistance, there will inevitably be some losses in terms of materials, but the spirit is very happy! When the Japanese pirates first came to our inland to fight, they were unfamiliar with the terrain everywhere, and the people everywhere were our compatriots, that is, their enemies. If the teacher is not righteous, then the qi is not strong. They are all afraid of death and unwilling to sacrifice, just using their planes and artillery to bombard us fiercely, hoping to scare us back.

"As long as we deeply understand the significance of protracted war and attrition war, and do not panic or be confused in the face of war, even if we suffer some losses and setbacks in the early stage, we must never have the attitude of 'doubt' or 'hesitation', and abandon the right path of 'seeking victory from beginning to end' and turn back to the dead end of 'compromise suicide'. Because these initial losses and setbacks that we expected, as long as we can use the weaknesses of the Japanese pirates who rely on material and empty spirit, calmly remedy, and continue to struggle, we will definitely win the final five minutes of victory!

A certain commander-in-chief continued to say more and more vigorously: "To retreat, although we have slightly moved and persuaded a few positions for strategic reasons, we cannot consider it a failure in the overall situation of the war of resistance. The movement of this or two positions seems to be beneficial to the enemy, but considering the heavy price paid by the enemy, it is ultimately a loss to gain this scorched earth; moreover, we must continue the war of resistance for one or two years according to our established decision. Even if Paris, the capital of France, is threatened during the European War, and the entire land of Belgium is temporarily occupied, we will not yield and use all our thoughts and efforts to continue to struggle. We will not stop until we achieve the goal of expelling the Japanese and recovering the land.

He then put his tone a little softer and said: "But if it comes to this time, or maybe not at this time, I dare to believe that the enemy has already exhausted its military resources, its economy has collapsed, and its national foundation has been shaken, and it has bowed down to us!"

"To what extent will Shanghai be completely abandoned?" The reporter asked him bluntly when he was about to leave.

"Unless Shanghai is fought into a Kokusho Kisen, a Baoshan that will forever shine with blood and light, in order to adjust the position, it may be necessary to talk about temporary abandonment!" Then he said with a firm attitude: "But in fact, it will never be so easy, because the troops that we have added up are all holding the determination to die in order to complete the task of defending the Great Shanghai. This is not a temporary emotional impulse, but the flowers and fruits that have been opened and borne according to the revolutionary spirit left by history and Mr. Sun Yat-sen!

After reading the remarks of the above two senior generals, we are not afraid of the sound of artillery on the banks of the Suzhou River, which is more and more tense at one time, but we can firmly believe that the Great Shanghai will never be easily abandoned! At the same time, whenever there are still traces of the enemy left on Chinese soil, any peaceful atmosphere advocated by the enemy will never shake our determination to resist the war! (End)

### Sanitation Conditions in Refugee Shelters in the Concession

According to the report of the Health Department of the Municipal Council, there were a total of 128 refugee shelters in the Public Concession at the end of October, which is almost the same as the number in mid-month (there were 125 on October 17). However, the number of refugees is increasing day by day. The total number on the 17th of last month was 56,196, and by the 31st, it had increased to 64,189. A large number of refugees are now coming from western Shanghai, so the number of refugees at the beginning of this month will increase quite rapidly. Several old shelters have been closed, and all the refugees in them have been moved to newly established shelters. Near Shenyuan Sports Ground on Yanping Road, there is now a factory and two mat sheds, which have been converted into shelters. There are a total of 4,837 refugees in the area near the factory. In addition, there are several newly established shelters, which can accommodate a certain number of additional refugees. All of these shelters have considerable medical equipment, and their sanitary conditions are gradually being improved. However, refugees living in mat sheds are susceptible to cold. Fortunately, the local International Red Cross and other charities have found ways to raise clothes and quilts to prepare for the refugees to keep warm.

The number of refugees suffering from infectious diseases is decreasing day by day. There are only one or two cholera patients every day. Although measles has been discovered, it only affects a small number of shelters. The number of people suffering from dysentery, diphtheria, and epidemic parotitis is even smaller. Several people suffering from scarlet fever have been quickly sent to the hospital.

Considerable measures have been established in the various shelters for the prevention and treatment of beriberi. Cod liver oil is now available for all those who are malnourished and need tonics for other reasons. Fresh milk, which is supplied free of charge by various dairy factories, is distributed daily to certain shelters, and the remaining shelters have milk powder donated by enthusiastic people to replace fresh milk. In the future, it is planned to supply a large amount of milk and other products to underage refugees in the shelters. The plan is under consideration.

Since the Municipal Council appealed to all sectors of society to donate nutrients, it has received a lot of food and medicine. What the refugees need most now is milk or its substitutes, so the Health Department of the Bureau sincerely hopes that enthusiastic people will actively transport them.

Those who wish to donate can send money or items to Dr. Paulis, Office 219 of the Bureau. The American Red Cross has donated 15,000 yuan in national currency, which has been deposited in the bank under the name of the Municipal Council Health Department's Refugee Relief Hygiene Work Fund. If anyone wishes to donate cash in the future, please open a crossed check, clearly stating that it should be paid to the above account name, and the Citibank will collect it on your behalf. The list of donations and donors received in October is published below: ① Mr. Biersen (transliteration), two gallons of cod liver oil, six sets of bed sheets, and two blankets; ② Watson's Drugstore, twelve tubes of ointment and 388 cans; ③ Bucknall & Sons, twenty-three boxes of disinfectant and eight bottles of Scott's cod liver oil, various clothes, etc.; ④ Shunfa Foreign Firm, twelve pairs of baby bottles; ⑤ Yi Ji (transliteration) Pharmaceutical Company, thirty-four cans of eczema ointment; ⑥ Paeder Pharmaceutical Company, twelve bottles of Haliverol and one box of samples; ⑦ International Relief Committee, twenty-four cans of milk powder; ⑧ Chinese Medical Association (handled by Mr. Ou), three bottles of cod liver oil; ⑨ Reid Medical Research Institute (handled by Dr. Li De), twelve pounds of various ointments, forty bottles of cholera pills, two gallons of cod liver oil, sixteen pounds of sulfur water for treating scabies, Mermite one box (handled by Dr. Ou Er); ⑩ Jardine Matheson, three dozen bottles of malt extract; ⑪ Mr. Nie Xian, four cans of milk powder; ⑫ Mr. Biersen, one can of cod liver oil; ⑬ Mr. W, 20 yuan in national currency (designated for purchasing lunch milk, etc.); ⑭ Mr. Shi (transliteration) of Tongji University, three bottles of cod liver oil; ⑮ Nanyang Sock Factory, nineteen cans of milk powder; ⑯ Mr. Wang Hansong (transliteration) of the Chinese Youth Association, one bottle of cod liver oil; ⑰ Mr. Lancelinqi, two large cans of Cenovita Yeast; ⑱ Mr. Shi (transliteration), one can of cod liver oil; ⑲ Mr. Gebede, 100 yuan in national currency; ⑳ Mr. Shilisong (transliteration), one can of cod liver oil.

### Cadres Being Recruited by the 36th Division, Applicants Shoulder-to-Shoulder

Ironclad Proof of the People's Enthusiasm for the "Military Service Movement"

In order to strengthen the long-term war of resistance lineup, the 36th Division of the Army is recruiting lower-level cadres on the third floor of the YMCA in Baxianqiao in this city. This morning, the people who went to register and apply were shoulder-to-shoulder, coming one after another, covering all walks of life, including farmers, industrialists, students, and teachers. This is ironclad proof that the people of our country enthusiastically support the military service movement. The reporter met with Director Jiang of the Political Training Office of the division, who said that the exam will begin on the 8th of this month. Cadre officers attach equal importance to academic theory and experience, while cadre reserve soldiers focus on oral examinations and experience. Academic qualifications are secondary, but physical fitness is a prerequisite. Those without a strong physique cannot bear the arduous task of resisting the war.

### Corpse in Bathtub

Murder Case at the Central Hotel

Two young travelers, dressed in fancy clothes, came to the Central Hotel at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Hubei Road in the Public Concession at about 9 p.m. the night before. The waiter led them into Room 201. The three characters "Shi Shengji" were written on the registration book. Not long after, a young girl, about twenty years old, dressed fashionably, knocked on the door and went inside. She was not seen coming out all night, and the waiters did not suspect anything else. At 12 p.m. the next day, there was still no movement in the room. The waiters, according to the hotel regulations, routinely asked the guests if they wanted to extend the room. They tried to open the door, but there was no one in the room. When they got to the bathroom, they only saw a woman squatting in the tub, wearing a undershirt on top and underwear on the bottom, but there were three rope marks around her neck, which were purple. When they touched her, she had been dead for a long time. The waiter quickly turned around and went out to report to the front desk, who reported to the Old Gate Patrol. The Chinese and foreign detectives were ordered to rush to the scene to investigate. Then, the body was transported to the coroner's office to await the court's examination. At the same time, the suspects were arrested and investigated.

### Suggestions for a Refugee Zone in the Nanshi Area

— Suitable

The International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross, driven by humanitarian motives, has recently proposed to both China and Japan that the northern section of the Nanshi area, adjacent to the concessions, be designated as a refugee reception zone. Within this zone, both sides' armies would avoid combat. As of now, this proposal has not yielded concrete results, making it difficult to determine whether it would be beneficial to our country. We believe that Nanshi is not entirely a crucial military location. However, this area contains hundreds of thousands of residents and countless industries. It holds significant political and economic importance for our country. It is said that our military authorities have long been determined and prepared to defend this area, preferring to turn it into scorched earth if necessary, rather than lightly abandoning it and causing the residents of Nanshi to fall into a state of enslavement and slaughter. This approach is undoubtedly entirely correct.

Now that friendly countries have put forward the idea of a refugee reception zone, we should, of course, deeply appreciate their sympathy for our suffering compatriots. However, we cannot rely too much on this for the safety of Nanshi. This is because the enemy is using the concessions as a base to provoke war in Shanghai, fundamentally disregarding the interests of other countries and indicating a desire to monopolize China. Since the start of the war, the enemy has damaged the lives and property of neutral countries without any concern. I am afraid that they may not readily accept this proposal of a humanitarian nature from the neutral countries. Even if the enemy accepts, there is still a question as to whether the implementation of this proposal would not harm our country's political sovereignty in Nanshi.

### Our Representative at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Affirms a Solemn Stance

Peaceful Solutions Must Be Based on Treaty Principles; We Are Determined to Continue Resistance to Seek National and Ethnic Survival

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference continued its meeting this afternoon. Soviet representative Litvinov delivered a speech, hoping that after defining acts of aggression, the conference should do its utmost to seek solutions. Subsequently, Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, stood up and delivered a solemn speech to the conference. Dr. Gu first listed all the factual arguments about the current situation in China during the current stage of Japan's military aggression against China, proving that Japan, as a signatory to the 1922 Nine-Power Treaty, had clearly violated Article 1 of the treaty. Twenty-three countries unanimously condemned Japan's war against China as an act of aggression, so he did not need to ask this conference to confirm it again. Mr. Gu went on to explain the nature of Japan's military actions, stating that the three provinces of Hebei, Suiyuan, and Chahar, as well as parts of Shandong and Shanxi, had been occupied by the Japanese army. Japan has indiscriminately bombed 63 cities in China with one hundred bomber planes, all of which prove that Japan's current military action is a continued manifestation of its policy of expanding its territory into the East Asian continent. Mr. Gu also listed statistics on Japan's large-scale smuggling of red and white pills into Chinese territory, poisoning the Chinese people. He also said that Japanese planes had been appearing over Chinese territory from time to time before the start of this war. The above facts all prove that Japan has been continuously violating the Nine-Power Treaty anytime and anywhere. Mr. Gu stated that China deeply regrets that Japan refused to attend the meeting this time, and at the same time believes that Japan's move is another act that violates treaty obligations. As for whether there is anti-Japanese sentiment in China, it is also the result of Japan's continuous aggression. Regarding the section on communism, Mr. Gu solemnly declared that no one can admit that the Chinese government is under the influence of northern production forces, because it has been actively suppressing the communists for ten years. The Chinese government is not opposing communism based on theory, but protecting the property rights of the people, and even the Chinese Communist Party is patriotic. China does not accept the view that the world should be divided into two opposing camps, but believes that every country has the right to choose the government system that best suits its national conditions. As for the Chinese government carrying out any military propaganda against Japan, it is absolutely not the case. Japan advocates that it is working hard to seek cooperation with China. This is almost a contradiction in words and deeds, deliberately confusing the hearing. Cooperation can only be achieved through peaceful methods based on mutually beneficial conditions. Therefore, China is now determined to continue the war of resistance to gain freedom. Mr. Gu continued: "I do not believe that the participating countries will refuse to uphold the sacred principles of the treaty. This principle is the main pillar of world peace. China is now determined to prepare to negotiate peace, because true peace must be based on the principles of Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty and requires the full cooperation of all countries."

Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty mentioned in Dr. Gu Weijun's speech includes the four principles of Mr. Rhodes of the United States, which stipulates ① respecting China's sovereignty and independence, as well as the integrity of its territory and administration, ② giving China a full and unimpeded opportunity to develop and maintain a strong and solid government, ③ using the power of various countries to effectively establish and maintain the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of various countries throughout China, ④ not taking advantage of China's situation to seek special rights that would reduce the rights of friendly countries, and not encouraging actions that would harm the security of friendly countries.

### Speeches by Soviet and Portuguese Representatives

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference continued its meeting at 4:40 this afternoon until 6:10. Litvinov, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, and Castro, the representative of Portugal, delivered speeches. Litvinov advocated that the conference should put forward various proposals to restore the peaceful situation and punish the aggressor countries as a warning to others. After Dr. Gu Weijun finished his speech (the words are in the previous section), Portuguese representative Castro then took the floor, saying that Portugal is happy to support all mediation work that is carried out within Portugal's neutral scope. The conference then adjourned and scheduled to reopen at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 3rd)

In his speech, Litvinov warned the audience that international conferences are sometimes used by aggressors, especially when the conference is prolonged indefinitely. The most concerning thing for various countries is that they may only be concerned with maintaining their own existence, or that the initiators of the conference may obtain moral satisfaction, or only seek superficial success, which is unrelated to the success of the doctrine. Litvinov said that he believes that this conference will be able to establish a just peace and restore peace in the Far East, and move forward towards its goals. If so, the aggressor's hand will not be loosened, but will be further restrained, not only for today but also for the future, not only in the Far East but also in other parts of the world. (Reuters)

### Talks between Chinese and Italian Representatives

Brussels – People from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference recently commented on the situation of today's meeting, and all said that the speech delivered by Chinese representative Gu Weijun was the most important at the afternoon meeting today. According to what the Chinese people here said, the position taken by the Chinese government can be seen in Gu's speech. In other words, China is prepared to accept any procedure, but on the condition that the final solution respects the current treaty, especially Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Note: Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that the contracting countries agree to respect China's sovereignty, independence, territory and administrative integrity.) Gu visited the chief Italian representative, Count Marco della Torre, a former member of the Lytton Investigation Team, in the afternoon. People from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference also commented on Gu's move, because Gu was the representative sent by China when the Lytton Investigation Team went to China to work, and Count Marco della Torre had a graceful relationship with him when they worked together. In addition, people from the conference also commented on the speech delivered by the Portuguese representative today, saying that the country's attitude was clearly different from the attitude it held in the London Adjustment Committee. Generally speaking, the country's attitude towards the Spanish issue is restricted by various domestic and geographical concepts. For other international issues, it still reverts to the traditional pro-British policy. In addition, Portugal retains significant interests in the Far East. Since the Japanese navy occupied Lingding Island near Macau, the Portuguese authorities themselves are uneasy about it. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 3rd)

### It is Rumored that Italy Intends to Make a Proposal

Brussels – According to rumors here, the Italian representative Marco della Torre will propose to the conference to send an investigation team to the Far East. As of late at night, it has not been officially confirmed. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

### Conference Venue Arrangement

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was recently opened at the Tongru Academy here, as recorded in the previous telegram. The conference venue is located in the auditorium of the academy. There are two long tables in the hall, covered with green felt. A total of 48 representatives from various countries are sitting around the long table. Two hundred journalists are seated on the front podium. Experts from various national delegations are seated on the sides of the seats. Members of the diplomatic corps, most members of the Belgian government and other important people are all seated upstairs to listen. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 3rd)

### Britain and the United States Advocate Forming a Committee

Invite Japan to Participate

Beijing – People from the United States here recently announced that when the US representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Davis, met with British Foreign Secretary Eden late at night, he advocated sending a second invitation to the Japanese government. Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Daladier had already discussed this matter when they had lunch together at noon. In the afternoon, Eden and Daladier met for an hour, and the conversation was also related to this matter. The US delegation believes that the reason why the Japanese government refused to participate is because the conference was initiated by the League of Nations. In fact, this conference was convened in accordance with Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty and is completely independent. If Japan does not send personnel to attend the meeting, it will inevitably be unable to do anything. Therefore, the US delegation advocated that a committee be formed by the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty (excluding China), and that the committee send a second invitation to Japan to invite it to participate. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 3rd)

Beijing – The committees will hold separate closed meetings at 2:30 today. According to the latest news, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is still planning to make a final effort to obtain any form of Japanese cooperation, but it is generally felt that there is little hope for Japan's attempt to change. Furthermore, the Japanese side reiterated last night that the Japanese side had received instructions in advance to reject any new requests to attend the meeting. However, the conference authorities do not want to abandon any possible avenues in the early stages of the conference, so they still plan to make every possible attempt. Furthermore, no action has been decided on to date, but it is rumored in the lounge that various countries intend to recommend Britain and the United States to take on the responsibility of mediation, and whether Britain and the United States are willing to take on this thankless task, and whether the conditions will be accepted by Japan when they are put forward, there is no room for speculation in advance. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 3rd)

[Geneva] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, people from the League of Nations recently commented that the key to what kind of results this conference can achieve lies in the attitude of the United States. In other words, to what extent is the United States prepared to cooperate with the member states of the League of Nations? In any case, the Sino-Japanese issue will definitely be submitted to the League of Nations for discussion again. There are two reasons: one is that the General Assembly of the League of Nations has not been closed and is currently in extension, and can be convened at any time; the other is that China and the Soviet Union both insist that the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue of the General Assembly of the League of Nations should meet as soon as possible. Since the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has opened today, representatives of various countries that are members of the League of Nations will inevitably hold talks with US representatives outside the conference venue. This conversation will be beneficial to the future work of the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 3rd)

The main force of the enemy has been cut off. According to reports, food is scarce and they have switched to eating sorghum. The guards at various small data points north and south of the Great Wall are panicked. Except for a few cities such as Yingxian, Yangyuan, Huailai, Zhuolu, Yixian, Shouyang, Wanxian, and Puxian, the rest of the counties south of Ping Sui, east of Tongpu, west of Pinghan, and north of Zhengtai have been recaptured and have become a whole area. The Pinghan Road has been cut off, and the people have begun to mobilize extensively. The situation is developing favorably. I have heard about the distant focus, and I am respectfully reporting.

### Fierce Bloody Battle Unfolds in Wujiazhai, Our Encirclement and Annihilation Severely Crushes the Stubborn Enemy

Our Regiment Commander Leads Soldiers to Charge, Wounded But Does Not Retreat; Fierce Artillery Battles on Both Sides of the Suzhou Creek This Morning; The Remaining Enemies in Liujiazhai Are Being Searched and Killed

The bloody battle on both sides of the Suzhou Creek is still continuing. The stubborn enemy entrenched in Wujiazhai is where the main force of the enemy on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek is concentrated. After our army's encirclement and annihilation, more than half of the enemy's casualties have been severely hit. The battle last night was the most fierce. Our army launched a fierce counterattack, and the enemy also resisted stubbornly. The regimental commander of our □ division □ led the soldiers to charge himself, breaking through the enemy's central road. In a battle until midnight, our regimental commander was unfortunately wounded, but he refused to retreat. The division commander of our □ division, upon hearing the report, rushed to supervise the battle. The regimental commander was transferred to the rear for medical treatment. Starting at dawn this morning, the two sides launched the most fierce artillery battle again. The stubborn enemy repeatedly attempted to break through, but were repelled. As of noon today, they are still in an encircling bloody battle. The remnants of the enemy in the Tingtou area have indeed been completely eliminated. The remnants of the enemy in Liujiazhai are stubbornly resisting in western-style houses. After our army's search and killing, very few are left. In short, our army has built extremely solid positions on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, and new troops have been continuously arriving to reinforce them. Therefore, it is definitely possible to fight a death battle with the enemy. At the same time, the positions from north of Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang Guangfu Town were further advanced last night, threatening the enemy's rear. This road of the enemy is based on the Second Division. After our army's active counterattack and fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. According to prisoners of war, more than half of the Second Division of the enemy has died in consecutive days, and they are now reorganizing and replenishing their forces, and the entire line has been changed to a defensive posture and has no offensive capabilities, etc.

### Wu Family Warehouse Crossing River Enemy Forces Surrounded by Our Troops in Multiple Groups

Bloody Battle in East and West of Beixinjing All Night Long; East of Tingtou Village Recaptured Yesterday; Remaining Enemy Forces in Liujiazhai Still Resisting Stubbornly

Since the enemy forces secretly crossed the Suzhou River to the south bank, it has happened more than ten times. Their main force is concentrated in Yaojiazhai and Wujia Warehouse. A large number of enemy troops are covering those who secretly cross the river at these places, numbering about two to three thousand. The enemy forces are concentrated in Wujia Warehouse, because from there they can observe our Hongqiao Road positions and strike the back of Jiangqiao, threatening Nanxiang. Near Liujiazhai between the east of Beixinjing and Zhoujia Bridge, the enemy forces have also repeatedly crossed the river forcibly, attempting to echo Wujia Warehouse and invade towards Lincoln Road. After days of fierce suppression and annihilation by our troops, the number of enemy troops who crossed the river and were defeated and annihilated is not small. Our troops' crossfire is concentrated on the river bank, causing great power, and killing the enemy troops along the river one after another. Although it rained heavily yesterday, our troops still attacked in the rain and fought fiercely with the enemy. The besieged enemy, after our troops' continuous efforts, west of Beixinjing, up to Yaojiazhai at Shenjibang Estuary, has been gradually cleared after a bloody battle all night. The eastern part of Tingtou Village was recovered last night. The enemy forces scattered in all directions towards the river bank, and many were swept down by machine guns. The enemy facing Wujia Warehouse is the most rampant. After being surrounded by our troops, in order to eliminate them as soon as possible last night, our troops used fresh troops to break into the middle of the enemy from the central route. Under the dense rain of bullets and artillery fire, the enemy forces were divided into several small groups. Although the enemy repeatedly tried to break through, they could not succeed. The fierce battle continues until this morning, and they are still in our heavy siege. Except for a few small groups of enemies in Wujia, the enemy who crossed the river in the western section has been almost completely resolved.

East of Beixinjing, up to the section near the Shanghai West Concession at Zhoujia Bridge, only near Liujiazhai at the intersection of Huo Bilan Road, a few enemy troops who crossed the river are still scattered in various foreign houses. However, under the fierce crossfire bombardment of our troops, they are hiding and dare not come out. The number of people is small, and the connection is broken, so it is not enough to worry about. This morning, the enemy forces on the north bank bombarded the south bank with dense artillery, rumbling loudly, hoping to cover the enemy forces in Liujiazhai to break through and advance. Our troops responded calmly. By noon, the sound of artillery had become sparse, and our troops were holding on as before. According to news from a certain military agency, the battle in Wujia Warehouse yesterday was extremely fierce, and it did not stop from morning to night. The enemy there secretly crossed from Houjiadai on the opposite bank. This section of the river is only two or three feet wide. The enemy uses a new type of cloth bridge, so it is easier to cross the river. Currently, our large troops are stationed at the Wujia Warehouse position, and the battle has been going on for several days, which is extremely advantageous. When the enemy first crossed the river, there were as many as three to four thousand people, but as of this morning, there were only a little over a thousand remaining enemies, still fighting like trapped beasts. Now they are surrounded by our troops on three sides. The key points along the river are also guarded by our machine gun teams. There is no possibility of crossing again there. Yesterday afternoon, a certain fresh force of ours bravely charged the front of the enemy's position. After an hour of hand-to-hand combat, countless enemies were killed, and the enemy forces were finally dispersed and divided into two sections. Now they are attacked from both sides, and the battle line is even more chaotic. It is expected that it can be completely resolved in the next two days.

The Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:30 pm on the 4th that the remaining enemy troops scattered in the foreign houses west of Liujiazhai on the south bank of the Suzhou River were besieged by us. After a fierce battle all night, more than 70 people were killed by us again. As of this morning, there were still 40 to 50 survivors. The enemy forces on the north bank were unable to deploy and bombarded across the river with small steel cannons to prevent our troops from pursuing. Now our troops are closely monitoring to prevent the enemy from crossing the river to reinforce. Also, the remaining enemy troops trapped in the basement of the Shenxin Yarn Factory were bravely charged by our troops last night and attacked with hand grenades, killing another five of them. Only seven or eight people remain.

The Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1:10 pm on the 4th that the river body near Shenjibang in the western section of the Suzhou River is relatively narrow. The enemy has secretly crossed the river for several days, reaching more than two thousand people. After being intercepted by our troops, they were surrounded in Yaojiazhai along the river and Wujia Warehouse and Tingtou and other places. In the past three days, our troops have launched fierce attacks, killing many enemies. We also have heroic sacrifices. Last night, the enemy crossed the river again to reinforce and struggled hard, trying to connect all places into one. Therefore, from last night to this morning, the battle was extremely fierce. The enemy forces in Wujia Warehouse and Tingtou joined forces to attack Yaojiazhai in the west. Once it was broken through by the enemy, resulting in a part of our troops in Tingtou being cut off from the rear. Then our troops counterattacked and restored the original position at midnight, and took advantage of the victory to advance from Yaojiazhai, Yujidun and other places to attack the enemy, in order to support. A fierce battle took place this morning in Xujiaqiao. At the same time, the enemy in Wujia Warehouse also used a part of their forces to attack our Caijiazhai Chen positions in the south. However, after our counterattack, the enemy did not succeed.

### Enemy Warships Shelling Pudong Again

Central News Agency reported that at about 6 am today (the 4th), two enemy planes circled and reconnoitered in the Yangjing Town, Lannidu, and Tangqiao Town areas of Pudong. After 7:30, they left. After 8 o'clock, three other enemy planes flew to the Yangjing Town area of Pudong and dropped bombs. At the same time, an enemy gunboat moored at the No. 21 pontoon in the Huangpu River also fired fiercely at Yangjing Town, bombarding it until after 9 o'clock, destroying more than ten houses. The enemy planes are still coming and going to reconnaissance there.

### Short Commentary

Recently, there have been rumors from the outside world that Nanshi will be designated as a neutral zone. Mayor Yu has solemnly denied this. However, for the sake of settling the war refugees in this city, he agreed to consider it. According to this, Nanshi will not be designated as a neutral zone, but may be designated as a refugee zone. However, since the outbreak of war between China and Japan, enemy planes have been bombing everywhere. There is almost no territory in our country that has not been affected. Therefore, by analogy, not only Nanshi should be designated as a refugee zone, but the entire Shanghai should also be designated as a refugee zone. Not only the entire Shanghai should be designated as a refugee zone, but the entire Chinese territory should also be designated as a refugee zone. Otherwise, Nanshi is still our country's territory, still our country's life and property. What is the purpose of designating it as a refugee zone alone?

### Two National Heroes

One Dies for the Country, One Injured; The Heroic Deeds of Our Soldiers

On the evening of October 21, when our troops counterattacked the enemy's position, two battalions of our ××× Division were responsible for attacking the line of Yangjia Village, Laodanzhai, Xindanzhai, and Xuxuzhai. The artillery fire on both sides was very fierce. Before 2 am the next morning, they successively occupied the enemy's position. The enemy defending this place was the most famous Kumamoto Division (that is, the 6th Division) 13th Regiment. Both sides used bayonet charges in the final stage. The sound of shouting and killing shook the entire battlefield. The division had Private Pan Wenliang, holding a round shovel, and coordinated with two other soldiers from the same unit to rush into Yangjia Village. The enemy soldiers were waiting at their leisure. Suddenly, they stabbed Pan Wenliang in the corner of his eye with a bayonet. The second knife pierced Pan's left leg. After Pan was injured, not only did he not retreat, but he still bravely killed the enemy. He used a round shovel to strike the enemy's forehead accurately, killing the enemy. The remaining enemies were terrified and tried to escape. Pan immediately seized the enemy's gun and stabbed three enemy soldiers to death in a row. The entire company took advantage of the situation and rushed up to occupy the place. Afterwards, he was supported out of the fire line by his comrades and sent to the division's field hospital for treatment. After × Commander learned about it, he said that the soldier did not retreat after being injured, seized the enemy's gun, and stabbed three enemy soldiers to death. He was so brave that he could be a model for the best soldiers. In addition to receiving a gun and a reward of ten yuan, he was specially awarded a reward of thirty yuan and promoted two ranks to encourage him. At the same time, there was Squad Leader Zhao Xinwen of the division. When he rushed into the enemy's position, he was shot by a machine gun and injured. Five enemy soldiers came to capture him. Zhao then took the enemy by surprise and threw a hand grenade. All five enemy soldiers fell to the ground to avoid it. Zhao Xinwen then rose up and used a bayonet to completely stab all five enemy soldiers to death. Zhao was already seriously injured, and he also had to deal with the attack of five enemies. He exerted too much force and died heroically. After × Commander received this report, he shed tears and ordered that the squad leader's body be properly buried to comfort his heroic spirit.

### Military Model

Wounded Military Officers Show Deep Patriotic Feelings; Donate Salary to Purchase National Salvation Bonds

Since the Army ××× Division participated in the battle, the officers and soldiers have all been deeply aware of the great cause. Every battle, they always bravely moved forward and repeatedly defeated the strong enemy. Therefore, so far, the enemy has not only failed to advance a step into the × Division's position, but the division's position has gradually advanced. Zhou Quanfu, a lieutenant platoon leader of the division, was shot by four bullets in the fierce battle with the enemy on October 11, suffering eight injuries. After being injured, he was sent to the rear hospital in × place for treatment. Hearing that compatriots from all over the country are purchasing national salvation bonds, the platoon leader showed deep patriotic feelings and volunteered to purchase bonds with his monthly salary of fifty yuan. He also wrote to the division commander, explaining everything. The letter is excerpted below: ㊀ I have been in the army for ten years. I have been raised by the country and cultivated by you with various kinds of enthusiasm. I have been able to occupy a cadre position in the national army group and receive good treatment from the country. I often think that I should follow your daily instructions, be loyal to my duties, carry out orders, strictly abide by discipline, work hard, devote myself to the country, and wait for the opportunity to kill the enemy. When our division was ordered to participate in the fight against the enemy, it was indeed a good opportunity to kill the enemy. At that time, I vowed to save the country and destroy the enemy, and I had the determination to have the enemy but not me, in order to fulfill my original intention. However, our division has been holding against the enemy for more than a month, charging and killing many times. I hate my inability and improper command. Not only did I not establish any merit, but I was hit by four machine gun bullets by the enemy. I was also sent to the rear for recuperation by your staff. I am extremely ashamed and feel infinite humiliation, which I always remember. ㊁ I am now in the ×××× Temporary Army Hospital. The hospital is perfectly equipped, and there are medicines and nurses. Moreover, the Ministry of Military Administration sends people to the hospital to express condolences from time to time. The local merchants are the same. At this time of urgent military needs and national survival, the country can still care for and treat the wounded and soldiers who cannot produce and can only consume. Anyone with a little conscience will be moved. After I recover from my injuries, I will quickly return to the unit and fight against the enemy again to avenge myself. ㊂ I read in the newspaper in the ward that military needs are urgent, and the first phase of 500 million national salvation bonds has been open for subscription for some time. I was excited at that time. Although I have eight wounds on my body, I have been examined and found that the bones are not injured. After two months of recuperation, I can still kill the enemy. During these two months of rest, the food, clothing, housing, and all are provided by the public, so there is no place to spend money. I intend to use my salary of eighty yuan for September and October to purchase national salvation bonds with fifty yuan and support my parents with thirty yuan. I implore you to pay in advance and deduct it from my salary for September and October. I also implore you to send a convenient person to purchase and send it on my behalf. Whether it is possible, I respectfully request your instructions. The platoon leader, as a soldier, has been injured, but he still pays his salary to purchase national salvation bonds, which is indeed a model among soldiers. It is said that after the division commander received the letter, he commended it greatly and ordered the division's political training office to send it to Shanghai for purchase on his behalf.

### Order in Nanshi Gradually Restored

No More Congestion at the Border Between the Chinese and French Concessions

At about 7 am this morning, about two or three teams of enemy planes passed over Nanshi and flew directly to the Shanghai West area to reconnoiter. It took a long time before they turned back, but they did not drop bombs. As for the situation in Nanshi, although it feels more desolate than in the past, the relocation of citizens has decreased. Therefore, the traffic at the border between the Chinese and French concessions is in good order, and there is no more congestion. At the important traffic points, police officers and members of the protection group organized by our citizens are maintaining order.

### The Enemy Continuously Spreads False Rumors

For days, the enemy troops have been attacking our troops fiercely, but they have not succeeded. Therefore, they do not hesitate to spread rumors in order to disturb people's hearts. However, our people are very clear about the military situation on the front lines and have not been moved by them at all. Therefore, the enemy's plan failed. This morning, they spread absurd rumors that the Japanese army had advanced to ×× place. In fact, the military situation in Shanghai West is close at hand. Chinese and foreign people can go to inspect the truth at any time. It is not difficult to see the truth. Therefore, this meaningless propaganda of the enemy only shows that they have exhausted their tricks and made a fool of themselves among friendly countries, which has no impact on us at all.

### The Puppet Organization in Baoshan is Complaining Endlessly

Miles Without Seeing a Soul; The Puppet Mayor is Struggling to Cope

Since Baoshan's urban and rural areas have fallen, the enemy's insatiable greed has intensified. They even dare to appoint officials and confer titles, intending to occupy it for a long time. Previously, the enemy arbitrarily appointed the Japanese Yoshida as the puppet county chief of Baoshan, ordering the traitors who tend to the foul to go out and distribute grain and conscript laborers, which was already extremely illegal. However, Yoshida, who is like a monkey wearing a hat, recently changed the districts under Baoshan's jurisdiction, ㊀ urban area, ㊁ Dachang, ㊂ Liuhang, ㊃ Luodian, ㊄ Yuepu, into various towns, and the puppet mayors of each town were also appointed. Yao, the puppet mayor of Weidian Town, followed Yoshida's orders especially carefully, sucking boils and licking hemorrhoids, doing everything possible. However, the population of Baoshan is not comparable to that of a large county. Moreover, after this unprecedented catastrophe, except for those who were arbitrarily killed by the Japanese and those who escaped, there are almost no people for miles. The puppet county chief then ordered the puppet mayors of each town to forcibly pull in refugees from other places to act as obedient people. However, the number is extremely limited, and they escape again when they get the chance. The puppet mayors cannot report back and are complaining endlessly. In addition, according to the statistics of the Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association, there are more than 100,000 refugees from Baoshan stranded in Shanghai. Although they have been accommodated and rescued, there is still too little porridge for too many monks. Moreover, the winter season is approaching, and many women and children lack clothes to keep out the cold. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically donate and send them directly to the Fellow Villagers Association at No. 10 Fada Road for verification and forwarding.

### Ten Criminals Arrested in the Zhongshan Steel Factory Theft Case

Stolen Goods Claimed to be Hidden in Shanghai West; Difficult to Investigate Due to the War Zone

The Japanese-owned Zhongshan Steel Factory at No. 488 Bailinan Road reported that after the outbreak of the war, about 150,000 pieces of iron sheet stored in the factory, worth about 300,000 yuan, were suddenly stolen. The factory reported the case to the police station. Recently, Jiang Shangpei and Wu Yaozu, Chinese detectives of the General Patrol Room, and detective Ren Fengwu learned that Cai Ruisheng had contacted the British-owned Longmao Foreign Company at No. 77 Guangdong Road to sell 15,000 pieces of iron sheet, with a selling price ranging from 2.3 yuan to 2.7 yuan per piece. It was found that what he intended to sell was the stolen goods from the Zhongshan Factory. Therefore, Cai was arrested. According to Cai's confession, nine people were involved: Lu Renchang, Zhu Linjun, Zhang Hongguang, Xiao Jiahong, Gu Zhaotai, Su Xiaonong, Jiang Mengping, Chen Caiqing, and Zhou Tingcai. The detectives arrested them all together and learned that the stolen goods were stored in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West. Now that the place has become a battlefield, it is difficult to investigate and retrieve them. This morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, requested a postponement because further investigation was needed. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he was allowed to postpone the review.

### Various Yarn Factories Need Male and Female Workers

Registration Organized by the War Zone Refugee Association

The Shanghai Charity Federation United Disaster Relief Association Rescue War Zone Refugee Committee stated that various yarn factories in the safe zone of this port have successively started work and need many workers. Therefore, worker registration is specially organized to facilitate job placement. A notice was recently sent to various reception centers: "For the sake of notification, recently, various yarn factories in the safe zone of this port have successively started work, and many workers are needed, especially skilled female workers in the cloth weaving room (that is, the weaving room) are in urgent need. Once hired, food and accommodation can be provided by the hiring factory, and wages will be paid.

We hope that you will fill it out in detail and send it to the association to facilitate job placement. This is a special notice."

### Chamber of Commerce Applies for Facilitation of Charcoal Transportation

Those with Certificates Allowed to be Inspected and Released

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Command yesterday to facilitate fuel matters: "Respectfully, according to the letter from the charcoal industry association, charcoal is a necessity for people's daily life. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the source has been blocked. Our chamber has repeatedly been ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to find ways to dredge it. It is related to people's livelihood, so we dare not slack off. However, the charcoal transported to Shanghai from the interior is all unloaded in the Nanmatou area. Now that the military situation is urgent and the enemy is bombing Nanshi, it is necessary to choose another location for unloading to ensure safety. The Yuhang Pier in the former Sixteen Shop of the French Concession has a wide river surface and can accommodate many ships. It is proposed to dock the charcoal ships there for unloading. However, in this extraordinary period, it should be submitted to the military and political organs and approved by the French Engineering Bureau to avoid any obstacles at that time. Now that our members have applied, we hereby send a letter to your association for verification. We hope that you will forward it to the command for review and approval. All charcoal with transportation certificates from your association will be allowed to be inspected and released. At the same time, we will also send a letter to the French Engineering Bureau, asking them to allow charcoal ships to dock at the former Sixteen Shop Yuhang Pier to facilitate commercial transportation and benefit the people." After receiving the letter, the chamber checked that charcoal is needed for cooking fuel. The source of supply in this city mostly relies on the interior. If the transportation is interrupted midway, it will be as alarming as the residents lacking rice. According to the previous situation in the letter, your department should try its best to facilitate the people's livelihood. All those in the industry who hold certificates issued by this chamber will be allowed to be inspected and released without obstruction, which is truly a public benefit.

### Fresh Pork Subject to Transit Tax

The fresh pork industry association should inform the pork traders to pay taxes according to the regulations in order to help the country. Please forward this notice to the public. Seal of the 30th Customs of the Ministry of Finance."

### Defending Greater Shanghai and Zhu Yaohua's Suicide

— Guo Woli

Everyone in Shanghai knows it is the center of our economic structure. In order to strike at our economic lifeline and disrupt our entire financial market, the enemy, following the Lugouqiao Incident, rushed in like wild boars to invade on a large scale. They amassed 200,000 troops, more than 100 warships, and over 300 aircraft, a force that cannot be called anything but formidable. However, for two months, they have only wasted ammunition, and their soldiers are stuck in a corner of Songhu. Our heroic soldiers have suffered great losses in their bloody and bitter battles. Recently, with the Nine-Power Treaty Conference about to open, in order to divert international attention, they have recklessly made a desperate gamble, launching a fierce offensive, and conducting large-scale bombing in various parts of Dachang, turning it into a scorched earth. As a result, our defense works were completely destroyed. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and implement a long-term war of resistance, we safely and voluntarily retreated to the second line of defense on the 27th. If the enemy invades again, they will certainly pay an extremely high price. In fact, the deeper they enter the interior, the more helpless the enemy will feel, and the more they will only increase their sacrifices.

On the day our army retreated, the raging flames of Zhabei could be seen everywhere. What a moving and heroic scene this was, truly heartbreaking and shocking, bringing tears to our eyes and further strengthening our resolve to fight the enemy with a common hatred. We are not afraid of the enemy's strong armor and sharp weapons. Even if we are empty-handed, we will fight them one by one. These terrifying and cruel means are not enough to frustrate our will. Even under the onslaught of aircraft and heavy artillery, in one corner of Zhabei, there was still an earth-shattering event taking place. Surrounded by enemy troops, they were still carrying out their sacred mission, that is, General Xie Jinyuan's eight hundred soldiers in the Sihang Warehouse, vowing to live and die with the building. Following Yao Ziqing's battalion and Qin Chunrong's regiment, another heroic historical site of resistance was produced, which is enough to show the greatness of the Chinese national character and the supreme glory of Greater Shanghai.

This full-scale war of resistance was launched in Shanghai. The war of resistance in Shanghai stood in a leading position and was indeed able to set an example. In a short period of time, it won international admiration and obtained world sympathy. This is a great achievement. Although we have now retreated to the second line of defense due to strategic reasons, this is by no means a demonstration of the enemy's irresistible force.

Did the enemy really win? Did we fail? Absolutely not. It is neither the enemy's victory nor our defeat, but rather trapping the enemy in a more difficult environment, which in turn reduces our own difficulties. This is not only passively refusing to give up Greater Shanghai, but also actively consolidating Greater Shanghai. The people lurking in the concession must know that the soldiers on the front line, regardless of all sacrifices, use their flesh and blood to resist sharp artillery fire, originally in order to save the nation's crisis and protect our Greater Shanghai. How should we be moved to tears, fulfill our obligations, strive to transport supplies, and aid the soldiers who are fighting to the death on the front lines.

In this war of resistance in Shanghai, among the National Revolutionary Army, in addition to the deeply moving and exciting materials, few disappointing events occurred. In recent days, honestly speaking, under the quadruple pressure of the enemy's most elite naval, land, air, and mechanized chemical teams, we only heard of Luo Lin's dismissal and investigation, and this time the division commander Zhu Yaohua, who was defending Dachang, due to ineffective resistance, shook the line from Dachang to the North Railway Station, which inevitably made our hearts feel a little disappointed. Now, because of the loss of Dachang, Division Commander Zhu felt he had no way to face the people of the country, no way to face the mission of defending Greater Shanghai, and indignantly committed suicide, dying to apologize to the people of the country.

From Division Commander Zhu's suicide, we can imagine the pain in his heart and the uncontrollable grief and indignation. In the great national war of resistance, we certainly hope that the generals will live and die with the land they defend. Even if they unfortunately sacrifice, they can forge the great soul of the Chinese nation. At the same time, we should also have a feeling of understanding and pity for those generals who have made minor mistakes and therefore committed suicide out of shame and anger. In any case, it is always ten thousand times better than those who harbor sinister intentions, take a wait-and-see attitude, remain idle, and lose important positions. At least he always vented some anger for the nation and did some work.

Although Division Commander Zhu did not complete the mission of defending Greater Shanghai, he still did a considerable amount of work to defend Greater Shanghai and did not fail to be a general with personality and vigor. In addition to continuing to intensify the implementation of this mission to defend Greater Shanghai, we should pay the highest respect to the portrait of Division Commander Zhu.
