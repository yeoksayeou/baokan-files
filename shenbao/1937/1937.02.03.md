### Fu Zuoyi Urges His Subordinates Not to Give the Enemy Another Opportunity to Invade

We Must Use Popular Support and Spirit to Overcome Everything; We Will Not Determine Our Actions Based on Self-Interest

[Guihua] Chairman Fu's speech at the memorial week on the 1st is as follows in full:

Today, I have several things to report to everyone. That is, we have now obtained a "command" from bandit-puppet division commander Zhang Futang (i.e., Zhang Wanqing), which was forwarded by the First Army Headquarters of Shangdu based on a telegram from the Tanaka Agency Chief. The main two points are as follows: 1. Agency Chief Tanaka absolutely trusts you (referring to Zhang Wanqing). Generally, the state of China is such that we have an opportunity for development, and there is nothing to worry about. Strive to follow the direction indicated by a small official (small official is what Tanaka calls himself). 2. It is necessary to make subordinates thoroughly understand the major events of the overall situation in China, especially the Xi'an Incident, and explain it to them. It is necessary to strive hard, and there is the possibility of great success, and so on. After we have finished reading this order from the bandit side, we should think that the internal turmoil in our country is a good opportunity for the enemy to advance. The enemy takes advantage of our mutual disturbance of order and unrest to strive for his army. In the past, many incidents in our country have created a good opportunity for the enemy to reach out, and also created an opportunity for the enemy to invade our land and sovereignty. Now, we Chinese people should realize that the enemy comes to invade us because we first created the opportunity for the enemy. It is not entirely relying on his strength. If we do not create an opportunity for the enemy, the enemy would never dare to easily invade us. At present, we should thoroughly realize this and not give the enemy another opportunity to invade. Then the enemy will have no way and cannot invade us. When the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War began, the people of all walks of life in Suiyuan were completely united in spirit, so they could cope with this incident. But at that time, there were a very few intellectuals who had a different view. They said that our Suiyuan's various preparations were inferior to others in every way, so instead of seeking a peaceful solution, they talked about resistance, which would inevitably lead to local chaos. This statement cannot be considered a big mistake at the time, because estimating the strength of the enemy and ourselves, we really had no certainty of victory. However, I believe that the Chinese people today should make up their minds not to determine our actions based on self-interest, but to win the final victory with a spirit of sacrifice. We are in a time of severe national crisis, and we must work to save the nation and survive. Material is not our main condition. We must use "popular support" and "spirit" to overcome everything. Before the War of Resistance, we could not predict certain victory, but we all had the determination not to be slaves of a conquered nation in our hearts, so we could disregard everything and fight the enemy to the death. Although we are not sure of winning battles when we fight the enemy, we are sure not to be slaves of a conquered nation. However, we are all sure of this because our country must perish before people perish. History tells us that this is absolutely true. We will not talk about the entire war this time. Now we will only talk about the Battle of Hongge'ertu. The Battle of Hongge'ertu started on November 15th last year. Hongge'ertu is 160 li from Taolin, 180 li from Pingdiquan, and only 60 li from the enemy's base. It is a very small place. The troops stationed there in our country were only two cavalry companies, with a population of more than 200 people, under the responsibility of Lieutenant Colonel Zhang for guarding. At the same time, the fortifications there were very simple, and the enemy suddenly launched a fierce attack on our positions on the 25th. We all know that cavalry can only move around and fight guerrillas, not defend. Defending is also unsuccessful. Moreover, at that time, our telegraph lines were also cut off by the enemy, so the news was not communicated. The enemy had 5,000 to 7,000 troops, and we had only 200 people. Compared to each other, there was a difference of dozens of times. At the same time, the enemy had artillery and aircraft to help in the battle, and we only had rifles. If we had calculated based on self-interest and considered material conditions at that time, we would not have been able to win and Hongge'ertu would not have been able to be defended. But the result was that victory belonged to us. Therefore, the Battle of Hongge'ertu was the most valuable battle of this war, and it was also our spirit of sacrifice that won the victory. At that time, the mission Lieutenant Colonel Zhang received was to guard, not to defend to the death, but he was able to achieve such results because of his spiritual strength, so he got this harvest. We must seek national rejuvenation in this spirit. The above proves that if we do not create opportunities for the enemy, we are not afraid of the enemy, and at the same time, everyone is not willing to be a slave of a conquered nation, and is determined that the country can perish but I will never be a slave of a conquered nation. We may not be sure of winning if we fight the enemy like this, but we are all sure not to be slaves of a conquered nation. With the spirit of sacrifice, we will confront the enemy, and we will definitely be able to win, because our blood can overcome the enemy's aircraft and artillery, and our fearless spirit can overcome the enemy's material. In this way, the enemy will never be able to destroy us. So I believe that the Chinese nation cannot be rejuvenated, but we must have: 1. Do not disrupt our formation and do not divide ourselves. 2. Do not seek temporary peace, but strive to become strong. 3. Do not be afraid of the enemy, do not be discouraged, and use the spirit of sacrifice to overcome everything. I hope everyone will fully contribute our physical and mental strength to the country and work together to complete the mission of rejuvenation. (2nd, Central News Agency Telegram)

Current Commentary

### Establishment of the Japanese Hayashi Cabinet

— Auxiliary

Since General Ughaki was received on the 24th of last month to organize a cabinet. After five days of struggle, it ultimately failed due to the strong opposition from the military, who refused to recommend a successor to the Minister of the Army. On the 29th, he entered the palace to decline the mandate to organize a cabinet. After Ughaki resigned, Prince Saionji originally intended to recommend Hiranuma to organize a cabinet, but after learning that the military's opposition to Hiranuma was no less than that of Ughaki, he recommended General Hayashi Senjuro to organize a cabinet. On the evening of the 29th, the Emperor issued the order. After receiving the order, General Hayashi began to organize the cabinet, and after several contacts with various parties, he formed a new cabinet on the 1st and officially took office on the 2nd. Thus, the cabinet turmoil that had lasted for more than ten days subsided.

The newly established Hayashi Cabinet, no matter how one looks at it, is under the influence of the military. First, considering General Hayashi himself, he is fundamentally a soldier. He has previously held important positions such as Minister of the Army and Governor-General of Korea. During his tenure as Governor-General of Korea, the September 18th Incident occurred, and he took the liberty of deploying troops into the territory of the Northeast Provinces to serve as reinforcements for the Kwantung Army. After taking on the task of organizing the cabinet this time, the military provided him with strong support. However, General Hayashi had slightly different opinions from the military regarding the candidates for the Minister of the Army and Navy. General Hayashi intended to appoint Itagaki and Suetsugu as ministers respectively, but the previous Ministers of the Army and Navy recommended Nakamura and Yonai respectively. The result was naturally that General Hayashi gave in. At the same time, General Hayashi accepted all the conditions put forward by the military. The conditions put forward by the army were: ㊀ Fully recognize the Army Ministry's demands regarding the implementation of the national defense budget and the increase in army expenses for six consecutive years. ㊁ Implement innovation policies and other policies advocated by the previous Minister of the Army as soon as possible. The main conditions put forward by the Navy for joining the cabinet were two. First, the fundamental policy of expanding armaments in the first year without treaty restrictions and the urgent third supplementary plan budget must be implemented quickly and smoothly. Second, the unification of diplomacy. In particular, the fundamental policy of diplomacy towards China must be re-examined. General Hayashi accepted all these conditions one by one.

From the process of General Hayashi organizing the cabinet, the new cabinet is indeed entirely under the influence of the military. From the organizational nature of the new cabinet, it can be seen that it has already implemented the military's consistent主張(zhuzhang - position/viewpoint). We know that during the previous cabinet, the military demanded the reform of administrative institutions. In this new cabinet, except for three or four departments, most of the other departments are held concurrently. For example, Prime Minister Hayashi also serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Education, Finance Minister Ketsugi Toyotaro also serves as Minister of Colonial Affairs, Agriculture Minister Yamazaki Tatsunosuke also serves as Minister of Communications, and Railway Minister Godo Takuo also serves as Minister of Commerce and Industry. This situation is nothing less than a preliminary manifestation of the military's demand for reform of administrative institutions.

Since the new cabinet is entirely under the control of the military, its future policies will naturally follow the military's orders. In terms of domestic affairs, the new cabinet's statist ideology will be further tightened. Its oppression of liberalism and its economic exploitation of the general public in order to expand armaments as much as possible. In terms of foreign affairs, there is no need to mention the vigorous implementation of the continental policy. Although the appointment of Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi as Minister of Foreign Affairs is intended to break the international isolation of Japan since the conclusion of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact on the one hand, it is also intended to intensify its policy of annexation towards China on the other hand. Because Saito Hiroshi, although he has served as a diplomat in Europe and the United States for many years, his views on annexing China are completely consistent with those of the military. We should still remember that when the "April 17th" Amau Doctrine was published, it caused a great backlash in Europe and the United States, but this new Minister of Foreign Affairs defended it in many ways, simply not treating China as a country.

Although the Hayashi Cabinet was successfully formed with the support of the military, its future is still not entirely optimistic. Because of the serious repercussions it will cause at home and abroad. In particular, China's national policy is of great importance to the fate of the Hayashi Cabinet.

### Mississippi River Water Continues to Rise in the United States; Military and Civilians Strive to Prevent Flooding

Waves Impacting Embankments Sound Like a Thousand Drums Beating in Unison; If the Wind Does Not Stop, the Sluice Gates are in Danger of Collapse

Cairo, Illinois: This place is where the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers meet. The overflowing floodwaters, agitated by the wind, are impacting the banks, sounding like a thousand drums beating in unison. The superstructure of the levee is in imminent danger. The last batch of 4,500 flood control personnel are on standby. The struggle between man and nature is at its most dangerous point. The battle line stretches 1,200 miles, and there is a risk of collapse at any time. In order to provide early warning as a precaution, sentries on the levee stand at the end of the levee day and night in the bitter cold, as if facing a formidable enemy. In the event of a breach, the entire city could be submerged in 20 feet of water within minutes. Rescue boats are also standing by with fires lit in case personnel need to be evacuated in an emergency. Furthermore, the amount of water flowing from the Ohio River into the Mississippi River is approximately 3 million cubic feet per second. However, the flood control personnel are confident that the flood barrier they built is sufficient to save the city, so their morale is excellent. It is also reported that the water level in Cincinnati, Ohio, has receded. Relief workers are working to clean up the mud. However, opportunistic merchants have been discovered buying flood-damaged properties and abandoned livestock at low prices. Mr. Heberkin, the director of the Flood Disaster Committee, has been ordered to go to the disaster area for a week-long inspection. The Red Cross has raised $8.3 million of its proposed $10 million, and according to preliminary estimates, approximately 400 lives have been lost and approximately 1 million people have been left homeless in this flood. (Second-day Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency)

Memphis: The Lower Bessie Sluice Gate, which protects Reelfoot Lake and the city of Tiptonville, is being impacted by the massive waves of the Mississippi River today and is showing signs of collapse. Army engineers have mobilized five battalions of the Civilian Conservation Corps to do their best to prevent the flooding. However, the sandbags placed on the gate have been washed away in the blink of an eye. If the wind does not stop, the sluice gate may not be able to be saved. If it collapses one day, Reelfoot Lake and three cities in western Tennessee will be completely submerged. Tiptonville will also be affected. There are many disaster victims there. The government has prepared several barges capable of holding thousands of people to prevent emergencies. The army is densely stationed along the river from Cairo to the mouth of the Arkansas River, and at the command, flood control personnel will be ordered to retreat. There are now 100,000 people working on the embankments. The water in Louisville has receded, and some stores have resumed business. (First-day Guomin News dispatch)

### Fighting Breaks Out in US Auto Workers' Strike

Michigan Governor Mobilizes Troops to Suppress

Flint, Michigan: Fighting broke out in the Chevrolet Motor Plant here, involving 300 workers. Before the fighting, the workers held a meeting and announced that one union member had been expelled. During the fighting, several shots were fired, and workers outside the factory smashed some of the factory building's windows with sticks. Today, General Motors has petitioned the authorities to evict the "sit-down strike" workers from the company's two plants. After a four-hour court hearing, the judge announced that the verdict would be given tomorrow, as the court wants to wait for the union to present reasons for not evicting them and does not want to act rashly. According to the company, the strikers occupying the plant are no longer employed by the company, and nearly 80% of the 135,000 unemployed workers are willing to return to work. The strikers occupying the plant are still being supplied with heat and water by the factory, and their food is delivered by those sympathetic to the strike. Those who violate the strike rules are tried and punished by a court organized by the workers inside the factory. Those who have committed offenses are punished by serving as extra patrol members and doing hard labor such as sweeping. (First-day Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency)

Flint: The authorities have mobilized 1,200 troops to monitor the area outside the General Motors factory, where striking workers are occupying the plant. Upon hearing the news, the wives, sisters, and girlfriends of the workers have also formed a women's team, wearing red beanies, armbands in red and white, and holding clubs. When the troops take any action, they will come forward to protect the striking workers and persist to the end. They have no firearms and are currently searching for gas masks to defend against tear gas. (First-day Havas Agency dispatch)

Flint: The 3,000 night-shift workers at the Chevrolet No. 4 plant have gone on strike. The factory building is now surrounded by 1,200 guards, who intend to force the striking workers to surrender.

Strike leaders are now planning to form a women's emergency team to forcibly deliver food to the trapped workers in the Chevrolet factory. (Third-day Guomin News dispatch)

### A Glimpse of the Thirteen Soviet Russian Party Prison Defendants Before Execution

Pyatakov Cried Out, Begging to See His Wife One Last Time. The Rest Generously Faced Execution, Crying Out That Radek Had Sold His Friends.

[Paris] The Paris Evening News recently published a report from a correspondent in Riga, confirming the rumor that Lenin's wife had been arrested. It also stated that the third trial of the Trotskyite counter-revolutionaries will open in April. As for the thirteen defendants sentenced to death in the "Parallel Center" case, they were executed last night in the prison courtyard of the Moscow Political Police Bureau. The execution was carried out by sixteen soldiers, commanded by a Latvian named Peterson, who has a beard. He is known externally as the "Bearded Executioner." Previously, each of the defendants had requested amnesty from the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee. The Presidium organized a committee to study and discuss the requests for three hours. Several committee members favored amnesty, and Chief Prosecutor Vyshinsky reportedly believed that since the main defendants in the case, such as Radek, had been spared death, there was no reason to execute the other defendants. However, Stalin was resolute and could not be swayed. The Presidium ultimately rejected the request for amnesty. Before the execution, Vyshinsky felt unwell and therefore did not participate, leaving the prison beforehand. Among the thirteen defendants, Pyatakov cried out loud before the execution and asked to see his wife one last time. The prison historian told him that she was not in Moscow. Geslavsky, on the other hand, was mentally disturbed. There was no place to tie him up in the prison courtyard, so they had to place him on the ground and shoot him. The other defendants generously faced execution, without any fear, and shook hands with each other to say goodbye. One of them cried out, "Radek and Sokolnikov are traitors who sold their friends!" The corpses of the thirteen defendants were immediately loaded onto hearses and buried in a common pit. Thus, the Parallel Center case came to an end. (Havas, 2nd)

### Radek Spared from Death

Due to Clever Defense

[Paris] The verdict in the Moscow "Parallel Center" case resulted in one of the defendants, Radek, the former chief writer of Pravda, being spared from death. The local "Business News" recently commented on this, stating that Radek's survival was due to his clever defense. According to his confession, there were aspects of the Trotskyite secret activities that were not known to the outside world. He knew them well. When he met with a certain German diplomat in a villa, Bukharin, the former chief writer of Izvestia, was also present and also knew about them. The Supreme Court likely believed that because the third Trotskyite case was about to open, and Bukharin and Rykov, the former Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, were both implicated, Radek could provide powerful testimony. (Havas, 2nd)

### Large-Scale Activity by Secret Police

Nearly a Hundred People Implicated in Party Prison Case

Warsaw – Pyotr Pavlov, who ordered the execution of the Russian Tsar and his family, has been arrested. Uglanov, who, along with Bukharin and Rykov, was a leader of the "Right Opposition," has recently been arrested by the secret police. Pirogov and Uglanov were both considered to have participated in a conspiracy against Stalin in the Trotskyite reaction case, and the Soviet press is demanding that they be sentenced to the extreme penalty. (National Telegram, 1st)

[Paris] According to reports in the local newspapers, Bronstein, the manager of the Baltic Shipping Company in Leningrad, has been arrested by the secret police. Bronstein is a relative of Trotsky. (National Telegram, 1st)

[London] A correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" reports that the "confessions" of the defendants in the Moscow Trotskyite reaction case implicate approximately one hundred people. It is widely believed that these one hundred people have all been arrested, but it is not yet known whether there will be a public trial. The "Daily Herald" has learned that Radek and Sokolnikov may have to be questioned along with Bukharin and Rykov, and other "Trotskyites," based on new evidence. (National Telegram, 2nd)

### Of Lenin's Circle, Only Stalin Remains

[Moscow] A local workers' pamphlet recently published states that of the members of the Communist Party Politburo at the time of Lenin's death, only Stalin is still free. Of the other six, Zinoviev and Kamenev have been executed, Tomsky committed suicide half a year ago, Rykov and Bukharin have been arrested, and Trotsky has fled abroad. (National Telegram, 1st)

㊁ Chuu Ouchi of the Seiyukai and Yanetaro Mizui of the Minseito have both refused to join the cabinet, so it is completely isolated from both the Seiyu and Minsei parties.

㊂ In selecting the successor to the Army Minister, the initial policy of forming a cabinet was abandoned, so that the representative figure of the benchmark reform faction, Shinji Sogo, withdrew midway, and only then was it possible to complete the cabinet formation.

㊃ Therefore, the new cabinet's political program is nothing more than a list of extremely commonplace words. Its essence is no different from the Saito, Okada, and Hirota cabinets. It could even be said that its sense of reform is a step backward compared to the Hirota cabinet. Moreover, the Hayashi cabinet's relationship with the military and with the political parties contains many hidden dangers, and its future is even more noteworthy.

As for the issue of recommending the Army Minister, in the future, it will inevitably increase the degree of internal conflict. Regarding its relationship with the political parties, although it is currently threatened by the atmosphere of dissolution, if it is inevitable to the point of dissolution, then the political parties will definitely decide to adopt a counter-offensive attitude. The Hayashi cabinet, which is completely isolated from the Seiyu and Minsei parties, is difficult to predict how it will respond. Some people say that it may try to work with the Seiyu and Minsei parties and plan to establish a new political party. However, it is very doubtful whether the political parties will make every effort to organize a party organization for the current cabinet, which has no party members as ministers. Also, because the number of cabinet members is very small, the control within the cabinet is relatively easy. Looking at the list of cabinet members, it is immediately clear that it is a motley crew, lacking a central collective. If it is considered as a cabinet to deal with the current major and difficult situation, it is suspected of lacking vigor. Therefore, the general public anticipates that it will inevitably have a short life. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi met with a group of reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence at 2:00 pm on the 2nd and gave a speech saying that he had been ordered to form a cabinet at this extraordinary time. To stabilize the people's hearts and develop the country's strength, he must have extraordinary determination. He will do his best to repay the country, and he hopes that everyone will spare no effort to help him. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

### Various Current Problems

Dealing with the Parliament and Revising the Budget. Oohashi Confers with the Speakers of Both Houses.

[Tokyo] After returning home from the cabinet formation headquarters last night, the new Finance Minister, Toyotaro Yuki, told reporters that the issue of party members joining the cabinet could be resolved tonight. Their withdrawal from the political parties is not a necessary condition, but a matter of their own will. The new cabinet hopes that the political parties will assist in the issue of whether or not to dissolve the parliament, which should be decided after the appointment ceremony is completed. If the parliament is not dissolved, the budget bill submitted during the Hirota cabinet will be withdrawn by the parliament, and the new cabinet will resubmit it to the parliament. Whether or not to amend it at that time can be decided after the appointment ceremony. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

[Tokyo] After the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet, the issue of whether or not to dissolve the parliament is the focus of attention from all parties. However, since the current government is not only not actively opposed to the cabinet by the Seiyu and Minsei parties, but rather indicates that it will use a principle of right and wrong to pass the budget bill, the initial approach is not to deal with the parliament with a policy of dissolution. Depending on the situation in the parliamentary arena, measures will be taken as appropriate. However, the new Finance Minister, Yuki, will make some revisions to the financial and economic policies of the former Finance Minister, Maba. Therefore, there is a need for the parliament to temporarily suspend or even adjourn. The Chief Secretary, Oohashi, held a long discussion with the Chief Secretaries of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives on the afternoon of the 2nd. In general, even if the parliament reconvenes on the 3rd, the government will not request a suspension. According to the decision of the negotiating committees of each faction of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, the adjournment will continue. The Chief Secretaries of both houses have requested understanding from both houses. The adjournment is scheduled to be approximately ten days from the 3rd. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

[Tokyo] The emergence of the Hayashi Cabinet and the issue of the immediate dissolution of the 70th Diet are the most important events of concern in various aspects of the political world. Moreover, how the results will be determined is an important key to determining the future political situation, which has aroused the attention of the general public. When Mitsumasa Yonai took office as Naval Minister, he put forward his cabinet conditions, and regarding the fundamental policy of expanding armaments after the first year of the non-treaty period, especially the implementation of the third supplementary plan, he has obtained the understanding and approval of General Hayashi. This third supplementary plan requires rapid and smooth implementation. If the budget for the Showa 12th year, which is based on the funding for this plan, is successfully passed in the Diet, the implementation period will inevitably be delayed compared to the naval plans of Britain and the United States due to the fiscal year relationship. The naval authorities do not approve of the immediate dissolution of the 70th Diet for this reason. Therefore, when the issue of Diet dissolution is a topic of discussion at the Hayashi Cabinet's cabinet meeting, the new Naval Minister, Yonai, will definitely express his beliefs and express the views of the Navy, hoping that the new cabinet will handle the Diet issue with a prudent attitude. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

### Seiyukai Criticizes the Cabinet

Saying It Submits to Army Blackmail

[Tokyo] The Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, Mr. Ando, ​​issued a statement as follows: The announcement of the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet temporarily stabilizes the political situation, which is gratifying. Our party takes the country as its foundation, and will use strict principles of right and wrong to review the policies of the new cabinet. We hereby declare this. However, the Hayashi Cabinet considers the power of the political parties and follows the blackmail of the army to exclude the political parties. This means that Prime Minister Hayashi does not have a firm and unswerving policy, and it is also felt that his cabinet is a weakling from birth. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

### Minseito Issues Statement

Attitude Toward the New Cabinet Determined in the Parliament

[Tokyo] Regarding the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet, the Minseito Party issued a statement on the 2nd in the form of a speech by its Secretary-General, Nagai, as follows: Prime Minister Hayashi, with his loyal, resolute personality and experience, is able to handle the heavy responsibility of dealing with the general situation during this major period of reform. The new cabinet must recognize the importance of the current situation and overcome the difficulties together with the national people. We should also assist the new cabinet from the perspective of the country, and at the same time realize the mission of national survival, stabilize the people's hearts, and do our best to contribute. Recently, the new cabinet has issued its political program. Our party will also decide its attitude towards the new cabinet at that time, and meet in the parliament. (Domei News Agency, 1st)

### Army and Navy Ministers Issue Statements

Each Implementing Fixed Policies

[Tokyo] After the first cabinet meeting, the new Army Minister, Nakamura, told reporters that at this time of great importance, he was appointed to the important military and administrative post, and he deeply felt the weight of his responsibility. The former Army Minister made it his mission to rectify military discipline, enrich national defense, and rejuvenate the administration. He believed that this was also his mission, and he would do his best to realize it. The whole country should recognize the importance of the situation, cooperate to overcome the difficulties, and support the imperial destiny. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

[Tokyo] After the first cabinet meeting, Naval Minister Yonai said as follows: At this time of great importance in internal and external affairs, he received the great command and assumed the heavy responsibility of Naval Minister. He would serve the public with utmost sincerity, and with a fresh spirit, lead his department to be loyal and answer the sacred command, and live up to the expectations of the people. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

### Hayashi Cabinet's First Cabinet Meeting

Only Ten Minutes Before Dissolving. Formal Agenda This Morning.

[Tokyo] The first cabinet meeting of the new Hayashi Cabinet was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at noon on the 2nd. All cabinet members, including Prime Minister Hayashi, attended. The Prime Minister delivered a speech on the formation of the cabinet, and it was decided that all cabinet members would cooperate. Then, the following important personnel matters were decided. The meeting adjourned after only ten minutes. It was decided to hold a formal cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 am on the 3rd to discuss the aftermath of the Diet dissolution issue and the policy towards the Diet. The important personnel matters decided at the cabinet meeting today were: Hachiro Oohashi was appointed as Chief Cabinet Secretary concurrently Director-General of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau; Shotaro Ishiwatari, Cabinet Investigator, was relieved of his post as Acting Director-General of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau; and Kanesuke Kaya, Director of the Financial Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was appointed as Vice-Minister of Finance. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

[Tokyo] The list of the Hayashi Cabinet is as follows:

Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Education: Hayashi Senjuro

Minister of Home Affairs: Kakichi Kawarada

Minister of Finance and Minister of Colonial Affairs: Toyotaro Yuki

Minister of the Army: Kotaro Nakamura

Minister of the Navy: Mitsumasa Yonai

Minister of Justice: Suehiko Shiono

Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, concurrently Minister of Communications: Tatsunosuke Yamazaki

Minister of Commerce and Industry, concurrently Minister of Railways: Takuzo Gotho

Chief Cabinet Secretary: Hachiro Oohashi

Director-General of the Legislation Bureau: Takeo Kawagoe

Lieutenant General Takuzo Gotho, President of Showa Steel Works, has agreed to assume the post of Minister of Commerce and Industry and concurrently Minister of Railways.

Tatsunosuke Yamazaki was invited by General Hayashi to assume the post of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry at 11:40 pm on the 1st and immediately agreed. General Hayashi also entrusted Toyotaro Yuki to negotiate with Baron Yorinori Arima, a member of the House of Peers, to join the cabinet, but Arima refused.

Tatsunosuke Yamazaki of the Showakai immediately announced his withdrawal from the party after promising General Hayashi to assume the post of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry last night. Judging from Yamazaki's political activities to date, Yamazaki will definitely be an important protagonist in the new political party establishment movement, and at the time of the establishment of the new party, several members of the Showakai will take the same action as Yamazaki.

General Hayashi is currently negotiating with Harumichi Tanabe, a member of the Advisory Council of "Manchukuo," to assume the post of Minister of Communications, but because Tanabe is an official of "Manchukuo," the procedures will take a considerable amount of time, so he cannot attend the appointment ceremony on the 2nd. Tatsunosuke Yamazaki will concurrently serve as Acting Minister of Communications and attend the appointment ceremony.

The appointment of the successor to the Vice-Minister of Finance was decided at the cabinet meeting on the 2nd, and Kanesuke Kaya, Director of the Financial Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was promoted to fill the vacancy.

After the appointment ceremony of the new cabinet was completed, Tetsuichi Terauchi was immediately appointed as a Military Councilor, Osamu Nagano as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the First Fleet, and the new Army Minister, Nakamura, was concurrently appointed as Director-General of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs.

### Marquis Nagashige Asano, Contributor to the Meiji Restoration, Passes Away

One of the Seven Loyal Clans

Hiroshima – Marquis Nagashige Asano, the lord of Hiroshima Domain and a contributor to the Meiji Restoration, was 96 years old this year. He had been receiving treatment at his home for senile asthma since the 12th of this month. His condition deteriorated on the evening of the 1st, and he passed away at 8:10 pm. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

Hiroshima – Marquis Nagashige Asano was born in the 13th year of the Tempo era. In the 5th year of the Ansei era, he became the adopted son of Nagayoshi Asano. In the 2nd year of the Meiji era, he inherited the fiefdom and was transferred to the position of Lord of Aki. At the time of the Meiji Restoration, he obeyed the imperial order and supported the military administration and the great cause of the restoration of the monarchy. At that time, he was one of the seven loyal clans, fought in various places, and made great contributions. Later, he served as a member of the Imperial Court, President of Accounting Affairs, Governor of Hiroshima Prefecture, a member of the Senate, and a minister to Italy. In the 17th year of the Meiji era, he received the title of Marquis and was appointed as a court official of the Ministry of the Imperial Household and Chief of the Peerage Bureau. In the 30th year of the Meiji era, he was appointed as an official of the House of Peers. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

### Analysis of the Hayashi Cabinet

[Tokyo] The Hayashi Cabinet, after many twists and turns, officially took office this morning. Counting back from the resignation of the Hirota Cabinet on the afternoon of January 23, it has been ten days. In Japanese history, it is not too long to spend ten days organizing a new cabinet. In fact, Hayashi spent only three days organizing the cabinet, so its success was quite rapid. Among the members of the new cabinet, aside from the Army and Navy Ministers, Toyotaro Yuki occupies the most important position. The rest of the cabinet members are all second or third-rate figures. The movement to organize a new cabinet was first thwarted by the issue of the Minister of National Defense, and then encountered setbacks because Nakajima and Nagai refused to accept Hayashi's conditions for withdrawing from their parties. The fact that the Hayashi Cabinet is completely unrelated to the political parties is, in a sense, quite important compared to the Hirota Cabinet, in which the party members were merely companions at the ministerial conference table. This kind of cabinet can exempt itself from the criticism of playing with political parties, and it can also prevent the political parties from bearing the empty name of government parties, since they should not actually have this empty name. At present, both the Seiyu and Minsei parties maintain a neutral attitude, watching the new cabinet's policies in order to prepare appropriate strategies. Shinji Sogo's withdrawal from the cabinet midway during Hayashi's cabinet formation can symbolize that the new cabinet has shifted from "radicalism" to "gradualism." Although the new cabinet is a middle-of-the-road cabinet, it shares the same purpose as the Saito, Okada, and Hirota cabinets, but there are slight differences between the two. The Hayashi Cabinet is based on the cooperation of the military cliques, bureaucrats, and zaibatsu, while the Hirota Cabinet was a cabinet of cooperation between the military cliques, bureaucrats, and political parties. Hayashi announced the new cabinet's plans yesterday, including ㊀ gradual reform policies, ㊁ efforts to establish diplomatic policies, and ㊂ respect for constitutional government. The middle-ranking officers of the army are difficult to satisfy with the so-called gradual reform policy, and it is predicted that friction may occur between the new cabinet and the middle-ranking officers of the army. When establishing diplomatic policies, it is also questionable whether the new cabinet has sufficient power to control various aspects of Japanese diplomatic activities. Furthermore, regarding the so-called "respect for constitutional government," since there are different interpretations, how to use concrete policies to harmonize the various divergent interpretations and concepts to avoid conflict is the most difficult of all the problems. The difference in opinions between the army and navy makes the problem even more complex. This complex relationship has affected the issue of dissolving the Diet. Therefore, before implementing the new policies, Hayashi will encounter various difficulties when the cabinet is established to unify the opinions within the cabinet. This is why the future of the new cabinet is not optimistic. (Central News Agency, 2nd)

### Japanese Ministry of Communications Five-Year Plan

Allocates 15 Million Yen

[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Communications has adopted a five-year plan to increase the tonnage of merchant ships over 100 tons. It plans to increase the existing 4,216,000 tons to 6,000,000 tons within five years. The method is for the government to allocate 15 million yen to subsidize deep-sea liners and cargo ships, mainly non-scheduled vessels. Japan ranks third among the world's maritime nations today, but the development of foreign trade has made its existing vessels insufficient. The Japanese shipbuilding industry is now showing a prosperity not seen since 1919, and the enthusiasm for ordering ships has even exceeded supply. This phenomenon is surprising because in the past few years, Japanese shipping has suffered various disadvantages in Europe, Australia, and the Atlantic, and has had to concentrate its strength in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In 1934, a total of 48 Japanese ships sailed the Atlantic, totaling 450,000 tons, but by 1936, this had decreased to 33 ships. Japanese shipping has also suffered similar setbacks in European waters. In 1932, a total of 69 Japanese ships sailed to Europe, totaling 630,000 tons, but today there are only 16 ships totaling 170,000 tons. The Japanese Ministry of Communications has now slightly changed its policy. For the issuance of subsidies, non-scheduled vessels will receive the same treatment as scheduled liners.

### Hitler's Speech Attacked by Russian Newspaper

Believing Britain and France are Cowardly, Hand Extended in Vain

[Moscow] The Izvestia newspaper commented on Hitler's speech, saying, "Hitler has resolutely declared that everything remains the same as before. Britain and France extended their hands to Germany, but their hands remained suspended in the air for a long time. Of course, this result is not so much a tragedy for peace in Europe, but rather a tragic blow to the dignity of those gentlemen who have been openly insulted by Hitler in essence. In short, the world can only thank Hitler, because he has made the current situation completely clear. The essence of the current problem is whether collective strength can be used to stop the fascist aggressors before they plunge the world into catastrophe. Peace in Europe depends on this. As for the path chosen by Britain and France, which is to courteously guide Germany, it will never achieve this goal. The focus of the entire fascist agenda is economic and political expansion, mad military expansion and war. Fascism must abandon this agenda only after realizing that its tricks of isolating and threatening individual peaceful countries, which are now being invaded by Germany in stages, are not successful and have no hope of success. Fascism must abandon this aggression only after understanding that it will face immediate united and severe blows from peaceful countries. If Hitler is forced to reach this understanding, he may hesitate to stop blindly advancing towards the prospect of European and world war. However, have Britain and France ever really taken any measures to prevent Germany from taking this path? Have the bloody adventures of German and Italian fascism in Spain ever been seriously stopped? Has the position taken by Germany against the peaceful and democratic Czechoslovakia, which is absolutely intolerable from the perspective of European peace, ever encountered organized and normal blows? Can Britain's policy truly make Hitler realize that Britain is truly prepared to uphold a collective peace organization? To these questions, we must answer no. However, if Britain and France, especially Britain, continue to waver, if they continue to respond to fascist actions with empty talk, and their empty talk is neither frank nor affirmative, then if we consider Hitler's intelligence, the result will always be disappointment."

### Disarmament Bureau Scheduled to Meet

May 6th

[London] The House of Commons met this afternoon, and Foreign Secretary Eden mentioned the issue of disarmament, stating that the Council of the League of Nations has now decided to convene the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference in Geneva on May 6th. As for the agenda, it will be decided by the Bureau itself during the meeting, and it is not yet known at this time. He also stated that the British government is still prepared to re-engage in negotiations with Germany in the hope of achieving universal disarmament. At this point, Labour MP Henderson asked the Foreign Secretary, "Germany withdrew from the Disarmament Conference in 1933 because it failed to obtain equal rights in armaments. Now that Germany's armaments have reached an equal footing with other countries, does the British government intend to invite Germany to rejoin the Disarmament Conference?" The Foreign Secretary replied, "Britain would be extremely pleased if Germany could rejoin the disarmament efforts. The members of the House surely understand this intention," and so on. Henderson then questioned the Foreign Secretary about Germany's activities in Spanish Morocco. The Foreign Secretary replied that British representatives had conducted an investigation in Spanish Morocco, and the results did not prove that Germany had violated any treaties signed by Britain. As for the authorities in Melilla, Spanish Morocco, prohibiting British investigators from inspecting the airfield there, it is understood that such prohibitions are standard regulations. Since the British investigators did not specifically request to inspect the airfield, the authorities in Melilla did not specifically refuse them either. Regarding the current negotiations between Germany and Portugal and whether this issue conflicts with the obligations arising from the current treaties between Britain and Portugal, the Foreign Secretary declared, "The Portuguese government has already issued a communiqué denying the rumors, so the obligations arising from the current treaties between Britain and Portugal do not seem to be affected."

### French Air Force

1,500 First-Line Aircraft

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies continued to debate national defense issues today. Aviation Minister Cot explained the current state of the French Air Force, saying, "Although our country's inventors and manufacturers once lagged behind their foreign counterparts, they have since quickly caught up and restored their original position. Our Air Force has also become one of the most powerful in the world. To my knowledge, among the air forces of the world, only the Soviet Union has machinery superior to ours. However, the excellence of our Air Force's machinery can still bring glory to the nation. As for the exact number of aircraft we have, I am afraid I cannot disclose it. But if others talk to you about our Air Force's machinery, I hope you will be cautious and not believe it lightly. Among the total number of aircraft, there are those that can immediately take off to engage in battle, and these should not be confused with other aircraft. Some say that our country has a total of 1,500 aircraft. This refers to first-line aircraft, not that the total number is only 1,500. We have been intensifying our work in aviation for the past six months, to an extent that other countries cannot match. The number of first-line aircraft has increased by 37 percent, the ammunition used by the Air Force has increased by 50 percent, the weaponry has increased by 70 percent, and several bases have been built. As for the morale, that is another matter." (A Havas dispatch from the 2nd)

### Spanish Government Centralizes Command

Preventing Extremist Activities

Valencia The remaining members of the Spanish Parliament today unanimously voted to grant dictatorial powers to the cabinet of leader Gabarillo, allowing him to engage in war and suspend parliamentary sessions indefinitely. According to Gabarillo, the purpose of this decision is to centralize command power and prevent the activities of extremists. Gabarillo is the Secretary-General of the Spanish Workers' Union and the leader of the Socialist Party, and he served as Minister of Labor before forming a cabinet on September 4th of last year, assuming the positions of Prime Minister and Minister of War.

### Centenary of the Russian Poet Pushkin

Soviet Union Formulates Ceremony

[Moscow] The local newspapers published a resolution by the Federal Pushkin Committee regarding the procedures for holding the Pushkin Centenary Celebration, which has been approved by the Soviet People's Committee. The contents are as follows: On February 10th, the day of Pushkin's death, all public organizations in Moscow will hold a solemn assembly at the Soviet Grand Opera Theater.

### Statistics on Criminal Cases Handled by Tokyo Police

Reached Over 20,000 Last Year

[Tokyo] According to statistics released by the authorities, in 1936, the Tokyo Police Department handled 23,239 criminal cases, arresting a total of 18,230 people. Theft ranked first among the crimes, averaging 800 cases per month, followed by robbery, averaging 550 cases. The remainder were assaults, averaging 200 cases. Intellectual crimes, such as fraud, averaged 150 cases. Murder averaged about 20 cases. Of particular note were the increases in infanticide, abortion, and shoplifting. Women accounted for the majority of shoplifters. In addition, 80 women were arrested for violating election laws. (A Reuters dispatch from the 2nd by Central News Agency)

### Liu Weichi, Director of the Guangdong Construction Department, Discusses Impressions of the Eastern Tour

Traveled Over 3,000 Li of Highways, Impressions Gained from Personal Observation are Very Good, Economic Conditions in the Chaozhou Region are the Best

Guangzhou Communication, Liu Weichi, Director of the Construction Department, departed on January 23rd to inspect the various counties in the eastern region, and has now completed the tour. On the evening of the 28th, he returned to the province by express train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. On the morning of the 29th, he attended the provincial government meeting and then went to the department office. According to Director Liu, the itinerary of this inspection is as follows:

I have been in charge of the Construction Department for several months, and I had long planned to tour the various counties to inspect the local transportation situation and economic conditions. However, due to the busy departmental affairs, I was occupied with organizing matters, so the trip was delayed. Now that matters have been largely organized and are progressing in an orderly manner with considerable progress, I have taken the time to tour and inspect the various counties and cities. The first step was to inspect the eastern region, followed by the southern region and Qiongya. This inspection of the eastern region followed the eastern route trunk line. Departing from Guangzhou, I first arrived at Zengcheng, then proceeded through Boluo, Huiyang, Haifeng, Chaoyang, and reached Shantou. From Shantou, I transferred to Chaoan, Jieyang, Fengshun, Meixian, Xingning, Wuhua, Zijin, and Huizhou, and finally arrived at Zhangmutou, where I took the train back to the province. In this week, I traveled approximately 3,000 li. The impressions gained from the observation along the way are very good. The objectives of the inspection were: first, to check the highways.

Eastern Region Highways

Apart from the provincial highways, those in Huizhou and Chaozhou-Meizhou are relatively developed. Currently, in terms of road surface, the Puning-Shantou, Shantou-Zhangmutou, Chaozhou-Jieyang, and Meixian attached sections, as well as the Huizhou suburban sections, are very complete and can be compared to the best highways in other provinces. In addition, the road surfaces of other highways are mostly uneven, some damaged by rainwater, and some caused by overloaded vehicles. This is because the soil used for the roadbeds in the eastern region is not as good as the soil in the southern region, which has better cohesive properties, so it is easily damaged. I have now ordered the person in charge of the Eastern Route Traffic Department and the various county governments, along with the privately operated transportation companies, to pay special attention to repairs. At the same time, there are too few trees planted along the roads. Apart from the aforementioned better sections that have trees planted, there are no trees planted elsewhere. The reasons for this are twofold: ㊀ Some parts do not have enough rainfall, so the trees do not grow even when planted. ㊁ Some parts are destroyed arbitrarily by the villagers who do not know how to cherish them. I have now ordered special attention to be paid to increasing the planting of trees along the roads. Regarding bridges, apart from those already built with reinforced concrete, which are still complete, many other temporary wooden bridges have been damaged due to long-term maintenance or weak construction materials. These road bridges are extremely important for freight and passenger transportation during normal times. The fundamental solution is for the government to raise a large sum of money to rebuild the wooden bridges with reinforced concrete foundations so that they can last permanently. However, due to the limited financial resources of the government, it is not possible to do this all at once, so it must be implemented in two steps: first, to improve all the wooden bridges, and then to rebuild the important ones with reinforced concrete. Secondly, regarding the

Traffic Situation

Traffic on the highways in this province is divided into two types: one is provincial highways, which are operated by the government, and the other is county highways, which are mostly privately operated. Because the county highways were built by the people themselves raising funds, the traffic rights are also handed over to the people. Because the traffic rights are divided between the government and the people, the management is also inconsistent. Often, there is a lack of coordination between the provincial highway traffic and the county highway traffic, which greatly hinders traffic. The improvement plan in the future is to ensure that the provincial highway traffic and the county highway traffic are effectively coordinated and that an accurate timetable is set to facilitate the travel of merchants. I have now ordered the relevant personnel of this department to carefully plan and handle this matter. As for the vehicles used on the highways, those purchased by private operators are still relatively clean, but most of the others are old and dilapidated. The vehicles used for provincial highway traffic are mostly old and worn out because they have reached their service life. I have now ordered the Chelu Traffic Department to add new vehicles to improve the situation. It is estimated that the first batch of ten vehicles has been finalized and can be installed and used in one and a half months. Another ten vehicles will be purchased in the first batch and exchanged in succession. However, the profits from Eastern Route traffic are limited. During normal times, it is only enough to maintain the status quo. If the vehicles are completely replaced, the burden will be very heavy. However, it is hoped that after the improvement, merchants will be happy to ride, and the business will improve, which can offset the costs. Furthermore, regarding the economic conditions of the various regions.

Economic Situation

The economic situation in the eastern region is best in Chaozhou, followed by Meizhou, and then Huizhou. The largest products of Chaozhou are cane sugar. Last year, the cane sugar alone was worth about 17 or 18 million yuan. Next is citrus fruit, which is worth over one million yuan per year. Next are drawnwork and pottery, which are also produced in large quantities. In addition, there are remittances from overseas Chinese, which amount to tens of millions of yuan per year. In recent years, due to the impact of the world's economic downturn, remittances from overseas Chinese have decreased, and production has also been slow. However, things have gradually improved last year, and the situation in the future will definitely be promising. Regarding food, apart from Jieyang County, other counties are insufficient in supply, and a large amount of foreign rice is imported each year. However, the establishment of the Jieyang sugar factory is uneconomical due to the local conditions. Because the local people have the habit of making refined sugar, they are unwilling to sell sugarcane to the sugar factory. Even if they are willing to sell, they often demand high prices. If the sugar factory wants to grow sugarcane itself, the price of land in Chaozhou is very high, so the cost is also very high. For this reason, the cost of producing sugar at the sugar factory is too high, and the profit is too small. From an economic point of view, the Jieyang sugar factory should be moved to the southern region or Qiongya, because the land prices in the southern region and Qiongya are cheaper, and sugarcane can be purchased at a lower price, so development is easier. Meizhou is also short of rice. In the past, the largest product was Xingning cotton cloth, which was sold in large quantities to various places each year. In addition, there is also the production of fruit. In recent years, due to weather conditions, the sales of cotton cloth have decreased slightly, so there has been a gradual increase in fruit cultivation. There are also a few minerals. As for the Huizhou region, the soil is not very fertile. Although there is a sugarcane factory now, the sugarcane grown is not very good. In addition to cane sugar, there are various minerals. A lot of tungsten comes from Zijin, and many people are engaged in its mining. In addition to the above, there is a lot of afforestation in the various regions. However, the methods used in the past were immature, and there was no overall plan. The current forests in the various regions are mostly pine and fir. Fir can be used for construction, while pine is only used for firewood or raw materials. The government is also paying close attention to this and has established forest farms in various counties, setting up nurseries and gradually increasing the planting of various trees. In a few years, the forestry in the eastern region will definitely develop. As for

Telephone Communications

All counties in the eastern region have long-distance telephone services, but there is no overall plan. At present, most of the telephones are operated by private companies in each county, which makes the connection between the various locations difficult, and the management methods are also inconsistent. In order to improve the transportation industry, special attention should be paid to this. Finally, Director Liu also said that after he prepares to go to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session, he will accompany Mr. Billet, the commercial counselor of the British Embassy, and others to inspect the industries in the southern region and Qiongya in order to develop them.

Xiamen Communication, "Japanese schistosomiasis" has recently been discovered in Fuqing and Putian counties. Yu Wenguang, director of the Fuqing St. Luke's Hospital, accompanied Dr. Han of the Fourth Treatment Patrol Team, Yang Sheng, director of the Putian Drug Rehabilitation Center, and Ruan Fuchou, director of the St. Luke's Hospital Laboratory, to Houlong Village, eight miles outside the west gate of Fuqing, on January 25th to investigate the source of the disease. It was learned that "Japanese Schistosomiasis" is a type of microbe that lives in water and often parasitizes snails or swims in the water. If people accidentally drink water containing these microbes or bathe in this water, they will get worm enlargement disease. Last year, a patient from Houlong Village with worm disease went to Ma Keai Hospital in Fuzhou for treatment. After the surgery, the doctor felt that the disease was different from common worms, so he sent the waste taken from the patient's abdomen to the Peking Union Medical College for analysis, which revealed that it was "Japanese Schistosomiasis." Therefore, Director Yu and others made a special trip to Houlong Township to conduct a field investigation and found that there were many patients with worm disease in the township. They took the feces and urine of the patients and the snails from the creek back for examination and research, and investigated whether the disease was distributed in more than 30 villages nearby. It was learned that some people in Shuitou Village in the fourth district of Putian also had this disease, so Director Yu and others went to the village to investigate. (January 31st)

### Fuzhou Faces Shortage of Grain and Copper Coins

Rice and Copper Coins Rise in Price Simultaneously; Representatives of Two Groups Discuss Relief

Fuzhou Communication, The prices of grain and copper coins in this city have recently soared simultaneously. White rice is now sold for eleven yuan per stone, and each copper coin (old cast) costs five wen (originally three wen), which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. On January 29th, the provincial government ordered the Provincial Public Security Bureau, the Minhou County Government, and the Minhou Chamber of Commerce to plan relief measures. The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce convened meetings of the rice merchants and money changers on the afternoon of the 30th. The details of the proceedings are as follows:

Rice Merchants Meeting

More than 20 representatives of the rice merchants attended the meeting, which was chaired by Commerce Committee member Wan Yinru. He reported on the relief issue of rising rice prices, stating that he had consulted the Department of Civil Affairs and received three instructions: ㊀ Investigate the amount of rice currently stored in the provincial capital, ㊁ Determine the daily rice demand of the entire city, ㊂ Identify where rice is currently stored that can be purchased. However, the rice produced in the provincial capital cannot meet the demand. In the past, there was a large supply of rice from the Xi River, as well as rice from Jiangxi and Zhejiang, which was transported to northern Fujian and then to the province. Since the price of Fujian salt exceeded that of Huai salt, the neighboring counties of Jiangxi and Zhejiang no longer purchased Fujian salt, so the rice produced in those two provinces was also diverted to other places. In the past, northern Fujian was plagued by bandits and the countryside was abandoned, but they still came to the province to purchase rice. Fortunately, the local area has been peaceful in recent years, and the rice production has a surplus to transport to the province. The late rice harvest was abundant last year, and the price of rice should not be so high. How should we provide relief now to maintain the supply of grain? We ask everyone to share their views, and the association will forward them to the government for adoption. The rice merchants expressed their opinions one after another. As a result, they requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the provincial government to allow free flow of rice from the interior, without the need to apply for rice transportation permits, in order to save procedures and speed up the process. It is necessary to prevent private exports at the seaports, so that prices can be reduced. It is heard that the association will immediately forward the request to the provincial Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. As for the rice stored in the provincial capital, there are currently 30,000 stones, and the daily demand is 2,000 stones, which is only enough for half a month.

Money Changers Meeting

More than 10 representatives of the money changers attended the meeting, which was chaired by Commerce Committee member Song Jingyan. First, the representatives of the money changers reported that there was a shortage of copper coins on the market. The money changing shops collected the coins from the shops to meet the market demand. However, the copper coins in the shops are all collected from their own income, so when people go to the money changing shops to exchange money, there are no copper coins to exchange. The reasons for the shortage may be hoarding or private exports. In order to maintain the circulation of the market, all member shops should try their best to collect coins from various shops, and the exchange rate should be unified at four and a half wen per coin, and 22 coins for 100 wen of subsidiary currency, without arbitrary fluctuations. It is also necessary to investigate those who hoard copper coins and request the government to investigate them. (January 31st)

### Song Rujiu and Others from Zhongyuan Trading Company Collude with Foreigners to Evade Customs Duties

Song and Seven Others Were Arrested by the Police; Sentenced to Imprisonment by the Court

Qingdao Communication, Since the large-scale smuggling by Ronin, unscrupulous merchants in this city have also often colluded with foreigners to evade customs duties. Last year, the Jiao Sea Customs suffered from the impact of smuggling, and its annual revenue sharply declined. Therefore, in recent times, the customs has been very serious in investigating and seizing smuggled goods. In October of last year, two smuggling cases were cracked, and they were sent to the court prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution. Now that the court has completed the trial, sentences of life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment have been handed down separately. The facts of the crimes and the main text of the judgment are recorded as follows:

Facts of the Crime

Song Rujiu, manager of the Zhongyuan Trading Company on Jimolu Road in this city, co-founded the Zhongyuan Trading Company in January of last year with Ren Ruishan and Niu Fengchi in Osaka, Japan. Song and Ren were managers, and Niu was responsible for purchasing goods in Osaka. Ren worked as a helper in the postal parcel room, transporting the parcels on behalf of the company and requesting exemption from inspection. The shop assistants, Niu Haoru and Huang Kejian, helped with the operations, specializing in trafficking private goods for profit. Song Rujiu and Niu Fengchi also colluded with Ronin separately to reduce customs duties and entrusted the Ronin to carry goods and evade customs duties. Ren Ruishan used his status as a postal worker to transport parcels on behalf of the Zhongyuan Trading Company and requested exemption from inspection to facilitate evasion, which was not a one-time occurrence. On October 21st of last year, Song Rujiu knew that the 52 pieces of rayon carried by Dong Fuxiang were goods on which taxes had been evaded, but he still purchased them. The police arrested Song Rujiu, Ren Ruishan, Niu Haoru, Huang Kejian, and others one after another. Dong Fuxiang, Zhang Shouli, Yu Shousan, and Xu Zhankui, as well as Wang Yongkuan and Zhang Zhenhai in Dalian, all knew each other. Dong Fuxiang saw the profit in evading customs duties, so he had Xu Zhankui, Zhang Shouli, Yu Shousan, and others each contribute capital to purchase rayon, rock sugar, white sugar, and other items from Dalian, mix them in their luggage, and come to Qingdao by boat to evade customs duties. This happened a total of three times. On October 29th of last year, the Public Security Bureau arrested Dong Fuxiang, Xu Zhankui, Zhang Shouli, and Yu Shousan one after another. Ni Fengliang knew that Dong Fuxiang's rayon was goods on which taxes had been evaded, but he still carried them to Shanghai for sale. He was also investigated and arrested by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court in this city. The prosecutor investigated and filed a lawsuit.

Main Text of the Judgment

Dong Fuxiang is sentenced to ten years of fixed-term imprisonment for continuously colluding to evade customs duties. Xu Zhankui, Zhang Shouli, and Yu Shousan are each sentenced to five years of fixed-term imprisonment for continuously colluding to evade customs duties. Ni Fengliang is sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment for selling goods that he knew were used to evade customs duties. Song Rujiu is sentenced to life imprisonment, with permanent deprivation of political rights, for colluding with foreigners to evade customs duties. He is sentenced to six months of fixed-term imprisonment for knowingly buying and selling goods on which taxes had been evaded. Life imprisonment is enforced, with permanent deprivation of political rights. Ren Ruishan is sentenced to fifteen years of fixed-term imprisonment, reduced from life imprisonment, for colluding with foreigners to evade customs duties. Niu Haoru is sentenced to twelve years of fixed-term imprisonment for assisting in colluding with foreigners to evade customs duties. Dong Kejian is sentenced to twelve years of fixed-term imprisonment for assisting in colluding with foreigners to evade customs duties. Other parts of the prosecution are acquitted.

### Overview of Land Administration in Beijing (Continued)

Two Important Tasks Completed Last Year; Implementation Plan for This Year Also Confirmed

The above describes the process of approving land value tax rates. Regarding the estimation of land values, when the Land Bureau of the city was reorganized into the Land Administration Bureau in June, one first-class land estimation specialist and two second-class land estimation specialists were appointed to specifically handle land value estimation. Their estimation methods all followed the procedures stipulated in the Land Law. On one hand, they investigated the market prices of land transactions in recent years. On the other hand, they sent letters to various district offices to inquire about recent market values. They also referenced the values reported by property owners when registering their property rights, calculating the overall average. However, for land with no recent transactions or no market value to investigate, they adopted a comparative estimation method and a revenue capitalization method. Areas with similar land values were designated as land value zones, and standard land values were estimated for each location to determine its value. Then, for land within each local value zone that had special advantages in location or inferior terrain, the standard price could be slightly increased or decreased, but not exceeding one-third of the standard price. After the standard land values were drafted, they were submitted to the Municipal Land Valuation Committee for review. The committee was composed of the heads of various municipal bureaus, representatives from the court, the chamber of commerce, the bankers' association, and several expert members. When discussing land values in each district, the district head of each district was also invited to attend. The estimated land values were finalized only after being reviewed and approved by the committee, and land value charts and tables for each district were created and submitted to higher-level agencies for record-keeping. At the same time, the public was notified for a period of one month. If there were special circumstances requiring an increase or decrease in land value, property owners were notified separately. If there were any objections, they had twenty days to raise them. If no objections were raised within the deadline, or if objections were resolved through reassessment or arbitration, the estimated values became final. Investigations reveal that land values in all districts of Beijing were estimated and completed within the twenty-fifth year [of the Republic], and the district land value distributions and the highest and lowest prices have been announced successively. Tables are attached below.

After the land values of each district were estimated, land value registers and land tax registers were compiled according to the estimated land values and approved tax rates. The land tax registers were completed and sent to the Finance Bureau, scheduled to be levied in December of the 25th year [of the Republic]. The land value registers have also been compiled and will be printed and submitted to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Interior for record-keeping.

The Beijing Municipal Government originally planned to levy land value tax and land appreciation tax simultaneously, but due to insufficient time for completing the procedures, the appreciation tax could not be levied as scheduled. It is currently being expedited. Beijing has been levying deed tax on real estate transfers. Because the appreciation tax has not yet been levied, the deed tax continues to be levied. Furthermore, the city was unable to estimate the value of land improvements in a timely manner due to the complicated estimation procedures. The Municipal Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to temporarily suspend the levy, instead levying 70% of the original house tax to replace the land improvement tax, and set a deadline of three years to complete the land improvement value estimation in order to levy the land improvement tax.

Land Expropriation

As the capital of the country, Beijing has many land expropriation cases for public utilities. Investigations show that in the 25th year [of the Republic], the Municipal Land Administration Bureau handled land expropriation cases totaling approximately 360 mu for municipal construction projects related to road construction, over 100 mu for educational purposes related to the expansion of municipal primary and secondary schools, and approximately 840 mu for other projects such as the establishment of public housing areas, public cemeteries, slaughterhouses, vegetable markets, and toilets. In addition, the land entrusted to the city by various agencies and schools for expropriation reached over 11,000 mu. In total, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau paid a total of 663,000 yuan in compensation for land expropriation in the 25th year [of the Republic]. The expropriation procedures were all handled in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law.

In addition, the handling of public land in Beijing is carried out in accordance with the "Regulations for the Handling of Public Land" and the "Regulations for the Clearing of Urban Public Land" promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Abandoned roads and fragmented land are offered to adjacent property owners for acceptance at estimated prices. Banner land is offered to the original flag households for acceptance at 40% of the estimated price. Excess land is offered to the original occupants for acceptance at the price. The release or lease of other public land is carried out in accordance with regulations. The city's land rezoning and zoning methods have also been planned by the Municipal Land Administration Bureau in conjunction with the Public Works Bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government Committee for handling. The clearing and reclamation of wasteland has also been planned by the Land Administration Bureau in conjunction with the Finance Bureau, drafting methods for the clearing and reclamation of wasteland and submitting them to the Municipal Government for review, preparing for implementation in the 26th year [of the Republic]. This is the general situation of land administration in Beijing in the 25th year [of the Republic]. (End)

### Suzhou

Re-election of Township and Baobao Chiefs

The terms of office for township and baobao chiefs in this county have expired. The county government has received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs to re-elect them uniformly in accordance with the law. County Magistrate Deng issued orders to the district offices on the 2nd, instructing the township offices to notify the public and complete the re-election by the 15th of this month. However, in the urban area, it is stipulated that there should be one bao for every ten jia. The county government has also organized a Township Chief Qualification Review Committee. In addition to the district heads and baobao instructors and county government section chiefs, the committee also includes five locally appointed individuals: Li Genyuan, Zhang Yi'ao, Zhang Yipeng, and Cheng Ganqing.

### Wuxi

Opening of a Swimming Pool in Liyuan Garden

Liyuan Garden in Qingqi Township, First District, is one of the famous scenic spots in Xiyi County. In October last year, a new swimming pool was opened in the garden. Construction has been underway since then and is nearing completion. The pool is built along the lake, making water intake convenient and extremely clean. It is expected to open in April. The total project cost is approximately 30,000 yuan.

Organizing River Dredging and Tree Planting

The county's Bureau of Construction is organizing the dredging of rivers by conscripted labor because the rivers in the four townships are crisscrossed, and the riverbeds are silted up, especially during this farming season, in order to carry out water conservancy work. There are nine major rivers in the Second District: Daqiao Shenggang, Jiuli Jing, Luwang Jing, Cao Wang Jing; the Fourth District: Dahongqiao River, Luquqiao Xi River; the Sixth District: Yang River, Kuatang River, Zhang Miaoshe River, etc. The total length is over 26 kilometers, and the estimated amount of earth to be excavated is over 242,248 cubic meters. The survey has been completed and submitted to the province for approval. Construction will commence immediately upon receipt of the instruction. In addition, tree planting on highways has been designated for the four routes: Xihu, Xiyi, Xicheng, and Suxi. It has been decided to dig holes on the 25th of this month.

### Changshu

Difficulties in Investigating Opium Smokers

According to the authorities, the total number of opium smokers arrested in the recent general review of opium smokers here reached 1,230. Some of those mistakenly arrested are also undergoing investigation in the hospital. Currently, the county hospital is facing various difficulties due to the sudden increase in the number of opium smokers. The hospital can only accommodate 120 people, but the number has now increased to over 400, causing the outpatient clinics, surgery and internal medicine consultation rooms, etc., to be converted into opium smoker investigation rooms. The hospital receives 60 yuan per month from the county for food expenses, but with such a large increase in numbers, there will be a shortage of food. Moreover, opium smokers are not allowed to bring bedding when admitted. The wards are temporary conversions, making it difficult to endure the severe cold. The reagent bottles used for testing opium smokers have also run out. Furthermore, the two testers can only test a maximum of 20 people per day, meaning that it will take 20 days to test these 400 opium smokers, which is not in accordance with the regulations. The hospital is feeling overwhelmed by all of this and has submitted a request to the county for instructions.

### Jiangyin

Confiscation of Scrap Copper at a Sub-checkpoint

The Jiangyin sub-checkpoint of the Zhenjiang Customs discovered two sailing boats loaded with copper items at Huangtian Port the other day. There were over ten tons of copper shells, purple copper wire, ancient coins, Kangxi coins, and various copper coins. The sub-checkpoint patrol boat detained the transporting shipowner, Shen Qingtai, because he had no shipping permit. The scrap copper was transported to the sub-checkpoint and sealed. According to the shipowner, the copper was loaded in Hankou and Nanchang and was intended to be transported to Shanghai for transshipment to Hong Kong. Director Ye Yongxiang believes that the shipment of scrap copper is of great importance and is awaiting submission to the Zhenhai Customs for review.

### Yuyao

### Amendments to the 1936-37 Men's Basketball Rules (Continued)

Translation Published by the National Amateur Athletic Federation of China

Article 13: The timekeeper shall record when each half begins. Three minutes before the start time, they should report to the referee so that the referee can notify the teams or inform the teams at least three minutes before the start time. The timekeeper should inform the scorer two minutes before the start time. The timekeeper shall record the time of play as stipulated by the rules and the time-outs within the game.

The timekeeper shall have at least one stopwatch designated as the game clock, which shall be managed by one of the timekeepers. It shall be placed appropriately so that both people can view it together. At the start of each half or overtime period, or when play resumes after a time-out with a jump ball, the game clock shall be started when the referee blows the whistle and the ball leaves his hand. If play is resumed with a throw-in from out of bounds or a free throw, the game clock shall be started when the ball is thrown in and crosses the boundary line or when the free throw is missed.

The game clock shall be stopped at the end of each half or quarter, when an official declares a foul, or when a time-out is granted or a substitute player is allowed to enter the court. When the game clock is stopped, the timekeeper should immediately start another clock to calculate the time-out period. When the time-out period or the unauthorized time-out period expires, the timekeeper should notify the scorer with a signal to the official. At the end of the actual game time of each half or quarter or overtime period, the timekeeper should fire a gun, strike a gong, or blow a whistle to report the end of the game time. This signal shall be the standard. If the signal is damaged, but can be issued on time, or is issued but not heard, the timekeeper should immediately run onto the court or notify the referee by other means. If, in the meantime, the ball has been shot or a foul has occurred, the referee should consult with the timekeeper to determine whether it is valid. If both timekeepers agree that the time had already expired before the ball was released for the shot or the foul occurred, the referee should rule that the shot is invalid or that the foul, if not overly egregious, should be cancelled. However, if the two timekeepers disagree and the referee is unable to determine, the referee should rule that the shot or the foul is valid.

(Note) The electric timing method has been approved for adoption and should be tested for suitability in accordance with the above timing methods. If two clocks are available, one of the timekeepers shall manage the game clock and the signal, and the other shall act as the checker and manage the time-out clock.

Chapter 8, Article 2: The first sentence should be amended as follows:

Three minutes before the start of each half, the captains of both teams should be notified.

Chapter 8, Article 6: The last sentence should be changed to prevent obstruction by other players during jump balls in China, as follows: During jump balls in China or on any free throw line, other players, except for the two jump ball players, should stand outside the circle (6.5-foot radius circle) until the ball has been touched. Violation is a violation (penalty is a throw-in from out of bounds by the opposing team), but repeated violations may be considered delaying the game.

Chapter 8, Article 7: A new sentence is added to indicate the position that other players should stand when a jump ball occurs outside of China or a free throw. The sentence is as follows:

Other players should stand at a considerable distance from the jump ballers and the officials before the jump ballers touch the ball.

Chapter 8, Article 9: Two new sentences are added. The full text is as follows:

When the game time expires, the timekeeper shall issue a signal, and the entire game shall be over (see Chapter 7, Article 7). If a player commits a foul when the timekeeper issues a signal to report the end of a half or overtime period or before the signal is issued, the overtime period should be extended and a free throw should be held immediately until it is completed. If the foul is discovered at the end of the first or third quarter of the game, or during the rest period after the first or third quarter, the free throw should be held at the start of the next quarter. If the foul is a personal foul, the game shall begin when the free throw is missed, or when the free throw is made, it shall begin with a throw-in from out of bounds by the opposing team. Each half time or each overtime time, the game begins with a center circle jump ball.

Chapter 13, Article 1: The note has been modified. The full text is as follows:

(Note) If there are multiple free throws or a re-throw (replacing the original free throw), then the above item ㊁ only applies to the last free throw.

To ensure the accuracy of the calculated time, officials and timekeepers should agree on a certain code to indicate the start and end times. This is especially important during fouls and free throws.

Chapter 11, Article 3: The number of timeouts that each team should be allowed to request is increased to four (the old rule was three).

Chapter 14, Article 1: The penalty is changed. The full text is as follows:

Penalty: Invalid free throw. Regardless of whether the free throw is made or missed, the ball is awarded to a player on the opposing team for a throw-in from out of bounds at the end line. If there is more than one free throw, this provision of the throw-in from out of bounds only applies to the last free throw. If the free throw is for a technical foul, the game should continue with a jump ball in the center circle.

Chapter 15, Article 1: ㊂ "After three timeouts" is changed to after four timeouts.

Chapter 15, Article 1 Note: "When the ball has not been patted before jumping the ball" is changed to when jumping the ball, before the ball is thrown up

Chapter 15, Article 2 and Note: This is an important change by the committee. Before or after reporting to the officials, substitute players may speak with other players, but must report and prepare for the game immediately. After a substitute player reports to the scorer and obtains permission from the official to enter the court, he may send messages to teammates or give instructions on basketball tactics. If, during a timeout for other reasons, a substitute player may communicate with his teammates after reporting to the official. Because of the above changes, the phrase "or directly talking to other players without being told by the referee before the game starts" is deleted from this article, and a note is added as follows:

(Note) The sentence prohibiting substitute players from talking has been deleted. When entering the court, substitute players must report to the officials immediately, regardless of whether it is during a timeout for other reasons, so that the game can continue on time within 30 seconds.

Chapter 15, Article 9: A new note is added. The purpose of this note is not to defend rough actions, but to maintain fairness for defenders in normal ball-stealing situations if there is slight and unintentional contact. The full text is as follows:

When blocking a shot or pass, or stealing the ball from an opponent's hand, if a player touches the ball and the part of his hand below the wrist touches the opponent's hand without contact with other parts of the body, it is an accidental normal pat and is not considered a foul.

Correction: Yesterday's "Chapter 6, Article 4" was a mistake for "Chapter 6, Article 14". (End)

### Ministry of Education Distributes Educational Films

All Provinces and Cities to Begin Screening

Since the Ministry of Education implemented educational film work this year, it has set up a special class to train film projection personnel for various provinces and cities. It has also instructed various provinces and cities to divide projection areas, raise funds, and formulate implementation plans for this province and city, which are submitted to the Ministry for review. On the one hand, it customizes projection equipment and purchases and produces educational films. In order to vigorously promote this undertaking, the Ministry has taken into account the actual situation of various provinces and cities and has subsidized the equipment price separately. The subsidies for the full amount are for ten provinces including Suiyuan, and the subsidies for half the amount are for twenty provinces and cities including Jiangsu, with a total subsidy of more than 54,000 yuan. Details have been recorded in the newspaper. Now, it is learned that the various preparatory works have been completed.

After the screening, they will be returned, and the films for each period will be sent by the ministry in advance. Currently, many copies of films have been prepared for three periods. The audience is provisionally assumed to be 80% or more, with only primary school level or uneducated people, so the content strives to be simple and focuses on the cultivation of national consciousness and the inculcation of scientific common sense to meet urgent needs.

### Several Secondary Education Issues Concerning English Teaching (5)

— Wang Shijie

Only then can these endeavors be substantial and stable, and only then can the country progress. In the future, secondary education should regard further education and employment as two equally important goals. To be more specific, in addition to focusing on cultivating leading talents, more attention should be paid to cultivating middle and lower-level cadres for national and social endeavors.

Fifth, the current curriculum of secondary schools and the scope of English teaching secondary education is very broad, and there are many problems. What has been said above only addresses a few basic issues that are closely related to the main topic of today's conference, explaining the urgent matters that should be paid attention to at present. Moreover, what has been said above does not propose any abstract or lofty ideals, but only discusses the gradual changes that should be made in the future based on current facts. I will now briefly summarize it, which is: ㊀ Secondary education should cultivate practical and useful knowledge; ㊁ The knowledge cultivated by secondary education should emphasize both theory and practice; ㊂ Secondary education should cultivate students' initiative; ㊃ Secondary education should give equal attention to students' further education and employment. Specifically speaking, in addition to cultivating leading talents, it should also cultivate a large number of healthy middle and lower-level cadre talents. If we feel that these few principles are close to the facts and meet the needs, we may as well discuss these few points more fully, arouse deeper and more focused attention from all sectors of society, and enable these few principles to gain universal support and unanimous advocacy from the national education community and other sectors, so that the development of the entire secondary education in the future can be governed by these few principles and achieve balanced and harmonious development. In the past few years, the Ministry of Education has made some preliminary reform efforts based on the principles we can think of in the regulation of secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools across the country, the revision of curricula in various types of schools, and the enrichment of equipment. We can only admit that this is just a preliminary work of breaking ground, but the matter is too big and too complicated, and there are too many aspects that should be paid attention to. Although there is some experience, we ultimately feel that we have very little grasp. If the principles proposed above can be established, the reforms in the future must naturally be gradual, and we should gradually seek their realization step by step according to what experience allows. To realize these principles, a very important task is of course the curriculum in secondary schools. The current curriculum of secondary schools has been revised several times and is the result of the thoughts and experiences of many people. Moreover, we are still constantly striving to make it more complete and more in line with the needs based on new experiences and new facts. The revision of the secondary school curriculum recently was only a few months ago, and the regulations on physical education in secondary schools were also just announced a few days ago. In the future, when the secondary school curriculum needs to be revised again, it should also be governed by the above principles, and the teaching materials and teaching methods related to the curriculum should also be gradually improved to conform to the above-mentioned principles. Such a principled, planned, and systematic reform requires considerable time, money, and experience, but we believe that after such a reform, the secondary education in China will be refreshed.

Today is the first day of the conference of the Chinese Western Language Society in Beiping. The main topic discussed is most closely related to the English teaching of secondary schools, especially middle schools. English is one of the main courses in junior and senior high schools. In junior high schools, just in terms of class time, English accounts for an average of more than one-eighth of each student's total weekly hours. In senior high schools, English accounts for an average of one-sixth, and for some students, it can account for more than one-quarter in the third year of high school, which is a total of eight hours per week. The secondary school curriculum recognizes the importance it deserves. Such time allocation can be considered quite sufficient. If the time spent by each middle school student in English classes over six years is roughly calculated, it is about 430 hours in junior high school and about 540 to 650 hours in senior high school, totaling about 970 to 1080 hours. This refers to class hours. Assuming that each hour of homework requires two hours of preparation, the total preparation time for six years is about 1940 to 2160 hours. Adding up the class and preparation hours, a senior high school student spends a total of about 2910 to 2140 hours studying English over six years. This is an astonishing number. If a middle school student spends such a long time on a relatively common subject, and if he is a diligent student, and the teaching materials, teachers, and teaching methods are all appropriate, even if his achievements cannot be extremely excellent, at least he should gain a considerable and rich harvest of preliminary basic knowledge, and a relatively solid grasp. He should gain a fairly thorough understanding and a considerable degree of confidence in English writing, reading, and speaking. However, in fact, the English performance of current high school graduates is generally poor. The English test scores of freshmen admitted to universities each year are generally disappointing. Not only are they mostly unclear about the structure of common English grammar and unable to form sentences and chapters, but also the spelling and writing of some common English words are mostly full of errors. The ability to understand English is even more extremely weak. The impression gained by the examiners is often very bad. Judging from the statistics of foreign language scores in the university freshman entrance examination in the twenty-fourth year, 60% of the freshmen in national and public colleges and universities scored below 60 points, and the scores in the entrance examination are generally not too strict. Those who have handled university admission examinations know this. Of course, the teaching of English outside its native country has its special difficulties, which no one can deny, but its difficulties, saying that it is special is possible, saying that it is particularly large is not necessarily true. It is not necessarily more difficult than subjects such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics. The current situation creates a very difficult problem for university education. Since the English level of high school graduates is so poor, if they do not make special efforts to make up for it in the first two years after entering university, they will feel that it is extremely difficult or impossible to read original reference books. If they are still willing to work hard to make up for it, it is equivalent to moving the homework that should be done in secondary school to university, so that other subjects in university cannot but be affected. And now the coursework in university, especially in science and engineering, is quite heavy, so this problem of English teaching is directly related to secondary education and indirectly affects higher education. The most important thing is that students cannot refer to original books, blocking an important way of self-study and cutting off the hope of studying advanced knowledge. If he does not go to university, then enters society, not only can he not use what he has learned in English before, but he will not have progress, and even what he has learned before will be forgotten together. The 3,000 hours of work spent in the previous six years is tantamount to being wasted. This is a great loss, so this problem is quite serious at present. To seek remedy,

### Yarn and Fabric

Long Positions Maintained, Recent Yarn Price Rises Revived

After the previous day's sharp decline in the yarn market, the market stabilized yesterday. This was mainly because major players did not relax their long positions. Indian merchants also did not give up on the February contract. Changfeng, Gengfeng, Jinchang, and others continued to add to their positions in large amounts. As a result, the market tightened suddenly and held up in the near term. Due to the sluggishness of the overseas yarn market and the lack of real demand, industry players tended to sell, resulting in a particularly strong pressure.

Large Players Drag in Marked Yarn

The marked yarn market opened lower across the board. The decline in the current month was particularly severe due to the loose and self-abusive attitude of a certain cotton company's wholesale release of files on the previous day. Today, they continued to advance with a false wind. Short sellers took the opportunity to exert high pressure. Unexpectedly, Changfeng worked hard to drag in on behalf of a certain merchant, and Jinchang also bought, for a particularly large amount. All floating chips were thrown in by them, and the market gradually rebounded after a round. As a result, each month fell by 1.3 to 1.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was tighter after the afternoon opening, and each month saw an increase again, with major players still buying. However, spot yarn transactions were sluggish, and the price of third-grade yarn fell. Market sentiment was not restrained. The current month was very expensive. As a result, February rose by 1.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price, a rapid increase of 2.3 to 4 jiao. It was found that Chen Ji sold 1,200 bales, Hengyi 1,050 bales, Yuren 2,500 bales, Dafeng 3,350 bales, Ruidai 1,200 bales, Dachangcheng 1,800 bales, Mei Ji 1,500 bales, Yi Ji 650 bales, Hexing 600 bales. Dafu bought 1,100 bales, Jinchang 2,250 bales, Gengfeng 4,650 bales, Wang Taixing 1,950 bales, Changcheng 1,050 bales, Changfeng 1,000 bales, Run Kang 1,100 bales, and Fukang 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below (see layout).

Thread Price Rises Alone by One Yuan

Spot yarn sales are still considered to be considerable, among which thread transactions are very strong. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 1,065 bales throughout the day, with prices being average and thread rising by one yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below (see layout).

Retail Investors Make Up, Cotton Price Once Rebounds

The cotton market is stable and the trend is unusually peaceful. The general trend is still in a state of wandering and hesitation. Hankou gang has a slight makeup, and Dafu Changhe purchased a lot, but the spot cotton business is deserted, and factory demand is stagnant.

Bearish View Not Lacking in Marked Cotton

The marked cotton market opened lower due to the continued decline in U.S. cotton, a slight increase in Indian cotton, and the sluggishness of the yarn market. The decline has been very severe recently. After a round, retail investors came to make up again. At the same time, the yarn market improved, and market prices gradually rebounded, but the trading volume in the market was very thin. As a result, each month rose by 1 to 1.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was stable after the afternoon opening, with very little fluctuation up and down each month. Because the impact of the U.S. cotton flood on cotton fields is not expanding, there are many who are bearish. As a result, each month fell by 5 to 1 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Gengfeng sold 1,800 dan, Ruidai 5,000 dan, Yongyu 2,100 dan, Dachangcheng 1,700 dan, Yichang 1,300 dan, Changfeng 3,000 dan, Xiecheng 1,000 dan, Yongda 1,400 dan, Juxing 1,200 dan, Dafeng 1,200 dan. Dafu bought 8,400 dan, Dafeng 1,300 dan, Changhe 5,900 dan, Run Kang 1,500 dan, and Fukang 900 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.

Spot Cotton Arrival and Sales Both Quiet

Spot cotton consumption is depressed, factory demand is deserted, and the source is 200 bales of Yao cotton, with no general cotton available.

Sharp Decline in Raw Cotton Purchases by Yarn Factories in January

According to a survey by a certain cotton industry organization, the total amount of cotton purchased by Shanghai Sino-Japanese factories in January this year was 77,140 bales, a sharp decrease of 43,828 bales compared with the average in December last year. Among them, Sino-Japanese yarn factories purchased 30,323 bales, a decrease of 28,873 bales from the previous month. The amount purchased by Chinese factories was 46,917 bales, also a decrease of 16,955 bales. The reason for the decrease is said to be that the yarn factory workers have several days of rest during the old calendar year, and the factory's demand has decreased. The amount and flower names of purchases by Sino-Japanese factories are listed below (unit: bales).

U.S. Cotton Suffers Another Setback After Rising

Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with a firm market. Each month fell by a pound to rise by four pounds. In the early morning, the Liverpool telegram was good, and the flood situation was uncertain. Industry players bought near-month contracts, and brokers and foreign merchants bought far-month contracts. The market was firm. Unfortunately, when the May contract rose to 1.27 cents, it encountered great resistance. Afterwards, long positions were closed, and the purchase of foreign cotton to hedge the U.S. cotton market price turned weak. Industry players are waiting for the sale of pledged cotton, fearing that low-grade cotton will be hedged in the market, and the market may be oppressed by it. The closing was average, with spot falling by four pounds, and first-tier goods falling by two to six pounds. British cotton spot rose by two points, and futures fell by one to two points. Indian cotton was firm due to overseas news favorable to buyers, and industry players and speculators purchased it. Later, the news from Liverpool was good, and the market was even firmer, with Pingguoer rising by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Aomula rising by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi remaining unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (one day electricity).

According to the Mumbai telegram, the forecast for the opening on the 2nd is Bairoxi at 227 rupees, Aomula at 209 rupees, down 1.5 rupees, and Pingguoer at 182.5 rupees, down 1.5 rupees.

### Silk and Tea

User Silk Transactions Quite Brisk

——Prepare for a Bull Market and Sell Wisely——

Recently, overseas silk markets have gradually stabilized after repeated declines due to the floods in the United States and the unrest in Japanese politics. Yesterday, the prices of American silk futures were firm. It is expected that the silk market will rebound. The opening price of New York standard silk for near-term futures was 205 yuan, up 3 cents from last Saturday, and futures rose by 4 and a half cents. The prices of Yokohama spot two-cargoes rose slightly by two or three yuan. The Lyon silk market was quiet and the price was sluggish. Currently, in the Shanghai silk market, because there are very few silk factories starting work, the stock is also depleted, and there is even a shortage of spot goods on the market, so the silk price can still maintain a relatively stable price. Yesterday, the American firm's account of White Factory B-word RR limited price was 810 yuan, which is about 20 yuan away from the Shanghai market, so it is still rarely sold open. In the Indian silk market, the sales of yellow and white native silk are still healthy, such as Wuyang KKK which sold for 480 yuan, which is 20 yuan higher than last weekend. Other silk products have also risen accordingly. In the user silk market, because general silk mills are aware that at the beginning of the waste calendar year, the silk price may continue to be firm, so they generally buy more goods to spend the year, so the transaction is quite strong, such as the white factory replanting which sold for 820 yuan, which is 10 yuan higher than last week, and the market atmosphere is trending stronger. Yesterday, a total of 105 bales were traded.

Green Tea Exports Outstrip Demand

Recently, the sales of green tea have suddenly become active. Various European firms are vigorously soliciting eyebrow, pearl, needle-eyebrow and other green teas because of the urgent demand from Morocco. However, the incoming goods from the tea estates have already been sold out, and the supply is already unable to meet the demand. General local tea factory manufacturers who have found raw materials for coarse tea have also started purchasing again. The selling price of secondary coarse tea has surged from 11 or 12 yuan per dan to 17 or 18 yuan, and there is not much stock left. It is heard that tea estates such as China Tea Tongyifeng have already started production to meet the needs of foreign firms. It is said that this situation is unprecedented in recent years.

Kriebel then accompanied him to the Municipal Government in the city center at 10 AM to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng. The Mayor, accompanied by Secretary Tang Shixuan, received them and expressed a warm welcome to the ship's arrival in Shanghai. He offered them champagne and they talked for more than ten minutes.

Hosting Journalists

At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, the ship hosted Chinese and foreign journalists from Shanghai. They traveled by the warship's small launch from the Xinguans Wharf. About 70 or 80 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers arrived. After boarding the ship, they first went to the dining room to rest and were offered cigarettes and alcohol. Captain Lohmann was hosting Yang Hu and others to return the visit, so Lieutenant Commander Leiber, the ship's intelligence officer, delivered a welcome speech, saying, "I represent the captain in welcoming you to visit. Now, because the captain is hosting Commander Yang, he cannot spare the time, so I apologize. We have prepared some refreshments, please rest for a while and visit the various departments in groups."

Captain's Report

Later, Captain Lohmann also came to give a speech, saying, "I have met with the authorities of your country several times in Beijing and have been invited to visit various new constructions, which is very gratifying. I hope that you will give me more advice when I come to Shanghai this time." Then, the ship's personnel led the reporters to visit the various departments. Although the scale was small, the equipment was very complete. Inside the ship, there was a bronze plate with the ship's name left over from the first Emden, and an image of Captain von Müller, as well as a shark hanging in the radio room at the highest point, which was caught in Singapore. After the tour, they were returned to the Xinguans Wharf by the original launch at around 4 PM.

A Glimpse of the Equipment

Before the European War, the ship was a cruiser squadron commanded by General Spee, stationed in Qingdao, China. When the war broke out, it left China via the Pacific Ocean and returned to its country. In the southern part of the Pacific Ocean, it was blocked by the British Navy, and then appeared in the Indian Ocean, sinking more than 20 warships and merchant ships of the Allied countries, and its reputation shook the world. On September 9, 1914, it encountered the Australian warship Sydney at Cocos Island and was sunk in a battle. In order to retain the ship's prestigious name, a new ship was built in 1916, still named Emden. In 1917, it was stationed on Böld Island in Russia, and was defeated and sunk again in 1918. The current ship is the third one, launched on January 7, 1925 and incorporated into the fleet on October 15 of the same year. According to the Treaty of Versailles, the ship weighs 6,000 tons, is 450 feet long, 45 feet wide, has a draft of 17 feet, a speed of 29 nautical miles per hour, and a motor that can generate 46,000 horsepower. There are 28 officers on the ship, one captain, seven mid-level crew members, 45 officers, 119 junior officers, and 468 soldiers (including 160 naval trainees), for a total of 668 people. The ship has eight 6-inch caliber guns, two 3.5-inch anti-aircraft guns, and two twin-barreled torpedo launchers. The ship is used for training. Recently, it made a special six-month tour, passing through Constantinople, the South Pacific Islands, etc., and arrived in Beijing. It will continue to go to South Pacific, Bombay, Alexandria, and southern England. It is expected to return to Wilhelmshaven in Germany in mid-April. The ship's soldiers are all young servicemen who are newly graduated naval students interning on the ship. After their term expires, they will be promoted to mid-level crew members. Captain Lohmann was the captain of the U45 submarine during the European War.

Itinerary in Shanghai

Last night, the German expatriates in Shanghai held a grand banquet and dance party at the Shanghai Race Club to welcome the ship's officers.

### The Municipal Federation and Other Organizations Sent a Letter to the Municipal Council Yesterday Requesting a Reconsideration of the Water Rate Increase

Distributing Dividends Places the Burden on Users; Audit the Accounts and Order a Reduction in Profits

The Municipal Federation and other organizations in the First Special District sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council yesterday to protest against the increase in water rates, requesting them to submit a reconsideration and cancel the increase in order to ensure the livelihood of the people. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, the water rate set by the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company has been charged at 75% of the company's original price list since April 1935, and users have already felt it was an unbearable burden. Unexpectedly, the company's authorities insisted on maintaining a 9% official interest rate, and falsely claimed that the exchange rate had fallen and expenses had increased, so they secretly requested the approval of your Board of Directors to change to an 80% charge starting on February 1, effectively increasing the price. The residents of our district were deeply shocked upon hearing this. After holding a joint meeting of representatives of various organizations on January 30 to discuss it, they all said that since "January 28," Shanghai has suffered great trauma. Coupled with the years of floods and droughts, the rural economy has been destroyed, and the social economy has collapsed. Factories and shops have closed down one after another, and unemployment has increased sharply. However, the company's authorities disregarded the difficulties of the times, hoarding and monopolizing, arbitrarily expanding the issuance of bonus shares, and ordering users to increase their burden. This kind of policy will inevitably cause unrest among all the citizens. Our association decided that in addition to notifying users to deposit all water bills at the original price in the bank before the case is resolved, we would like to send a special letter to your Board of Directors requesting that the issue be reconsidered, the price increase be canceled, and the company's accounts be audited over the years, and that it be ordered to reduce profits as much as possible and save expenses in order to ensure the livelihood of the people. Otherwise, it will incite incidents, which will be of great concern to public tranquility and social order. We urge you to carefully reconsider and resolve the disputes. In addition, the Public Concession Waterworks Problem Research Committee organized by various groups is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss research matters."

### Yangtze River Water Rises Sharply, Yangtze River Shipping is Smooth

Large Ships Rush to Transport Passengers and Cargo; Loading for New Year Sales in Xun and Hankou

The Yangtze River water level has risen sharply recently, from 11 feet to 13 feet 7 inches, and is still increasing daily. The waterway from Jiujiang to Hankou has been completely unobstructed. Not only are large Yangtze River ships completely unobstructed, but seagoing ships transporting salt and coal, which have been blocked for more than a month, can now safely load and unload cargo. The Yangtze River is now fully navigable from upstream to downstream. Therefore, the Changxing Wheel, the deepest-draft ship of the Sanbei Company, which has been suspended for a long time, has now been fully loaded and has begun to resume service. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also chartered the seagoing ship Tianxing to sail to Hankou to rush to transport passengers and cargo at the end of the waste calendar year. All large ships of Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin Kisen Kaisha also generally go to Hankou. The goods that have been accumulated during the shallow water period have been rushed to be transported in recent days, so that they can be loaded to Xun and Hankou before the end of the waste calendar year for the New Year bull market sales.

### Shenbao Capital Extended by One Month

The Ministry of Finance levies income tax. The first category of business income, all companies, shops, firms, factories, or individuals with a capital of more than 2,000 yuan, must pay income tax at the prescribed percentage of their net profit at the end of the year. However, the Ministry of Finance announced that the deadline for reporting capital within one month of the start of the process has expired. According to news from the Shanghai office, many people went to report during the period. However, there are also many smaller shops that did not report because of business practices and because they were in the midst of the general closing period and were unable to fill in the amount of capital. The office has been explaining to the industry associations through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce that the reporting of capital is a preliminary survey for reference only and has no other effect. All industries understand and promise to report immediately. Therefore, the office applied to the Ministry of Finance to extend the reporting period by one month to March 1, and has published a notice to all industries.

### The Copper Coin Problem: Bank of China Entrusted Tobacco Exchange Industry to Exchange

This is divided equally among 100 households, with each household receiving 80 yuan per day. The Central Bank's Issuing Department will no longer exchange. This was implemented yesterday morning. However, as of noon, it was still not universal in the market. Therefore, the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association decided to hold a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss universal exchange methods.

Smaller Shops Still Rushing to Exchange

In the past few weeks, the tobacco shops in Shanghai have seen a sharp increase in demand and have sent apprentices to gather outside the Central Bank every day to exchange subsidiary coins in turn. Before 8 AM, hundreds of people have been standing at the door, and they are still squeezing and refusing to leave in the evening. The daily exchange amount is about 20,000 yuan or more. Although the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association Cooperative 100 large tobacco exchange shops were entrusted to exchange yesterday, smaller shops still went to the Central Bank to request a continued exchange. More than 200 people were waiting at the door, and they did not disperse until noon.

### Public Concession Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Others Mediate and Resolve Road Workers' Strike

To Take Care of Workers' Livelihood, Three Agreed-Upon Measures: Workers Satisfied and Will Resume Work This Morning

The strike by road construction workers of the Public Concession's Public Works Department was resolved yesterday through mediation by Yu Qiaqing and other Chinese directors of the board with the Public Works Department. Road workers are scheduled to resume work this morning. Details are as follows:

Three Agreed-Upon Measures

Since the outbreak of the road workers' strike, Public Works Department Chinese director Yu Qiaqing has been extremely concerned. Yu, in accordance with the workers' demands and for the smooth resolution of the matter, convened Chinese directors Guo Shun, Xu Xinliu, Xi Yushu, and others at the Shipping Club yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to exchange mediation opinions. Subsequently, at 3:00 PM, the Chinese directors went together to visit Mr. Jemson, the head of the Public Works Department, to conduct negotiations. The negotiations proceeded very smoothly. To take care of the workers' livelihood, three measures were decided upon: ㊀ The original workers will not be terminated, but only changed to temporary workers; ㊁ When there is a shortage of work, if the workers do not want to use a lottery method to determine whether to work or not, they can still rotate as before; ㊂ The original workers will be given priority for employment, and new temporary workers will only be recruited when excessively busy. When not needed, the new workers will be stopped first. Mr. Jemson also indicated that, considering the road construction projects in the Public Concession, it is determined that workers will not be left without work even if changed to temporary workers. After more than an hour of negotiations, the Chinese directors then took their leave.

Full Resumption of Work This Morning

Road worker representatives Li Jingchun and four others, as instructed by Yu, went to inquire about the news at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Yu informed them of the results of the mediation with the Public Works Department by the Chinese directors. The representatives, satisfied that there would be work, expressed their deep gratitude to Yu. Subsequently, the representatives recounted the oppression they usually suffer from their foremen. Yu also promised to inform the authorities and pay attention to it. Moreover, Yu also planned to negotiate with the Public Works Department for other relief measures when work cannot be done due to rain or snow, in order to maintain the livelihood of the road workers. According to reporter inquiries, the road workers, after Yu's mediation, no longer insisted and have decided to resume work this morning. Furthermore, the Chinese directors will continue to make statements on this case at today's board meeting of the Public Works Department.

### Ten Points of Petition by Southwest Yi and Miao Chieftain Representative Gao Yuzhu

Foreign Forces' Erosion and Intoxication of the Yi and Miao People is a Major Crisis: Requesting Central Government Relief and the Establishment of an Yi Affairs Consolidation Committee

Public Lecture at Sino-Western Radio Station Today at 4:00 PM

Southwest border Yi chieftain and Miao people's representative Miss Gao Yuzhu, after completing her affairs in Beijing, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, she conducted inspections in Shanghai, visited the war zone in Zhabei, and toured cultural institutions such as the Shen Bao newspaper. Today, she will give a public radio broadcast lecture. The reporter of the Shen Zhou News Agency specially inquired and recorded the details as follows:

Yesterday's Visit to the Scars of the Shanghai War

Miss Gao came to Shanghai to report on the general situation of Yi affairs in the southwest and hopes that those who pay attention to border matters will assist in development. Yesterday morning, accompanied by Huang Jingwan and others, she visited the China National Goods Company and expressed satisfaction with the progress of the machinery industry. She also went to Zhabei to visit the scars of the "January 28th" Shanghai War and expressed indignation at the enemy's brutal acts. After returning, she visited the Shen Bao newspaper and the Liangcai Library. In the afternoon, she went to the Xujiahui Catholic Church and visited the Lianhua Company. She is scheduled to broadcast the recent situation of the Southwest Yi people at the Sino-Western Radio Station at 4:00 PM this afternoon. She will stay for a few days and then return south.

Foreign Forces Erode the Yi and Miao Nationalities

Last year, Miss Gao, along with petition representative Yu Shucai and others, went to Beijing and met with Chairman Lin, Chairman Jiang, and Madam Soong Mei-ling. She was greatly congratulated for her efforts to innovate the Yi people. The Southwest Yi and Miao nationalities are distributed along the borders of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Kang provinces, with a population of no less than 25 million and a territory spanning thousands of miles. The people lead simple lives, and their character is brave, honest, and sincere. They are governed by chieftains, and the chieftains and the people are closely related, relying on each other for life. In the past, foreign forces penetrated deeply and tried their best to invade our chieftains, and used missionaries to bewitch our people, often instigating chieftains and Miao to break away from the Han people, promising large sums of money and new-style firearms as supplies. Unknowing Yi people were thus intoxicated, and some were willing to surrender to the rebels, while others relied on the power of foreigners to kill compatriots. The disaster reached a point where good chieftains and Yi Miao had no room for survival. Later, due to many domestic affairs and frequent border chaos, the foreign aggression was strengthened, and the hidden worries are a matter of concern.

Key Points of the Southwest Yi Miao Petition

In addition to foreign intrusion, the Yi Miao people are also suffering from banditry. The purpose of this petition in Beijing is to actively rectify and develop the Yi people and stabilize the border defenses. The petition items are: ㊀ Promote the culture of the Southwest Yi Miao; ㊁ Focus on Yi Miao education; ㊂ Adjust the policies for governing the Yi Miao; ㊃ Organize and train Yi Miao national armed forces; ㊄ Eliminate the Communist Party's redification policies in the Yi Miao ethnic areas; ㊅ Resist imperialist aggression; ㊆ Restrict corruption and devastation; ㊇ Focus on border party affairs to lead the Yi Miao nationalities; ㊈ Develop Yi land and enrich resources; ㊉ Allow the Yi Miao nationalities to elect several representatives to participate in the National Assembly, in order to demonstrate the principle of equality for all nationalities in the country. It also requested that the central government subsidize the development of the Southwest Yi Ethnic Cultural Promotion Association, establish a special Yi affairs agency in the central government, and allow the government to permit various chieftains to organize an Yi affairs consolidation committee in the border areas to be responsible for consolidating all Yi affairs.

### He Zifang Discusses the Need for Development in Yunnan Border Counties

Languages and Writing Systems of Wufu and Other Places are Disconnected: This Visit is to Investigate and Learn from Experience

Yunnan is an important province in our southwest, and the people of the country pay close attention to it. However, the counties in the border areas, due to inconvenient transportation, are quite disconnected. The reporter of the Shen Shi News Agency met yesterday with He Zifang, the Major General Military Counselor of the Yunnan-Guizhou Pacification Headquarters and concurrently the magistrate of Wufu County, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Yunnan, to inquire about the recent situation on the frontier. Mr. He had been ordered by Chairman Long Yun to go to various counties in the border area for inspection, so he knew it very well. According to his account, President Sun had long been concerned about the development of the southwest, and Chairman Chiang was even more concerned about the Yunnan border cause. Since Chairman Long took office, he has followed the central government's policies and ordered his subordinates to work hard together. So far, major policies have yielded results, and all political, military, educational, and construction aspects have been improved day by day. This time, I came to Shanghai to investigate various new facilities here, and to learn from them when I return. Mr. He continued to talk about the situation in Pusi, Lancang, Wufu, and other counties in the border area. The area borders Siam, Burma, and Vietnam, and is of great importance to national defense. The mineral resources are especially abundant, but the people's knowledge is shallow, and all languages, writing systems, beliefs, customs, and habits are closer to Siam and Burma. The disconnection is evident. The province of Yunnan is rich in produce, with agricultural products including the famous Pu'er tea, camphor, platycodon, cotton, rice, etc. Mineral products include the famous gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, coal, tungsten, mercury, asbestos, and the most famous mica. However, due to the inconvenient transportation in border counties such as Wufu, the outside world has been unable to enjoy them. Due to the inconvenient transportation, exports to Siam and Burma are more common than exports to the country. However, there is no major development due to the inconvenient transportation. Therefore, the development of Yunnan's foreign trade and transportation to Siam is also very important. This time, I specially invited Xu Ge Ting, the executive committee member of the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and secretary of the China-Siam Association, to come to Shanghai to report on the situation in southern Yunnan to those who care about the Yunnan border and hope that overseas Chinese in Siam and all sectors of the country will develop it. Mr. He will not stay in Shanghai for long and plans to go to Beijing within a few days to report the situation of the border defense to the authorities and to discuss the construction of a new Yunnan province and the development of transportation.

### Ministry of Transportation Orders Airlines to Pay Attention to Aviation Safety

Severe Punishment for Those Responsible for Accidents

In order to increase port shipping safety, the Ministry of Transportation issued instructions to China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, stating, "Aviation transportation places the utmost importance on safety. Since the establishment of the company, aircraft accidents have occurred (for China National Aviation Corporation) twelve times, with eight aircraft completely destroyed, four partially damaged, five passengers dead, twelve injured, six pilots dead, seven injured, and one radio engineer dead; (for Eurasia Corporation) nine times, with seven aircraft completely destroyed, two partially damaged, nine passengers injured, three pilots dead, one injured, and one mechanic injured. As for the recent incident of the Sichuan aircraft burning to the ground in Chengdu, an overall examination of the causes of the past accidents reveals that management negligence accounts for the vast majority, and technical deficiencies cannot be excused either. Many accidents could have been prevented, but they resulted in huge losses, which is truly regrettable. It also has a significant impact on the public's reliance on the company and the future development of our national civil aviation. In order to enhance the company's future aviation safety, a solemn order is hereby issued that the company must strictly order its aircraft maintenance teams and the service personnel at each station and airport to be cautious and meticulously attentive in their routine management, inspection, and repair of aircraft, as well as the organization and maintenance of airports. Pilots must continuously study flight technology. In the future, in the event of an aircraft accident, once the cause is determined, those responsible should be severely punished. In addition, if the company's routes have frequently occurring drastic weather changes and there are places where radio stations have not been established, please increase the number of stations as soon as possible. Aircraft that should be equipped with direction-finding devices must be installed and properly secured within the shortest possible time to ensure flight safety. You must comply with this order and report back."

### Shanghai-Suzhou Carrier Wave Telephone is Smooth

The Shanghai-Suzhou carrier wave telephone, since its installation and trial operation last month, was officially opened on February 1st. Since its opening, the sound waves have been very clear due to the increased electrical waves, and the public feels it is very convenient. It is reported that the carrier wave components were manufactured by the German Siemens factory and installed in the Zhabei Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Suzhou Telegraph Bureau. It is the MK type, specially designed for long-distance clear lines with shorter distances, such as 60 to 100 kilometers. It can transmit voice services through frequencies of 80 to 140 kilocycles per second. On each pair of clear lines, it can increase the number of simultaneous telephone lines to as many as five. The components are small, easy to install, and easy to adjust, so it is beneficial to both economy and business. It is heard that the Ministry of Transportation will also install corresponding carrier wave components on busy lines such as Beijing and Shanghai to ensure smooth voice services and reduce waiting time.

### New Beijing Sent to Repair, New Ningxing Ship Temporarily Replaced

Approved to Sail from Shanghai to Ningbo for the First Time Tonight

The Shanghai-Ningbo line's New Beijing Ship of the British Swire Shipping Company, after running aground outside Zhenhai, has been rescued and arrived in Shanghai for repairs. Because the repairs will take time, it has been decided to send the New Ningxing Ship (2,175 gross tons, 1,343 net tons, built in 1906) of the Sanbei Shipping Company's Shanghai-Hankou line to replace it temporarily. The notice is recorded below: Notice: Now that our company's New Beijing Ship is undergoing repairs in port, the New Ningxing is specially dispatched to replace it, starting from the 3rd of this month (Wednesday).

### US Shipping Strike Ends, Huade Ship to Arrive in Shanghai

According to the Continental News, the American shipping industry in this port will officially end tomorrow (the 3rd) due to the American shipping strike. In the period following, business will inevitably be extraordinarily prosperous. Yesterday (the 1st), preparations were made to avoid being caught off guard at the last minute. Employees of the Dalae Shipping Company and others believe that several ships will come to Shanghai from the United States in the second half of this month. Thus, the maritime trade that has been suspended for 94 days will be active again. Although there are no instructions or news from the United States, it is expected that a telegram will arrive in Shanghai within two days. It is expected that the first American cargo ship to arrive in Shanghai after the shipping strike is announced will be the Huade, which is chartered by the government and has not been affected by the strike. It sailed from New York around January 15th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on March 2nd. Another sister ship, the Pu Jiang, also sailed from New York and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on March 23rd. This is one of the first ships to leave the American coast in the hope of resolving the strike. In addition, the American Oriental Company's mail ships detained in San Francisco, if the sailors vote to approve the termination of the strike, will be announced on Wednesday and will set sail west on Thursday.

### Jianghai Customs Stipulates Regulations for the Management of Shipping

This customs issued Notice No. 1543 on August 29th, 1936. Now, by order of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, the supplementary measures for the said article are stipulated: If a merchant ship fails to reach the port where it was originally registered during the annual re-registration, it must be re-registered at another customs station.

### Ministry of Finance Replies to Chamber of Commerce's Promotion of National Rice Transportation to Guangdong

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance regarding the request of Guangdong Province to exempt foreign rice from taxes, requesting that it not be approved. The Ministry of Finance now replies to the chamber of commerce by telegram: "Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I have received your telegram. Regarding the case of Guangdong Province requesting exemption from foreign rice tax, it has now been resolved by the Executive Yuan that only foreign rice purchased by the Guangdong Provincial Food Adjustment Committee will be allowed to pay half of the tax in cash and half on account, limited to the transportation of 300,000 metric tons, in order to address the emergency of the province's rice shortage. The customs duty is not exempted, the quantity is limited, and it is for the purpose of regulating food, which ultimately helps the sale of national rice in Guangdong. Protection is also involved. At present, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is actively allocating more vehicles for the transportation of national rice, and the transportation cost of national rice, whether by train or ship, has been reduced. Rice merchants across the country should immediately understand the government's intention to protect domestic products, not have speculative intentions regarding the price of national rice, and not have a wait-and-see attitude regarding the purchase and transportation of national rice, in order to fulfill the responsibilities of the rice industry in regulating food. Work together to protect the sale of national rice. The Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association should promote the transportation of national rice to Guangdong for relief. I hope that your association will inform them accordingly, Ministry of Finance."

### Shanghai Gentleman Mu Shuzai Cremated Yesterday

More than 500 People Attended the Funeral; Ashes Stored in a Copper Coffin

Shanghai gentleman Mu Shuzai passed away on the 30th of last month due to cerebral hemorrhage, which has been reported in various newspapers. The Mu family, in accordance with his will, cremated Mu's remains at the Jing'an Temple Public Works Department Cremation Ground yesterday morning. Details are as follows:

Funeral Situation

After Mu's death on the 30th, the coffin was placed in the International Funeral Parlor. Yesterday morning at 8:45 AM, the remains were placed in a glass coffin and transported by a fire truck from the South City Fire Brigade, passing through Jiaozhou Road, Yuyuan Road, and Jing'an Temple Road to the Public Works Department Cremation Ground. Those who attended the funeral included members of the Shanghai City Defense Corps, the South City, Zhabei City Center District, Wusong, and Public and French Concession fire brigades, as well as Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Yiting, Gu Xin Yi, Huang Renzhi, Shen Xinqing, Huang Boqiao, Mao Zijian, Tan Boying, and more than 500 relatives and friends of Mu. Previously, the Mu family had followed his will and did not disturb relatives and friends, but people from all walks of life automatically went to participate, so the funeral procession was more than a mile long, extremely orderly and solemn.

Cremation Process

When the coffin arrived at the entrance of the cremation ground, it was carried by six members of the Shanghai South District Fire Brigade to the cremation ground. Those who attended the funeral stood in teams on both sides of the aisle and saluted. The remains were then repackaged into a specially made coffin for cremation and sent into the incinerator. This furnace is the latest equipment of the Public Works Department and burns with gas. All clothing, coffins, etc. had no metal objects, so after burning, in addition to the ashes that could be preserved, the rest was immediately gasified and dispersed, which was extremely fast. The family prepared another small copper coffin, about one and a half feet square, specifically for storing the ashes, to be kept for permanent worship and remembrance.

### Detailed Record of the Symposium on the Literary and Art Circles (Continued)

Pan Gongzhan: Six hosts, esteemed gentlemen, today, fellow members of Shanghai's literary and art circles have gathered together, and I am deeply honored to participate. At the same time, I feel that there will be frequent opportunities to meet with all of you gentlemen in the future, and I must thank the hosts for this. Just now, I saw the declaration of the Unified National Salvation Movement, and I was very pleased. I personally agree with the general principles of the declaration. I heard Mr. Fan Zhongyun say that he hopes everyone will express their opinions on the declaration, or nominate a few gentlemen to be responsible for making revisions. I have a few opinions, and I don't know if everyone thinks they are correct. Some gentlemen said just now that we should not discuss the left and right factions any more, so as not to cause disputes. I think this is very right. If everyone wants to do this, we should first have a common goal. If the common goal is determined, other trivial matters need not be mentioned. The saying "If a common belief is not established, mutual trust will not arise" means just that. If a common goal is not established, mutual trust will never exist. Now, a common goal has already been established, which is unified national salvation, and no one opposes it. In the future, we only need to work hard towards this common goal. But we must not only issue declarations; we must also express the spirit of unified national salvation in our literary and artistic works. Only then will unified national salvation become a reality. I see that this declaration has already mentioned "Every era has its own literature and art," "Every nation has its own literature and art," and "It is truly a manifestation of the era and nationality of our Chinese masses." In this era, the most important point in literary and artistic works is that they should be filled with a rich sense of nationality. In this way, on the one hand, literary and artistic works can meet the needs of the times, and on the other hand, they can unite the literary and artistic circles of the whole country, so that there will be no more slogans of any front. Whether it is the so-called people's front or anti-people's front, they are essentially inseparable from the entire nation and country. If the country is destroyed, what people's front can we talk about? Therefore, now it is only a question of how the entire nation should save the country. The entire nation cannot be preserved by a part of the people; we must use the power of the entire nation to protect all the people within the entire nation. We must not divide into any fronts. Therefore, China does not need any fronts, but only the unity and unification of the entire nation. In this critical period of national survival, all the petty personal grievances of the past within the nation must be completely eliminated under the major premise of saving the entire nation, and we must work together for the entire nation. Why couldn't the literary and art circles unite in the past? It was because they did not have a common goal. Mr. Wang Fuquan said just now that the reason why unity has not been successful in the past is because the left and right factions cannot agree. Frankly speaking, even within the left faction, it is not necessarily possible to be consistent. At the funeral of a leader of the left faction, they almost fought to the point of bloodshed over the position of commander-in-chief. Can this still be called consistency? This fully shows that the literary and art circles lack a great spirit and a fair mind. Engaging in literary and artistic movements in this way will probably not contribute anything to the country and the nation. Furthermore, within the left faction, there is a distinction between the so-called "national defense literature" and the mass literature of national revolutionary war. One side insists that national defense literature is correct, while the other side insists that the mass literature of national revolutionary war is correct. Frankly speaking, slogans cannot be eaten. What is the point of paying attention to these boring arguments? At this time, we do not need articles with outdated theories; we only need to consider how literary and artistic works can raise national consciousness and unite the national spirit. However, left-wing writers publish lengthy articles on these theoretical disputes in newspapers and magazines, causing readers to have headaches when they see them. One should know that the playwright has the playwright's ideas, and the director has the director's methods. During the performance, there is no need to explain how one wrote the play or how one directed it. Everyone only needs to watch your play to know whether it is well-written or well-directed. Otherwise, what is the use of thinking that one's "ideology is correct"? Therefore, I hope that the members of the literary and art circles will recognize the times. Originally, you gentlemen of the literary and art circles are undertaking a very important task. Half of the rise and fall of the country depends on guns, and the other half depends on pens. In the past, we scolded warlords, but now most soldiers are gradually awakening, uniting and working together against foreign enemies. But we intellectuals have not yet united, which is a pity. Intellectuals lead the times. The current era has reached the stage where the entire nation is working together for revival. If the literary and art circles do not quickly grasp this point and work together, then the literary and art circles will inevitably fall behind. How to distinguish between advancing and falling behind? I think it is not that the left faction is advancing and the right faction is falling behind. We must first recognize the times. Those who lead the times are advancing, and those who have not recognized the times and are still satisfied with old things are falling behind. Mr. Fan Zhongyun said just now that everyone agrees with talking about patriotism now. However, a few years ago, some people scolded him for being a patriot, thinking that being patriotic was falling behind at that time. Those who used to think that being patriotic was falling behind now suddenly feel that the country should be loved and no longer consider it falling behind. Also, a few years ago, if you talked about national defense, they would think you were falling behind because at that time they were talking about "internationalism" and saying that "workers have no motherland." If you talked about national defense, you would be a nationalist. But now national defense literature is the most "advanced." Isn't this a very bizarre and laughable phenomenon? Therefore, I say there is no such thing as advancing or falling behind; we only need to look at the needs of the times. The so-called national defense literature evolved from proletarian literature. Why did proletarian literature suddenly transform into national defense literature? This is due to the instructions of the Third International. Frankly speaking, imported communists are always more clever than homegrown communists. They saw that they could no longer implement the old plan. The environment has changed, and the plan should also be changed. Therefore, they had a resolution on what the People's Front in Spain should do, what the People's Front in France should do, and what the People's Front in China should do, and stipulated each one. They believed that China should now shout the slogan of resisting Japan, as resisting Japan is most likely to arouse sympathy. Therefore, in the literary and art circles, the slogan of proletarian literature was transformed into "national defense literature." This can be proven by the resolution of the Third International Congress. However, the above had already made a decision, but the Chinese Communist Party below and the so-called left-wing writers had not yet received the order and were still advocating proletarian literature. Only when they received the order did they immediately change to national defense literature. Why did they have to wait for the order of the Third International to change? This fully shows that they have lost their self-confidence. Therefore, the first step for us now is to restore the self-confidence of our literary and art circles. Gentlemen, you must know that the masses led by the literary and art circles are more numerous than the army. A commander or division commander leads at most several thousand or tens of thousands of people, while the readers led by the gentlemen of the literary and art circles are dozens of times more numerous than the soldiers commanded by the commander or division commander. Therefore, I hope that the members of the literary and art circles in the future will abandon their petty personal views and work together under the overall goal of national revival. I believe that the national revival of China will definitely receive great help from you all. Therefore, I very much hope that this declaration can mention "Work together to promote national consciousness, promote national sentiment, promote unity, and consolidate unity in literary and artistic works." I wonder what you gentlemen think of this. Secondly, as some have already said, our Literary Association should not only have those present today participate, but also hope that all members of the literary and art circles who are not present today will participate.

Shao Xunmei: Today, we are grateful to all of you gentlemen for gracing us with your presence and expressing many insightful views. On behalf of the six hosts, I extend our sincere thanks. Although the time for this symposium is short, and not every gentleman has the opportunity to express his grand views, we have obtained many valuable opinions that can be used as a reference for people in the literary and art circles across the country. Moreover, today's symposium is precisely the beginning of the collective efforts of literary and art workers. After the establishment of the Chinese Literary Association, we will have even more opportunities to meet and talk. Finally, I wish all of you present good health. (End)

### Supplementary Amendments to the Draft Regulations on the Collection of Taxes

Continued Letter from Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, etc. to the Income Tax Bureau (Continued)

C. The following are the points that should be supplemented and revised in the draft regulations on the collection of income tax on securities and deposits of the third category: ① Article 2 of the draft stipulates that "Stock interest refers to dividends," then it seems that share bonuses do not need to be taxed. It is a good thing to reduce the double taxation of company stocks in this way, but if a minimum limit is not set for dividends at the same time, then companies may modify their articles of association, cancel their dividends or official interest, and all income from shares will be in the name of bonuses. Then, the effect of this article will inevitably be to completely evade stock income tax. ② Article 2 of the draft stipulates that "Deposit interest includes the following items: ⓐ Interest on deposits received by banks and money shops; ⓑ Interest on loans from silver money businesses, foreign firms, groups, and individuals to companies and businesses." The second item not only has difficulties in interpretation in terms of wording, but also seems to have major problems in terms of meaning. First, what exactly is meant by the term "group" is unclear. Second, according to the wording of this item, strictly interpreted, loans from individuals to individuals, loans from companies, businesses, and groups to individuals, and loans from companies to companies and businesses are not included in the "deposit interest" referred to in this draft and do not need to be taxed. Is this interpretation correct, and does it have any meaning? All these become questions, so a clear regulation should be given separately so that people can understand. ③ Article 4 of the draft, "Interest arising from loans from banks and money shops and from inter-bank transactions between silver money businesses should be included in the operating income item for calculation, and deposit interest income tax will not be collected," is very appropriate, but the deposit interest income tax withheld from the deposits of profit-making institutions can still be deducted from the amount of income tax payable according to the provisions of Article 13 of the draft regulations on the collection of the first category. In reality, it is also equivalent to not collecting deposit interest income tax. Therefore, the application of the above Article 4 is not limited to the silver money business. Therefore, the last sentence of this article, "Deposit interest income tax will not be collected," should be changed to "Deposit interest income tax does not need to be withheld by the interest-paying institution" to be correct. ④ How to calculate the interest income of fixed deposits with lump-sum withdrawal should be added. Now, according to the calculation method in Article 7 of this draft regarding life insurance proceeds as part of deposit interest income, we propose a clause as follows: "For fixed deposits with lump-sum withdrawal, the portion of the lump-sum withdrawal amount that exceeds the actual deposit amount will be regarded as deposit interest income." ⑤ How to calculate the interest income of fixed deposits with periodic withdrawal, and when the tax amount should be withheld, should also be specified. For example, if the fixed deposit amount is 1,000 yuan, and it is scheduled to be withdrawn in twelve years, that is, 144 months, with a monthly withdrawal amount of 10 yuan, according to American precedents, there are two methods for calculating interest and paying income tax. First, the monthly amount of 10 yuan withdrawn in the first 100 months is regarded as a return of principal and is not subject to income tax. From the 101st month, the 10 yuan withdrawn each month is regarded as interest income, and income tax is withheld at the time of payment. Second, from the first month to the 144th month, the 10 yuan withdrawn each month is divided into principal and interest by precise calculation, and the income tax on the interest portion is withheld. Which method should we adopt in our country should be clearly stipulated. In our opinion, the first method is relatively simple and stable and should be adopted. The above is for Gao, Director of the Income Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and Liang, Deputy Director.

### Military Service Association Decides to Continue Service in Suiyuan

If the War Does Not Expand, It Will End by the End of May

The Military Service Committee of the National Association of the YMCA held a meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 12:30 noon yesterday to discuss the continued work matters due to the arrival in Shanghai of Xiao Siqian, Director-General of the Military Service Department in Suiyuan, and to welcome and comfort Xiao. More than ten people, including Zhang Jiapu, Liang Xiaochu, Lu Gan Chen, and Hu Yongqi, attended the meeting. During the meeting, Xiao reported in detail on the progress of the front-line service department and the needed items.

A Glimpse of the Work of the Service Department

Currently, the YMCA Service Department has a total of 21 people and 6 technicians working in Wuchuan, Bailingmiao, Jining, Taolin, Xinghe, Datong, and other places, which is very popular with the soldiers. Chairman Chuan is particularly preferential. This time he came to Shanghai and purchased a sound film projector at Qianghua Company to be transported to Suiyuan for screening to encourage the soldiers. A separate room was set up in the hospital specifically for wounded soldiers to write letters and handle remittances. The soldiers in the front line are very depressed, as all they see is a piece of yellow earth. Therefore, the service department has already gone to work in the front line. As for the Sui border, there are no Mongolian puppet bandits or traitors. The Japanese people in Sui are also not active, and it is very peaceful. However, rumors are rampant in the front line.

The General Assembly Decides to Continue the Operation

Xiao came here to contact the association for service work and to handle the period. Currently, because the front-line war has become peaceful and the wounded soldiers have gradually recovered, it was decided to aim for the end of May. The authorities' preference and welcome to the front decided to handle it until the end of May. If the war expands, the work will continue without interruption. At the same time, various encouragement efforts will continue to be actively carried out before the end of May. Xiao has completed his work in Shanghai, and has decided to return to Suiyuan this morning because of the importance of the work in the front line. According to Xiao, the main item needed in the front line is a large quantity. The soldiers value the need for items more than money.

### British Officials and Civilians in Shanghai Prepare to Celebrate the Coronation of the British Emperor

Large-Scale Military Parade and Fireworks Display. The Racecourse Prepares to Accommodate 60,000 People

The grand occasion is predicted to be unprecedented.

### Korean Independence Party Leader Yan Bingxue Escorted to Korea Yesterday

Shenzhou Society reported that he left by the Anping Maru yesterday afternoon. Yan Bingxue, the leader of the Korean Independence Party, was arrested by the Japanese Consulate General's police station and has been detained in the Japanese police station for many days. It is learned that after investigation, it was decided that the Japanese side would escort him to the Korean Governor-General's Office for trial. Yesterday afternoon, he left on the Anping Maru under the escort of Nishio, the patrol minister of the Japanese police station, and Nishimura, the patrol.

### Tea Picking Season Is Approaching, Improving Tea Making Technology

Qimen Establishes a Large Tea Factory, and Inspection Preparations in Tea Areas Are Underway

The improvement of tea-making technology has been promoted in recent years and has gradually made progress. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has actively carried out inspection of tea area origins. A monitoring office has been established in Shanghai.

After that, the Bureau should handle this type of drug case with special caution to avoid discrepancies. The following items that should be noted are listed for the Bureau Chief to follow: ① Drug users arrested should be sent to the Department immediately, so as not to lose the timeliness and fail to find the truth. ② The seized evidence should be marked separately for each defendant. ③ The personnel in charge should record the name of the drug user who was seen using drugs on the spot to avoid errors. ④ The drug suspects arrested at the same time should be sent to the Department together with the case for questioning to testify. ⑤ The detained drug dealers should first verify their fingerprints to prove whether they are repeat offenders.

### Hongchang Pawnshop Is Accused of Embezzling Pledged Items

A Diamond Ring of Great Value. Refusal to Redeem

Wu Yunfu, a native of Nantong at No. 6 Tongfu Lane, Fuxu Road, hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to sue Chen Yaoming, the manager and shareholder of Hongchang Pawnshop at No. 1 Hongde Lane, the eastern end of Jules Da Road, Fuxu Road, in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for embezzling pledged items and requesting investigation. According to the indictment, the plaintiff urgently needed a

Diamond ring

worth two thousand two hundred and seventy yuan on December 24th of the Republic of China Year 24. He entrusted his relative Shen Suigeng to pledge it at Hongchang Pawnshop, managed and opened by the defendant, for 500 yuan. At that time, he inquired that the pawn period was twelve full months, and a red stamp stating that it was twelve full months was affixed to the pawn ticket as proof. In October of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff's friend, the owner of the item, was in a hurry to return the diamond ring. The plaintiff also could not afford to redeem it, so he returned the pawn ticket to his friend to redeem it with his own funds. The friend of the owner

Was also tight on money

and could not redeem it, so he entrusted a jewelry broker to sell it to avoid being confiscated after the pawn period expired and suffering losses. When he handed the pawn ticket to the broker to see the goods in the pawnshop, he was refused by the defendant's pawnshop staff, who claimed that the diamond ring had expired long ago and had been confiscated. After the friend of the owner informed him, the plaintiff was shocked and entrusted Shen, the original handler, to go to redeem it with funds, but was still refused. After repeated negotiations, the pawnshop staff said that the

Red stamp

color did not match and should be in accordance with the blue text printed on the pawn ticket, which stated eight full months. If it was not redeemed after the expiration date, it would have been sold long ago. The defendant's pawnshop used this trick to deceive the pawnbroker and dared to consider the pledged items that had not yet expired as expired and disposed of them without authorization. This was clearly a crime under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and should be

Investigated in accordance with the law

and also incidentally requested the return of the original diamond ring through civil litigation. According to the complaint, the court summoned both parties to the court for interrogation yesterday by Judge Chen Shuoying. Both parties and their lawyers arrived at the court. After a detailed interrogation by the court, it was ruled that the case still needed investigation and questioning of witnesses, so it was adjourned to 2 pm on the 9th for another hearing.

### Bank of China Plans to Establish a Branch in Yangon

In order to actively develop overseas banking business, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Bank of China to quickly establish a branch in Yangon, Southeast Asia, to facilitate the sale of national goods and to facilitate overseas Chinese to remit money to the motherland to purchase goods. It is learned that the Bank has instructed the Singapore branch in Southeast Asia to select staff to investigate the industrial, commercial, and overall financial situation in that area. As soon as the report arrives in Shanghai, it can be started. As for the selection of personnel, there is currently no formal decision. After the branch is established in the future, the business scope will be the same as ordinary banking business, and special emphasis will be placed on overseas Chinese remittance business. Loans to various industries will be provided as much as possible, depending on the needs of the local situation. It is heard that the official establishment period is around March or April of this year.

### Lu Genlin Swindles Masseuses

Successively Swindled Three Gold Rings, Which Were Pledged for Expenses. It Took Half a Month to Be Arrested and Detained for Investigation

On the night of the 19th of last month, a sudden visitor came to the Sanmin Massage Parlor at No. 5, Lane 442, Haining Road. He selected a woman named Zhou Xiaomei to massage in the room. According to him, he was Zhang Yipeng, a famous actor of the Great Stage, and wanted to invite Zhou and another masseuse, Li Axiang, to go out to watch a play together. During the conversation, he caught a glimpse of each of the two women wearing a gold ring on their fingers and falsely claimed that the

Colors Were Not Good

and there were no names on them. He took the opportunity to take off the rings from the two women, saying that he would go to the silver shop to buy two more of the same kind and give them as gifts. The two women were young and ignorant and were deceived. They went out together. They first went to the Weiya Restaurant on North Sichuan Road for dinner. In the middle of the meal, the guest suddenly said he was going out to buy something and told the two women to wait a moment. He then went to Sanmin Massage Parlor again and went to another

Masseuse

Wang Gendi, falsely claiming that Zhou and Li were already watching a play in the theater and asked her to come and borrow a gold ring. Wang was unaware and rashly handed it over. Unexpectedly, he swindled three gold rings worth ninety-three yuan and then disappeared without a trace. Zhou and Li waited for a long time and the guest did not return. They realized that they had been deceived and had to pay the bill and return to the massage parlor. They also learned that

Wang Was Also Deceived

so they reported to the police and asked them to arrest him. It was not until the previous day that the Hongkou Police arrested the swindler. He confessed that his name was Lu Genlin, a native of Shanghai, 25 years old, and confessed that the three gold rings he had swindled had been pledged at the Lao Fengxiang Silver Shop on Nanjing Road. They ordered him to be detained and notified the victims to prepare seventy-eight yuan and two cents and four cents to

Retrieve the Original Ring

Yesterday morning, he was escorted to Criminal Court No. 5 of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, prosecuted the defendant Lu Genlin in accordance with Article 329 of the Criminal Law for fraud. He also stated the case, saying that a certain guiding agency at No. 7 Hankou Road also had a similar case of being swindled. The police requested a postponement because they had not yet investigated. After Judge Pan questioned Zhou Xiaomei and the other three women about the circumstances of the fraud, the defendant also pleaded guilty. The court ordered the defendant to be detained and adjourned the hearing to Saturday.

### Gambling Bandits Set Up a Scheme to Rob

All the Bandits Were Arrested and Sentenced Separately

Le Yuan, a woman from Ningbo, was passing near Yuezhou Road, Gongping Road, at around 9 am on the 22nd of last month when she saw a poker gambling stall. The woman had 50 yuan in legal tender hidden on her. She went forward to watch the gambling and was confused by the people. She took out the ticket from her pocket and was about to enter the game when she was robbed of the full amount and fled in a swarm. The woman urgently reported to the Huishan Police Station. Chinese Detective Zhou Guisheng and Detective Liu Decheng arrested the bandits Cai Xuehai, Wu Guisheng, Zhang Jinlong, and Wang Zhenhe, natives of Jiangbei, and the woman Wang Chen, at the Ruyi Teahouse on Jiashing Road and Huajie Shengji Road, and escorted them to the First Special District Court. It was found that there were a total of seventeen bandits at the time. Please postpone the detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiecai came to court for a continued hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Municipal Council, stated that the accomplices could not be arrested during the postponement. He also stated that these gambling bandits used three-card poker as bait, and countless villagers were victimized. Please impose severe punishments. The old pushcart inquired clearly and sentenced Cai Xuehai, Zhang Jinlong, and Wang Zhenhe to one year and two months of imprisonment, and Wu Guisheng and Wang Chen to one year of imprisonment and a three-year suspended sentence.

### Swire Resumes Shanghai-Ningbo Route

Renting the New Ningxing from Sanbei Company – Resumption of Service Expected Today

Swire Company's new vessel, the "New Beijing," mistakenly navigated the wrong route near Zhenhai port last month and struck the Laotaipo Reef. After taking on water, the company dispatched a ship to unload passengers and cargo. Cement and wooden planks were used to patch the damaged bow compartment, and the ship was refloated, towed to Zhenhai for repairs, and then sailed back to Shanghai for extensive dry-dock repairs. Unexpectedly, during this voyage from Zhenhai to Shanghai, the "New Beijing" again encountered

Stormy Seas

The captain, concerned about the ship's structural integrity, did not risk proceeding and returned to Zhenhai. It is now planned to further reinforce the hull before attempting to sail to Shanghai again. The Ningbo route, however, has been temporarily suspended due to the lack of a suitable passenger vessel to replace the "New Beijing." This suspension has lasted for two weeks. Fortunately, business losses have been mitigated through a profit-sharing agreement with China Merchants Sanbei Ningshao and other companies. However, passengers traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo have experienced

Crowded Conditions

on the Ningshao Company's "New Ningshao" vessel, which operates on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Latecomers often find no available passenger seats. Furthermore, with the end of the lunar year approaching, Shanghai natives from Ningbo are customarily returning home for the holidays. In recent days, the number of passengers departing from Shanghai to Ningbo on the Ningbo-bound ships has increased several times compared to normal days. Swire Company recognized the necessity of deploying a substitute vessel and, as it did not have a suitable ship available, negotiated with Sanbei Company to rent its "New Ningxing" to temporarily operate the

Ningbo Route

Shanghai will continue to have departures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, while Ningbo will have departures on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, recognizing the convenience this arrangement provides for fellow villagers returning home at the end of the year, expressed his support. The rental agreement with Swire has been approved, and the "New Ningxing" is expected to arrive in Shanghai from the Yangtze River today to unload cargo before being handed over to Swire. Swire will then deploy it to Ningbo today. The "New Ningxing" has a carrying capacity of 2,175 tons, can load 2,600 tons of cargo, has a draft of 17 feet 4 inches, has 10 first-class cabins, 18 official cabins, 148 second-class cabins, and accommodations for 451 third-class passengers. Swire is renting this vessel to continue and revive the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Once the "New Beijing" is repaired, it will resume service, and the rented vessel will be returned.

### The Qin Zhen Burglary Case

Valuable Items Purchased in London and Paris Stolen – Maid's Infiltration Confirmed

Qin Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, residing at 97 Masnan Road in the French Concession, has reported the continuous theft of valuable items since September of last year. The stolen items include nine watches and various currencies. Recently, gold watches purchased in Italy, a small knife purchased in London, and a gold signet ring purchased in Paris during Qin's overseas inspection were also stolen, despite being carefully stored. Qin reported the thefts to the French Concession Police, requesting an investigation. Detectives Li Tiqing and Wang Wenhua were assigned to the case and identified Qin's maid, Yu He (29 years old, from Anhui Province), who had access to the residence, as a prime suspect. Yu He was taken into custody, and she confessed that her husband, Yu Shixue (32 years old, from Anhui Province), had instigated the thefts. She claimed that the stolen goods were handed over to her husband for pawning or sale. Investigations revealed that objects began to disappear after He started working at the Qin residence in February of last year. Detectives have begun investigating Yu Shixue and attempting to recover the stolen items, with the intention of handing the case over to the Criminal Division of the Special First Court for further investigation today.

### Continued Hearing in the Lu Guanzeng Couple's Dispute Over Embezzled Jewelry

Plaintiff and Defendant, Each Accompanied by Their Lawyers, Appear in Court – Separate Interrogations Conducted for a Week, Witnesses Still to be Summoned

Lu Guanzeng, a wealthy businessman from Suzhou and owner of the Yuanli Yuchang Pawnshop in Shanghai, married Cheng Shuwen, daughter of Cheng Huting, a shareholder in the Fuyuan Money Exchange, in March of the 13th year of the Republic (1924). They have three children. Recently, misunderstandings arose between the couple, and Cheng returned to her mother's home, refusing to return to the Lu family. Attempts at mediation by relatives and friends were unsuccessful. Lu then filed a lawsuit in the Wuxian District Court, demanding that Cheng return home and return the

Jewelry Taken

with her. This case remains unresolved. Cheng has also filed a complaint with the New Zha Police Station in Shanghai against Lu Guanzeng and Mr. Yu, the manager of the Yuchang Pawnshop, accusing them of jointly embezzling jewelry worth over 110,000 yuan that she had stored in the Yuanli Pawnshop. The police have filed a lawsuit in the Special First Court, and preliminary hearings have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Division. Lu and Cheng attended with their respective lawyers, Ling Qihong and Wu Linkun, Wang Fusheng, and Jin Henian. First, police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that one of the plaintiff's witnesses, Wu Ruisheng, was out of town and unable to attend, but that Chen Huiquan was present. He requested that the court conduct separate interrogations of the defendants and witnesses. Wu Linkun requested several corrections to the previous hearing's record. The court first inquired about the circumstances of Lu Cheng's delivery of the jewelry. She stated that she and Lu Guanzeng brought the jewelry box to Shanghai. Lu escorted her to her mother's home, and she then handed the jewelry box to Lu for storage in the Yuanli Pawnshop. She could not remember whether anyone witnessed this. The court then asked if reconciliation was possible, given previous mediation attempts. She replied that there had been no talk of reconciliation. Wu Linkun stated that his lawyer and the plaintiff's lawyer had discussed the matter briefly, but the defendant insisted on

Continued Cohabitation

while the plaintiff wanted a divorce, making progress impossible. The defendant had two pieces of evidence: first, that the plaintiff had rented a safety deposit box at the Fuyuan Money Exchange in the name of San Ji in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933); second, that neither the letter from the plaintiff's lawyer to the defendant nor the letter to the defendant's uncle mentioned any

Embezzlement of Jewelry

The court then ordered Mr. Yu and witnesses Chen Huiquan and Zhu Shaoqing to leave the courtroom and questioned Lu Guanzeng. Lu stated that the plaintiff's jewelry was always kept by her. Only the "six gifts" given at the wedding were placed by him in an iron box in the Yuanli Pawnshop, and he kept the key. However, on Lunar New Year's Eve last year, she asked him for the key, saying she needed to use the jewelry for a wedding banquet. He instructed Yu to accompany the plaintiff to Shanghai, and later

Yu Informed Him

that the plaintiff had taken the jewelry box. The plaintiff refused to return home after returning to her mother's house. Despite mediation by relatives and friends such as Bei Runsheng, Qin Runqing, Liu Zhengkang, the plaintiff's sister Ge Cheng, and her husband Ge Wenqing, he had given the title deeds and seals to a piece of land to the plaintiff for safekeeping. However, the plaintiff later changed her mind. The court then questioned Lu and Cheng about the number and value of the jewelry items. Yu was then brought to the court and testified that he had been ordered by Lu Guanzeng to

Accompany the Plaintiff

to Shanghai to retrieve the jewelry. Around the tenth day of the first lunar month last year, they went together to retrieve the jewelry box, with the plaintiff saying she wanted to place it in the Fuyuan Money Exchange. Next, witness Zhu Shaoqing testified that the plaintiff went to the Yuanli Pawnshop and took away the jewelry box. Chen Huiquan then testified that he had sold the plaintiff 300 pearls, 60 small diamonds, and a diamond ring worth over 7,000 yuan. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Zhan Liangce adjourned the case to summon Ge Cheng and Ge Wenqing for further questioning.

### National Temples Hold Three Days of Peace Prayers

From the 11th to the 14th - The National Peace Protection Association Issued a Notice Yesterday

The National Peace Protection Association of Chinese Buddhists in Shanghai yesterday issued a notice to all temples and monks across the country, stating that all Buddhist temples, Buddhist organizations, virtuous bhikkhus, and elder lay Buddhists should be aware that the world situation is dire and the national crisis deepens. The enemy is entrenched in our vital areas, and internal strife is increasing. While we strive for human intervention, we must also rely on the power of Buddha to dispel disasters. It is difficult to eliminate misfortune without universal encouragement and dedication. Therefore, we are initiating a three-day nationwide prayer for national peace, starting on the 11th of the second month of the lunar calendar (March 4). We respectfully request all temples, organizations, and Buddhist followers to recite the Benevolent King Prajna Paramita Sutra and Mantra (or the Great Compassion Dharani and the name of Avalokiteshvara) during this period, activating the three karmas (body, speech, and mind) and sincerely dedicating the merit to eliminate the suffering of all beings and pray for the peace and security of the nation. May we turn the crisis of the world and quell the anger of the Asuras. We beseech your divine compassion and vows to jointly generate great dedication, rejoice in participating, and strive bravely and diligently. This will not only benefit our nation but will also illuminate the entire Dharma Realm. In addition to sending requests to the Buddhist Association of China to inform all branches, this notice is hereby issued by Honorary Chairman Wang Zhen, Zhu Qinglan, Chairman Dabi, Vice Chairmen Chang Xing, Qu Yingguang, Huang Molan, and Guan Jiongzhi.

### The Year-End is Difficult to Pass: Sun Chengshan Dies by Poison

Sun Chengshan, a native of Funing, aged 50, living in a shack north of Datong Road (Zhonghua New Road) in Zhabei, had a wife, daughters, and a total of seven family members. He usually made a living pulling a rickshaw. Recently, due to soaring prices, his income could not cover his expenses, resulting in a heavy debt burden. Moreover, with the end of the lunar year approaching, he was obligated to repay his debts. However, he had no way to earn money and thus conceived a desperate idea, committing suicide by poisoning. Yesterday afternoon, at 1:30 PM, his family members noticed his pale complexion and rushed him to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road. Dr. Lu Guanyuan diagnosed that Sun had taken a large amount of arsenic, and that more than four hours had passed. The poison had spread, and the blood vessels had all ruptured. It was impossible to save him. He was instructed to return home quickly, and he died shortly after entering the door. The case was reported to the Taiping Temple Police Station under their jurisdiction. After learning the details, the local bailiff was instructed to report to the Shanghai District Court to request an autopsy.

### Xu Yi Accuses Tan Zhuohong of Abuse of Power and Wrongful Judgment

Detained for Sixty-Eight Days - Request for Bail Denied

Tan Zhuohong, a former clerk of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai District Court, was dismissed by the Ministry of Justice for colluding with Shanghai lawyer Yang Shaopeng in bribery and for dereliction of duty. He was transferred to the Wuxian District Court, where the initial trial sentenced Tan to eight years in prison and Yang to six years in prison. On appeal, the Jiangsu High Court reduced Tan's sentence to four years and Yang's to three years and six months. The second instance appeal is still in progress. However, during his

Dereliction of Duty

while in office, Xu Yi, a former Shanghai lawyer, was also one of the victims. Therefore, Xu Yi filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the District Court, accusing Tan Zhuohong of violating Article 125, Paragraph 1, Clause 3 of the Criminal Law, which concerns abuse of power and wrongful judgment. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court session. Xu Yi, 31 years old, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, stated that he was formerly a lawyer and currently resided at 13, Lane 171, Tangshan Road. He stated that the defendant, Tan Zhuohong, during his tenure as a judge in the court, colluded with Yang Shaopeng. Last year, Cheng Li Tianzhi falsely accused the plaintiff of forgery. The original agent was Li Shirui. It was later learned that the case was being heard by the defendant, who then used the pretext of appointing Yang Shaopeng as an agent to

Bribe Him

4,000 yuan. As a result, the defendant unlawfully arrested and detained the plaintiff and wrongly sentenced him to four months in prison. The plaintiff then appealed to the Jiangsu High Court and was eventually acquitted, but had already been detained for 68 days. Within half a year, the defendant and Yang Shaopeng openly and blatantly solicited bribes, which were reported, and the Wuxian District Court sentenced them separately. The defendant's acceptance of bribes in the case of the plaintiff's trial was one of the crimes identified in the initial trial judgment. However, when the case was appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, it was obscured and considered that the evidence for that part of the initial trial was

Still Insufficient

Therefore, the judgment was reversed. According to the part of the defendant accepting bribes, it is difficult to avoid abuse of power and wrongful judgment. It has not yet been adjudicated in the previous case, and in the infringement of national legal interests, there is also the intention to infringe personal legal interests, so a lawsuit is now being filed. According to the scope of detention of the defendant during the trial, it is narrower than the scope of investigation. Reference to Article 20 of the Criminal Procedure Law is very clear. The Ministry of Justice repeatedly issued three orders and five declarations last year to

Vigorously Implement Bail

Responsibility, it can be seen how cautious the detention of criminal defendants should be. However, it was found that Xu was falsely accused of forgery by Cheng Li Tianzhi. During the investigation, he was not only not detained, but he was not even bailed. He obeyed three summons and attended the hearings on time. Moreover, Xu Yi had a fixed residence and a normal profession in Shanghai, and there were no other defendants in the case. It can be considered that there is a risk of claiming decorations. In short, Xu Yi had no reason to be detained. However, the defendant ignored the legal order and suddenly ordered him to be detained in the sultry heat. At that time, the defense lawyer He Baiqian

Tried His Best

To assign or to grant bail. The lawyer Wang Jianhang, who was in the audience, was also willing to jointly assign the defendant and asked to file a statement for instructions, but no instructions were given. It was clear that he knew that the reason was unjustified, so he perfunctorily waited until the day of the verdict. Xu Yi was sentenced to four months in prison and repeated his previous request. The defendant also said, "File a statement for review." Since then, on July 20, July 30, and August 17 of that year, I repeatedly filed statements, thinking that even if the crime was identified by the defendant, the circumstances were very minor. According to the law, there was no reason to be detained, and

Regardless of Approval or Rejection

According to the provisions of Article 201 of the Criminal Procedure Law, there should be a ruling. The defendant knew that the application could not be rejected according to the law and had received a bribe. It would be difficult to meet the person who bribed him. He shelved the application and did not make a ruling, making it impossible to appeal. After the case was submitted to the High Court, the defendant instructed him to apply to a higher level to shirk responsibility. Furthermore, the defendant's verdict obliterated all the counter-evidence favorable to Xu Yi and made empty statements, saying, "The prosecutor's words are credible and reasonable," etc., and forcibly convicted him by favoritism. The defendant did not mention it, and the court instructed that the case should be suspended for file transfer and another hearing date should be set.

### The Establishment of District Branches of County Rural Cooperation

In order to promote cooperative undertakings and guide the organization of district branches, the Shanghai County Rural Cooperative Business Promotion Association has appointed the chiefs of districts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Wu Shifang, Ge Xiusheng, Zhang Yi, Zhao Qianli, Xing Zhigang, etc., as directors of preparation and actively organized. Now the branches of each district have been established, and the summary of the branch rules and the list of staff will be sent by the county association to the county party headquarters and the county government for record. At the same time, cooperative societies will be established in each township according to the regulations.

### Zhejiang Industrial Bank Expands West District Branch

The West District Branch of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, originally located at 1166 Jing'an Temple Road, has been expanding its business in recent years.

The branch is scheduled to move to the new location on the 10th of this month to celebrate the new year, and will officially open for business at the new location on the 17th. The safekeeping equipment is mostly purchased from the United States, but it has not yet arrived due to the influence of the American seamen's strike, so the opening will be slightly delayed.

### A Clear and Bright Day in This Port

But the Extreme Cold Remains, All Ditches are Frozen – The Beginning of Spring is on the 4th, Spring Cold is Inevitable

The weather in this port was extremely bad the day before yesterday. From morning to noon, rain and snow were flying. In the afternoon, the rain continued intermittently. After dusk, the weather turned cold, and a north wind suddenly rose. The sky began to show signs of clearing. By yesterday morning, the sun had suddenly broken through the clouds. However, the cold air was biting, and the ice in the ditches was quite thick. The Beginning of Spring is on the 4th. Because the winter weather has been mild, it is inevitable that the spring cold will be severe after the Beginning of Spring.

### "Yunxiao Yao and Tong" Dispute Resolved Through Yi Jing's Apology

Issue No. 13 of Shanghai's Yi Jing Magazine contained an article titled "The Yao and Tong of Yunxiao," which contained many defamatory words. The Singapore Hakka General Association, the Chao'an County Dapu Association, the Tinglong Guild Hall, the Zhennian Guild Hall, the Wuhua Fellow-Villagers Association, the Meixian Fellow-Villagers Association, and other Hakka groups from Chao'an jointly confronted Yi Jing Magazine in a serious manner, appealing to all sectors of society. Li Dachao, Section Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Government, intervened vigorously, pointing out that during this time of national crisis, it was important to unite the national front and not allow disputes to arise that would hinder the nation's revitalization. He proposed a three-point solution: ① Yi Jing would publish an apology in major newspapers in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore; ② Yi Jing would regularly introduce Hakka history and origins to the best of its ability; ③ Yi Jing would formally issue a letter stating its position and apologizing. Jian Youwen, the person in charge of Yi Jing, agreed to this and sent letters to the Singapore Hakka General Association and the Chao'an Hakka Association. It is reported that Li Dachao received a reply from the Hakka groups in Chao'an who were confronting Yi Jing Magazine. The letter stated that after reviewing the proposed solution for Yi Jing's publication of the "Yunxiao Yao and Tong" article, the third meeting of their joint association resolved that since Yi Jing acknowledged its mistake, they were willing to accept the three proposed solutions put forward by Li Dachao to unite the national front, and that this should be recorded for future reference. They requested that this information be conveyed to Yi Jing Magazine and that they must implement the three proposed solutions as soon as possible. Li then forwarded the letter to Yi Jing Magazine, urging them to promptly resolve the dispute with the Hakka community. Thus, the dispute between Yi Jing Magazine and the Hakka community has been resolved.

### Barber Shop Employee Dies Tragically; Fugitive Murderer Wanted

Chuan Tinghui, a barber shop employee from Yangzhou, aged 28, who worked at the Dongfang Barber Shop at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Beijing Road, had a dispute with his colleague Wang Donggao on the morning of November 23rd last year. Wang violently beat Chuan with an iron bar and pushed him from the third-floor mezzanine, causing serious injuries to his abdomen, waist, and arms. He was sent to Renji Hospital, where internal injuries were found to be severe. The incident was reported to the police station at the time, but it was not accepted. Chuan Tinghui eventually died in the hospital on January 16th of this year, while Wang Donggao fled without a trace. Chuan's wife, Tao, hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the eighth criminal court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Fu Tao, tearfully recounted the events. The court ordered that Wang Donggao, who was at large, be placed on the wanted list. The trial will be suspended until Wang Donggao is apprehended.

### Wife Files for Divorce After Husband Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

Sentencing Scheduled for the Sixth

Li Zhiming, a local resident of No. 38 Gaojia Lane, Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, is 29 years old. In 1934, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the local court for murder. The Supreme Court upheld the original sentence in the final appeal, and he was sent to prison. His wife, Qin Guizhen, is 27 years old and currently resides at No. 17 Wangjia Lane, Da Xi Road. Citing her husband's life imprisonment, which makes it impossible for them to be together in this life and wastes her youth, she has hired lawyer Sun Qiying to file for divorce in the civil court. The petition states that the defendant is

Imprisoned and Unable to Provide Support, Requesting a Divorce. The plaintiff married the defendant in the winter of 1930 through a matchmaker. Since their marriage, their relationship has not been harmonious. The defendant indulged in vulgar habits and repeatedly tricked the plaintiff into giving him her jewelry and clothes from her dowry, which he then pawned. The plaintiff had hoped that they would be lifelong partners, but he continued to wander about. When she tried to persuade him, he became angry. The plaintiff, wanting to maintain harmony, did not say much. However, disaster struck in April 1934 when the defendant had a conflict with Yao Minggao, with whom he was living, and

Killed Yao Minggao.

Yao's wife immediately fled with the plaintiff. As time went on and their expenses ran out, the defendant instructed the plaintiff to return to her mother's home to find a way to make a living. After the plaintiff had been staying with her mother for a few days, the defendant could not wait any longer and secretly came to Shanghai. Consequently, he was arrested and imprisoned on the tenth day of the eighth month of the same year. After the initial trial, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The appeal was rejected, and the case was finalized after three trials. He was sent to prison. Upon hearing this, the plaintiff was heartbroken. Unfortunately, the defendant's family had no permanent property, and he had long been

Estranged from his Family.

Moreover, his father was living in his second wife's mother's home. As a result, the plaintiff, who was six months pregnant, was alone and helpless. If she stayed with her mother for too long, she would be burdening her elderly parents. Furthermore, the defendant's relatives were mostly untrustworthy and constantly pressured her to remarry, using deceitful words and threats to oppress her. The plaintiff, being an ignorant woman, could not bear such treatment. Therefore, she is requesting a divorce to save her life. Yesterday, Judge Chen Ping held a court hearing and brought Li Zhiming from prison. Qin Guizhen testified to the previous events and waived her claim to the return of her dowry. When questioned about this, Li Zhiming

Looked Unhappy,

Saying that she was taking advantage of his misfortune and betraying years of love. He did not want a divorce because receiving the summons was very stressful. He had ten reasons and requested a retrial after preparing his defense. The judge said that was not necessary because the case was clear and there were no issues with the judgment. He asked if he had anything to say at that moment. Li replied that he requested the return of the 500 yuan betrothal gift and compensation for

All Wedding Items.

He also pointed out that the plaintiff's statement that she had a child was false because the child was born last year, but he had been in prison for two and a half years. He asked how she could have become pregnant and given birth. He claimed that she had a lover named Wang and that was why she wanted a divorce. He requested permission to provide further reasons for a retrial. The judge stated that the facts of the case were clear and declared the debate closed, with the sentencing scheduled for the afternoon of the sixth of this month. Upon hearing this, the defendant declared in court that he would appeal the verdict. The judge ordered him to be taken back to prison.

### Concubine Flees with Belongings Due to Abuse by First Wife

Wang Gengtao Files a Complaint Requesting Investigation

Wang Gengtao, a local resident aged 48 who works as an accountant at the Kailuan Mining Bureau, bought Dai Xiulin, a woman from Suzhou (aged 24), as a maid seven years ago. However, Wang was attracted to Dai's beautiful appearance and slender figure. Before long, they engaged in physical relations, and Wang took her as a concubine, living with his first wife. However, Wang's first wife was fierce and often abused Dai. Wang, fearing his first wife, secretly built a golden house for Dai at No. 9 Beidi Lane, Beidi Road in the French Concession to hide her away. But because Wang feared his first wife, he rarely visited Dai, and the relationship between the old husband and young concubine could not last. Dai Xiulin lamented her misfortune and, on the morning of the 28th of last month, fled with her own belongings, including clothes, gold jewelry, a watch, a suitcase, a camera, and a kerosene stove. When Wang discovered this, the woman was gone. He reported the incident to the French police, requesting an investigation. It was not until the day before yesterday that they learned that Dai Xiulin and her lover, Zhao Baiqiao, were hiding at No. 7, Lane 16, Caojiaqiao, between Yu Yuan Road and Hede Road in the Public Concession. Detectives, accompanied by Wang, went to the address with officers from the Public Concession police at 5:00 AM one morning and arrested Dai Xiulin and Zhao Baiqiao. After taking them to the Public Concession police station, they only brought Dai Xiulin and her belongings back to the French police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the eighth criminal court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Qiu Huanying interrogated them. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police department, presented the case, stating that the police department still needed to investigate the case and requested a postponement. The plaintiff, Wang Gengtao, then claimed that he had been living with the defendant for seven years and that she had previously stolen his passbook and fled, but was found. This was the second time she had stolen his belongings and fled, and she was having an affair. He requested an investigation. When questioned, Dai Xiulin confessed that she fled because she could not bear the abuse. She was still wearing thin clothes in the cold weather, so she took her own clothes and left to choose her own path. She did not want to be the plaintiff's concubine. She denied stealing his gold watch, claiming that he had hidden it under her pillow to frame her. Upon reviewing the confessions, the judge ordered a postponement for further investigation. The defendant was released on bail of 500 yuan pending investigation.

National Goods Special

### Guanxian Hua on the Laudable Inventor

— Yang An

Because we advocate for national goods, we often pay special attention to, respect, and admire national industrialists, especially the many inventors who are tenacious and outstanding.

In the future, we would like to dedicate more space to chronicle domestic industrialists who invent things. Famous inventions are certainly worthy of respect, but ordinary, anonymous inventors, especially those from the working or lower-ranking white-collar classes, who rack their brains and expend countless efforts, overcoming countless difficulties, to achieve something, are particularly valuable and bring glory to the history of national industry.

Recently, the Department of Applied Chemistry at Nankai University invented proteins from cottonseed oil, and extracted glucuronide and formic acid sugars and other substances from corn cobs. We greatly admire this and believe that the university has achieved some success after decades of schooling. However, universities are places for academic research, and it is their duty to invent things. But for a tool worker in a machinery factory to invent something after seven years of hard work, such as Mr. Gong Xinglei, who invented the folding umbrella for both sunny and rainy days, is particularly commendable.

Mr. Gong is a 25-year-old tool worker from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, at the Puzhen Machinery Factory on the Jinpu Railway. He only received elementary education. He has been a tool worker at the Puzhen Machinery Factory since 1928. In his spare time, he enjoys reading books and newspapers on invention, which sparked his strong interest in invention. Several years ago, he aspired to create a pocket-sized, dual-purpose umbrella. He spent his evenings making samples and molds. His colleagues ridiculed his fantasies, and his superiors criticized him for being foolish, even threatening to dismiss him if he did not stop his research. Gong was unmoved and continued his work in his spare time. His roommates complained that he was disturbing their sleep and frequently reproached him. Only the landlord, appreciating his sincerity, was tolerant. After 18 months of research, he created the first prototype and applied for a patent from the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of Industry rejected it because the structure was not refined. Gong did not lose heart and continued his research. After another three years and eight months, he revised and improved it and submitted a second application for a patent from the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry rejected it again because it was not flexible in use. Gong continued his efforts and gradually modified it until it was finally completed, and he recently obtained a patent from the Ministry of Industry. In total, it took seven years. This laudable inventor is worthy of our praise and admiration. We hope that countless inventors in the country will continue to be featured in this publication, which is not only an honor for this publication, but also the glory of the national goods industry.

### National Goods Exhibition and Opening Up the Way to Townships

— Junmei

Autumn is ripe, the harvest is abundant, and the new grains are on the market. This is the only time for national goods manufacturers to go to the inland townships. In the past, national goods exhibitions in the inland often did not yield good results. Here, I feel that there are several points that national goods manufacturers need to improve if they truly want to open up this vast road.

1. Extensive Publicity The minds of the masses in the townships are simple, which is an undeniable fact. However, their curiosity and willingness to try new things are inversely proportional. In the past, national exhibitions in the inland often neglected this point and considered publicity unimportant. Even a small grocery store in a township must be heavily promoted beforehand to attract customers, fearing that they will not be thorough enough. How should this large-scale shopping mall use interesting publicity to attract attention? Moreover, farmers in the townships "follow the crowd." The quieter the storefront, the more they will shy away. Therefore, widespread publicity is also an indispensable condition in the townships.

2. Clear Arrangement Undoubtedly, there are no larger houses in the townships to allow for a comfortable arrangement. Doors, samples, advertisements, and flags are hung in a chaotic manner. Inside, the goods are stacked in a disorderly manner, and some of the boundaries are unclear. Being in this environment is like falling into a fog. There is no way to stay and watch, nor can one choose the goods with ease. In fact, although the house is small, one can save space to allow for room to stand. Although there are many goods, one can arrange them in an orderly manner to give people a clear understanding.

3. Kind Attitude Secondly, most farmers in the townships are relatively awkward and shy in their attitudes and actions, especially women, who can be unbearably trivial about the goods and their prices. In the city, shop assistants who are accustomed to service will unconsciously reveal their disdain and impatience. As a result, they may be cold and unresponsive to customers' inquiries, and they may monitor or ridicule those who are not neatly dressed, making simple farmers uneasy. Although these situations are sometimes caused by language barriers, if the service personnel can be more kind and friendly, the farmers will be receptive.

### National Goods Joint Company and the Future of National Goods

— Gong Jin

Recently, the National Economic Construction Movement Committee, in conjunction with the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association and various national goods factories, companies, and commercial introduction agencies, discussed the establishment of a National Goods Joint Company. It is reported that they have reached a satisfactory agreement with the Ministry of Industry. Preparations for the establishment will begin soon. This is another good sign for the future of national goods.

Since the people of our country, deeply aware of the harm of economic aggression by the great powers, began to advocate for national goods, they initially only knew how to shout slogans and implement passive inspection methods. More recently, they have learned to organize groups, formulate concrete plans, and focus on positive measures, such as establishing various national goods associations, holding national goods years, and recruiting home visitors. Moving from empty talk to practical action is a sign of progress in the national goods movement. However, many people still have two difficulties in purchasing national goods. One is the difficulty in distinguishing between national and foreign goods. In the past, national goods were simple and easy to identify. In recent years, imitation of foreign goods has progressed rapidly, and the products sometimes surpass those of foreign countries. In addition, some unscrupulous merchants take advantage of the patriotic psychology of the Chinese people and pass off foreign goods as national goods, which makes it even more difficult for purchasers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish places that specialize in selling national goods. In the past, various places have held national goods exhibitions and fairs to sell national goods, but these were mostly temporary and ineffective. A permanent national goods company is needed. The second is the lack of a complete national goods sales venue. With the progress of modern culture, the variety of daily necessities has increased significantly. If consumers have to go to many different places to purchase the goods they need, it is very troublesome and uneconomical in terms of time. Therefore, department stores have emerged to meet this need, gathering various goods from different places in one place, allowing consumers to obtain all the daily necessities they need for clothing, food, housing, and transportation in one place. The Sincere and Wing On stores in Shanghai are examples of this. Unfortunately, they are mostly a collection of foreign goods and a distribution center for imported goods. A large-scale national goods department store of this kind is still lacking. If the people of our country can recognize this and establish such companies in various places, it will greatly help the development of the future of national goods.

### A Fundamental Approach to Ms. Xu Qu Gong’s Advocacy of Domestic Goods

— Ms. Lin Wen

My experience with interviews is increasing daily, and I now feel no difficulty whatsoever. Yet, recently, I suddenly encountered such an unexpected setback! Although I don't feel discouraged, each day doesn’t go as smoothly as I'd like. One gloomy morning, I went to Heping Village and knocked on the doors of eight houses, but the replies were always: "They're out," "They're sick," "No one's home." Some people sat in the parlor for ten minutes or more, only to say that the person wasn't home! From the first lane all the way to number twenty-one of the very last lane, the door was opened by the same maid. I handed her my business card, and she invited me into the parlor. I carefully listened for sounds inside. From afar, I heard a woman's voice saying, "Please ask her to sit for a while!" The maid brought out tea, and soon a hostess, nearly fifty years old, with a kind manner and simple clothing, speaking in a Beijing accent, came out and smiled at me, saying, "I saw in the newspaper that you had arrived, and I have been looking forward to it every day. The other day, two women passed by my door, peering inside. I thought it was you, the interviewer, and hurried to open the door, only to be disappointed that they were carrying cards and notebooks to solicit donations for building a school. No wonder enthusiastic female interviewers for the nation are facing unexpected obstacles due to the uneven quality of people and things. Today, I have finally met you, and we can talk freely..." I believe her remarks are worth publishing. The following is Ms. Xu Qu Gong's conversation:

㊀ Our country's industry has been progressing rapidly recently, and domestic products are not lacking in high-quality items. However, according to customs import reports, the amount of imported cosmetics has been increasing at an alarming rate year by year. The reason for this is simply that the consumers are generally women of the propertied class. But fundamentally, it's because domestic cosmetics lack suitable products! For things like face powder, perfume, and facial soap, the principle should be that they don't damage the skin and are hygienic. All cosmetic merchants should cooperate and openly research together, aiming to defeat foreign goods, and not prioritize profit or competition within the industry. On the one hand, we must rely on the literary advocacy and publicity efforts of noble ladies and wealthy women. Hopefully, this will lead young women who tend to imitate to follow suit, and it won't be difficult to make domestic cosmetics active in the market in the shortest possible time!

㊁ Students in various middle and large schools in Shanghai, except for elementary school students who have some awareness of patriotism and promoting domestic goods, have a weaker sense of national concept at the middle school and university level! Most of their minds are Westernized, and everything they need for clothing, food, and housing is imported. Western suits are made of foreign materials; social interactions require four meals; furniture is purchased from foreign stores. They have become accustomed to this, to the point where it is irreparable! Moreover, schools do not have prescribed uniforms, which not only fosters extravagance but also directly contradicts the promotion of domestic goods. It is hoped that people with concern for national affairs will find ways to petition the education authorities to order all schools nationwide (especially in Shanghai) to prescribe student uniforms, with raw materials to be sourced from domestic goods. This would not only promote a simple and unadorned style but also achieve the effect of promoting domestic goods!

㊂ Domestic goods manufacturers should ideally contact schools and authorities of various organizations to set up domestic goods sample display areas in each school, displaying various valuable domestic goods samples. Each sample should clearly state the name of the producing factory and the telephone number of the purchasing department of that factory, so that those enthusiastic about using domestic goods can purchase them at any time. At the same time, manufacturers can offer schools and organizations special preferential treatment: that is, those who shop with a certificate can be given a discount. This method has been implemented by the Tianjin YWCA, and Shanghai can follow suit. As for elementary schools, the principals can be asked to give brief talks to elementary school students during weekly assemblies about the evil schemes used by people from certain countries to sell food in our country: such as adding white powder to white sugar; adding white stone chips to white rice; adding chemical poisons to salted fish, causing chronic poisoning after consumption. All of this can be explained in detail to elementary school students, so that they know the necessity of promoting domestic goods in their pure minds, and instruct them to spread the word to their families and friends at any time. Isn't this a good way to fundamentally promote domestic goods? (To be continued)

### On Salesmanship (II)

— Ding Kai

Dealing with counterparts requires not only research and discussion but also detailed psychological analysis. Harvard University Professor Copeland used psychology to test and analyze the motivations of customers buying goods and made them public. Excerpts are as follows:

A. Original Class (The purchasing function comes entirely from nature without any reason. Salesmen should cater to this instinct.)

(1) Being different from others (2) Being worthy of competition (3) Special achievements (4) Maintaining health (5) Protecting young children (6) Satisfying appetite (7) Promoting ambition (8) Pleasing to the eye (9) Maintaining safety (10)崇尚時髦

B. Emotional Class (Due to emotional impulses, salesmen do not need to move with reason.)

(1) Increasing beauty (2) Physical comfort (3) Family happiness (4) Maintaining cleanliness (5) Occupying as one's own (6) Beautiful demeanor (7) Entertainment (8) Promotion (10) Sightseeing

C. Rational Class (Customers are well-prepared when buying. Sellers must explain the advantages in detail.)

(1) Sturdy and durable (2) Convenient application (3) Increased efficiency (4) Unparalleled economy (5) Good quality (6) Attentive service

We have seen Mr. Copeland's psychological analysis, and at the same time, we must also study the "sales channels" issue. If we consider "sales channels" from an economic point of view, then sales itself becomes a tool or item. From the manufacturer to the distributor, then to the door-to-door salesman, to the final consumer, all the various processes that are gone through are used by sales itself as a tool to seek profit. At this point, we believe that factory managers should simultaneously use three psychological studies:

A. Adapting to the market channels in the buying and selling process and catering to its interests;

B. Understanding the consumer's psychology and paying attention to their desires and convenience;

C. Catering to customs and paying attention to its metabolism.

### Introduction to the Function of Pocket Umbrellas for Both Sunny and Rainy Days

The pocket umbrella for both sunny and rainy days has three functions: (1) Convenient to carry. This umbrella is similar to a flashlight, 9 and 1/3 inches long, and the diameter can be reduced to 1 and 1/2 inches, which can be hidden in a pocket. (2) For both sunny and rainy days. To use it, first take the sliding ring of the umbrella, pull out the umbrella handle inside, and after opening it, it is the same as an ordinary umbrella. When retracting, take the sliding ring of the umbrella with your left hand, take the handle of the umbrella with your right hand, and then turn your left hand to the right and your right hand to the left. When it doesn't move, pull the sliding ring down, and push and retract the umbrella handle upward at the same time, and then put it into a thin rubber bag. Mr. Gong is very willing to cooperate with others or transfer the patent rights to others.

Size and weight of pocket folding umbrellas

(Large, for men) The diameter after shrinking can be reduced to 1 and 1/2 inches, the length is 9 and 1/3 inches, and the weight is 1 pound, which is 6 taels lighter than ordinary umbrellas (produced by Shanghai Fu Factory). The size after opening is the same as an ordinary umbrella.

(Small, for women) The diameter after shrinking can be reduced to 1 and 1/8 inches, the length is 9 and 1/3 inches, and the weight is more than 9 taels. The diameter after opening is 36 inches. (Gong Xinglei, Design Department, Puzhen Machine Factory)

### The National Goods Movement in Various Ports along the Yangtze River (Part 2)

— Yun Sun

▲ Hankou There is the Hankou Municipal National Goods Movement Committee, which is based on central strategies to plan the city's national goods movement work. It is jointly organized by 15 organizations, including the Hankou Special Municipal Party Department, the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Hubei, the Hankou Municipal Government, the Wuhan Garrison Command, and the Hankou Chamber of Commerce. It has three departments: general affairs, publicity, and investigation. The office is located in the municipal party department and is currently headed by Mr. Yi Bao Xun. Hankou has a national goods market, and various newspapers publish national goods special publications from time to time. Wuchang's commercial activities are second only to Hankou. Currently, a ten-mile-long street is being developed. After Mr. Lu arrived, the Director of Education, Mr. Cheng Qi Bao, once convened a meeting of all sectors. In the future, Wuhan and Hankou are preparing to jointly form the Hubei Provincial National Goods Movement Committee.

▲ Changsha The national goods movement has achieved remarkable results, with the "Hunan People's Association for Promoting National Goods to Save the Nation"! The current standing committee members are Mr. Zhou Ding Yu, Mr. Huang Ji, and Mr. Ling Wei. There are three groups under it, with Mr. Xiang Rong Ting as the director of the Red Weaving Group, Mr. Zhu De Ling as the director of the Publicity Group, and Mr. Gong Zhong Sun as the director of the Review Group. The gentlemen and ladies of Hunan have a reputation for hard work and practicality! The provincial capital has a magnificent National Goods Exhibition Hall that cost 700,000 gold! The buildings are splendid and stand tall, creating a large base for promoting national goods! It seems that there are few such facilities in the country. The second, third, and fourth floors are exhibition halls, and the lower floor is a sales market. Embroidery, porcelain, minerals, cotton, and general merchandise are displayed in a spectacular manner. Collecting these local products is truly not an easy task. Adjacent to the exhibition hall is an entertainment venue, attracting people to stop and linger. Changsha's well-organized national goods movement is truly worthy of emulation across the country, far from sitting and talking without taking action! Mr. Lu finally said: Promoting national goods should not be just empty talk, but should be promoted with plans. The above-mentioned provinces and cities, party and government leaders, have made considerable efforts and enthusiasm in promoting national goods, and it is hoped that the central and local governments will have a unified name, and the main members are still young men and women students.

Notice The manuscript fees for this publication for January have been settled. Please ask the contributors to take the receipt and the stamp to the accounting office of this hall to receive it. (Time) From the 6th to the 10th, and from the 16th to the 20th, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. The National Goods Special Issue Department of Shen Bao

### The Chanyu Proposes Marriage

— (Sun Jingwen)

Recently, while reading history, I saw that after Emperor Gao of Han died, the Chanyu Modu even sent a marriage proposal to Empress Lu, "I am a humble ruler born in the swamps, raised in the open fields of cattle and horses. I have come to the border several times, wishing to travel in China. Your Majesty is independent, and I live alone. Two rulers are not happy, and there is no way to entertain myself. I wish to exchange what I have for what I do not have."

At that time, although China suffered such humiliation, Empress Lu was furious, but she did not dare to send troops to the Xiongnu. She had to politely decline Modu's joking request, replying, "The Chanyu does not forget our humble village, and bestowed a letter. Our humble village is frightened and has been planning since the retreat. I am old and weak, my hair and teeth have fallen out, and my steps are unsteady. The Chanyu has misheard and is not worthy of making himself sweat. Our humble village is innocent and should be forgiven! I have two chariots and four horses to offer for your frequent drives."

I suddenly realized that the demands of the invaders are arbitrary, and the invaded dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and still have to try to use sweet words to delay. However, we must know that Emperor Gao of Han originally used the policy of appeasement and marriage, first offering his own princess to Modu in order to seek temporary peace, which finally made Modu turn his thoughts to his mother-in-law, Empress Lu.

"A weak country has no diplomacy" has been the case since ancient times. The policy of appeasement will only arouse the insatiable ambitions of the invaders.

### The Newly Opened Xiang Gate in Suzhou

— Bi Li

Suzhou used to have six gates: Lu, Qi, Lou, Feng, Pan, and Xu. Later, Jin and Ping gates were added. Recently, because the Sujia Railway has been opened to traffic, the first station away from Suzhou is between Lou Gate and Feng Gate. Passengers entering the city must detour through Lou Gate, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, a Xiang Gate was added between Lou and Feng gates.

Now, Xiang Gate has been completed. The two characters "Xiang Gate" in running script, inscribed by Yu Jingtang, are on the city gate. The other city gates are all adjacent to bustling streets, but this one is very different. Inside the city is a clean and quiet street, along a clear stream. A corner of an ancient temple is revealed among a neat row of tall trees. Outside the city, a more beautiful natural picture unfolds. Just outside the city gate is a long wooden bridge, spanning the vast city river. The river here is wider than outside Ping Gate, so the bridge has twelve arches, comparable to the Baodai Bridge. The bridge has not yet been completed, and I followed a group of children and walked over it adventurously. What an interesting moment!

Across the bridge is a belt of wheat fields and water marshes intertwined. Seeing those water marshes makes one think of side dishes of taro, tender lotus root, red water chestnuts, and white water bamboo shoots. I walked slowly along the river, watching the sparse sails leisurely flowing on the river; the shadows of the sails fell on the ancient city walls surrounded by green vines. Within this ancient city, three tall spires are revealed. Everything is so quiet and solemn, only light white clouds swept over. Suddenly, the sound of a bell came from afar, startling the crows on the spires, reminding the tourists of their thoughts of returning home, and dispelling all silence.

Friends who go to Suzhou to play, when you are tired of visiting Tiger Hill or Lion Grove, don't forget that there is such a beautiful and poetic picture outside Xiang Gate.

### On the Usefulness of Daughters

— Wei Jing

Ah Gen, the old tea room servant who resigned two years ago, is now wearing riding breeches and a呢大衣, smoking a cigar, and riding in a shiny private car. He often comes to our office to play. Our director treats him like an honored guest, gets along very well with him, and often invites him to dinner. At the same time, it is rumored that our director, who is always complaining about being poor, has private financial dealings with him, but this matter has not been confirmed. However, how Ah Gen became so rich is worth mentioning.

Four or five years ago, that was after the January 28th Incident, everyone knew that Ah Gen was in a very poor situation because his home was destroyed by artillery fire, and his two sons, one a typesetting worker and one a leather factory worker, were unemployed. At the same time, his three daughters, who were working as female workers in the factory, could not find jobs that earned five or six cents a day. At that time, the whole family's livelihood almost completely depended on his monthly income of nearly twenty yuan, so his lunch was three large pancakes every day. It is said that the morning and evening meals were not so sumptuous.

The pressure of hunger and cold forced his three daughters to embark on a less honorable path to earn food and clothing. Initially, they were all private prostitutes, and then they changed their profession to female tea room servants. Three years ago, the eldest daughter sneaked into the film industry to become a supporting actress. The second daughter went to a small dance hall to become a dancer. The youngest daughter worked as a waitress in a coffee shop. A year later, the second daughter was married by a comprador as a concubine. The youngest daughter had a relationship with a wealthy artist and lived with him. During that period, his eldest daughter also switched from the film industry to the dance industry, and quickly became a popular dance star. Even more gratifying, his two unemployed sons were able to support themselves due to the help of their second sister, who was married to a comprador. Therefore, when Ah Gen resigned two years ago, his three daughters subsidized him a total of about three hundred yuan per month.

In the past two years, his eldest daughter was hired by a famous banker and was favored in the household. The youngest daughter broke off her relationship with the artist and married a bureau chief as a stepmother, going to a certain northern province to be an official's wife. According to our director, Ah Gen now is very different from two years ago and has at least sixty to seventy thousand yuan in his hands. Although the two sons are nothing special, his three sons-in-law are really unbelievable. So these days, it is more useful to have daughters than to have sons. Ah Gen is a good example.

### The Living Depend on the Dead

— Chen Liang

Shanghai is really a strange society. Some people eat by fraud, some people eat by intimidation, but this is still the living earning the living's money. "Bai Xiang Ren" sit with their legs crossed at the tiger stove all day long, dressed warmly and eating well. Their skills are "extraordinary." What is even more strange is that the living depend on the dead for food.

This time, due to handling the funeral of my deceased wife, I was given a new insight, at least for the first time for me.

Death is originally the greatest misfortune. Coffins, bedding, and silver ingots all cost money. "Losing both people and money" is the most unfortunate of misfortunes. But in addition to the legitimate burial expenses, there are all kinds of expenses that cannot be named. These expenses are not for the dead, but are extorted by many living people.

As soon as the white paper strip "Family has a funeral" was posted, sure enough, immediately a gentleman in a呢大衣and a copper basin hat ran in. The stranger was indeed a stranger, but he was not here to offer condolences. When I went up to ask the purpose of his visit, he said very honestly, "The little brothers in this street are asking for some expenses." Expenses, I heard, were rather strange. I declared to him, "Friend, someone in my family has died!" But he replied even more honestly, "Yes, we live off the mountain if we are near the mountain, and we live off the water if we are near the water." As a result, I confusedly gave a dollar to send him away. Unexpectedly, another group of "little brothers" came, also asking for expenses. Thus, I had to deal with it two, three, or four times.

The coffin carriers opened their mouths to ask for money again. "It's all contracted to your office," I solemnly declared, but it was ineffective. They said, "As long as you make life exquisite for us, we will take advantage of the tea money." The dead person was lying on the board, and there was no way, so I had to pay. After the encoffining was completed, the lacquerers used putty to fill the coffin seams. As usual, they opened their mouths to ask for money, saying that they only had a fixed wage in the office and relied entirely on the bereaved family to reward them. The words were pitiful enough, and needless to say, I paid.

The "escort pass" for fifty people cost two dollars, but "passing" was still a problem. The "little brothers" on the road demanded "toll money." At the office, someone helped light incense candles and silver ingots. The twenty strings of yuanbao prepared to be burned for the "earth god" were snatched away by an old woman as if to honor her, and as a result, hands stretched out to ask for money before leaving.

They are all living people who live off the dead. Even "dying" is not easy in Shanghai. It is really a strange society.

### The False Phoenixes

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 10 (Su Pa Sends a Tender Poem, Miscasting the Golden Flowers, Autumn Letters Add to the Sorrow of Yellow and Withering)

Mrs. Jiang said, "According to what you say, he is lovesick." The eldest daughter-in-law interjected, "Mother, you believe Xiao Ju's nonsense." Mrs. Jiang said, "He may not be talking nonsense. This Meng Lan child, her mouth is full of reform. But she is so sickly and melancholic, she has become a Lin Daiyu-style girl. Naturally, some things also make her unhappy. But in a family like ours, with plenty of food and clothing, and everything going smoothly, she shouldn't be frowning all day long." The second daughter-in-law was younger, and could not fully hide her words in her heart, so she smiled at Mrs. Jiang and said, "I think it is because she has eaten the loss of reform. You also know the thing that makes her unhappy, right?" Mrs. Jiang took the water pipe on the table and sighed. Xiao Ju quickly lit a paper coal and sent it over. Mrs. Jiang smoked without answering. The eldest daughter-in-law and the second daughter-in-law were facing each other, and they exchanged glances twice. So, the question that could just be discussed stopped again. But under this situation, it moved the second daughter-in-law a little bit of compassion. That day, she stopped talking. The next day, she thought of a way to comfort Meng Lan. This day, it was a dark day, and the sky was full of fragmentary dark clouds. Meng Lan came back from school and saw that several pots of newly opened chrysanthemums were placed on the tea table in the business hall. Especially this pot on the desk was the best. It was planted in a small Yixing porcelain mud vase. The vase was liver-colored, red with black color. Big belly, small mouth of the vase, from which two chrysanthemum branches stretched out. The one stretching out on the left was longer, the leaves were long and thick and ancient green, the left and right were contrasted, and there was no lack of a piece. At the top was a delicate petal of light yellow chrysanthemum, as big as a small rice bowl. The petals were so fine, so fine that they were like a pinch of silk cotton, drooping lightly. The branch on the right was short, with a small flower bud as small as a winter melon date. He threw the schoolbag on the bed, clapped his hands and said, "Good flower, good flower, who got this for me?" Xiao Ju followed upstairs and answered, "The second daughter-in-law got it from her mother's house. She said that you will be happy for a while after seeing this chrysanthemum, and it is indeed true." Meng Lan lay on the edge of the table, looked at the chrysanthemum for a while, and sighed, "It is still the sister-in-law who is a caring person, and sent me a few pots of chrysanthemums to relieve my boredom. But when the west wind rolls the curtain, people are thinner than the yellow flowers. Seeing the chrysanthemum only adds to my withering." Xiao Ju said, "Miss, are you saying that the flower is not good?" Meng Lan laughed and said, "Nonsense, why would I dislike such a beautiful flower. You go downstairs and invite the second daughter-in-law, I will thank her in person." Xiao Ju agreed and left, but she didn't come back for a long time. (121)

### Weekend Customs of Various Countries

— Ji Yun

Saturday is the last day of the week. People work hard for six days of the week, and by Saturday, everyone feels relieved and looks forward to Sunday, the day of rest, to recover from mental and physical fatigue. Taking advantage of the gathering of reporters from various countries for the World Games in Berlin, the German magazine *Die Woche* inquired about the weekend activities of people in various countries from famous reporters, resulting in a very interesting record.

In England, on Saturday afternoon, the complex business situation gradually becomes sparse and cold. The hustle and bustle on the streets of London noticeably decreases. Sunday is a solemn religious day. Telephone calls from various places no longer mention commercial matters. If this sacred spirit is insulted, then that person's usual intentions must be very evil. Such sinful people will be respected and kept at a distance by society. Sunday afternoons are for children to play freely, and adults also begin their activities. However, they must follow God's commands and engage in labor until twelve o'clock. Therefore, the English do not return to their usual mood until after twelve o'clock on Sunday afternoon.

In Bulgaria, stopping work at one o'clock on Saturday afternoon is considered a moral principle. Sunday is the happiest day for Bulgarians, and most plan to visit friends and relatives. The first visit is usually to the sweet home of newlyweds. The housewife cheerfully prepares delicious dishes. From morning to night, they happily wear clothes as beautiful as those on stage. Sunday is a day for the people of Bulgaria to return to their childhood, playing games that children can do all day long. In hiking groups, there are always adults mixed in with the children. In winter, it is customary to go skating with the family.

In France, when the clock strikes twelve on Saturday, people leave work and go home. Between seven and eight in the evening, they are busy tidying up at home; this is a French custom. After finishing, they discuss plans for Sunday, with young women always being the first to suggest ideas. If there are young women in the family, then their plan will usually be adopted. They don't like traveling by train, they don't like staying in hotels, and they prefer to go to forests and lakes. They spend most of their time driving cars and playing dominoes. Parks are the best places to bask in the sun, but they are not that interesting.

Outdoor camping is the most common plan for Sunday in Poland because Polish people really like driving cars, and there are many forests. Those who cannot leave their homes on Sunday are considered the most unfortunate, so even cats and dogs go out together. Women sing songs, and men simply listen quietly beside them.

Unlike women in other countries, Italian women do not like going out, so weekend trips are rare. They skillfully decorate their homes on weekends, with women as the planners and men as the implementers. In the afternoon, they entertain female guests, hosting banquets with various names. Men are considered very fortunate to be invited.

In New York, after the noon whistle blows on Saturday, the citizens scatter like birds and beasts, quickly discussing plans for leisure on Sunday. As a result, the city streets are as quiet as a cemetery. The suburbs, usually as silent as the seabed, immediately become a luxurious and lively scene. The air on Sunday is the only delicious drink for Americans, providing them with intoxication.

### Yue Wu Mu and the "Ox"

— Zongheng

What is the relationship between Yue Wu Mu and the ox? I say there is one. Look at the following. We have read the *Romance of Yue Fei* (this book was on the list of banned books during the Qing Dynasty) and probably all know there was a foolish general named Niu Gao. In the *Romance of Yue Fei*, he is said to be Yue Wu Mu's sworn brother, but in the official history, he is said to be Yue Wu Mu's subordinate general. He was from Lu Shan (belonging to Henan), his courtesy name was Boyuan. He repeatedly defeated the Jin people and was instrumental in capturing Yang Yao. He was promoted to Ningguo Army Commissioner. He was also a national hero. Yue Wu Mu got a lot of help from him. The traitor Qin Hui having killed Yue Wu Mu, he was naturally worried that Niu Gao and the others would rise up in revenge. Therefore, to wipe them out in one fell swoop, he secretly ordered the commander Tian Shizhong to poison Niu Gao. The story is like this: One day after Yue Wu Mu died, Tian Shizhong suddenly held a large banquet for the generals. The honest and frank General Niu naturally did not suspect anything. But when the wine had been flowing for some time, General Niu was poisoned to death. You see how vicious the traitors' methods were! The *Romance of Yue Fei* says that Jin Wuzhu was angered to death and Old Niu Gao laughed to death; these are words to soothe the readers' emotions and are unreliable. It is said that General Niu was also buried in West Lake, Hangzhou, after his death, but I personally went to Hangzhou several times and never found the tomb of this loyal national hero. I always feel regretful in my heart. (Editor's note: Niu's tomb is below Purple Xia Cave)

Also, there is a tragic scene in the *Romance of Yue Fei* where Gao Chong challenges the Hua chariot. The location of this tragedy was Niu Tou Mountain. The mountain is located south of Jiangning County, Jiangsu. The *Book of Song: Ritual Records* states: "In the third year of the Daming era, the southern suburban altar was moved to Niu Tou Mountain in Moling." *Yuanhe Zhi* states: "The mountain is forty miles south of the county. The mountain has two peaks, facing each other east and west, named Shenque, formerly known as Daque." It can be seen that this mountain was a strategically important place in military terms. History only says that Yue Wu Mu ambushed and defeated Jin Wuzhu here. The scene of challenging the Hua chariot in the *Romance of Yue Fei* was perhaps a sacrifice of this battle, but finally Jin Wuzhu was defeated, which shows that this tragedy had a considerable cost. It is said that there is an iron mine on this mountain, with the ore bed exposed on the top of the mountain and its northwest slopes. The ore on the slopes is of better quality, while the ore on the top of the mountain is of slightly inferior quality. The total ore reserves of the entire mountain are only tens of thousands of tons. It originally belonged to the Continental Company, but after a large exploration, the results were poor, and operations were stopped (see *Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Place Names*). It is also a pity that the buried resources are submerged.

The above two things are what I said is the relationship between Yue Wu Mu and the ox, because this year is the Year of the Ox, and the country is in a time of broken mountains and rivers. The story of this national hero is most worthy of our praise, so I have written it out in a scattered way as above, for the general public to use as a "not meaningless" topic of conversation during tea and after dinner.

*Shen Bao* Local Supplement

### Blackie

— Xinye

A narrow-gauge railway stretched sinuously from Huangye Ridge to the banks of the Du Ma River, quietly like two dead snakes. The small coal car was busy, crawling on it all day long, from the mining area to the depot, a short five or six miles, it was able to travel back and forth every fifteen minutes, carrying load after load of coal into the depot, while at the same time bringing the empty baskets back to the mining area.

After a sharp whistle sounded, a group of "blackies" crowded out of the mine. Their ink-black oilcloth hats and clothes were covered with patches of water stains. The black marks on their faces could not hide the fatigue of their lives. Although they were all in their prime, one could not find a trace of the courage that young adults should have in them.

Mu Long was awakened by the second long whistle. He pushed aside the ragged cotton batting that was pressing on him, got out of bed, hurriedly put on the stiff and cold oilcloth hat and clothes, and ran out of the mine house. A yawn rose from his throat, as if telling him that he had not had enough sleep.

Everyone in the mine house had run out. Those who had finished their shift had not yet returned. Only a few sick "blackies" were lying on their bunks, groaning heavily.

"Damn, living ten hours for forty or fifty cents, dying in a thin board coffin. Being a 'blackie' is really not something a human should do!" Mu Long muttered as he carried a carbide lamp that had not yet been lit and walked towards the mine entrance.

The sound of the winding machine was rattling. The mine entrance was already crowded with people. The small carbide lights flickered in the cold wind. The "blackies" who had finished their shift were lifted up by the winding machine like drowned chickens, group by group, and once they were on the surface, they all scattered. Mu Long ran over and lit the carbide lamp for a companion named A Li.

The wind was blowing even harder. The pillars of the engineering office were creaking a bit from the shaking. In the gray sky, goose-feather-like white flakes were flying. They drifted into the mine corridor and landed on the "blackies'" bodies and faces, and soon, they turned into a drop of water on their faces and bodies.

The fat foreman stepped out of the office, which was scorched by the stove fire like late spring. He tightened his beaver collar coat. A gust of cold wind blew in his face, almost suppressing a breath that he was about to let out.

"It's really cold, it's snowing!" He muttered to himself as he walked into the engineering office, telling the shift supervisor something, perhaps directing the work below.

The bell on top of the winding machine rang, and then every supervisor ran to the mine entrance. Each of them led eight "blackies" and sent them into a deep, unfathomable black pit on the winding machine.

Steam was rising from the black pit. Mu Long followed the supervisor and squeezed into the winding machine; the winding machine slowly sank into the black pit, like dropping into a chimney. The firelight trembled dimly, and all sounds were isolated. Occasionally, he or his companions would breathe out or cough, and it would sound like thunder. Water droplets dripped from the mud walls, like eaves leaking from a roof tile, all dripping on them.

The winding machine stopped below the stratum. The light of the electric fire in the mine tunnel was as yellow as the eyes of a patient with a degenerative disease. The trolley on the small railway was quietly parked there. The air was still, and a vapor of earth filled the entire tunnel. Hundreds of "blackies" arrived one after another.

### Magnificent Mansion

— Wang Tian

At the corner of Fourth Malu and Henan Road in Shanghai, there stands a magnificent mansion. The inside of the mansion is furnished very beautifully. When people walk inside on cold days, they feel very warm and forget the cold. There, you can buy all kinds of good medicines for household use, all kinds of cosmetic fragrances, all kinds of medical devices, and all kinds of lotus root and fruit foods, and you can also fill all kinds of prescriptions. There are also soft sofas inside where customers can sit at ease. The shop assistants there are all "service trained" and are very kind to customers. No matter how much you buy, they are equally diligent in their service. As for the prices of the goods, they are not increased because of the well-equipped facilities, but are actually cheaper than other stores. No wonder the people of Shanghai like to patronize this magnificent mansion. (Note: this mansion is the Wuzhou Pharmacy.)

### Tooth Whiteness Competition

— Ruyu

A dozen children gathered in the schoolyard. The teacher walked over and asked, "Who among you is the most hygienic?" These children all vied to say that they were the most hygienic. The teacher said, "I have a way, which is to see whose teeth are the whitest. Whoever has the whitest teeth is the most hygienic." So the teacher checked everyone's teeth in order. Some had black teeth, some had yellow teeth. As a result, only Wang Er's teeth were the cleanest and whitest. The teacher then announced that Wang Er was the most hygienic and praised him greatly. Wang Er said, "I know that teeth are very important, so I brush them carefully every day, and I use '131 Toothpaste' from Wuzhou Pharmacy, which is especially effective in cleaning and protecting teeth."

## Page 22

Everyone went to work separately, with small workers, large workers, blacksmiths, and carpenters all supervised by the supervisors of each section. Mu Long's team consisted of eight people, led by a supervisor named Zhao, and they walked towards a deep, dark mine tunnel.

The firelight of the carbide lamps shone in the mine tunnel. The sounds of chiseling stone and splitting coal rang out as one. Sometimes, laughter or complaints would be heard intermittently among the companions, but all these sounds were like being in a jar, only ringing in each other's ears.

"Old Li, Xiao Ling is pretty good, I think she's a little interested in you. Haha!" A Wang said seriously to a thin young man.

"Don't say that, be careful of the supervisor's whip!" Old Li made a face and answered, but he was thinking about the girl who washed clothes by the stream next to the mine house every day. She hadn't come to the stream for two days, and he didn't know why. He really missed her a little.

The laughter stopped under the supervisor's scolding, but the sound of metal instruments hitting the coal seam and slate became even louder. A Li felt dizzy and nauseous several times, but he finally endured it. He wanted to slack off, but the supervisor's sharp eyes seemed to be fixed on him all the time.

Time seemed to crawl very slowly in the "blackies'" hearts, and everyone's stomachs had long been rumbling with echoes, but the whistle for shift change was still not heard.

### Face

— Lu Jia

To depict one's own face is like the hesitant brushstrokes of an immature painter on a desolate autumn wilderness.

Only because of years of wandering do I not only have a rough soul, but also have the years eroded the youth on my face. In the morning, I occasionally linger in front of the mirror for a moment, and what an aging face is reflected in the mirror!

Due to a wandering life, the fullness and rosiness of my forehead have disappeared, and it is covered with countless deep, vertical and horizontal wrinkles. Each wrinkle is engraved with a pile of hardships and sorrows. This is because I have a heart that cannot be stretched, so I also have eyebrows that cannot be stretched, accumulating into lines of forehead wrinkles, like a muddy road after snowmelt, covered with countless complex whip marks.

Along this narrow road, withered grass grows like a clump of dry hair, dry and messy, and some are even gray. It used to be as dark and shiny as my pupils, covering my forehead neatly, but now it hasn't been trimmed for years, and I don't have the mood to trim it either.

Speaking of my pupils, I can still remember the past brilliance of judging people, the crystal tears, and the silent and lingering ripples in my eyes; but now, a stone covered with moss is placed in stagnant, dark green water, without a breeze to stir up a ripple, looking empty at the chaotic sky above and the vast twilight fields around. When the snow melts in spring, the water will overflow and become a winding stream, flowing into the vast wilderness.

The desolate nose is like an isolated ancient tomb. The weeds in front of the tomb are already deep, but who will come to sweep the tomb and repair the tomb site?

Standing on the ridge of the tomb, one can see the barren fields with steep slopes! These are my cheeks. The fields after harvest are empty and lonely, leaving some stubble and withered grass, covered with a layer of frost and snow. When will they receive the caress of the spring breeze?

The drawing should be considered complete here, no, I forgot my lips. This is an ancient stone cave at the end of the wasteland. Speaking of which, there is still a mysterious but beautiful legend that has been passed down from the primitive times along with the stone cave. It is said that the stone cave used to produce crystal clear red jade, and many girls risked coming here to collect it as an ornament on their chests. It is said that a red dragon also lived in the cave, often spewing red flames, so many girls died as martyrs. This story may be true, but now there is no red stone at the entrance of the cave, only gray-colored rocks; there are no more flames spewed by the red dragon, only empty cold winds, sighs, and sobs.

Putting down my pen and looking at my face in the mirror again, what an aging face I have, out of proportion to my age.

### The Problem of Water Price Increase

— Tian Yu

The British-owned Public Concession Water Company has submitted a request to the Public Works Department for approval to increase water prices, which is scheduled to take effect on February 1, changing to an 80% charge. Organizations such as the First Special District Citizens' Federation have risen up in opposition, requesting that the Public Works Department, in view of the declining market and the difficulties faced by citizens, immediately cancel the approval of the water price increase. Previously, when telephone prices were increased, all citizens fiercely opposed it, and the issue was extremely serious, but in the end, the telephone company won, and the price increase was implemented in full according to the original plan. They even said proudly: "After the price increase, the number of telephones has greatly increased, which shows that this price increase method is actually welcomed by citizens." Looking at these words, we feel a sense of increased burden every time we make a phone call, which is truly a feeling of being both crying and laughing. This time, a similar issue of water price increase is just beginning. Will the result follow the same path as the telephone price increase issue? This depends on the method and determination of the citizens' struggle this time.

In terms of method, my personal opinion is that it is useless to simply oppose in words. It is imperative that a special project thoroughly studies the operating conditions of the water company, providing evidence to prove that the water price increase is currently an act against social interests. For example, how much is the official interest paid by the company, how much is the dividend, whether the company's expenses exceed the necessary level, and are far beyond the general living standards of Shanghai citizens. We know that the telephone company hires several telephone experts to organize a telephone research institute, spending tens of thousands of yuan at once, not hesitating to do so, and the telephone price increase is a must. Collecting three or five cents of telephone fees from the citizens to supply the company's squandering is fundamentally a contradiction. The water company of course also has the same situation. In the current economic downturn, general interest rates are declining, but several large enterprises held in the hands of foreign businessmen that are closely related to the vital interests of all citizens—electricity, telephone, water, trams, and even bus companies—still stubbornly maintain their high interest rates above general interest rates, ignoring the decline of society and only maintaining the unique and generous interests of a small number of people. This is truly the most unreasonable thing. To oppose the water price increase, we must concentrate all our efforts and attack this unreasonable weakness. But this must first have a thorough study to be possible, and cannot be done with carelessness or neglect.

But then again, the operating conditions of several monopolistic enterprises in Shanghai held in the hands of foreign businessmen are incompatible with the current society—these types of monopolistic enterprises should be run by the state for the welfare of the citizens—this is already a well-known fact. Therefore, the citizens cannot exercise their supervisory rights over these social enterprises only because the enterprises are in the hands of foreigners, and there is a strong political force behind them. Therefore, even though we listed the unreasonable reasons for the telephone price increase as the basis for opposition, we were certainly righteous, but we ultimately failed under the strong support of the concession authorities. Therefore, whether we can win the final victory in opposing the water price increase this time, the most important key is whether all citizens have the determination to persevere to the end!

Observing facial expressions brings prosperity to every family, understanding life and death, success and failure, is truly insightful. Usually proficient in the art of physiognomy, one's own body is like being entrusted to wandering in all directions. Suddenly, bailiffs arrive in droves, with loud calls and relentless shouts. He sits proudly on a gold-inlaid chair, waiting to stand on the street and squint his eyes. I think you, your death is no more than three days away, your face is full of remorse. He, with a word, shatters the courage of the treacherous hero. The physiognomist is detained and not allowed to leave. Deceiving the masses with false statements is truly hateful, where is there pre-knowledge of human life and death? Class guards keep a close watch, patrolling day and night for three days. From beginning to end, the matter is filled with doubt and suspicion, and guards patrol day and night. The closed vermilion doors are heavily guarded, how can assassins enter this gate? Thanking guests and closing the door, residing in the inner courtyard, incense and tea are enough to please the heart. Without regard for matters of state, rumors are spread throughout the inner and outer armies. Who would have thought that disaster would strike from within.

### Cecil B. DeMille's "The Plainsman" is About to be Released

Since "The Crusades" was released in Shanghai, we have not seen a new work by Cecil B. DeMille for more than a year. Now, "The Plainsman," directed by him, is said to be released in the Grand Theater starting from the Lunar New Year's Eve. The story of the film takes place in the American West after the American Civil War. At that time, indigenous people lived there together, and bandits were rampant. It was still a chaotic era, so a hero nicknamed "Wild Bill" was born. This name is known to three-year-old children in the United States. In the chaotic world, he disregarded his life and made a world-shattering career. Such a role is played by Gary Cooper, of course, he can do his duty, and Jean Arthur's co-starring is even more perfect. As for the great background and the majestic spirit, it is a special feature of DeMille's works, and of course, it is also the case in this film.

### Dianbanhua Shoots Three Films at the Same Time

Dianbanhua started her film life as early as three or four years ago. Because there was no proper opportunity, all her talents were not exposed, but the impression she gave people was very deep. As long as you mention her name, no one will not know it.

This time she joined Xinhua, she feels very excited, and she asked the company to give her plenty of opportunities to perform. Xinhua's owner Zhang Shankun originally planned to give her the role of a villain, but now seeing that she has such an ambition to make progress, he feels that she is a talent worth promoting, so he decisively assigned her to play the role of the village girl, the heroine of "Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang River."

"Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang River" is a social drama directed by Zhang Shankun and Wang Cilong, which has been in production for two or three weeks, and the work is becoming increasingly tense, but Dianbanhua is working calmly. At the same time, she also has roles in Wu Yonggang's "Blood in the Cloud Sea" and Shi Dongshan's "March of the Youth," and they will start soon. Dianbanhua's becoming a popular star is probably at this time.

### "Winter in a Poor Alley" Released

"Winter in a Poor Alley" depicts a group of children of the city who live under the heavy burden of sorrow and struggle under the giant palm of fate. In the iron cage and the capitalist trap, they use a cavity of passionate blood and a bright red heart to resist the harsh winter in this poor alley. The play is originally written by the great writer Anderson and won the drama championship last year. When it was performed on the stage, it was a sell-out for two seasons. Now, under the banner of RKO Pictures, it is brought to the screen for the first time, and it is still starred by the original cast on the stage. New star Paige McReady and beautiful and mysterious actress Maige have wonderful and amazing performances in this film. The film will be released in the Nanjing Grand Theater today.

### Performing "Elegy of Lovebirds" Starting Today

Lu Xixi and Lu Qiqi's Drama Broadcasting Troupe has more than a dozen members, including Wu Meimei, Yang Yanqiu, and Lu Xiaotong. The performances are profound, and the dialogues are fluent. The various programs broadcast are very popular among the audience. The play "Elegy of Lovebirds" is especially praised by people from all walks of life because of its tortuous and fragrant plot, and its sad and moving story. Recently, in response to the earnest requests of the audience, the troupe has decided to perform the play on stage, and will perform it day and night for four consecutive days at the Great China Theater at the entrance of the Racecourse on Fourth Road starting today. Those who love to watch tragedies must not miss it. The ticket prices are divided into 60 cents and one yuan.

### The Increasingly Refined 1937 New Austin

— Fu

Anyone who has visited the 1937 New Austin car currently displayed at the Mayer & Co. Auto Company showroom on Mayer Road will undoubtedly feel that the beauty of the new car's lines has reached its peak. This is indeed one of its most prominent advantages. The reason why the new car has such wonderful lines should be attributed to the proper proportion of its entirety. The design and construction of the New Austin are based on sound basic principles, so the proper proportion is natural, not accidental. As for the praise, it is because the new car can thoroughly solve all the practical needs related to comfort. The New Austin is not only more spacious inside, making passengers feel more comfortable, but also the seats and driving positions are wider than before. As for the stability on the road and the clarity of vision, they are all far superior to before. In addition, the noise of the new car's engine and the vibration of the machine power have been eliminated, so its quietness is even more unmatched.

Driving a car, if you want to be relaxed and happy, and feel happy in spirit, then quietness is one of the most important conditions. This is generally recognized by car enthusiasts. In addition to adopting original power insulation, the New Austin's streamlined body arc curve transforms the whistling wind sound into an indistinguishable light hiss when driving at high speed. As for the all-steel body panels, they are also insulated. This is why it is particularly quiet, and those who are in it feel very comfortable.

From the standpoint of safety, another important progress of the New Austin is that the entire body, whether it is the door side panel, the floor panel, or the roof, is made of all steel, so its strength and durability are unmatched. The new car's windows and windshields are still equipped with three-layer thick glass. As for the green-style car stopper and the flexible and foolproof steering wheel, they make the new car extremely safe and reliable at any speed.

The various characteristics of the New Austin car have been tested in a very strict manner in the famous dangerous mountain passes of the Alps, so its perfection has been clearly proven, and Austin's absolute reliability has also been completely trusted by people in the automotive industry.

### "Diesel" Powered Car

The picture shows the situation of the smallest six-cylinder "Diesel" engine made in the United States installed in an ordinary passenger car.

The biggest advantage of the car powered by this engine is fuel economy. According to the test, the engine in the picture traveled 280 miles, and the fuel cost was 54 cents US dollars, which is only one-tenth of the cost of gasoline traveling the same mileage.

The installer of this engine is the famous "Diesel" engineer Hanfield. This machine can generate 79 horsepower and rotate 2,600 times per minute. Its cubic displacement is 260 inches, which is slightly higher than the standard six-cylinder gasoline engine.

Using ordinary "Diesel" fuel, it can travel an average of 30 miles per gallon.

### Automatically Capturing Photos of Car Accident Scenes

— Y

An American named Lunin has invented a camera that captures street car accident scenes. This machine can be installed on street corners, safety zones, and places with traffic lights. If a car ignores the traffic light signal and drives straight across the road, then the number on its rear license plate will never escape this camera.

In the picture, ① is the camera installed on the sidewalk. ② is the signal light in the safety zone in the middle of the road. If a car ignores the signal and drives over it, then the machine sheet will be pressed down, triggering the camera's button and automatically taking pictures. ③ is the developed photo, which records the actual situation at that time, along with the date and time, in detail. If you want to go to court, this photo is a very powerful witness.

Lunin, the inventor of this machine, was knocked to the ground by a car in the middle of the road, but the car ran away. So he painstakingly invented this machine. From then on, car accidents can completely record the situation at that time and the car number.

### The Whole Story of the General Motors Strike

Z>Yingdai

At the beginning of 1936, the American automotive industry encountered an unfortunate event. A major strike occurred at General Motors. Until now, a solution has not been obtained. Here, the whole story of the General Motors strike is briefly reported to readers as follows.

① The Occurrence of the Strike After Roosevelt was elected President of the United States, he advocated the revival of the industrial movement in order to remedy the various problems caused by the economic crisis. In the past four years, although it seems that various industries have begun to enter the path of revival on the surface, the contradictions between capitalists and the labor sector have not decreased as a result. Therefore, although Luo was able to continue to be elected this time, the strikes in various industries in the United States were still very serious. Even in the automotive industry, at the end of 1936, strikes were already brewing. The reason why they did not occur was nothing more than the authorities' strict precautions to eliminate the strikes. However, at the beginning of 1937, strikes in the automotive industry still occurred.

② The Number of Strikers On December 31, 1936, there was already news in the United States that auto workers would go on a large-scale strike in the New Year. Therefore, on New Year's Day in 1937, workers from six factories specializing in manufacturing Fisher bodies for General Motors, four Chevrolet branches, and several other factories in Detroit, the auto city of the United States, began to strike. General Motors is one of the three major car manufacturers in the United States. The entire factory employs 211,000 auto workers. At first, only 40,000 people joined the strike, but because the strike could not be resolved for a while, it quickly expanded. By the 4th, there were more than 70 large and small factories belonging to General Motors that were on strike. The number of strikers even exceeded 100,000.

③ The Conditions Proposed After the strike occurred, all the workers who participated in the strike occupied the factories, so that all work could not be carried out at all. At the same time, they put forward conditions to the capitalists. The three main conditions were ① increase wages, ② improve treatment, and ③ recognize collective consultation. However, because a satisfactory reply was not received from the factory for a while, it became a situation of being unable to dismount. Both sides insisted on continuing.

④ The Authorities' Attention The local officials attached great importance to this strike at General Motors. Therefore, after the strike occurred, the Michigan authorities immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to be stationed around all the striking car factories to prevent the occurrence of riots. On the other hand, notices were posted, ordering the workers occupying the car factories to leave the factories as soon as possible, and to make efforts to prevent the strike from expanding. However, the workers ignored it, making the authorities unable to do anything. In addition to the Michigan authorities, US President Roosevelt also paid close attention to this matter, fearing that all the auto workers in the United States would join the strike line, which would be even more difficult to solve.

⑤ The Company's Losses As mentioned above, General Motors is a large car manufacturer in the United States, so the average daily output of cars is also not small. However, since the strike occurred, all the larger branches have been completely in a state of strike. All work cannot be carried out. Only a small part of the factories did not join the strike group and are working as usual, but the cars produced are also very few, less than half of the usual output. Moreover, judging from the current situation, the complete solution of the strike will take at least a month. It can be seen that the losses suffered by General Motors this time due to the strike are not small.

⑥ Start Negotiations After the strike occurred, the workers demanded immediate negotiations, but General Motors believed that the occupation of factories by the strikers was illegal and this trend could not be allowed to grow, so it insisted that no negotiations would be held before the workers left the factories. Therefore, both sides held their own opinions, and the matter became more and more僵 (deadlocked). Until recently, after the mediation of various parties, the workers agreed to first withdraw all the workers occupying the factories, and then the labor and management would start negotiations again. When the author collected the data and drafted this article, the General Motors strike had been going on for more than two weeks. The negotiation meeting is scheduled to start this Monday. Judging from the general situation, the time required for the negotiation will take at least two weeks. Therefore, this General Motors strike cannot be ended in less than a month. The magnitude of the loss can also be imagined.

### Automotive News

African Car Race Recently, the Royal East African Automobile Association organized a car race from Nairobi to Johannesburg. The total distance is 2,715 miles. Forty-two cars participated, and the bonuses ranged from £200 to £1,000. The drivers had many thrilling experiences. The most unfortunate was the driver of car No. 11, Mr. Weiscobo. He was driving a Ford V8 and was leading the way, far exceeding other cars. When he was only a hundred miles away from the finish line, there was a sudden bang, and the car had an accident. A cow suddenly appeared and became the god of misfortune, causing the driver to lose the championship that he was sure of winning. As a result of the collision, the car's water tank was damaged considerably. He immediately tried to replace it with a new water tank and continued to move forward, but valuable time had been lost, and the championship went to others. Even so, Mr. Weiscobo still won the runner-up.

Long-Distance Driving of More Than 40,000 Miles If a car enthusiast can drive 30,000 miles in a year, they will often pride themselves on having reached a high record. However, they do not know that the drivers of freight trucks have a total mileage that exceeds this number by far. Recently, Mr. Naiba of Golden Eagle Road in Subad Bush drove a freight truck and traveled a total of 45,000 miles in a year. This car is a Ford CNT freight truck. According to Mr. Naiba himself, except for changing a new tire once, his only repair cost was one shilling and six pence. Mr. Naiba also said that this mileage is a record in his 21 years of driving.

Ford Crossing the Sahara Desert Recently, an Englishman named Harold Wuton and his wife drove a 10-horsepower British-made Ford special sedan from Guinea Bay to Algeria, a total distance of 3,000 miles. Mr. Wuton is the manager of the Nigeria rubber plantation of the African United Company. He obtained permission to cross the Sahara Desert by car during his vacation back to England. The couple traveled a large part of the journey completely unattended. The route they took was also the more difficult of the two car routes, starting from Kano (in northern Nigeria), winding north through the rocky desert, which is 2,000 miles long. On the way, they also had to cross the mountains and wilderness of Air and Hoggar. This route was only passable by cars at the end of 1933. There are 1,600 miles that can be said to have no route at all. The places they passed were rocky and separated by fine sand, with stone piles as landmarks. The necessary supplies along the way, such as tents and containers for gasoline and water, were all loaded in the car. On one occasion, the car carried enough water, food, and food for a 500-mile wilderness journey. The load was equal to the weight of seven adults. This road is very dangerous, and anyone driving alone considers it a daunting task. Along the way, it is necessary to report to each station by radio. Although the roads traveled by Mr. Wuton were all discouraging, and the items he carried were so heavy, the journey was relatively uneventful. The car never stopped, and there were no mechanical difficulties. There was only one tire puncture.
