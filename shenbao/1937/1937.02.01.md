### The Troops of Zhang and Yang Have Not Yet Retreated

Zhang Xueliang is Insistently Demanded to Return to Shaanxi First; Yu Xuezhong is Received in Shaanxi for Consultation; Zhang's Cavalry Attacks Baishui City

[Nanjing] Military news: the troops of Zhang and Yang in the Xi'an area have not yet shown any definite signs of retreat. It is reported that some officers are adamantly insisting that Zhang Xueliang must return to Shaanxi first and address his subordinates before any movement can begin. Therefore, an aircraft has been dispatched to Lanzhou to bring Yu Xuezhong to Shaanxi for joint consultation on a solution. It is also reported that Yu arrived in Xi'an at 11:00 AM on the 31st. When Zhang Xueliang left Shaanxi, he designated Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong to be responsible for presiding over military affairs. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)

Tongguan: The pseudo-30th Army under the command of the Red Bandit Zhu, Chen Shicai, the pseudo-28th Army under Niu Shushen, and Wu Zhendong's pseudo-Northern Route Army, totaling about 13,000 to 14,000 people, are in the Fushi, Tingchuan, and Wuding River areas in northern Shaanxi. Gao Mazi's gang, numbering over 2,000, is in the Yanchuan and Yichuan areas. They are now preparing to split into three groups for other intrusions, but their direction to the east or south is not yet clear. Many of their personnel collecting grain for security purposes are gathering and transporting it to Tingan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)

[Luoyang] ㊀ According to an aircraft reconnaissance report on the 31st, in the vicinity of Weinan, from the north bank of the Wei River to the Tianshi Town area, and the line of Lingkou and Ma'e Towns, there is approximately a regiment of Zhang Xueliang's troops constructing fortifications on both sides of the railway. Furthermore, near Xiaoyi Town in northern Wei and from west of Gushi Town to east of Tianshi Town, troops from the other side are also at work. ㊁ On the morning of the 31st, many troops were seen traveling between Weinan and Lintong by aircraft. There were five to six hundred people at Ba Bridge, resting. A battalion of soldiers was traveling from Xi'an to Xianyang, and more than a dozen large carts were heading from Xianyang to Liquan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)

[Nanjing] The aftermath of the Shaanxi situation has encountered twists and turns because a small number of troops in the 106th Division disobeyed orders. According to sources, this should not affect the progress of the settlement. (Special dispatch, 31st)

[Xuzhou] News from the railway: The Longhai Railway engineering team has gone west to repair the Chishui and Wei River bridges. Once the Central Army takes over defense of Xi'an, the railway can be opened to traffic. (Special dispatch, 31st)

[Xuzhou] Tongguan news: The retreat of Yang's troops is slow and hesitant. The Central Army is still taking a serious monitoring attitude to prevent Yang from making other changes. Our aircraft are flying reconnaissance daily. (Special dispatch, 31st)

[Nanjing] The situation in Shaanxi is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, but the Central Government is still adhering to a policy of leniency, urging them to finally come to their senses. According to reports on the morning of the 31st, telegraph and telephone communications between Tongguan and Xi'an are barely functional. There has been wind and snow between Tongguan and Xi'an in recent days, and the front line is peaceful. The Central Army is still taking a monitoring attitude. Mi Chunlin, He Zhuguo, Xie Ke, and Li Zhigang, the representative of Yang Hucheng, are still in Tongguan on the 31st, discussing everything in detail with Director Gu Zhutong. It is also learned that Shen Ke's unit of the 106th Division clashed with another unit while crossing the river at Sunyi and Gushi on the 30th, confronting each other across the river with gunfire. Troops were also reinforced on the Chishui side at the same time. The situation with Zhang's troops is quite complicated, and a small number of junior officers are disobeying the orders of their superiors. Yang's troops are relatively simpler. (Special dispatch, 31st)

[Nanjing] Although the solution conditions agreed upon between the Central Government and Yang in Shaanxi stipulate that the troops of Zhang and Yang must withdraw from all front lines, the overall situation is still very chaotic. The government forces have clashed with the troops of the 105th Division, which is under the command of Zhang Xueliang, but it is not known whether the conflict was accidental, whether the peaceful negotiations have broken down again, or whether the Red Bandits are now interfering with the implementation of the solution conditions. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

[Tianjin] Telegraph communications between Tianjin and Shaanxi were disrupted again from the 31st. (Special dispatch, 31st)

Tongguan: The 10th Cavalry Division of Zhang's troops has now dispatched soldiers from Hanbing Town, north of Pucheng, to besiege Baishui County. This is because the county's security guards and various teams refused the entry of the troops, and both sides are fighting. It is also reported that Fuping County, fearing harassment from Zhang's troops and extortion of rations from local bandits, has gathered guards and closed the city to prevent them from entering. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)

### Gansu Students Arrive in Beijing to Report on the Recent Situation in Shaanxi and Gansu

Four Rows of Trenches Dug Between Gaoling and Dali; Wooden Bridge Built Over the Wei River for Easy Troop Passage; Schools in Xi'an Open as Usual

[Nanjing] Shaanxi students Shi Bingzhong and Wang Zhongzhi departed from Lanzhou on the 14th and arrived in Beijing on the 31st, passing through Lintao, Longxi, Tianshui, Longzhou, and then Fengxiang, Guozhen, Xi'an, Sanyuan, Gaoling, Dali, Chaoyi, Tongguan in Shaanxi. According to their account, starting at 7:00 PM on December 12th, the 113th Division under the command of Yu Xuezhong, led by Li Zhentang, suddenly launched a revolt in the city of Lanzhou, occupying the provincial capital's Public Security Bureau and the Pacification Commissioner's Office.史铭, the director of the Public Security Bureau, was immediately detained. Yang Jigao, an advisor to the Pacification Commissioner's Office (from Tianshui), was searched and killed by rioting soldiers at 8:00 PM that night. Senior official Wang Shihui was also shot dead in front of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Police and Zhu Shaoliang's guards came out to resist, resulting in many deaths and injuries. By 8:30 AM the next morning, the riot was quelled, but inspections of pedestrians at the four gates were extremely strict. It was not until Yu Xuezhong flew back to Lanzhou from Xi'an on the 15th that the situation returned to normal. However, there is a shortage of food. The usual price of wheat was around four yuan per dou (100 catties), but now it sells for fourteen yuan, and there is nowhere to buy it. Food shops are also not open. During the most chaotic time, the Yellow River water that Lanzhou residents drank sold for eight jiao of silver dollars per dan. All schools, large, medium, and small, were closed, and all students returned to their hometowns. There is still no date for reopening. The army stationed in the city is still requisitioning carts, and people do not dare to go out. Mule carts do not dare to enter the city. Xu Xianshi, the director of the Construction Department, Liu Guangpei, the director of Civil Affairs, and Tian Jiongjin, the director of Education, are maintaining the current situation in Lanzhou, but there is nothing they can do. Inquiries into the troops stationed in Shaanxi and Gansu reveal the following: 1. Gansu: In the Lanzhou area, there is the 113th Division of Zhang's forces under Li Zhentang. In Dingxi, there are the 118th Division of Zhang's forces under Zhou Guanglie, and Mou's 114th Division. 2. Shaanxi: The first and second security brigades of Yang Hucheng are stationed in Xi'an, and the third security brigade of Yang's forces is stationed in Gaoling and Dali in northern Shaanxi. Four rows of trenches have been dug from east of Gaoling to twenty li west of Dali, most of which are occupied by bandit troops of the Communist bandits. Their clothes are incomplete, but their military caps are all the same, made of dark blue cloth with a very shallow back brim and a large front brim for sun protection. All caps have red badges as symbols. From Xi'an to Sanyuan, it is necessary to cross the Wei River. Previously, there were no bridges, and people used ferries to cross the river. Now, Yang has ordered his subordinates to build wooden bridges on the Wei River for easy troop passage. However, the people still cannot use this bridge to cross the river and must use ferries. Schools in Xi'an are open as usual. The Shaanxi Tax Bureau has encountered difficulties in its work due to the Shaanxi Incident. Staff have successively left Shaanxi for Tongguan, where a temporary office was established on the 27th to handle tax affairs. (Special dispatch, 31st)

### Chen Cheng's Remarks

Resorting to Force Only as a Last Resort

Tongguan: On the 30th, a reporter visited Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng at Yangcun and asked for his opinion on the Northwestern issues from the Central Government. He made the following remarks: ㊀ Question: Recently, Yang Hucheng and others in Xi'an do not seem to have any sense of awakening. The national public opinion believes that it is necessary to use force to resolve the situation as soon as possible. What do you think? Answer: This time, the Central Government is completely based on a spirit of leniency and sincerity towards the Northwest problem, hoping to achieve a political solution. This is known to the whole country. As for the use of force, this is the most unfortunate thing. It will not be used unless absolutely necessary. Observing the situation in Xi'an in the past month, it is impossible not to prepare for any eventuality, but the hope is that preparation is not used. If the Xi'an side can sincerely accept the orders of the Central Government, there is no need for military action, and their past actions can be forgiven in general. They will still be protected and will not be discriminated against in any way. However, if they are still controlled by a small number of reactionary elements and resist the Central Government, making the Central Government exhaust its sincerity and ultimately despair, then it will only have to make forceful corrections based on the needs of the nation and the demands of the people of the whole country, to promote their final awakening. It must be known that the Northwest is related to the entire national defense, and Xi'an is an important town in the Northwest. It must not be allowed to split, and even more, it must not be allowed to become a base for instigating internal strife and communizing China. As for the individual, I only know that I am carrying out my duties by adhering to the will of the Central Government, obeying the orders of my superiors, and executing my duties. I do not ask about anything else. ㊁ Question: Have the bandits and puppets in eastern Suiyuan been active in recent years, and does the Central Government have any plans? Answer: Before Chahar province is recovered, the base of the bandits and puppets disturbing Suiyuan cannot be eliminated, and there is a possibility of them coming to disturb us at any time. The Central Government has a whole plan and certain steps for the bandits and puppets in eastern Suiyuan. Not only should the territory of Suiyuan Province be thoroughly cleared, but for the safety of eastern Suiyuan, Chahar, the bandit nest that the bandits and puppets use as a base for disturbing eastern Suiyuan, must also be recovered. Otherwise, eastern Suiyuan and northern Hebei will never have a peaceful day. What makes me the most painful about this Xi'an Incident is that the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan was progressing steadily, but the plan to clear Chahar province was shattered by this incident. Now, although the officers and soldiers on the front line are still making active preparations, they cannot but have worries about the rear. A certain general on the front line once said that the Xi'an side is acting so perverse. What battles are we fighting in Suiyuan? We must first return to Xi'an to resolve the situation. Although this was just a moment of anger from a certain general, the close relationship between the war of resistance on the front line and the unification of the rear can be imagined. In short, resisting the enemy and defending against insult is a matter of burying oneself in practical work and preparing to sacrifice, and it cannot be achieved by a momentary emotional impulse, let alone by borrowing a name to show off. This is what I personally hope to share with the people of the country, to encourage each other. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

### He Jian Sends Telegram Requesting the Promotion of Ethical Principles

[Changsha] On the 30th, He Jian sent a telegram to the Central Government requesting the promotion of ethical principles and the upholding of Confucius's doctrine of centrality and rectitude to establish the foundation for universal harmony. His original telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: The aftermath of Xi'an has been unresolved for a long time. The Red Bandits are growing stronger, heterodoxies are emerging, and the people are perplexed to the extreme. I believe that internal pacification and external resistance are a necessary sequence. Suppressing chaos and resisting aggression are the normal course of saving the nation. Once national policies are set, daily progress will be made. Such things as the collapse of bandit forces, diplomatic victories, and the victory of the Suiyuan battle are all obvious facts. If one is swayed by complex words and uses a crooked yardstick, then the great cause of unification, which has been cultivated for ten years, and the common trust of hundreds of millions of people, what means will be used to maintain it? Forcing a square peg into a round hole is not allowed by the situation. Changing the rules and listening easily will only lead to division. Moreover, international situations are changing, and alliances are unpredictable. Gaining a little and losing a lot, what is the point? This is what I am worried and fearful about. The melons of the Huangtai cannot be picked again. The situation of unification should be maintained. Resolving the root cause and the symptoms can be done later. I have heard that when sages establish teachings, they emphasize ethical principles first. When a country seeks survival, it must first have discipline. Correcting discipline is the basis for defining positions, and clarifying ethics is the basis for loving the people. This is the traditional spirit of our country, that is, Confucius's great way of governing the country. The late Premier recognized the truth for all time and respected the way of Confucius. President Chiang personally practices the principles of the state, and the people are grateful. Following the instructions of the predecessors and learning from their effects, the path is almost clear. However, in recent years, the morale of scholars has been impetuous, and people have harbored desires. First, they established heterodoxies to seize fame, and then they used conspiracies to seize profits. One voice started a thousand echoes, and emptiness became the norm. The collapse of propriety and righteousness has led to this situation. The new and old ethical principles should be tailored to the needs of the time. If they can cure the disease, why avoid the established formula? If ethical principles are not correct, then the law will lose its severity. If the virtue of the people is not strong, then politics and education will have no roots. How can we govern the people of five races and align the products of all things? Moreover, the countries of Europe and the United States, whether dictatorial or democratic, have each gone to extremes, have lost the old model of the constitution, and have fallen into a dark and desperate path. They are only trying to put out the fire in front of their eyebrows. Who cares about the long term? If we promote Confucius's doctrine of centrality and rectitude to establish the foundation for universal harmony, and create our own laws so that the people are not confused, then humanity will be fortunate and peace can be expected. I am concerned about the difficulties of the times and the course of the country. I occasionally think about the future and increase the anxiety in my heart. Do not say that my words are close to commonplace and that people will criticize them as being old-fashioned. However, because the matter concerns the fundamental principles of governance, I have not dared to hesitate to speak. I respectfully ask the noble headquarters and the noble government, with their brilliant guidance that all the people look up to, to plan great strategies to consolidate the foundation of the country. If you appreciate my foolish sincerity and find it worthwhile, I will then propose detailed methods and make them public for discussion. I humbly request your consideration. He Jian."

### The Puppet Troops in Northern Chahar are Actively Replenishing Military Supplies

Smoke Bombs and Poison Gas Transported; Wang Ying and Zhang Wanqing Confirmed to be Dismissed

[Guihua] Although the puppet troops in northern Chahar have been focusing on defense in recent days, they are still actively replenishing military supplies. According to a report from the front on the 31st, a certain party transported sixteen truckloads of smoke bombs and poison gas from Duolun to Zhangbei. In order to unify command, a certain party has renamed all the puppet troops in northern Chahar as the Mongol-Han People's National Salvation Army. It is said that they are currently being organized. Wang Ying's bandit division has been reduced to three regiments, totaling about 1,200 people, and is temporarily under the command of Li Shouxin. (Special dispatch, 31st)

[Zhangjiakou] The bandits and puppets in northern Chahar are claiming to launch a large-scale westward attack within the year. The national army in eastern Suiyuan has been on strict alert for days, and the situation is quite serious. The reorganization of Wang Ying's and Zhang Wanyou's troops has been completed. On the evening of the 29th, more than 300 soldiers from Zhang's troops in Nanhogian staged a mutiny and plundered villages. Zhang was therefore placed under surveillance by a certain party, and there are reports that he has been suspended from duty for three months. Puppet troops from Rehe have been dispatched to Jiabusi and Nanhogian to reinforce them in recent days. (Special dispatch, 31st)

[Guihua] A certain military officer came to Suiyuan from Xinghe and Dalun on the morning of the 31st. According to his account: ㊀ The two bandits Wang Ying and Zhang Wanqing have indeed been dismissed by a certain party. Ma Houyuan, the puppet brigade commander of Zhang's bandit group, and Sun Zhaoming, the chief of the puppet military affairs office, have fled and their whereabouts are unknown. Wang's bandit group is under surveillance, and his death is unknown. ㊁ Zhang's bandit group has a total of three regiments, one of which, with 600-700 unarmed soldiers, was forcibly dismissed by a certain party. On the way, they were stripped of their cotton-padded clothes, leaving only their underwear. The cruelty is unspeakable. The remaining two regiments, Zhang Shiying's and Jiang Zibin's, are commanded by Zhang Shiying under the name of detachment commander. ㊂ A regiment of troops from a certain party is currently stationed outside the east gate of Nanhogian, and two regiments of Zhang Shiying's bandits are stationed in the city. A regiment of Li Shouxin's cavalry is stationed in the suburbs. They are mutually suspicious and closely monitored. The west, north, and south city gates have been sealed for a long time, and only the east gate is left open for entry and exit. However, it is also closed every night at 7:00 PM to prevent the puppet troops in the city from fleeing. Barbed wire is densely laid out at nearby intersections for security. ㊃ On the evenings of the 25th and 26th, there was a firefight between the bandits inside and outside the city, resulting in more than ten deaths and injuries. The dire situation can be seen from this. ㊄ On the 27th, two armored vehicles from a certain party suddenly drove to Xiaojingzi, attempting to attack the national army's defense line. They were discovered and repelled. ㊅ The number of bandits and puppet troops surrendering to the national army has been continuous. In recent weeks, there have been hundreds of people and more than 80 horses. ㊆ Dalun is thirty to forty li away from Shangdu and Nanhogian and is the front line of eastern Suiyuan. The national army is on very strict alert. Brigade Commander Wang Zixiu has postponed his visit to Suiyuan due to the tight defense situation there. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)

### Guangdong Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Relief for Guangdong Rice Shortage

Foreign rice tax to be waived for half a year; income tax for various industries

[Guangzhou] The Guangdong Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Director of the Guangdong Pacification Commission Yu Hanmou, and Chairman Huang Musong of the Provincial Government on the 31st, stating that the Central Government has allowed the Ministry of Railways to allocate trains to transport rice and approved the increase of foreign rice to 1 million dan on account at half price. The good intentions of relief are not without merit. However, the number of vehicles is limited, and transportation takes time. The cost of accounting at half price is still heavy. In practice, it has no great benefit. Looking at the current price of rice, it has not yet trended down. With the eagerness of 30 million people waiting for food and the breadth of 94 counties in the famine area, small favors cannot be universally applied. The cost of rice is still high in the cities, so the suffering in the poor countryside is imaginable. Completely waiving the foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province for half a year is not enough to achieve the actual effect of relief, etc. The chamber also believes that the business tax rate of the Finance Department is too high and difficult to implement, and has decided to convene a provincial representative meeting on February 16 to discuss it. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)

### A Year of High Speed

— Lü Bing

Since January of this year, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has launched express trains, and the Longxing steamer of the Sanbei Company, sailing between Shanghai and Hankou, has also shortened its voyage and been converted to an express service. Such a situation shows that the transportation sector is fully accelerating its development and fully demonstrating progress. Therefore, some people propose calling this year a year of high speed.

Looking back on the past, the progress of various constructions in our country has indeed been very slow. Compared with other countries, the difference is always more than ten years. If we want national rejuvenation and sufficient national strength, we must naturally step up our efforts in domestic construction. The so-called catching up must be done quickly, and even more quickly. Therefore, this year being a year of high speed not only hopes that the transportation sector will progress quickly, but also hopes that various undertakings will also develop rapidly.

Railways, shipping and telecommunications are all important tools in transportation. Railways have express trains, shipping has express services, and telecommunications should also be fast and express. However, telecommunications traffic is accelerating at any time, but it does not call for express or express, and there is no need to add the name of express or express, because telecommunications itself focuses on speed, and the speed of its transmission, the responsiveness of its response, and the sender and speaker know it, and the society is no stranger to it.

Although telecommunications does not need to be marked as express or express, the progress of telecommunications can be secretly combined with express or express everywhere. If we also follow the example of railways and ships and call it a year of high speed, then the so-called year of high speed should not start from now. Since 1932, telecommunications has gradually progressed, especially in the last three years, the progress has been even more rapid. The increase in transmission speed and the expansion of the scope of communication have shrunk thousands of miles into marbles and connected the two places like face-to-face meetings. In the blink of an eye, how fast is it? If we talk about its important facilities, long-distance telephone calls are open to nine provinces, and the communication is convenient. Domestic and foreign wireless electricity also reports as far as all countries in the world. Shanghai, Hankou and Shanghai and Guangdong have also installed wireless telephones. In addition, in terms of telegraphs, important cities in China have also been successively re-equipped with Cretet printing telegraphs. All telephone calls and newspapers are more convenient and faster than before. It is impossible to say that the construction in the past few years has resulted in such a result, but it is fast and express. Continue to work hard, a fast and everything is fast, railways and ships are like this, and what about telecommunications alone?

### Two New Measures for Domestic Long-Distance Telephone of the Ministry of Communications (Continued)

— Pu Zhan

New Year's New Contribution

People cannot be always quiet and motionless, so human affairs are also changing. Users have already installed telephones, and have registered with the telephone bureau, paid long-distance telephone deposits, or filled out applications for connecting to long-distance telephones, which is convenient for transmitting and receiving long-distance telephones, but occasionally they encounter something to negotiate outside, and urgently need to send long-distance telephones to discuss with relations in distant places, or some people whose service locations are uncertain every day and need to send long-distance calls at any time, unfortunately, the telephone installed in the place is not registered with the telephone bureau. According to the current regulations that unregistered user telephones cannot transmit long-distance telephones, at this time, you must go back to the self-installed telephone that has been registered, or go to the nearby long-distance telephone retail store, register and wait for the call, during which the loss of time is not to be said. If you encounter an important event, you must deal with it on the spot, and when you cannot spare yourself, it will inevitably lead to consideration of this and loss of the other, and the loss will be even greater! With the method of registered users being able to borrow opportunities to speak, after that, you only need to apply to the telephone bureau and list the call fees on the call fee account of the self-installed and registered telephone, and be responsible for paying. All telephones within the same municipal telephone business area can be borrowed to speak at any time and anywhere, which is not only the labor of going back and forth, but also the feeling of not delaying the opportunity, and there is no loss of time and economy, which can be described as killing several birds with one stone. At the same time, because the regulations on the method stipulate that the speaker must notify the self-installed and registered telephone in advance before the speaker registers for the call, tell him that he intends to borrow a certain telephone number, transmit a long-distance telephone to a certain place, and then the telephone bureau inquires the telephone listener of the self-installed and registered telephone designated by the speaker to pay for the call once before connecting the call, which can ensure that no one is speaking in the name of another person, and the idea is very thoughtful.

As for the speaker or receiver who calls someone to talk is out for business, if the speaker or receiver knows where the speaker or receiver is now, and there is also a telephone installed at the limb, the telephone number can be informed to the telephone bureau to change the connection, and the method is the same as the method of the speaker who can borrow the machine to speak, and there is a similarity in different ways; In general people's habits, long-distance telephones are rarely used without urgent and important matters, so when the receiver is out and encounters a long-distance call, although the receiving user knows where the speaker is, he cannot immediately call back to answer the call, so as to explain what kind of important event this call is, or the speaker registers and then has to go out urgently for some important matter and cannot wait for the call, and the feeling of frustration can be imagined. With this method, as long as there is a telephone installed, you can change the connection without adding extra costs, and the difficult problem can be solved easily. Therefore, these two methods can be called modern methods in the modern era. (End)

### Use a Long-Distance Telephone or Telegraph?

— Shan Ronghai

Modern society people, the entire use of telecommunications and traffic, is because of its many types, and do not know how to choose. That is, which should send a long-distance telephone? Which should send a telegram? Fang Shi is in line with the economic conditions of operation. Regarding this point, if there is no experience in discernment, it is often because a telephone should be sent and a telegram is sent, or a telegram should be sent and a telephone is sent, resulting in a reduction in the effectiveness of the use of telecommunications and traffic, and becoming a loss of economy and time. I would like to say a word here, and make a small contribution:

If we want to properly solve the above problem, we should first analyze and compare the nature and advantages of telephones and telegrams. Which one is more suitable to use? The analysis is as follows:

Looking at the table on the right, we can know that telephones and telegrams have their own advantages and disadvantages in mutual comparison. Therefore, social people, for the choice of using telecommunications and traffic, may as well follow the different advantages and disadvantages of the two tools listed in the above table, and the starting point of their needs, and make a decision after review. That is, all those who tend to be physical and time-sensitive, such as bank remittances, etc., should send telegrams. On the contrary, those who pay attention to immediately waiting for a reply to solve a certain event can log on to a long-distance telephone. The above discussion is just an example. When people in society are accustomed to using the two, they will know what to choose.

### Promulgation of Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations

— Bao Zhen

The programs broadcast by local private radio stations every day often focus on recreational aspects, and often adopt low-grade songs and lyrics and superstitious and absurd stories, which not only fail to achieve the grand effect of radio education, but also inevitably have the drawbacks of teaching obscenity and theft. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated the "Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations," which were promulgated and implemented on October 28, 1936. The measures have been distributed by the Ministry of Communications to the telecommunications bureaus in Beiping, Hankou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxian, Wuxi, Tongshan, Gaoyou, Yin County, Shaoyu, Wuchao, Xiamen, and Wujin, etc., so that the local private radio stations will earnestly abide by them to comply with the law. The broadcasting stations run by local government agencies must also abide by the same measures, and the Ministry of Communications has separately requested the governments and municipal governments of all provinces to investigate and order them to implement them at the same time to return to a unified approach.

The above-mentioned "Contents of the Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations" are divided into the following items:

1. Regarding the procedures for arranging programs, each radio station (including public and private radio stations) shall pre-compile a program schedule of the type of broadcast programs and the broadcast time, and send it to the Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee of the Central Executive Committee for review and approval in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Communications before it can be broadcast. If the program needs to be changed in the future, it must also be reported for approval before it can be implemented again. Each radio station should also compile a forecast of the program content on a light basis, and include the title of each program broadcast every day (such as the lecture title, drama song name) and the name of the person in charge, and the planned broadcast time (such as someone lecturing on the recent international situation at a certain time on a certain day, and a certain song and dance troupe singing a certain famous song) and other items in detail in the table and submit it to the Central Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee for review. If it is necessary to change it, the Central Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee may notify it to correct it. Each radio station shall limit the changes, additions, deletions, or temporary suspensions of the pre-scheduled programs to no more than one-fifth of the daily programs due to unavoidable accidents. Each radio station shall rebroadcast the broadcasting programs of the Central Broadcasting Station (such as the speeches of party and state dignitaries) in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Communications during the broadcasting program time. Those who do not have the equipment for rebroadcasting shall report the suspension of rebroadcasting. Whenever the Central Broadcasting Station has particularly important programs that the Central Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee deems necessary to rebroadcast. The Ministry of Communications may notify it to handle it at any time, but at most one program per day shall be rebroadcast.

2. Regarding the allocation and selection of program content, the daily broadcast time allocated to each public radio station shall be mostly about propaganda education lectures. Private radio stations shall not be less than 40% of the propaganda education lecture programs, and the entertainment programs shall not exceed 60% at most. All commercial advertisements requested to be broadcast by various merchants shall be included in the entertainment programs, but the broadcast time shall not exceed one-third of the entertainment program time (for example, if the broadcast time of the entertainment program is 30 minutes, the time for inserting advertisements and broadcasts in the middle of each record shall not exceed 10 minutes if calculated cumulatively.) In addition to entertainment programs, each radio station shall broadcast propaganda education lecture programs in Mandarin in principle. Those who temporarily use local dialects for broadcasting should also add Mandarin teaching programs.

Each radio station must carefully select the programs broadcast every day. Any opinions that violate the prohibition or are ideologically biased, as well as stories, songs, and lyrics that are close to teaching obscenity, theft, or superstition and absurdity, shall not be broadcast. Otherwise, the Ministry of Communications may give a warning or order to stop broadcasting depending on the severity of the circumstances, in order to show no punishment.

3. Regarding the correction and regulation of broadcast time, the time for each radio station to broadcast programs shall be based on the specified standard time of each district. This standard time shall be checked against the time reported by the Central Broadcasting Station every day. In addition, if there are more than five radio stations with 100 watts or more in the same urban area or county town, the time for broadcasting programs of radio stations with less than 100 watts in the area shall be restricted, and the Ministry of Communications shall order them to know them at any time, and shall not exceed them.

4. Regarding the crackdown on those who do not abide by the regulations, if any radio station in any place fails to earnestly abide by the "Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations," the Ministry of Communications may give a warning or crackdown, or even order it to stop broadcasting or revoke its license, depending on the severity of the circumstances.

After the above-mentioned "Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations" are promulgated and implemented, each radio station has something to follow in the arrangement, allocation, and selection of programs, and it should not be the case that the chapter regulations are violated again, and it is taken upon itself. Therefore, this journal is happy to introduce the measures for the public to read. (End)

### The Factors and Characteristics of Formally Written Social Telegrams

— Shan Ronghai

Formally written social telegrams are a unique product of our country in the telegraph business. The meaning of advocating this kind of telegraph business is nothing more than the following three points: ㊀ The transmission of telegrams uses symbols as representatives of characters, which is the most important key when telegraphers first invented them, and so far this decision has not been overturned, and another method has been changed (the now invented fax telegram is popular in Europe and the United States, but because of the high cost and organization, it has not been widely promoted, so no matter what, it can never become the main organization in the structure of the telegraph business in our country.) Therefore, the structure of a country's writing in the telegraph business is extremely important. However, the organization of Chinese characters is not as simple as that of European and American characters, so in terms of telegraph transmission, four numbers are still used as the basis for the change of telegraph symbols (the now invented Chinese telegraph typewriter and the national phonetic telegraph, etc. have not been widely implemented, so they are not discussed here). Therefore, in the organization of telegraph writing, it must be one word and four codes, and there is no way to increase or decrease them, so it is impossible to make the text short. ㊁ Our country has been called the land of etiquette and righteousness since ancient times. For the grand ceremonies of weddings and funerals, all the etiquette is different from that of Europe and the United States, and the various meanings expressed in writing are different for relatives and children. Therefore, it is almost impossible to write a social letter or a small announcement without being old in social interaction. ㊂ Our country's telegraph business has been developing rapidly in recent years due to the rectification of the authorities and the efforts of employees across the country, but due to cost reasons, the current telegraph price is set. Except for telegraphs in this province, which have been reduced by 30%, there is no way to reduce it further, and the general public is mostly affected by the decline in domestic production and the downturn in business. There are very few people who use telegrams to communicate, so domestic telegraph business has not been able to develop as much as possible under this situation. It was not until the promulgation of the domestic social telegram method in August 1933 that the general merchants became interested in sending telegrams. However, from the perspective of precise statistics, the social telegram, on the one hand, has a low fee, which is inevitable to lose costs, and on the other hand, if the number of words exceeds the specified number, the newspaper fee must still be added, and the economic strength is somewhat insufficient, and there are two shortcomings. Therefore, there is the creation of the establishment of formally written social telegrams.

Regarding formally written social telegrams, in the telegraph accumulation in our view, the reason why it has become a creation is based on the above-mentioned three points, so the result of its implementation also has the following three characteristics:

㊀ Our country's telegraph prices cannot be reduced further due to food and salt relations. In terms of the hearts of ordinary people, sending a telegram for Liu Yu is only required for major China reasons. Now, Ernei's formally written social telegram adopts a fixed low transfer price, which is convenient for any class in society to have the opportunity to use, and can be used to arouse the public's interest and habit of sending electricity universally.

㊁ Our country's pin meeting situation is extremely brainy and frugal. Today's domestic formally written social telegram, although it is a piece of telegraph text, must imagine the grand intention of the sender hundreds of thousands of miles away when receiving the telegram in the receiver's spirit, and be entangled in endless excitement. On the sender's side, it feels easy and not restricted by everything in time, space, and material trade.

㊂ The social interaction of the generation has really tended to be close to one of the written sides, that is, the spiritual interaction, which has increased in matter. Therefore, Wei Ci is more linked, etc., and has been praised by the general public. However, most of the hair and industrial civilians still do not have this kind of elegant thinking power. Today's domestic branch-textual view of telegrams, the wording and sentence are all drafted for you, and the various forms and colors are all adjacent. The person who reports the news only needs to review it, and he can grasp the hair. Even in the intellectual world, it is easy to unload the sweet time.

Domestic formally written social regular reports have the above-mentioned factors and advantages. We broaden our vision and observe them. They are not only a kind of era product that facilitates a twist of the people and sends out zero reports, but also make great efforts to improve the social interaction system and embellish the folk culture.

### Recent News on the Ministry of Communications' Rectification of Northwest Telecommunications

Expansion of Counties and Addition of Lanzhou Radio Station

Zikai Prefecture is an important town in the northwest. In recent years, Bianjiang Radio Stations, which have been established in the areas of Gansu and Ning, have a large number. Lan Gu, the middle leaf of the ancient town, is extremely important? The original motor has been severely outnumbered, and the distribution is uneven. Now, a 5 million special wireless motor is specially added to sell and enrich it.

Reorganization of Jin-Sui Agencies

Since the Sui incident occurred, Junxun has been frequent in Jin-Cai and all of her. The original telecommunications organization has been simplified, and the need is difficult to meet. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications has carefully considered the actual situation and the political improvement. All the Yanggao, Zhenxian, and Yuanping three agency courts in Shanxi, and the Longsheng, Xinghe, Dongcheng, Huailai, and Chai Jiangbao five agency courts in Sui, have been reorganized into business offices, and personnel have been sent by the telecommunications bureau to take over. In addition, all the telegrams transmitted in the above-mentioned places used to use telephone sewing, and now all of them have been replaced with Mo Xun tearing newspapers to benefit the report.

### The Japanese Contradictions Demonstrated in the Seventieth Session of Parliament (Part 2)

— Nanyun

This is the reason why the Seiyukai only proposed reducing the budget by 300 million yuan, and also the reason why the Minseito paid special attention to "diplomatic failure." It is difficult to expect these two major parties to be tough on the government to the end. In the end, they cannot but sacrifice the interests of the public. This is the weakness of Japanese political parties, and also the objective condition that Japanese political parties are bound to decline and inevitably become divided.

Therefore, no matter how tough political parties are at present, this toughness will only be a shout. This is similar to an unhealthy interim economic boom, and it will never be able to save itself from decline, nor will it be able to prevent Japan's right-wing politics—deeply non-parliamentary and non-partisan politics. The so-called attempt to revive parliamentary politics is now being trampled on by the national defense-first principle in extraordinary times. What will replace parliamentary politics will be rapidly fascistic politics.

(V)

Within the two major political parties, since the military proposed the parliamentary reform plan last October, there has been a division between the self-respecting faction and the hard-line faction. The hard-line faction opposes fascism, demands the regeneration of political parties, and advocates a vote of no confidence in the current cabinet in order to attack fascist forces. Those who participated in this faction included Saito Takao of the Minseito and Hamada Kunimatsu of the Seiyukai...etc. Most of the self-respecting faction are cadres of the two parties, who advocate that political parties should be cautious and should consider the impact on the political situation when fighting against the government. From these two factions' different viewpoints, we can see the internal contradictions among Japanese capitalists at this stage. Moreover, due to the strengthening of internal contradictions among capitalists, the recent tough anti-government attitude of political parties has been formed.

At the Eastern Chamber of Commerce New Year's banquet on January 14, some capitalists severely criticized Arita's failed diplomacy. At the Economic Federation's New Year's banquet on the 18th, Ohashi Shintaro (industrial capitalist, member of the House of Peers) rose to give a speech, expressing his dissatisfaction with the huge budget. From this speech, it was revealed that the anti-government atmosphere among the powerful members of the "Japan Industrial Club" and the capitalists centered on the "All-Industry Federation" was unexpectedly strong. In addition, at the Okura Group's New Year's banquet on the 19th, Mr. Masuda Giichi, a member of the Minseito and a businessman, also gave an extremely indignant speech, vehemently opposing the Baba finances. About 500 capitalists attended the banquet that day, and all applauded and approved of Masuda Giichi's claims. The tension in the atmosphere was unprecedented in Tokyo's financial circles in recent years. Even some capitalists related to the military-industrial complex expressed concern about the famine and soaring prices of raw materials, as well as the increase in labor wages, and expressed their willingness to support established political parties and resist the government to the death! (January 21—Tokyo Yomiuri)

On the other hand? The progress of the new political party movement is also very active. Minister of the Army Terauchi once said to Prince Konoe (Speaker of the Japanese House of Peers): "This time the parliament has a very dangerous atmosphere. There is no hope for established political parties, and only the realization of an innovative new political party can be expected. Please do your best for the country." (November 19—Tokyo Asahi)

At the same time, the following news was also published in the Tokyo Yomiuri on January 20:

At a time when political parties are standing at a major crossroads of life and death, the reform faction within the political parties is carrying out a new political party movement in extreme secrecy. The central figures of the new party movement are Nakajima Kujirahei (a member of the Seiyukai, a graduate of the Naval Machinery School, director of the aircraft manufacturing plant, and a member of the self-respecting faction in the Seiyukai), Maeda Yonezo (the current Minister of Railways in the government, an incumbent cabinet member of the Seiyukai), and Count Arima Yoriyasu and Count Kodama Hideo, both members of the House of Peers. The main points of building a new party are the following two:

(1) In order to attempt the reconstruction of parliamentary politics, it is necessary to rely on a new system of military-civilian unity and cooperation to implement strong politics.

(2) Give full play to the true essence of constitutional politics, reject the so-called constitutional routine, fundamentally eliminate political parties, sweep away the corrupt and degenerate phenomena from the past, and establish the mother of constitutional politics under the fresh spirit of Japanism.

The members of the new party movement have already called on Minister of the Army Terauchi and Minister of the Navy Nagano to request spiritual support. It is rumored that the president of the new party will be one of the following: Prince Konoe, General Hayashi Senjuro, General Ugaki Kazushige, and General Minami Jiro.

(VI)

Based on the various facts mentioned above, Japan after the seventieth session of parliament is even more imaginable. The so-called innovative political party will surely surpass the established political parties and emerge, and the so-called strong cabinet will surely replace the Hirota cabinet and take the stage in the near future. As for the huge budget? Under the conditions of respecting national defense but allowing slight modifications, it can always be passed by some means.

What cannot be managed is that the internal contradictions of Japan have become even stronger than before. - However, as long as colonies can be developed and control in the colonies can be consolidated, these contradictions can also be temporarily alleviated. January 22

### Difficulties in Selecting Army and Navy Ministers Hinder Cabinet Formation

Divergences in Policy Between Hayashi and the Military Become Apparent; The Issue of Dissolving Parliament Is the Most Troublesome

[Tokyo] The general public believed that after Hayashi Senjuro's meetings with Terauchi and Nagano this morning, the cabinet formation work could proceed smoothly. However, this was not the case. Differences of opinion have emerged between Hayashi and Terauchi and Nagano regarding the selection of new Army and Navy Ministers. For example, for the positions of Army and Navy Ministers, Hayashi intends to appoint Itagaki and Suetsugu respectively, while Terauchi and Nagano respectively recommend Nakamura and Fujita as candidates for the Army and Navy Ministers. Although Hayashi sent messengers to negotiate with Terauchi and Nagano for the second time, Terauchi and Nagano refused to consider it further. Therefore, the cabinet formation work suddenly fell into a deadlock. The underlying cause lies in the divergence of policies, which led to friction between Hayashi and the Army and Navy. The two sides are currently seeking ways to break the deadlock. Hayashi visited the Chief of the Army General Staff, Prince Kan'in, at 5:25 p.m., and then visited Terauchi and Nagano at 5:55 p.m. Currently, dissolving parliament is one of the most troublesome issues. Hayashi believes that this issue should not be decided in advance at this time. It would be more appropriate to re-examine the situation after parliament reopens and then make a decision. This point seems to contradict the Army's opinion. In addition, the Army and Navy have not agreed to other policies. Therefore, whether the Hayashi Senjuro cabinet can succeed has become questionable and is difficult to predict at present. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 31st)

[Tokyo] As a result of General Hayashi's visit to Army Minister Terauchi this morning, Army Minister Terauchi recommended Lieutenant General Nakamura Kotaro, Director of the Education General Directorate, as the successor Army Minister. However, General Hayashi wants to recommend Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, as the Army Minister. Also, after Navy Minister Nagano met with General Hayashi this morning, he went to Kioicho to meet with Chief of Naval General Staff Prince Fushimi to report on General Hayashi's request to consider the matter of the successor Navy Minister, and discussed important matters before resigning. The Navy Minister also visited General Hayashi to convey the Navy's opinion, recommending General Fujita as the successor Navy Minister. However, because General Hayashi hopes that General Suetsugu will take office as Navy Minister, the two sides' intentions are inconsistent. After Navy Minister Nagano returned to his official residence, he held discussions with Vice-Minister Yamamoto, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Toda, and Director of the Personnel Bureau Shimizu. Navy Minister Nagano is rooted in Prince Fushimi's opinion and carefully considers the selection of the Navy Minister. The Navy authorities, in view of the serious situation and the necessity of unification within the ministry, insist on their original position. Therefore, the Navy Minister issue seems difficult to resolve unless General Hayashi concedes. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)

[Tokyo] When General Hayashi received the imperial order to form a cabinet, the military expressed satisfaction. Therefore, everyone believed that General Hayashi's cabinet formation work would proceed smoothly. However, when General Hayashi began negotiations with the military on the 31st, the minister selection issue suddenly encountered difficulties, casting a shadow on the prospects of cabinet formation. According to general observations, the reason is that the ministers recommended by the cabinet formation headquarters and the military are inconsistent. However, in reality, there are complex issues such as the reform program and policies that the Hayashi cabinet plans to implement, and the dissolution of parliament, which have led to different opinions between the Army and Navy and General Hayashi. That is, the views of the military and General Hayashi differ not only on personnel issues, but also on policy issues. Therefore, its future is quite noteworthy. (Allied Press dispatch on the 30th)

[Tokyo] From 1:30 p.m. on the 21st, General Hayashi discussed the cabinet formation policy with Shingo Sogawa, Hachiro Ohashi, and Tsuyoshi Kawada at the cabinet formation headquarters. As a result, it was decided to break away from the old pattern and organize a clear new cabinet to rejuvenate the people's hearts. Thus, the cabinet formation work was started. However, that day was limited to internal work, so only Sogawa was appointed as Chief Secretary and Hachiro Ohashi as Director-General of the Legislation Bureau. From the 31st, the surface work began. (Allied News dispatch on the 31st)

[Tokyo] Hayashi Senjuro's selection of cabinet members is still under secret negotiations. Although various parties have made various speculations about the successors, none can be regarded as reliable. The trend of Hayashi's actions seems to be still failing to coincide with the Army in some aspects. This gradual approach held by Hayashi shows that Japan will not suffer major changes in the near future. According to general observations here, although parliament is bound to be dissolved, Hayashi will seriously consider this due to the extremely complicated political situation. Therefore, there is still a glimmer of hope for avoiding dissolution before the budget is passed. Hayashi's appointment of Shingo Sogawa as Chief Secretary is extremely noteworthy. Regarding the candidates for Foreign Minister, although rumors are flying around, such as Sato Naotake, Saito Hiroshi, Togo Shigenori, and Nagai Ryutaro succeeding as Foreign Minister, most of them are baseless. The theory that Tatekawa Mutsuyoshi was simultaneously proposed as a candidate for Foreign Minister is even more unexpected. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 31st)

### Recruiting Talent

Promoting Continental Policy; Carefully Selecting Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Minister of Finance

[Tokyo] Because the Hayashi cabinet has the mission of reforming administration, the posts of two or three cabinet members may be concurrently held by the Prime Minister Hayashi or other cabinet members. The huge budget for the 12th year of Showa and thereafter, although it has to be re-submitted to parliament due to the resignation of the Hirota cabinet, is almost inevitable due to the serious international situation and the continental policy waiting to be implemented. Therefore, important financial policies such as reforming financial policies, public debt policies, and strengthening controlled economy are becoming more important. At the same time, from a broad international perspective, promoting industry, expanding trade, and planning for national strength are important national policies that the new cabinet should adopt. Therefore, General Hayashi considers the selection of ministers such as Minister of Finance, Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and must select talents from official circles and business circles with an extremely cautious attitude.

### Satisfactory Results of the League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting

Representatives Able to Cooperate Harmoniously; Chairman Gu Weijun Expresses Gratification

[Geneva] After the 96th meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council closed, major European newspapers published articles criticizing the importance of the results of this meeting. Today, the Central News Agency reporter visited Dr. Gu Weijun, the chairman of this meeting. According to him, he was extremely gratified by the praise from all sides for his humble election as chairman. He believes that the most noteworthy thing in the meeting is that the representatives of the major member states always discussed everything with a spirit of harmony, mutual understanding, so the result was extremely satisfactory. For example, the dispute between France and Turkey was mediated by the representatives of Switzerland and Russia, and it was resolved satisfactorily. Also, the dispute between Spain and Chile seemed to have reached a deadlock, but it was resolved with the help of his own mediation and that of Aiden Talbott. The meeting had satisfactory results on the Franco-Turkish dispute, the Danzig incident, and the Spanish incident, which was enough to ease the tense situation in Europe a lot. If the same spirit of cooperation can be used to address other important issues in the future, European peace will be consolidated and the risk of European war will be reduced. Our China has always advocated resolving all international issues with peace and justice, and its satisfaction with the achievements of this meeting is no less than that of European and American countries, he said.

### 200,000 People Rally in Moscow's Red Square

Celebrating the Conviction of the Counter-Revolutionary Case

[Moscow] Yesterday, 200,000 Moscow laborers braved severe cold and strong winds to hold a rally in Red Square, expressing their hatred for the spies, assassins, and lackeys of the fascist intelligence agencies who had just been sentenced by the Supreme Court.

Khrushchev, Secretary of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party, Shvernik, Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions, and Komarov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, gave speeches. The assembly unanimously passed a resolution supporting the main text of the judgment. (TASS dispatch on the 31st)

[Moscow] Today, hundreds of thousands of workers, students, and soldiers, holding flags painted with caricatures of the defendant Radek and slogans condemning the Japanese and German fascist parties, gathered in Red Square to celebrate the conviction of this major treason case. The Soviet people expressed complete satisfaction with the court's verdict. Workers had held several meetings on this issue, passing several resolutions, one of which stated, 'The Supreme Court's verdict is the claim of 170 million citizens of the Soviet Union.' The newspaper commented on the case, saying that the threat of war is increasing, and the spies of Germany and Japan have been forced to prove this point in the interrogation with extremely clear confessions. This contains a great lesson that all Soviet laborers and friends of people's peace must learn from this trial. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)

### Trotsky

Claims Confessions Are Completely Fabricated

Mexico City: Trotsky, while receiving visitors here today, denounced the organizers of the Moscow trial. Trotsky said, I am willing to submit thousands of my documents and other letters to an international commission for review in order to clarify the air polluted by deception, slander, and fabricated toxins. This trial cannot be regarded as over. Those who fabricate everything are now just beginning. Although the proceedings of the Moscow trial are very similar to the mental confusion during fever, we will have something to end it with. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)

### Floods in the United States

120,000 People Mobilized to Engage in Rescue Work

Chicago: The Mississippi River floods in five states. Today, it seems that the efforts of disaster relief personnel in several states are in vain. Cairo, Illinois, is the confluence of the river and the Ohio River. Its floodgates stretch for 1,200 miles and are worth 100 million yuan, protecting the lives of 500,000 people. Now 120,000 people are doing their best to rescue. Army engineers believe that the floodgates can still control the water, but so far, more than one million disaster victims are homeless, 347 people have died, and property losses are estimated at between 400 million and 500 million yuan. The Red Cross has received donations of 6.4 million yuan, but even if the goal of 10 million yuan is reached, it is feared that it will still be insufficient.

### U.S. Sailors to Resume Work Soon

Voting to Solicit Opinions

[San Francisco] The strike committee organized by seven West Coast seamen's unions decided today to solicit opinions from members on whether to resume work based on the conditions currently established with the employers. It is scheduled to report next Wednesday. However, the procedures for soliciting opinions are very complicated, and it may not be possible to complete them before Wednesday. Therefore, a spokesperson said that if most of the voters agree to resume work, the workers will probably resume work immediately without waiting for the results to be announced. The voting method will be very simple, only writing whether they agree with the conditions established with the employers. Strike leader Bridges predicted today that most workers will agree to resume work, but because ships that have been moored for a long time cannot sail immediately, transportation will not return to normal until several weeks later.

Current Commentary

### The New Situation in North China

— Yu

For several weeks, the front line in Suiyuan has been silent. The entire situation in North China also seems quite quiet. Some people may think that the aggressors will really "lay down their butcher knives," but the fact is not that simple. The roots of any drastic change are hidden beneath the calm surface. Judging from the situation in recent days, the worries about the future of North China are really something we cannot ignore.

We believe that the bandit puppet troops invading Suiyuan and their instigators will, after the lessons of past failures, further implement their more meticulous and sinister conspiracies. They are just waiting for the right opportunity to launch a large-scale invasion again. According to reports, on the 23rd, the leaders of the bandit puppets and the personnel of a certain party had an important new resolution on the Suiyuan incident at the Jiabusi Temple meeting. It was rumored that a large-scale invasion of Suidong was scheduled for the 28th. Although it has not been realized, the active westward movement of the bandit puppet troops and the continuous transportation of large quantities of munitions and food from Rehe to the front line are enough to prove that a more serious crisis is imminent.

Looking at the recent situation in Hebei and Chahar, in recent days, Japanese naval and military officials have held repeated meetings and made specific decisions on how to expand the puppet organization in eastern Hebei and how to step up the work of special agencies. The Japanese military in and out of the customs, the puppet Manchukuo, and the puppet eastern Hebei, together with the frustrated politicians and warlords in Tianjin and other places, will secretly hold an enlarged meeting in Tianjin during the Spring Festival to discuss ways to promote the situation in North China. Obviously, what they are planning is nothing more than how to grab North China.

As for the economic aspect, recently, under the beautiful names of "friendship" and "cooperation," "economic cooperation" has been repeatedly promoted. On the 25th, representatives from the North China Garrison Army, the Tianjin Consulate General, the Xingzhong Corporation, and the South Manchuria Railway Company held a North China economic development symposium in Tianjin. Specific plans have been discussed for road construction, mining, water conservancy, cotton planting, etc. However, this is still their public activity in the North China economy. What is even more worrying is the smuggling problem. In recent days, under the support of a certain military department, smuggling in North China has been more rampant than in the spring of last year. Smuggling agencies use a large number of heavy-duty trucks to transport smuggled goods, with armed teams protecting them from behind, which has made the Customs Anti-Smuggling Headquarters helpless. The British Consul in Tianjin has also had to be very concerned. This situation is not limited to North China. It is said that the smuggling trend in various coastal counties in southern Fujian has also become very popular recently. It can be seen that this activity infringing on our country's tax rights is out of a large-scale plan.

In short, the current situation in North China is relaxed on the outside but tense on the inside. We must pay close attention to it at all times and take appropriate and resolute measures to deal with the roots of its crisis as soon as possible. Otherwise, if this situation develops, the sovereignty of our country will inevitably suffer a tragic infringement.

### Japanese Army Aircraft Fly to Manchuria

Departing from Kagamigahara Yesterday Morning

[Tokyo] The First Flight Squadron Command of the Kagamigahara Army held its first cold-resistant flight this morning after establishing a flight regiment. That is, 24 members of the regiment, under the command of Major General Saga, divided into three vice-plus-type aircraft, and departed from Kagamigahara at 3:30 this morning to fly to the Manchurian side. It is scheduled to return to its original location on February 20. In addition, the Second Flight Regiment also has a joint flight plan between Japan and Manchuria. Colonel Kuriyama is the commander, preparing to use six Type 92 reconnaissance aircraft to fly to Shenyang, and using that place as the center, to conduct cold-resistant flights in various parts of Manchuria. Its total range reaches 7,000 kilometers, scheduled to depart for Manchuria on February 12. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)

### Foreign Minister's Speech Responding to Hitler's Declaration Calls for International Cooperation

Maintaining Peace: The Soviet Union Should Not Be Excluded; Treaties Must Be Respected; Disarmament Must Be Achieved

Châteauroux, France – The memorial to the fallen soldiers of the European War in this city was inaugurated today. Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos delivered a speech immediately, explaining the international situation and responding to the declaration made by German leader Hitler yesterday in the German parliament. He said, "Leader Hitler's speech does not contain any attacks on our country. I am very pleased that he said it is inappropriate for France and Germany to have disputes for the sake of human welfare, as our country's aspirations are the same. However, in this world, there are not only France and Germany. Therefore, maintaining peace cannot be done solely by France and Germany. General rules must be adhered to, especially respecting treaties. However, Hitler has recounted his country's repeated unilateral abrogation of treaties and further damaged Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles, which establishes Germany's responsibility for starting the European War. How can other countries increase their trust in the value of his country's signature? Fortunately, there are several positive aspects in Hitler's speech, especially regarding disarmament. Hitler advocates for comprehensive consideration to stabilize the situation and bring countries closer together, but such efforts should not be conditional on opposing any country. I am referring to the Soviet Union, which has 200 million people. Excluding them from the international community is not only arbitrary but also dangerous. Moreover, they have no intention of excluding other countries, and their need for peace is no less than that of others. I believe that the military industries of all countries should be converted to peacetime industries. It is necessary for all countries to take joint action to find a way out for the military industry. In short, we do not ask Germany to do what France cannot do. Regarding the issue of the Spanish civil war, if anyone forces the country to adopt a certain political system, it could cause a major crisis. Only the country itself can decide what political system to adopt. I hope the country can deal with it wisely. The Foreign Minister reiterated that France still considers the League of Nations its home and that the dispute between France and Turkey over the Sanjak of Alexandretta has been successfully resolved after being submitted to the Council of the League of Nations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the League of Nations. Furthermore, we feel that general peace and our country's security have become more solid after closely uniting with other peace-loving countries. The good relations between our country and Britain, and the agreements established with the Little Entente countries and Soviet Russia, are also a strong guarantee for us, which can be used to prevent war. In addition, the democratic foundation of the United States is stable, and we are ideologically integrated with it, which also helps to maintain peace. We firmly believe that war is not inevitable and should do our best to avoid the scourge of war. However, our aspirations for peace have a limit: if our country is attacked by another country, we must rise up to defend ourselves. We must uphold the obligations we have accepted, which we are determined and unyielding in. Our country is free and strong, and has a firm grasp of its own strength and the friendship of other countries. We can shake hands with other countries without hesitation. On this day of the completion of the memorial to the fallen soldiers, we respectfully follow the will of the martyrs and preserve three supreme goals for their descendants: the motherland, peace, and freedom."

### Five German Cabinet Members Receive Highest Party Honors

[Berlin] Today marks the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. The cabinet held a meeting in the afternoon, during which Leader Hitler appointed five cabinet members who were not affiliated with the National Socialist Party as party members, namely Foreign Minister Neurath, Economic Minister Schacht, Finance Minister Kroesigk, Transport Minister Rubenthal, and Justice Minister Gürtner. They were awarded the golden party badge, the highest award in the party. The Leader briefly described the great achievements made by the National Socialist Party in the four years since it came to power. Then, Aviation Minister General Göring delivered a speech on behalf of all cabinet members, saying that it was an honor to be the Leader's assistant for four years. Finally, Defense Minister General von Blomberg thanked the Leader on behalf of the army. The cabinet then adjourned. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

### Hitler Forbids Germans from Accepting Nobel Prizes

[Berlin] Leader Hitler today ordered that Germans be prohibited from accepting Nobel Prizes. This is because the winner of this year's Peace Prize is Carl von Ossietzky, who was previously detained in the Esterwegen concentration camp by the National Socialist Party. It is said that Hitler issued this order as revenge. (National Electric dispatch from the 30th)

### Different Countries Have Different Views on Hitler's Diplomatic Statements

British and French Disappointment, Roman Approval

[Paris] There are varying comments from different countries regarding the speech made by German leader Hitler in the parliament. A summary is as follows:

Vague and Impractical

London – The impression here of Hitler's speech in parliament is that it only grants leniency to various matters and does not promote anything. The statement that the era of startling events has passed is welcome, but the era of cooperation does not seem to have begun yet. Hitler's tone is generally considered mild, but his response to the points raised by British Foreign Secretary Eden in his recent speech on a general European solution seems somewhat vague. For example, Eden said that it is now necessary to accept all countries as legitimate partners, but Hitler still responded with unchanged hostility towards Bolshevism. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)

[London] Major newspapers published on Sunday, namely the Sunday Times and the Sunday Observer, commented on German leader Hitler's speech, and both believed that the various issues raised by British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Premier Blum had not received answers, which is very regrettable. However, it is satisfactory that the door to international negotiations is not closed, and the world's concerns about the European situation can be slightly relieved. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)

A Ray of Hope for the Future

Paris – Hitler's speech in parliament was apparently a response to the one made by French Premier Blum in Lyon near London, so it needs careful study. However, France today accepted it with a very mild attitude. According to the French, Hitler's tone was slightly milder than previously announced, which should help clarify the international situation. Although the practical suggestions for adjusting international relations that the French had hoped for were not seen in the speech, the French were pleased that Hitler reiterated that the resentment between France and Germany had been eliminated. Hitler announced that Germany would no longer take startling actions and was prepared to cooperate with Europe. The French considered this the brightest part of the speech. When the Saar region was returned, Germany guaranteed to France that Germany would no longer have territorial desires towards France. Today, Hitler's words are almost a guarantee to all countries that Germany does not want to attack their territorial integrity, such as Germany not invading Memel and not occupying Danzig. It is generally believed that this passage of the speech is a ray of hope for the future. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)

[Paris] The initial impression here of Hitler's speech can be summarized as follows:

(1) The French had hoped that after the speeches by British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Premier Blum, Hitler would give a concrete response. Unexpectedly, this speech was still vague and did not have any concrete conclusions. (2) Hitler mentioned British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech, but avoided responding to Premier Blum's speech made on the 24th of this month in Lyon, which was about economic cooperation between France and Germany. This is somewhat strange. (3) Hitler's wording towards France in the speech was conciliatory, saying that the French government and the French ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, were both loyal. In addition, he provided a guarantee that there are no longer any objects of dispute between France and Germany. All of this made the French feel satisfied. (4) Hitler said that once Germany's equal rights are restored, it will reform the current system of German railways and the Deutsche Bank and place them under the sovereignty of the German government. The true meaning of this statement is still unknown, but it is generally believed that it is a sign that Germany is about to take unilateral action again and declare the abolition of international constraints, as evidenced by the fact that Hitler unilaterally announced the cancellation of Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles, which stated that Germany was responsible for starting the European War. (5) Regarding Hitler's suggestion that Belgium and the Netherlands restore their neutrality before the European War, the general public is paying close attention because this conference will affect the future Locarno Treaty. (6) The sections of Hitler's speech regarding the Soviet Union show that he continues to advocate for excluding the Soviet Union from participating in a general solution to the European situation. (7) Regarding the colonial issue, Hitler said that Germany will not demand colonies from any country that has not seized Germany's colonies. The intention is to indicate that Germany only asks to recover its pre-war colonies and has no intention of coveting Portuguese colonies. (8) Regarding the Spanish issue, Hitler said that Germany only has commercial interests in Spain. Therefore, it is hoped that the international situation caused by the Spanish civil war will not become more serious. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

Consistent with Italian Policy

Rome – Italian political circles fully agree with German leader Hitler's speech, believing that it can consolidate the true peace pursued by Italy and Germany. They also said that the points sought by Hitler in his speech to achieve this peace are completely consistent with Italian policy. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)

[Rome] All newspapers expressed satisfaction with the German leader's speech. Gaida, a famous reporter for the Italian Daily, also commented, "After this speech was delivered, various fantasies held by the world have been somewhat eliminated, and governments have a clearer understanding of the reality, which is of great benefit to the overall situation in Europe. As far as Germany's political tendencies are concerned, there are three main motivations: to oppose communism. As such, as long as the mutual assistance treaty between France and Russia exists, the rapprochement between France and Germany cannot be realized. Furthermore, regarding the colonial issue, 'what Leader Hitler said was directed at the two countries that divided Germany's old colonies.'" The Roman People's Daily stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech on the 19th of this month, mocking Germany, saying that if it could give up cannons, it could get butter. Hitler replied yesterday, "pointing out that this is a fundamental fallacy," meaning that Germany does not want to be isolated, but it also has no intention of disarming. The Messenger stated, "The content of this speech is mild, and the form is fluent. Any agreements that can be based on reality have room to be established in the future." (Havas dispatch from the 31st)

The Shame of the Treaty is Cleared

Berlin – Hitler's speech was published by all newspapers with large headlines, or said "The words signed by the previous government in November 1918 have been revoked by Leader Hitler," or said "The claim that Germany should be responsible for the European War has been solemnly denied by the Leader," or said "Germany's prestige in the world has now been restored." The main point of the newspapers is that Hitler has cleared the shame of the Treaty of Versailles, which is another move to liberate the German nation. The praise for the Leader is even greater than the celebration of the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule yesterday. For example, the local Guidance newspaper stated, "The Treaty of Versailles put shackles on us, which is a stain on history. Leader Hitler has now washed it away. His decisions and the motions he made have been blessed by God and have been successful. God loves the brave." The People's Observer stated, "The parliament was moved by the Leader's great personality and cheered for him. Germany can now cope with world political issues." The German General Report stated, "After this speech was delivered, the door to international negotiations was opened. What is the meaning of the Leader's words? It is that our claim for the revision of the treaty has come to a standstill." The external newspaper, the Berlin Stock Exchange Report, stated, "Our measures regarding the national economy are necessary, but the world doubts them and wants to hinder the revival of our economy. Leader Hitler has therefore faced it with Germany's determination and is determined to continue the four-year economic plan." (Havas dispatch from the 31st)

Belgium Expresses Satisfaction

Brussels – Semi-official figures in Belgium expressed satisfaction with Leader Hitler's statement that he is prepared to guarantee Belgium's neutrality, and said that Germany's declaration to cancel Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (i.e., the article stating that Germany was one of the initiators of the European War) was only made internally and has little impact.

Attempt to Alienate Britain and France

Poland – Polish observers generally believe that Leader Hitler's speech was almost entirely directed at Britain, and he pretended not to hear the speech of the French Premier. This is another attempt to alienate Britain and France, but the positions of Britain and France are in perfect agreement, which is very different from Hitler's position. Therefore, the attempt to alienate Britain and France will be difficult to realize.

No Benefit to the Cause of Peace

Geneva – Observers generally adopted an extremely reserved attitude, and some were disappointed because Hitler's speech did not contain any constructive proposals, but merely rejected certain proposals from other countries, and affirmed or denied some points. It was merely an argument and did not benefit the cause of peace.

The European Situation is Difficult to Clarify

United States – Semi-official figures in the United States had hoped that Hitler's speech would contain reassuring statements, but they were disappointed because the content was vague. They also said that the main point of this speech was internal, and the sections relating to the Treaty of Versailles were not very relevant. However, in terms of colonies, Germany now demands that all pre-war territories be returned, so it is practically impossible for Britain and Germany to reach a compromise. Furthermore, Hitler continued to attack the Soviet Union, so if Europe wants to establish a general agreement that includes the countries of Eastern Europe, the path has been blocked because of this. In short, after Hitler's speech was delivered, some aspects in the United States who advocate that President Roosevelt should participate in European affairs will still feel that it is not easy to start. (Havas dispatch)

[Washington] British businessman Sir Simon and President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull recently discussed here the possibility of redistributing colonial raw materials. Therefore, people here today read German leader Hitler's speech in parliament with particular interest. Officials were silent on this, but the international community expressed disappointment, believing that Hitler and French Premier Blum and British Foreign Secretary Eden were clearly unable to coordinate, and there was very little basis for joint cooperation. Hitler's tough attitude on the colonial issue and his lack of concessions on the exchange of views between Britain and France made people sigh. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)

### The Morbid State of the German Economy

The Natural Result of Rearmament: An Essay Published in a British Magazine

[London] The February issue of the magazine 'The Banker' contains an essay criticizing Germany's military finance and economic situation in the four years since German leader Hitler came to power. It was published at the time of Hitler's speech in parliament. The magazine said that the morbid state of the German economy is the result of rearmament, and the government's massive waste is far greater than that of other countries, which further exacerbates this morbid state. (National Electric dispatch from the 30th)

### Huge Celebrations in Danzig to Commemorate the National Socialist Party's Rule

Warsaw – The authorities of the National Socialist Party in the Free City of Danzig recently held a grand ceremony to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule in Germany. Flags were hung all over the city, and members of various National Socialist Party organizations marched in formation. The proceedings of the German parliament in Berlin and Leader Hitler's speech were broadcast here by radio. All factory, shop, and school staff listened respectfully on the radio. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

### Military Operations Near Madrid Come to a Halt

In the Western Suburb Park Area, Rebel Counterattacks Fail and Retreat

Madrid – Government military authorities issued a communiqué this afternoon stating that after our troops recovered Moncloa Park in the western suburbs of this city yesterday, rebel troops launched a fierce attack in an attempt to recapture it. The government troops met them head-on and engaged in a fierce battle for three hours, after which the rebel troops finally retreated, suffering heavy losses. Currently, there is heavy rain around the city, and military operations have been suspended. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

Seville – The National Army radio station in this city broadcast a message this afternoon stating that it is impossible to march around Madrid due to the rain. "However, the National Army is still maintaining its original positions and can continue to advance as soon as it receives orders." (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

### The Western Government Finds the Sea Monitoring Plan Difficult to Accept

Valencia – Semi-official figures recently announced that the Spanish Sea Monitoring Plan drafted by the London Adjustment Committee advocates that the naval fleets of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy be responsible for monitoring different areas, while the Soviet navy has not been invited to participate. Therefore, the Spanish Republican government may find it difficult to accept this plan. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)

### From Verbal Battle to Total Resignation

— Tokyo Correspondence

㊀

Before the opening of the Japanese Diet, everyone thought there were too many important issues, and some waves were naturally unavoidable. However, in the end, after making some revisions to the tax increase plan and the political expenses other than military expenditures in the budget, the situation could be navigated smoothly. However, the Hirota Cabinet contained too many internal contradictions, and ultimately could not last. It was inevitable that it would resign after the Diet session closed. Who knew that on the first day of the Diet session, the debate between Hamada and Terauchi over whether or not the military had been insulted led to a two-day suspension of the Diet session and then the question of whether or not to dissolve the Diet. Because of disagreement within the cabinet, a huge wave of total cabinet resignation was triggered. This chain of events was by no means accidental, nor was it a matter of personal feelings. It was purely the result of ideological opposition in Japan over the past few years. Two incompatible ideologies have been rubbing against each other too fiercely, and it was natural that they would explode. It can be said to be a social inevitability, but no one expected it to explode so quickly. What are these two ideologies? Simply put, it is the conflict between liberalism and controlled economy. This time, neither the Minseitō nor the Seiyūkai had any plans or determination to overthrow the Hirota Cabinet. Hamada's speech was only to say what he wanted to say, and the wording was originally very careful. He himself never thought it would cause such a big storm. If Terauchi had no dissatisfaction with Hamada's speech, he would not have had the feeling of being insulted. Things in the world are really coincidental. Just the first day, the declarations of the party conventions of the two major political parties did not mention the necessity of strengthening national defense, and at the same time, they all adopted a critical and attacking attitude towards the current cabinet's administration. Therefore, the army first issued a statement saying that the two parties lacked a clear understanding of the current situation and were not sufficient to share the heavy responsibility in times of emergency. If the two parties wanted to oppose the government, please first withdraw the cabinet members from the party. This kind of statement was very important, and all parties attached great importance to it. We felt that the friction between the army and the political parties was bound to expand, but we did not expect that it could immediately cause such a big political upheaval. The army had this dissatisfaction, so Hamada's speech was like lighting the fuse, and it exploded immediately.

㊁

On the day the House of Representatives was in session, the reporter was fortunate to have the opportunity to listen. From Prime Minister Hirota's speech to the verbal battle between Hamada and Terauchi, the whole drama was witnessed. Prime Minister Hirota's speech was like reading a manuscript, which made us feel that he not only lacked self-confidence, but also lacked courage. Compared with Hara Takashi, Katō Takaaki, he was really far behind. Foreign Minister Arita's speech was often ridiculed from the audience. A neutral member, Tabuchi Toyokichi, relying on his seniority, shouted loudly from time to time, 'Don't talk nonsense, hurry down.' Arita said, 'Negotiations between China and Japan have not achieved the expected results,' and the audience laughed. He also said, 'The situation is in a state of stagnation,' and the audience shouted, 'Isn't it a failure?' He then said, 'The negotiations so far, and the future development, have great significance,' and the audience was in an uproar again. Arita spoke about diplomacy with the Soviet Union, and the audience shouted, 'Tragic diplomatic failure.' When he spoke about the increasing friendship in diplomacy with the United States, the audience shouted, 'Don't talk nonsense.' In the end, Arita's speech only had scolding and no applause. This was a phenomenon that had never happened in the speeches of successive ministers of state. Finance Minister Baba's speech listed figures to explain the limits for issuing public bonds, and he did not have any confident conclusions about tax increases and the people's ability to bear the burden. Therefore, there was not a single applause from the audience. Under this situation, the psychology of the members can be imagined. After the speeches of the three ministers, Sakurauchi Yukio, the representative of the Minseitō, first questioned. Sakurauchi's speech was very long. Whenever he encountered an important point, the Minseitō naturally applauded, and the Seiyūkai also applauded from time to time. Hirota, Arita, and Baba's answers were just perfunctory. We who were listening did not feel satisfied, let alone the members. The second questioner was Hamada Kunimatsu, the veteran fighter of the Seiyūkai. Hamada was originally an old Seiyūkai member of Inukai Tsuyoshi, and he joined the Seiyūkai at the same time as Inukai. Hamada's question first criticized the three ministers' answers to Sakurauchi, saying that the answers of ministers of state had never been so insincere. He first attacked the Hirota Cabinet's weakness and its need to rely on the military as a driving force. The verbal attack gradually turned to the point that if soldiers want to talk about politics, they should take off their military uniforms, put down their swords, and form political parties to fight in speech. Hamada then launched a torrent of attacks on the Hirota Cabinet on the point of suppressing speech, and cited the constitution and the Meiji Rescript to expound the true essence of parliamentary politics and party politics, and attacked the rampant bureaucratic politics and dictatorial politics. Whenever he hit the key points, the audience applauded thunderously. The reporter turned to look at the attitude of the cabinet members. Hirota, Terauchi, Arita, and Baba were all busy taking notes on the key points of the questions. In particular, Terauchi's eyes were fixed on Hamada, as if he was very anxious.

Hamada's hour-and-a-half-long speech was finally over. Hirota first responded, strongly defending himself against the accusation of dictatorial politics, saying that 'the current cabinet decides everything based on public opinion.' The audience laughed. Next was Terauchi, the Minister of the Army and the protagonist of this political change. Terauchi took the podium and first said, 'The Prime Minister has fully explained our country's political form.' The audience roared at the word 'fully'. At this moment, Terauchi still forgot how he should answer below, and hurriedly beckoned to Vice Minister Umezu. Umezu handed him a piece of paper, and he continued to speak. Terauchi said, 'Just now I heard Mr. Hamada's speech, and he said something about the military...' He paused slightly before saying the word 'insult.' As soon as these two words came out, the audience shouted 'No, No' and shouted 'Cancel it quickly.' Terauchi could hardly speak because of the shouts from the audience. He managed to say two more sentences and hurriedly said, 'I won't say more now.' Arita went down and Arita came up to answer, and the attention of the audience was completely shifted to the words 'insult.' No one cared what Arita said. After Arita finished speaking, Hamada took the podium again to question, pointing to Terauchi and asking, 'Just now you said that Hamada's speech contained words that insulted the military, which sentence was the insult?' The audience applauded. 'I am the representative of the people. If you say that I have insulted the national army of honor, even if it means a fight, I will not back down (applause from the audience again). If you say I have insulted, you must cite the facts. I don't understand abstract words.' His aura was overwhelming, and the audience was sweating for him. At this time, Terauchi's face was like a persimmon. He stood up again and replied, 'I didn't say insult, please look at the stenographic record.' The audience was in an uproar. 'I said that the words used by Mr. Hamada gave people the feeling of insult, so I advised Mr. Hamada.' Hamada was a seventy-year-old man, a veteran in the political world, and he would not let go. He took the podium again and retorted, 'I cannot accept the advice of a young man. You are His Majesty's Minister of the Army, but you are a civil servant of the country. Although I am unworthy, I am also His Majesty's civil servant. From the perspective of feudal ideology and bureaucratic self-righteousness, you are an official and I am a commoner, but I am a civil servant with 90 million people as my backing. If I accept your advice, then I must apologize to the world. Japanese samurai have always respected honor and bushido. Can you determine someone's dishonor without any evidence or facts? Please look at the stenographic record. If I have insulted the military, I will commit seppuku to apologize to you. If not, you should commit seppuku to apologize to the world.' While Hamada was speaking, the applause from the audience almost never stopped. Terauchi felt even more embarrassed by the emotional impact. In the end, Terauchi still asked to wait for the stenographic record to be checked before speaking again, and Hamada also reluctantly ended the verbal battle because each member was limited to three questions. Who knew that these few minutes of debate would cause the storm of suspension and the total resignation of the cabinet that night?

㊃

When the House of Representatives adjourned, it was already 6:20. We went home to send telegrams, thinking that we could still see how this comedy would end tomorrow. Who knew that we received the news of the suspension in the middle of the night? It turned out that after the House of Representatives adjourned, Terauchi asked Hirota to convene an emergency cabinet meeting. We naturally did not know how Terauchi argued at the cabinet meeting and how the cabinet members discussed it, but it is said that Terauchi thought that the atmosphere in the Diet today was very dangerous, and the political parties did not feel the importance of the current situation. If they were not prompted to reflect, it might arouse a huge storm. He advocated dissolving the Diet immediately. Some cabinet members thought that this matter was too important and should not be decided lightly. Moreover, the Diet had just opened for one day, and everything had not been discussed yet. Dissolution would be too unreasonable. Therefore, the compromise result was to suspend the meeting for two days first and then discuss it again. The suspension was decided on the 21st. On the afternoon of the 22nd, an emergency cabinet meeting was convened to discuss the measures after the suspension. It was heard that Terauchi still strongly advocated dissolution at that time. If his proposal could not be passed, he would resign alone and hand over his resignation to Hirota in person. Under this situation, in order to avoid the crisis of mutual dissolution of the cabinet, it was only possible to decide on the policy of dissolving the Diet first and then try to remedy it. In fact, when the dissolution policy was decided, some cabinet members already had the intention of compromising, especially Navy Minister Nagano, who hoped that in the first year of the Pacific non-treaty, he could realize the grand plan of enriching and expanding the navy, so he did not approve of dissolving the Diet. Commerce Minister Ogawa, also because he was standing on the position of a member of the Minseitō, had to try his best to prevent dissolution. Therefore, although the cabinet meeting decided on the policy of dissolution, these two suddenly visited Machida, the president of the Minseitō, late at night to state their intention to mediate and compromise. Nagano also visited Suzuki, the president of the Seiyūkai, alone to explain his views in detail. The two major political parties originally had no intention of overthrowing the cabinet. Since Nagano took the lead in mediating, they naturally expressed their agreement, but because of the relationship between the parties, they asked to wait until the next morning to reply. At the same time, of course, there were also the same work going on in all aspects. The work of mediation that night led to a sudden increase in the atmosphere of compromise the next day. On the morning of the 22nd, the two major political parties officially replied that they accepted the mediation. Therefore, the final key was only in the attitude of the army. Here, we should raise several questions. First, did Terauchi agree to the compromise work beforehand? Second, what were the conditions for the compromise? Third, after the compromise, can the friction between the army and the political parties be eased? For the first question, our speculation is negative, because Terauchi's attitude has always been tough, and he has already submitted his resignation letter on the 22nd, so there is no reason to agree. However, some cabinet members thought that if the political parties were willing to compromise, Terauchi might not strongly oppose it, so they tried it out. For the second question, we speculate that the compromise conditions proposed by Nagano were probably that the two major political parties would state that they would not overthrow the current cabinet and guarantee the passage of the budget, then the government would cancel the planned dissolution of the Diet. This observation, although not accurate, is not far off. For the third question, we think that the cabinet members who are engaged in the work of compromise only hope that after the budget is passed, will the friction be eased? Temporarily, I am afraid it is not under consideration.

㊄

On the morning of the 23rd, the eyes of the world were focused on the army. However, the army issued a statement late on the night of the 22nd, rejecting a compromise, and still adhered to its original policy, vowing not to cooperate with the established political parties. Therefore, on the morning of the 23rd, the army convened a meeting of the three chiefs to decide on the attitude of thoroughly rejecting the political parties. The navy also convened a meeting of military councilors to decide to support Nagano's mediation policy. It was really wonderful to be so far apart. Although there were a lot of exchanges between the senior officers of the army and the navy, the most important solo meeting between Nagano and Terauchi could not be realized in the end. Therefore, around 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd, everyone knew that compromise was absolutely hopeless. If compromise could not be achieved, there were only two ways to resolve the situation: total cabinet resignation or dissolution of the Diet. According to political norms, dissolving the Diet is really unreasonable. First, the Diet has no vote of no confidence in the cabinet. The speech of one member cannot determine the attitude of the whole. Second, the current cabinet has no party in the Diet, even if the current cabinet is dissolved, there is no hope of victory. The situation is very obvious, and there is no need to wait for the result of the general election to know. Third, all policy issues have not been discussed yet. On what topic does the government solicit public opinion? With these three reasons, if the work of compromise cannot be achieved, then total cabinet resignation is the most appropriate way. That was how we observed it at first. However, the Hirota Cabinet suddenly decided on the dissolution policy, which made people feel inexplicable. Is there a special technique for the Japanese to use politics? Since Nagano took the initiative to undertake the work of mediation and failed, everyone knows that although there are two solutions, the path of dissolution is impassable. If the cabinet members disagree, there is only total resignation, and the public opinion of the whole country does not recognize dissolution as a solution. In this atmosphere, although Terauchi strongly advocated it, the cabinet members who did not agree could not change their attitude. Hirota also felt that he was powerless, and at this critical moment, it was even more difficult to unify the steps of the cabinet members. Therefore, on the morning of the 23rd, Hirota had already decided to resign. When he convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 1:30 p.m., Hirota met with them individually in advance to avoid conflict among the cabinet members and told them of his decision. Therefore, the most important cabinet meeting only took 20 minutes to decide on the total resignation. There are three reasons for the resignation of the cabinet members, which is unprecedented. Hirota's reason is 'In view of the recent political situation, the administration is even more difficult and it is difficult to expect it to be smooth.' Terauchi's reason is 'I am dissatisfied with the current political situation.' The reason for other cabinet members is to resign because the prime minister resigns. This way of expressing it is very noteworthy.

㊅

Among the political changes this time, there are several things that we can value the most. First, why does the Japanese army reject the established political parties so much? The shortcomings of the established political parties are well known, but under the current constitution, the Diet must be respected, and the operation of the Diet mechanism must rely on political parties. Rejecting the established political parties, how should politics be applied in the future? We know that the army also knows that a strong and effective politics cannot be realized without relying on political parties. However, the established political parties still take liberalism as their guiding spirit, which is fundamentally incompatible with the controlled economy embraced by the army. The so-called controlled economy, although the army denies that it is fascism, this impression is very deep. Therefore, this political change can be said to be the beginning of the direct struggle between liberalism and controlled economy. Second, the political beliefs of the Japanese navy are different from those of the army to a certain extent. The army advocated dissolution, and the navy advocated compromise. This is a very obvious opposition. Whether the claims of the army and the navy in the future politics will always be opposed is worthy of our attention. There seem to be quite a few liberals in the navy. Third, the army and the established political parties have formed an irreconcilable state. Then, how to solve this problem in the future? Organizing a new party is certainly a way out, but such a great undertaking is easier said than done. Even if some people can be absorbed from the established political parties, it is really not easy to get a majority. Forming a party with right-wing groups seems to be of little help. Why? Because the established political parties have been cultivated for decades, and even if there are contacts between them, it is too difficult for the new party to try to invade. Let's see what wonderful plans they have in their bags. (Central News Agency, January 24)

### Letter

To the editor, I was surprised to read the article 'Third Detachment of the Songjiang Detachment Wins Port Tax Police, Detachment Sergeant Shoots and Kills Fellow Sergeant' published in your newspaper on the 27th. After investigation, the tax police stationed at Desheng Port are the 54th Team, and there is no Third Detachment of Tax Police. There is another Third Detachment of Water Police stationed here. The case of the sergeant shooting and killing a fellow sergeant is a matter of the Third Detachment of Water Police. I am afraid that the rumors are untrue and may cause misunderstanding. I hope to correct this. He Yi, Captain of the 54th Team, Songjiang Five-County Tax Police Bureau.

### Shenyuan Basketball Chizhi Barely Wins Xintong Yesterday

33 to 30, Xintong Played with Four Players in the Second Half

Shenyuan Basketball had a total of three games yesterday. First, the unnamed team of the second division and the Fufeng team played. The unnamed team was very sharp at the beginning and led 20 to 15 in the first half, but it sank slightly later, and the Fufeng team gradually penetrated and reversed the score with 33 to 27. The next game was between Mailin B and Team Seven of the first division and second group. The strength gap was very large. The first half was 18 to 4. The balance was slightly better in the second half, but Mailin still won with 36 to 15. The final game was between Xintong and Chizhi, two teams of the first group, which met for the first time this season due to their different groups. However, Chen Xuechong and Liang Yunming of Chizhi were unable to attend due to leg injuries. Liang came on the court first for one minute because Xu Peisheng was not there, and then went down. After the match, Chizhi first opened the record with one goal each for Ru Lan and Jin. Xintong then exceeded with 6 to 4. Chizhi chased to 9 each. After that, from 12 to 12 to 14 to 14, Xintong led. Zhang Liangxiong of Chizhi once penetrated with 16 to 14, and then Lan Jin chased to 16 each. Xu Gao of Chizhi scored two consecutive goals and led 20 to 18 in the first half. After the break, Kate scored a penalty, and Lan Jin and Gao Nai also scored one goal each, surging as much as eleven points in one go, and exceeded with 27 to 20. Xintong's momentum was awe-inspiring, and Chizhi's luck was very bad, and there were many cases of hitting the basket and then stepping out again. After holding on for a long time, Zhang Liangxiong finally scored two free throws. Xingfusi Tuo was then sent off for four fouls, playing with only four players. Zhang then chased to 24 to 27, but his luck was still bad, and four chances under the basket were lost due to over-operation. After Zhang scored two more goals, Su Yinghai was also sent off for four fouls. Gao Baosheng re-entered and then added five points in a row, exceeding with 33 to 28. However, Zhang Liangxiong was also sent off for four fouls, and Liang Yunming returned with an illness. Fortunately, there was not much time left. After Kate scored a goal, the gong rang loudly, and Chizhi barely won with 33 to 30.

### The Collins Football Team's Visit to China: Shen Silian Discusses Negotiations

No Formal Invitation, Only Ordinary Pleasantries; Board Meeting to Discuss Upon Receiving Concrete Confirmation

Since Reuters reported that the strong British amateur football team, the Collins team, is scheduled to send twenty first-class players to China for a tour this winter, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Shen Silian, the general secretary of the National Sports Association, yesterday to confirm this news. According to Mr. Shen, during his participation in the World Games in Berlin, he was introduced to Miss Smith, the daughter of the general secretary of the association. However, there was no formal invitation, only ordinary pleasantries. Subsequently, he had a long-distance phone call between Berlin and England with Mr. Smith himself, making ordinary pleasantries, hoping they could form a team to visit China. As for the rumors that there was a promise of a 1,500-pound guarantee, it is not accurate. According to foreign news reports, the association has not yet received a formal notification by letter or telegram from the association. Now, upon receiving concrete news, a board meeting will be convened to decide on all reception arrangements. As for the speculation that Hong Kong may have independently contacted them, according to my observation, it is also not accurate, because in terms of financial and material resources, all specific measures will not be allowed and there is nothing to talk about now.

### "Evening Glow Cup" Table Tennis Finals: Boyang Wins the Championship

Boyang wins Aile 3-2

Aile wins Tongle Tongle forfeits

Boyang wins Tongle Tongle forfeits

The battle between Boyang and Aile yesterday was thrilling and full of highlights. In the first group, Depei played against Cai Guancheng. The two were mortal enemies and had met several times in important competitions. Lang took the lead in the first two games. From the third game, a fierce battle ensued, and Cai won. In the last two games, Lang lost due to anxiety and confusion, and Cai reversed the defeat with a score of 3-2. In the second group, Ge Ying also lost to Zhou Runtang despite being in an absolute advantage. Since Boyang had lost two consecutive battles, Yao Guanfan came out in the third group, cautious, and played against Cai Jinhe. Cai Jinhe fought bravely against the strong team in front of him, and fell into a bitter battle, 3-2, Yao Guanfan finally won, and won a city for Boyang. At the beginning of the fourth group, Chen Youda faced Cai Guanwang, and everyone expected Cai to win. After winning the first game, Chen suddenly burst into brilliance, drawing and cutting freely, winning three consecutive games. Chen Youda's contribution to Boyang's victory is undeniable. At the end of the group, Boyang's general Zou Guofan played against Peng Guisheng. Peng knew he was no match and lost in three straight battles. As a result of the competition, Boyang reversed the defeat with a score of 3 to 2. "Boyang and Tongle" and "Aile and Tongle" were judged to be won by Boyang and Aile due to Tongle's abstention.

After the victory or defeat was judged, Mr. Wang Zhongheng, the captain of the Evening Glow Team, awarded the prizes on the spot. The champion Boyang team received a large silver cup of the "Evening Glow Cup" from Yao Guanfan, and the Aile team also received a silver cup of the runner-up. Finally, Ma Tingliang and Zou Guofan were invited to perform. Mr. Ma's Drunken Eight Immortals shot repeatedly made the audience laugh, and dispersed with great interest until the clock struck eleven.

Since Tongle abandoned the game twice, its qualifications were cancelled according to the rules, and the third place was promoted by the fourth Evening Glow Team. The entire competition ended. The results of Boyang vs. Aile are as follows:

### Zhang Jiandong, Jian Tailiang, and Wang Ruifu, Who Organized "Liudong News," Were Expelled and Returned to China, Arriving in Shanghai Yesterday

The Embassy in Japan is Preparing to Protest; Zhang and Others Plan to Resume Publication in Shanghai or Beijing

Zhang Jiandong, the general manager of "Liudong News," Jian Tailiang, the editor-in-chief, and Wang Ruifu, the editor, who were expelled from the country by the Japanese authorities for organizing Liudong News, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese mail ship Aso Maru at 1:30 pm yesterday. Students studying in Japan in Shanghai and relatives and friends of the three gentlemen went to the Huishan Wharf to welcome them. They were immediately invited by students studying in Japan to a banquet at Daguanlou on Fuzhou Road. The three gentlemen are currently staying at a friend's place and plan to report to the government in Beijing within days. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency specifically interviewed the three gentlemen yesterday and reported the detailed situation. The details are as follows:

Motivation for Starting the Publication

We realized that there were seven or eight thousand students studying in Japan and forty or fifty thousand overseas Chinese. Japanese newspapers are controlled by the government and lack truthful reports. In particular, there are many inaccurate records about our country's news. In order to report accurate news about the motherland to overseas Chinese students and introduce the political situation in Japan to the country, and to communicate Chinese and Japanese culture, we raised funds to start the weekly "Liudong News" in Tokyo. It was founded on June 12th of the year before last. The purpose is pure and there is no political connection or party background. At that time, it was approved by various institutions such as the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Chinese Embassy in Japan's Student Supervision Department. Japanese newspapers also unanimously sympathized with and praised it as the only forum for Chinese people studying in Japan. At first, there were few publications on politics and diplomacy. Later, I felt that if political and diplomatic news were ignored, it would be contrary to the significance of starting the publication. Gradually, the records of political and diplomatic news were increased. After the fourth issue, the Japanese authorities immediately took an attitude of intervention. They were often checked and monitored very strictly. Support Until the ninth issue, in order to consolidate the foundation, we formally paid the deposit in accordance with the Japanese publishing law and filed it with the Japanese government. At the same time, we presented it to the Central Propaganda Department of our country for registration and issued a registration certificate.

The Process of Being Arrested

Since then, the Japanese authorities have still been nitpicking, and often warned or confiscated small problems such as words or titles. According to statistics, as of the 59th issue, the number of confiscated issues was more than ten times. In mid-December of last year, we were told by Japanese friends that this time the Japanese parliament was meeting with young soldiers of the Japanese military, intending to exert further pressure to promote its power. The department was particularly dissatisfied with Liudong News. Sure enough, not only were the publications suspended, but the lives of the organizers were also in danger. Therefore, the three of us once returned to China. On the 13th of this month, we returned to Tokyo. At 9:00 the next morning, the Asia Department of the Foreign Affairs Division of the Metropolitan Police Department sent detectives to the news agency to search. All documents were taken away. In addition, Li Zhongping, Lü Kuiwen, and Jian Bocun were also arrested and taken to the Kanda Nishikicho Police Station. Chinese officials and civilians in Tokyo were outraged when they heard the news. On the same day, the Chinese Embassy in Japan sent Secretary Shen Ti, and the Student Supervision Department in Japan sent Chief of General Affairs Section Jiang Junhui to the Metropolitan Police Department to make representations, demanding immediate extradition. Xu Ambassador sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Central Propaganda Department, and Director Chen Cip sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education, reporting separately for instructions. Students studying in Japan also went to the police station to express their condolences and tried to rescue them.

Expelled Back to China

However, various rescues and representations were ultimately ineffective. Repeated interrogations were all forcing them to admit to propaganda against Japan and exposing the secrets of the Japanese military, etc. Because we have a large number of domestic newspapers and magazines, which are displayed in the company for overseas Chinese to read and to instill the domestic situation, this is especially disliked by the Japanese authorities. Once, police officer Watanabe firmly ordered us to point out what kind of publications have what background, and what kind of publications are communist. We told them that all the publications we display have been registered and approved by the government of our country, and there are no reactionary publications. However, he forcibly pointed out that Saturday, Independent Review, Hong Kong Circulation Daily and other kinds of communist publications. Except for Li Zhongping, Lü Kuiwen, and Jian Bocun, who were released on bail by Chief Jiang of the Student Supervision Department in Japan, the three of us were imprisoned for more than ten days until the 15th of this month, when we were sentenced to anti-Japanese communist crimes and ordered to be expelled back to China. We were escorted from Tokyo to Kobe and boarded a ship back to China. Because it was a cargo ship, it had to stop at various ports. After passing through Moji, Osaka and other places along the way, we were taken to the local police station for interrogation, which was delayed until today (that is, yesterday) before we were able to arrive in Shanghai.

Will File a Protest

Although we have suffered a lot, we are not discouraged. After returning to China, we plan to prepare for resuming publication in Shanghai or Beijing, and change it to two large sheets a day. All plans are being discussed. The Chinese Embassy in Japan attaches great importance to the Japanese authorities' unreasonable order to suspend the publication of Liudong News and expel us back to China. It has specially convened a meeting of embassy affairs and is now conducting a special investigation of everything and asking the government for instructions. It is reported that it will formally lodge a protest with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Moreover, overseas Chinese in Japan have recently been repeatedly expelled back to China. Yesterday, there were also three people, Chen Jinxing, a noodle vendor, Xu Xiexing, a worker, and Zeng Yejin, a barber, who arrived in Shanghai on the Aso Maru.

### The Municipal Volunteer Education Staff's Winter Vacation Training Closed

Section Chief Jiang Delivered a Training Speech on Behalf of Director Pan; Twenty More Schools Will Be Added in This Short Term

The winter vacation training class for voluntary education staff sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been completed for 17 days since it started on the 15th of this month. The closing ceremony was held at the auditorium of the Municipal Shangwen Elementary School at 1:30 pm yesterday. More than 100 people, including Section Chief Jiang and lecturers Li Wanyu, Xue Wei, Qian Fugong, and trainees Ling Hongji, Gu Bingquan, and Yang Ding, attended. After the procedural ceremony, Section Chief Jiang delivered a training speech on behalf of Director Pan, roughly saying that the training class for volunteer education staff in this city will be closed today. Although the training period is short, its significance is quite important. The so-called compulsory education is the obligation that the country should fulfill to make people love the minimum education, and it must force people to go to school, so it is also compulsory education. However, due to the economic environment of China, it can only run short-term elementary schools to educate people for one year. Since the teaching time is short, if you want to improve the teaching effectiveness, you really rely on all the staff who are responsible for the volunteer education work. You should recognize this point and overcome any difficulties, cheer up and do it practically. If you feel that the interest is not suitable, or the work is not good, you would rather not do it, and you must not perfunctorily. I hope everyone will work hard, etc. The ceremony was then completed. According to the statistics, there are a total of 145 graduates in this class. In the last semester, there were 25 short-term elementary schools, 108 short-term elementary school classes, and 29 grades in the two-part system in the city. In this term, in addition to the 29 grades in the two-part system, 20 short-term elementary schools will be added, totaling 45 schools, and the short-term elementary school classes will be reduced to 83 classes. The students will be assigned work within days, etc.

### The 15th Anniversary Memorial Ceremony for the Four Boy Scout Martyrs Was Held Yesterday

Five Groups, Including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Presided Over the Ceremony at the Clothing and Hat Tomb of the Four Martyrs in Jiangwan

During the 'January 28' Shanghai War, the members of the 50th Boy Scout Group (Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout) Luo Yunxiang, Ying Wenda, Mao Zhengxiang, and Bao Zhengwu, etc., served in the war zone and died. Yesterday was the fifth anniversary. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Council, the 50th Boy Scout Group, representatives of the families of the four martyrs, the Red Cross Society, etc., specially held an expanded memorial ceremony at 9 am at the clothing and hat tomb of the four martyrs in the Shanghai Public Cemetery in Jiangwan. The details are as follows:

The representatives who attended included Shen Yu from the China Boy Scout Council, Pang Jingzhou from the Red Cross Society, Xu Guozhi from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Boy Scout War Zone Service Circle, three members from the 213th Boy Scout Group, five members from the 172nd Group, three members from the 176th Group, and representatives of the families of the four martyrs. Qin Huan, Wang Xueran, Li Fei, Zhou Caiying and other people from all walks of life, more than 200 people, were picked up and dropped off by special cars sent by the group.

▲Chairman's Report After the ceremony, Chairman Ye Chunnian reported that the four martyrs were all professional youths, who joined the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Regiment as members in their spare time. The group's business creed is "to train young people to serve the public". During the January 28 Shanghai War, the group believed that the opportunity to serve the country had arrived. Volunteer members, together with the Red Cross Society, set out to do battlefield rescue work. The brutal enemy, regardless of whether you are a combatant or a non-combatant, kills Chinese people when they see them. Although they are serving to save people, serving the suffering compatriots, and serving the wounded soldiers who resisted the enemy, they were caught by the enemy in the Hongkou District on January 31, and their bodies were destroyed. They must have died heroically and sacrificed for the country. Therefore, the main significance of our commemoration today is about two points. The first point is to stimulate the public and increase the mood of saving the country. The second point is to stimulate our young people, especially the Boy Scouts, to have more and more legacy of knowledge and continue to work hard on the ambitions of the martyrs, etc.

Economic Special Issue

### North China Cotton and the Japanese Textile Industry

— Deng Baoguang

㊀ Current State of the Japanese Textile Industry

The Japanese textile industry, since the establishment of a spinning factory in Kagoshima by Shimazu Nariakira in 1867, has only a short history of 69 years to date, but has already become a fundamental industry in Japan. Currently, there are 74 textile companies nationwide, with 256 textile factories. The total investment amounts to 700 million yuan, with 10 million spindles, over 376,000 looms, an annual cotton yarn production of over 3.5 million bales, and an annual cotton cloth export volume of over 2.7 billion square yards.

Remarks: (A) Company and factory units are in "units," spinning units are in "thousands," loom units are in "thousands," cotton yarn production units are in "thousands," and cotton cloth export volume units are in "ten thousand square yards."

(B) According to a survey by the Financial and Economic Times, the total capital of the existing 74 companies is 591 million yuan. Other small businesses and factories account for about 100 million yuan, bringing the total to no less than 700 million yuan.

(C) In 1935, out of a total of 277,000 looms, 241,000 were wide power looms, 79,900 were narrow power looms, and 55,500 were handlooms. Although the total number of looms has only increased by 12,000 since 1918, the number of wide looms has increased by 112,000. Narrow looms have decreased by 30,000, and handlooms have decreased by 70,000. This substantial change proves that the Japanese weaving industry, in the first sense, has shifted from an old-fashioned production method to a new production process, hence the annual decrease in handlooms. In the second sense, the development pattern has gradually shifted from targeting the domestic market to targeting the world market, hence the doubling of wide looms and the tenfold increase in cotton cloth exports. This also reflects the shrinking domestic cotton cloth market in Japan—due to weak purchasing power among the populace. Otherwise, narrow looms would not have decreased, as Japanese clothing materials are primarily made of narrow fabrics.

In 1934, out of a total industrial production value of 9.4 billion yuan in Japan, textile industrial products reached 1.5 billion yuan, accounting for 15.7% of the total. Out of 2,163,000 workers in all Japanese factories, 562,000 were engaged in the textile industry, accounting for 34.8%. In 1935, out of a total export trade value of 2.48 billion yuan in Japan, textile industrial products reached 590 million yuan, accounting for 23.6%.

Remarks: Production value and export trade value units are in "millions of yuan," and worker units are in "thousands of people."

In 1935, out of a world cotton cloth export volume of 5.88 billion square yards, Japan's exports reached 2.025 billion square yards, accounting for 48% of the total. This seized the cotton industry throne from the British Empire, took away the British Empire's exclusive market, and caused extremely profound Anglo-Japanese economic conflict.

Remarks: Items marked with "×" are estimated figures, with units in "millions of square yards."

The aforementioned three facts, as well as the three tables, prove that the Japanese textile industry firmly occupies the industrial throne in Japan's industrial economy, and also occupies the first throne in Japan's international trade, as well as in international cotton cloth export trade. In 1913—the pre-World War I era—the world cotton cloth market dominated by the British Empire has now been almost completely seized by Japan. Thinking quietly about this, one cannot help but feel a sense of past and present for the British people.

㊁ The Development Process of the Japanese Textile Industry

The Japanese textile industry, in its short history of 69 years, has seized the world cotton industry throne. The speed of its development is truly astonishing. Therefore, what are the reasons for its smooth development process? Why is its development speed so rapid? Naturally, there are backgrounds and reasons for this.

During the Meiji Restoration era, Japanese society, due to its political turmoil and socio-economic unrest, almost followed China's decline and became a semi-colony. At that time, the massive influx of Western goods plunged Japan's inherent domestic industry into an abyss from which it could not recover. Although the Restoration government made determined efforts to prevent foreign goods and vigorously promoted domestic goods, it was not possible to achieve results in a short time. By Meiji 10 (1877), the import value of cotton fabrics reached 89.6 million yuan, accounting for 36% of the total import value. Later, after the suppression of the Southwestern War, political unification gradually progressed, and industrial development also gradually yielded results. In Meiji 11 (1878), 25 districts nationwide were selected as cotton production areas. At the same time, the government invested funds to purchase 4,000 textile machines from England. In Meiji 12 (1879), large amounts of enterprise funds were released to purchase ten sets of 2,000 textile machines. In Meiji 13 and 14 (1880 and 1881), large amounts of funds were loaned out, interest-free for ten years, with repayments in installments. Government loans were provided for private purchases of textile machinery. After these multiple instances of direct assistance, by the end of Meiji 14 (1881), there were 17 textile factories, with 59,000 spindles. In Meiji 19 (1886), tariff protection policies were further implemented. In Meiji 27 (1894), cotton yarn export taxes were abolished. In Meiji 29 (1896), cotton import taxes were lifted. From then on, the foundation of Japan's early textile industry gradually became stable.

In Meiji 27 (1894), the Sino-Japanese War broke out, following Japan's economic development. This war was an epoch-making development for Japanese capitalism. The textile industry, from Meiji 27 to Meiji 31 (1894-1898), saw an increase in textile companies from 45 to 74, textile factories from 45 to 77, spinning spindles from 530,000 to 1,146,000, and cotton yarn production from 291,000 bales to 644,000 bales.

The god of war is the benefactor of Japanese capitalism. After the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War followed, and then the World War. In the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, Japan occupied the Korean and Chinese markets. After the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's cotton cloth imports to Korea and Northeast China reached 3.3 million yuan. After the Russo-Japanese War, they increased to 14 million yuan. In 1914, Japan's cotton yarn imports to China reached an unprecedented record of 570,000 bales. After the outbreak of World War I, Japan took the opportunity to seize the cotton cloth markets in India and the South Seas Islands, which were previously monopolized by Britain. In 1914, Japan's cotton textile export value was 43 million yuan. In 1919, it increased to over 350 million yuan. In just a few years of the European war, the increase rate reached five times.

In 1929, the Great Depression struck the world. Japan again took the opportunity to seize the Northeast and sought to use all its superior conditions to dominate the entire China. It further utilized the depreciation of its exchange rate, the poor labor conditions, and the "rationalization of industry" as powerful weapons to sweep across the world cotton cloth market.

Since Japan implemented an inflationary monetary policy again in 1931, its exchange rate has gradually depreciated, falling to 160% by now. As a result, the cotton cloth export value increased from 198 million yuan in 1932 to 590 million yuan in 1935.

Regarding the issue of poor labor conditions in Japan, at the 1933 International Labor Conference, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries raised the issue of "social dumping" in an attempt to improve the living conditions of the Japanese working class and suppress the rapid development of the Japanese textile industry. However, this practical problem cannot be solved by empty international conferences. If we compare the weekly wages earned by workers in various countries, the United States is 35 yuan, the United Kingdom is 18 yuan, Germany is 13 yuan, and Japan is only 5 yuan and 80 sen. As a result, the production costs of goods have the following ratios:

To put it plainly, if the production cost of Japanese cotton yarn is 100 yuan, then it would be 376 yuan in the United States, 238 yuan in the United Kingdom, and 192 yuan in Germany. This is a characteristic of Japan's low labor conditions, and it is also a major factor in the rapid progress of the Japanese textile industry during the global economic depression.

Regarding the relationship between industrial rationalization and the development of the Japanese textile industry, in October 1934, Mr. Kakumura Kozo, managing director of Fuji Spinning Company, gave a speech at the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce and Industry titled "The Superiority of the Japanese Cotton Industry," which was a typical report:

'As a result of rationalization, the production cost of our (Japanese) textile industry is very low. The number of workers has decreased. For 10,000 spindles, in June 1929, there were 61 male workers with an average daily wage of 1 yuan and 60 sen, and 218 female workers with an average daily wage of 1 yuan and 37 sen. By December 1933, the number of male workers had decreased to 27, with a daily wage of 1 yuan and 37 sen, and the number of female workers had decreased to 162, with a daily wage of 77 sen. The production cost, which accounted for half of the original cost of cotton textiles, has been reduced by 55%. This is the weapon of our (Japanese) textile industry's development.'

Remarks: Worker unit is "person," wage unit is "yuan."

In summary, there are five reasons for the rapid development of the Japanese textile industry: ㊀ Government's promotion policies; ㊁ Post-war stimulus and general industrial development; ㊂ Depreciation of the exchange rate; ㊃ Low labor conditions; ㊄ Industrial rationalization.

㊂ The Dependence of the Japanese Textile Industry on International Trade

Although the Japanese textile industry is developing at a high speed, there are many hidden worries about its future. Not only does Japan need to vigorously sell its textile products abroad, but 99% of the raw materials for textile products—cotton—also rely on foreign supply. Therefore, the Japanese textile industry's dependence on international trade is particularly significant.

In 1935, out of Japan's export trade value of 2.48 billion yuan, cotton textile exports reached 590 million yuan, accounting for 23% of the total. Out of the total import trade value of 2.34 billion yuan, cotton imports reached 714 million yuan, accounting for 30% of the total.

Cotton textiles in export trade and cotton in import trade both occupy the most important positions. This certainly proves the particularly significant dependence of the Japanese textile industry on international trade. At the same time, observing the Japanese textile industry itself also reveals a special tendency to rely heavily on external sources. In 1935, out of Japan's total cotton textile production value of 876 million yuan, cotton textile exports reached 590 million yuan, accounting for 68% of the total production value. In 1935, out of Japan's total cotton consumption of 12,520,000 dan, only 167,000 dan were produced domestically in Korea, while 12,353,000 dan were imported from abroad. As a result, the total production value of Japanese cotton textiles was 876 million yuan, while the cotton import value was 714 million yuan. To put it more simply, only 32% of the cotton textile production value is consumed domestically in Japan, while 68% is exported to foreign countries. Only 1.4% of Japan's cotton consumption is produced domestically, while 98.6% is imported from abroad.

Remarks: Cotton textile production and consumption relationship unit is "millions of yuan," cotton consumption and supply relationship unit is "thousands of dan."

I will not discuss the issue of cotton textile production and consumption further here, but will now elaborate on Japan's cotton supply problem.

In 1935, out of Japan's cotton import volume of 12,283,000 dan, worth 714 million yuan, 5,758,000 dan, worth 372 million yuan, were imported from the United States. 5,211,000 dan, worth 259 million yuan, were imported from India. 537,000 dan, worth 42 million yuan, were imported from Egypt. 427,000 dan, worth 20 million yuan, were imported from China. Other cottons, such as African cotton, Nangong cotton, Korean cotton, Brazilian cotton, Peruvian cotton, Turkish cotton, and Persian cotton, accounted for approximately 350,000 dan, worth over 19.5 million yuan. This means that 47% of the cotton used by Japan is supplied by the United States, 43% is supplied by India, and the remainder is supplemented by Chinese and Egyptian cotton.

Remarks: Quantity unit is "dan," and value unit is "thousands of workers."

The Japanese textile industry is controlled by the prosperity and decline of international trade, and Japanese international trade is controlled by the premise of world peace. Once international changes occur, Japanese international trade is the first to be threatened, and the Japanese textile industry will immediately be shaken. Therefore, since the 1929 global economic crisis, the theory of Japanese cotton national policy and market security has been loudly advocated, and it is even more intense today.

As I said earlier, 47% of the cotton used by Japan must be supplied by the United States, 43% must be supplied by India, and the remainder is supplemented by Chinese and Egyptian cotton. However, at this stage, Japan-US relations are very dangerous, Anglo-Japanese conflicts are deepening day by day, and India is rejecting Japanese goods. Japan's intention is to not buy Indian cotton. The future of cotton sources is also very dangerous. Therefore, Japan's dependence on the United States and India for cotton is a major disadvantage in the development of Japanese capitalism. Especially since the September 18th Incident, the military industry has developed rapidly, and cotton is a raw material for manufacturing gunpowder, making its demand even more urgent than that of steel. As a result, the Japanese government and public are loudly advocating the cotton national policy issue.

Everyone knows that Britain's control of India and Egypt is because they have large cotton yields, which greatly help Lancashire's cotton production and reduce its dependence on American cotton. In peacetime, it can balance the needs of domestic industries, and in wartime, it can be used as a raw material for military industries. During the European war, Germany used force to seize foreign raw cotton and discovered artificial cotton. To this day, it pays the same close attention to the encouragement of cotton production and the plundering of raw cotton production areas. Italy's seizure of Abyssinia is also because its land and climate are suitable for cotton planting. After Japan occupied Korea, it promoted cotton planting, but its output could only supply 1.4%. After occupying Manchuria, it also implemented a cotton planting plan, but it failed due to climate and geological conditions. China is the third largest cotton producing country in the world, with a climate and soil suitable for cotton planting, and China-Japan's geographical and economic relations are so close and intimate, and the North China provinces are the best cotton producing areas in China. Therefore, in recent years, Japan's cotton planting plan has shifted to North China.

Japan wants to implement a cotton national policy plan and seize cotton supply areas. In peacetime, it can balance the needs of domestic industries, and in wartime, it can be used as a raw material for military supplies. In order to reduce its dependence on American and Indian cotton and the threats from Britain and the United States, it is urgently seeking to seize "North China cotton areas" and create a "Japanese-controlled East India."

㊃ Production Status of North China Cotton

The largest cotton producing country in the world is the United States, followed by India, with China ranking third. If China's cotton can fully utilize its talent and land, then future production increases may surpass the United States and India.

China's cotton production is estimated to be 15 million dan this year, a bumper harvest. According to the statistics report of the China Cotton Industry Association for the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the harvest was 9.8 million dan, and it was 13.4 million dan in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). According to the statistics of various years, China's cotton production will be between 10 million dan and 15 million dan.

China's cotton producing areas are generally divided into two major cotton regions: the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze River basin. The cotton producing provinces in the Yangtze River basin are Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. The Yellow River basin includes Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi. What we want to discuss now is limited to the Yellow River basin, because of its geographical relationship, it belongs to the so-called North China region.

North China has high terrain and the soil is mostly a mixture of alluvial soil and loess, which is most suitable for planting cotton. The soil along the Yellow River contains the most lime, making it the best area for cultivating American cotton. Because of its excellent natural conditions, the productivity of North China cotton fields cannot be matched by any province in the Yangtze River basin. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu in North China is 30 jin in Hebei, and 26 jin in Shanxi and Shandong, which is 16% more than the national average yield per mu over the years. If converted to hectares, the yield of ginned cotton per mu is over 200 pounds, which cannot be matched by American or Indian cotton.

Because North China has excellent cotton planting conditions, North China cotton has long been the largest agricultural product in the North China provinces, and it also holds an important position in the proportion of cotton production in China. According to the statistics of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), Hebei's cotton production was 1 million dan. It increased to 3.385 million dan in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), and decreased to 2.586 million dan in the 24th year of the Republic (1935). Shandong Province decreased from 2.59 million dan to 1.59 million dan. Shanxi increased from 97,000 dan to 717,000 dan. Henan increased from 719,000 dan to 1.22 million dan. Shaanxi increased from 413,000 dan to 1.198 million dan. The area of cotton cultivated land also increased year by year, especially in Shanxi and Shaanxi. Only Shandong was affected by the Yellow River flooding and could not be cultivated smoothly, so the cotton cultivated area and cotton production decreased year by year, but the overall calculation for North China still increased year by year.

Although the annual production of North China cotton is only 8.8 million dan (in the 23rd year of the Republic, 1934), its future is promising. According to Mr. Li Shubo, a North China inspector of the China Cotton Control Committee, North China cotton production can be doubled within five years, that is, the textile raw materials needed nationwide can reach the level of self-sufficiency. After five years, China's cotton production can be exported and occupy an important position in international trade. As long as the central and provincial governments can seek irrigation methods for farmers in terms of water conservancy, this plan can be easily successful. (See the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, January 9th of the 14th year of the Republic, 1925, for a Beijing communication). According to the survey by Mr. Ohara Minoru in the book "North China Rural Relief and Cotton Industry Improvement" published by the Research Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if the cotton planting area in Hebei and Shandong provinces is expanded to 43 million mu in 20 years, the cotton production will reach 1.5 billion jin, which has great significance for the Japanese textile industry.

In terms of the quality of North China cotton, it is also above the Yangtze River basin. Nanyuhe cotton in Hebei Province can spin cotton yarn of 16 counts or more. Xihe cotton is elastic and suitable for blending wool and cotton, and it can be used to manufacture gunpowder as a raw material in modern military industry. Northeast cotton has thin and long fibers, making it suitable for spinning medium count yarn. Lingbao cotton in Henan is the best quality cotton in the country, and it can be used as a raw material for 32 counts or more, comparable to American cotton. Shandong cotton is most suitable for weaving, and the annual American seed cotton can replace American cotton. Only Shanxi cotton is of inferior quality. In recent years, cotton inspection bureaus have been established in various places to crack down on bad habits such as small vendors mixing water and impurities, which is of great significance for the future improvement of China's cotton industry. In short, if North China cotton can make use of its excellent natural environment, it will surely become the most beautiful quality cotton in the future. Whether as a textile raw material or as a raw material for military industry and other industries, the value of North China cotton will become increasingly precious in the future.

㊄ Conclusion

Japan is a country that needs cotton. The future of North China cotton is very promising in all aspects, and geographically speaking, it is only separated by a sea, which is a five-to-one ratio in terms of time and freight compared to the long voyage from the United States and India. In terms of international relations, it is more reliable to rely on North China than to rely on the United States and India. Therefore, for the sake of obtaining textile raw materials for the Japanese textile industry and for the sake of obtaining raw materials for manufacturing military supplies for the Japanese military industry, the relationship between North China cotton and Japan is gradually becoming more and more serious.

What kind of plan does Japan use to seize North China cotton? Judging from Japan's consistent policy of attacking North China in recent years, it can be roughly divided into three steps: ㊀ Actively promote cotton planting, improve cotton seeds, and improve quality; ㊁ Increase the number of cotton sales networks so that a large amount of cotton can be concentrated in the hands of the Japanese; ㊂ Directly use military policies and political means to seize cotton producing areas.

The first type, in the first quarter of 1934, Japan began to implement the cotton planting plan in various counties of the North China war zone, deciding to manage 3,000 hectares of cultivated land with a capital of 1 million yuan by the Osaka Industrial Company of Japan. Last year, the company established a cotton planting committee, and also established branches in more than ten counties including Lulong, Fengrun, Zunhua, Qian'an, and Miyun. At the same time, the Shandong Cotton Improvement Association was organized in Shandong, which requested the Shandong Provincial Government to allow it to plant cotton in Zhangdian and more than ten neighboring counties. Another example is the North China cotton improvement and increase planting plan promoted by the recent Xingzhong Company. In short, this only represents Japan's preliminary posture of advancing into North China cotton.

The second type, five of the Tianjin Seven Day Yarn Factory have been completely taken over by the Japanese, and other factories are also under their control. Recently, major Japanese textile companies such as Kanebo and Dai Nippon Boseki are all staring at North China with greedy eyes. Companies such as Tomen, Naigai, Daikang, and Shanghai have already spread out their sales networks in North China, waiting in battle, in order to wipe out everything in one fell swoop. At the same time, they plan to build the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway to seek transportation convenience, and plan to set up cotton exchanges in Tianjin and Qingdao in order to concentrate North China cotton and quickly send it to Japan.

The third type, since the Tanggu Truce Agreement and the North China Incident, to the recent so-called North China problem, using its superior political and military functions, it has tried to plunder North China in one fell swoop. The recent relaxed and tightened slow-moving problem is also a military plan to surround North China.

In short, Japan's plan to plunder the North China cotton area has become more and more serious following the increasing tension in international relations. Can the people being plundered sit idly by and wait for death?

### A Study of the Nanyang Cotton Fabric Market

— Gao Shiheng

1.  Distribution of the Nanyang Cotton Fabric Market

Nanyang is divided into five major regions: the American-owned Philippines, the Dutch-owned East Indies, the British-owned Malaya, the French-owned Annam, and Siam. Except for Siam, which is an independent country, the others are all colonies of white people, each with its own position and background, using different methods to handle its import trade. The purpose is the same: to serve as the outlet for the industrial products of the mother country. Cotton fabric ranks first in imports in all regions. Except for the Philippines and Siam, which can be freely imported, British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies have restrictions. French Annam uses high tariffs to protect the advantage of genuine French products, and imports from other countries are very few. According to the total Nanyang cotton fabric imports in 1935, converted to national currency, it was 184,633,750 yuan. Japanese goods accounted for the largest proportion, reaching 100 million yuan, while Chinese goods accounted for the smallest proportion, only slightly less than 3 million yuan. According to 1934 statistics, China's imports to Malaya were only 2,053,684 yuan in national currency, while Japan's imports were 5,142,028 yuan. In Siam, China's imports were 30,038 yuan, while Japan's imports were 10,593,652 yuan. Japanese goods win with low prices, and European and American goods are often more than twice as expensive. However, the price of Chinese goods is between the two, so only more expensive Chinese goods can compete with Japanese goods.

2.  The Influence of Overseas Chinese in the Cotton Fabric Industry

The population of Nanyang is 124 million, and overseas Chinese account for 6.5 million. For example, Singapore has a total population of 540,000, and overseas Chinese account for 400,000. Bangkok has a population of 500,000, and overseas Chinese account for more than 300,000. In Saigon, with a population of over 300,000, there are 120,000 overseas Chinese. Everywhere you go, you can see the national flag and overseas Chinese businesses. They occupy a very large influence in the cotton fabric market. Only the importers in the Dutch East Indies are mostly controlled by Europeans. The wholesale and retail trade in other regions are all operated by overseas Chinese. In recent years, because domestic goods have not been promoted in Nanyang, these people have become promoters of Japanese goods. The Japanese not only send representatives to Nanyang to conduct inspections and investigations, but also their industry operates as a whole, backed by the government and the entire domestic industrial and commercial sector. They use the low freight rates of their domestic shipping companies and the low-interest drafts of national banks to compete in Nanyang, and they are invincible. Since overseas Chinese have no domestic goods to operate, and cannot operate European and American goods, they can only focus on Japanese goods. In a few years, domestic cotton fabrics will inevitably be on the verge of extinction in Nanyang, which is beyond doubt. It is hoped that the domestic cotton textile industry will rise up and catch up quickly to reverse this decline.

3.  American-owned Philippines

The Philippine Islands have a population of 13 million, most of whom are farmers, with a prosperous and clean life. The import of cotton fabric ranks first among imports. From 1917 to 1922, the average annual import of cotton fabric was more than 44 million Philippine pesos. In 1929, it reached 54 million. In 1933, it was hit by the global depression and fell to 26 million. In the past two years, it has gradually recovered and is now over 32 million Philippine pesos. The United States, as the suzerain state, has the most favorable treatment of duty-free imports, but in fact American goods cannot compete with Japanese goods. As shown in the first table, in 1931, American goods imported more than 16 million, while Japan only imported 10 million. However, by 1935, Japan had advanced and was on par with the United States, both at 13 million. According to recent observations, Japan will surpass the United States in the final statistics for 1936. We can further analyze the trend of the market from the import quantity in the second table. In 1935, American goods were imported at a cost of more than 13 million, importing more than 35 million square meters. Japanese goods were imported at the same cost, importing 72 million square meters. The value of one yard of American goods can be exchanged for two yards of Japanese goods. It is inevitable that American goods will be eliminated and Japanese goods will rise. The import of Chinese goods to the Philippines accounts for a very small proportion in both quantity and value. Most of them are 12-pound and 16-pound coarse cloths. Moreover, except for a few shipments from Wing On and Shenxin, most of them are still exported by Japanese spinning mills, which cannot be said to be Chinese goods.

4.  Dutch East Indies

The Dutch East Indies is the largest market in Nanyang, with a population of 60 million and strong purchasing power. Before the European War, 19/20 of cotton fabric imports came from the Netherlands. During the war, Japanese goods took the opportunity to enter the market and became increasingly active. The Dutch East Indies government promulgated restrictions on imports on February 20, 1934 to protect the import of Dutch goods. This restriction is based on the import quantity from 1929 to 1933 as the standard. For example, 5 million yards of dyed twill fabric within 26 inches can be imported each year, of which 2 million yards must be imported from the Netherlands, 1 million yards must be imported from the United Kingdom, and the other million yards can be imported from other countries. Japanese goods are favored by importers in the Dutch East Indies because of their low prices. If it were not for government restrictions, Dutch and British goods would have no room for survival. The allowable quantity of Chinese cotton fabric imports is included in other countries and is the only strong competitor to Japanese goods. According to the statistical figures in the third table, it can be seen that in 1935, cotton fabric imported from Japan accounted for 84% of the total Dutch East Indies, imports from the Netherlands accounted for only 12%, and imports from China accounted for only 0.47%. The types of cotton fabric imported into the Dutch East Indies are mainly bleached cloth, followed by dyed cloth, and then gray cloth. Japanese goods are imported quite evenly. Except for gray cloth and printed cloth, Chinese goods are insignificant, which is shameful.

The Situation Suddenly Becomes Clear and the Bond Market Soars

—February Futures Jumped Two Yuan—

The bond market last week was a period of alternating between January and March futures. The market situation suddenly changed drastically. This was because the situation changed from chaos to clarity. People's hearts were extremely upright. The prosperity of buying on the surface was rare. Those who went long against the short were even more enthusiastic. With the market price in a state of sharpness, it suddenly turned into a soaring situation. The Class C and B bonds of the January period all frequently hit new highs. The ex-dividend market of the February and March periods also rose step by step. The firmness of the market showed no sign of fatigue. However, because the Spring Festival holiday started from the 6th, there were only five trading days in the bond market this week, so it is expected that there will be no major changes. The process of the whole week: Monday was the last day of the January period. Because major players were striving to buy, the market suddenly rose sharply. Class A and others all rose sharply by two or three corners to one yuan and one corner. Only February futures were traded on Saturday. There was still a surplus for short sellers to roll over, and the trend showed a slight decline in silence. March futures began to be traded on Wednesday. Major players such as No. 16, 77, and 11 all vigorously purchased, and the market price slowly rose by about half a yuan. The market was closed on Thursday due to the handling of the January period settlement. On Friday, the Shaanxi situation suddenly became clear, and people's hearts became more and more boiling. The buying market became more and more enthusiastic. Unified bonds all rose sharply by four corners and a half and seven or eight corners to one yuan and three corners. On Saturday, because some bulls gradually sold off, the market price turned to a decline. However, major players still bought more, and the trend was still very firm. The result of the whole week was that the January period rose by two or three corners to one yuan and one corner. The February period soared by two yuan and six corners to two yuan and five points. The total number of transactions for the newly opened March period was 41,805,000 yuan. The comparison of its rise and fall is listed on the left (unit completion transaction unit hundred yuan)

### Sugar Market

Estimated Production of New Chao Sugar This Season

Approximately 750,000 bags, a decrease of slightly less than 15% compared to the previous season. Domestic green and red sugar has always been crowned by Chaozhou goods. According to a letter from You Tou yesterday, the total number of new Chao sugar this season is approximately 750,000 bags, a decrease of slightly less than 15% compared to the previous season. It is heard that the Yangyang Factory still needs to collect raw materials and convert them to Five Sheep White Sugar. If so, the green and red sugar may need to be reduced further, which is also expected. Furthermore, since the registration of new sugar, a total of more than 150,000 bags have been exported. There are still more than 40,000 bags in You Tou, and about 500,000 bags in various production areas in Chaozhou. The daily transport to You Tou is about 2,000 to 3,000 bags of green sugar and more than 1,000 bags of red sugar, so the market is relatively stable. Recently, various gangs have been collecting goods, and most cargo owners are unwilling to sell immediately at the market price, so it has recovered after fatigue.

### Struggle

— (Xiaoting)

Don't think that the end of the struggle is success, sometimes there are fortresses of failure waiting for you ahead.

The failure of struggle is the experience of the life process, and the success of struggle is the achievement of suffering in life.

The cowardly have no ambition to struggle, the mediocre have no strength to struggle. The fools who struggle are smart and brave people. Only smart and brave people know the value of struggle.

The more people are squeezed by the environment, the faster the road of struggle runs. The more people fail in affairs, the more confident they are in their struggle.

A country without a fighting spirit will perish, and a person without a fighting spirit will fail.

Places of feasting and dancing are the lairs of eroding struggle, and places of extravagant indulgence are the deep pits of sinking struggle.

The reality of struggle is to endure hardship and work hard. People who are accustomed to enjoying themselves cannot talk about being able to struggle and jump in the circle of struggle.

### Reed Catkin Shoes in Pudong

— Jiang Junqing

The biting north wind roars, and it is again the time when reed catkin shoes are popular in the rural areas of Pudong: - they are a wonderful product for the poor to keep out the cold, made of reed catkins and rice straw; high tops, thick soles: buy them, trim the edges with cloth, and line them with cotton wool inside. When worn on the feet, they are warm and comfortable, better than cotton shoes. The selling price is only one corner and two or three cents per pair, which is both economical and durable.

Moreover, wearing these reed catkin shoes allows air to flow smoothly without hindrance, unlike cotton shoes that wrap tightly and are airtight. People with athlete's foot are especially suitable for wearing them.

It is said that fast hand-makers can weave five or six pairs a day, or at least three or four pairs. If each pair is counted at one corner and two cents, weaving four pairs of shoes a day can maintain the livelihood of a family of four or five people! Therefore, the hardworking rural women of Pudong regard this as the only easy and profitable sideline business in winter!

### Crows in Xi'an

— Guang Ji

Since the Xi'an Incident on December 12 last year, this ancient capital city of Xi'an has become the focus of attention around the world. Now that General Chiang has escaped danger, the situation in Xi'an is still chaotic! This is naturally a matter of deep concern to the whole country.

Because of the political situation in Xi'an, I also thought of the most famous crows in Xi'an. Anyone who has been to Xi'an knows that there are more crows in Xi'an than anywhere else. When the red sun first rises, groups of crows fly out of dilapidated walls and temples, or ancient palaces, like a swarm of bees, with dark clouds dotted, forming a spectacular sight. Sometimes they form teams and fly to the nearby fields to find food; sometimes they land on the guard's head to find food. If you are walking on the street, they will walk in front of you, less than two or three feet away, and they will not be afraid at all. It is said that the beans in the grocery stores and the fish on the stalls: even the meat carried by the workers, if they are not careful, may be snatched away at any time. When the red sun sets and the twilight is vast, then far and near, they form groups and fly into the dilapidated temples and ancient palaces, fighting for lodging. The Qingzhen Pavilion in Xi'an is their main camp. For a while, flying, chirping, and deafening. If the foreign city of Venice can be regarded as a 'city of pigeons', then our Xi'an can also be named 'city of crows'.

But why are so many crows not caught? That is also for a reason, because the year when the crows come more, that year is bound to be a good harvest; if it is a famine year, then the crows will fly to other places. Therefore, the people of Xi'an believe that the arrival of crows is very auspicious, just like we southeastern people treat swallows, letting them build nests in the house, only loving them and having no time for anything else.

Now the Xi'an Incident has been basically resolved! We earnestly hope that the Shaanxi military authorities will quickly pull back from the brink of the precipice, so as not to have to take military action to quell the rebellion, turning Xi'an into a piece of gravel soil. In the future, when dusk comes, the crows will not be able to sing in the setting sun!

### Boat Girls of Ap Lei Chau, Hong Kong

— Chen Xiaokan

Boat girls exist everywhere. West Lake in Hangzhou and South Lake in Jiaxing are both places where boat girls are produced. But how can those places compare to the boat girls of Ap Lei Chau in Hong Kong?

Ap Lei Chau in Hong Kong is an island facing Hong Kong across the sea. The surrounding area is probably more than five li, and it can also be said to be a village. - Nine out of ten of the residents on the island live by catching fish. Living in this peaceful island country, they also have beautiful fragrant flowers to play with; they also have the chirping of birds to listen to, how comfortable and happy! That virgin-like charming: quiet beauty is really a secluded paradise, full of the intoxicating mood of 'Penglai Island scenery'.

The daughters of the fishermen all have the beauty of falling fish and sinking geese; with lively and fluent eloquence, they have to find a sideline business that is relatively easy to make money to supplement their family. But in this day and age, what stable career is left for the girls to do? They have no other way. In order to satisfy the desires of life, they have to brazenly engage in the business of 'boat girls'.

In the evening when the moon is bright and the breeze is clear, if you are in a good mood, go to the green grassland-like beach for a walk, and those boat girls dressed in gorgeous clothes will shout at you: 'Do you want to take a boat!' 'Do you want to stay overnight!' That voice, that mysterious and seductive voice, is as crisp and beautiful as a delicate oriole coming out of the valley; as moving and soul-stirring as a swallow skimming flowers! No matter how iron-willed you are, you will not be afraid to cross the boat and enter non-fantasy.

Once in the boat, you can talk to her about the boat price. Generally, everything is included in one night for only two or three yuan. The boat girl supports the oar; while also singing seductive ditties. The cool sea breeze blows in gusts, blowing away the fatigue of your whole body; blowing away the troubles in your heart!

In a flat boat, swaying in the heart of the sea as smooth as a mirror, embracing a beautiful woman with jade skin and jade bones like a fairy, who can not be restless and do romantic and elegant things! - Ah! The boat girls of Ap Lei Chau; the black night of Ap Lei Chau

### Near Yokohama Bridge

— Zhibu

Yokohama Bridge, this place name, must leave a very terrifying impression in your mind; this impression is probably the January 28th Incident of the past - the sound of gunfire seems to still exist, and the terrifying atmosphere is still shrouded.

The day before yesterday, I happened to walk past here. The stench of river mud was very uncomfortable. The river water was not very deep. I only saw a few fishermen. They seemed unable to express their suffering. They were working hard despite the cold to make a living and to eat. At that time, I stared blankly, and I couldn't help but feel touched;

"Are you cold?"

"How many fish have you caught?"

When I asked these two questions, it touched his mind even more. He looked at me and said nothing. This is no wonder. Alas! He can be regarded as a person outside the circle of happiness.

There are no big shops here, so what is it? Is it a flat house? No! On one side is a deserted meadow, and on the other side are several shops of friendly countries. 'Comrades' is the first one under the bridge. This name is quite interesting. In various places in our country, I dare to believe that I have not been to, because I can't find it, so I want to talk about it; the meaning of this name, in my careful thought, is probably when the soldiers stationed in our country meet, everyone goes to eat a little bit, so it is called "Comrades Canteen."

In addition to this canteen, there are also ×× dance halls, stationery stores, schools, hospitals, and barbershops, all run by people from friendly countries; but, what do we have here? There are drug stores, pawn shops, and a few small shops for exchanging silver coins, and nothing else can be named; the very famous Shenjianglou Restaurant in those years has long closed its doors. Then, if you have not been there, seeing my words above, you can imagine the situation of this place.

However, I hope that this place will not always be deserted. Don't we do business? Don't we serve as officials? Why? Why? Because... Is there a devil in this place? Of course we won't believe it, and even if there is, we won't be afraid.

### Puyi's Four Years of Puppet Life

— Yingdai

Since the 'September 18th Incident', Puyi was coerced into becoming the puppet emperor of 'Manchukuo'. Puyi's life in the past few years can be said to be very pitiful. Tourists from all countries who have been to the Northeast know that Puyi is the loneliest emperor in the world. In this world, other emperors live in marble palaces surrounded by courtiers, but Puyi, after losing the throne of Beiping in the Xinhai Revolution and after the 'September 18th Incident', wanted to relive the old dream of being an emperor, but now the place where he lives is an old house of the Tingwu Department. This house does not look like a palace, but more like a barn.

Since Puyi ascended the throne in Changchun, until now, in four years, he has only left Changchun three times: once to Shenyang to pay homage to the mausoleum and worship ancestors, once to Harbin to inspect the 'Manzhou Corps' of the army and navy, and the last time to Japan to meet the Japanese emperor. He is thirty-four years old this year, and his life is completely trapped in that broken house of the old Supervisory Department built with gray bricks and tiles, surrounded by barbed wire fences, and it is electrified. Each corner is surrounded by high walls to form a bunker, and guards are stationed to prevent accidents.

Usually, he not only lives in seclusion, but also refuses to easily meet with foreign guests who visit him. He once ruled over 450 million people in China, but now he is a puppet emperor in five small houses, which really makes him feel nostalgic for the past! His wife is thirty-one years old this year and lives with him. In addition, there are several veterans of the Qing Dynasty who follow him. Guests who walk into the old house of the Supervisory Department can only pay attention to a dragon chair made in Japan.

Puyi only takes tennis as a pastime in terms of sports, and sometimes listens to wireless radio. If he has more free time, he reads books. He loves to read the classics written by Confucius. In terms of life, all his habits are the same as those of the Chinese people. Puyi only has one wife. It is said that this wife is his original match. He originally had a concubine, but she announced her separation not long ago. In short, his puppet life can be said to be very pitiful!

### Replacing the Phoenix in Its Nest

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Episode 10 (Su Pa Sends Entangled Silk, Strange Interweaving; Yellow Flowers Face Wan Autumn, Letters Add Sorrow)

Menglan had this idea in her heart. When she went home from school, her face inevitably showed a kind of melancholy. She carried her schoolbag under her arm and her feet seemed to weigh dozens of pounds. She moved only a few inches at a time and slowly walked towards the back building. All parents are mindful of their children every step of the way. Menglan's situation was first seen by Mrs. Jiang after she entered the house. After he went upstairs, Xiaoju immediately followed him into the room, and asked with a smile: Miss, are you feeling unwell? Menglan put the schoolbag on the bookshelf and took out another book to read. After taking out a book, she weighed it twice in her hand, looking thoughtful, and then put it back on the bookshelf. She unfolded her schoolbag, took out a English book and put it on the table, but then muttered to herself: How can I have the heart to study. So she put the book back in her schoolbag and stared blankly at the shiny surface of the desk. Xiaoju asked him if she was sick, but she didn't answer, so she didn't dare to ask again. So she quietly stood aside with her hands hanging down, glancing at him from time to time. Menglan couldn't see any meaning in the shiny desk surface. So she raised her eyelids and looked out the window. The first thing that came into her eyes was of course the three tall willow trees. So she crossed her arms and leaned against the table, and looked at the three willow trees again. She thought of the several poems that Guoqi had sent, which said, "I would like to be a green-feathered bird, nesting in your window's willow, forgetting the peach and plum's dislike, peeping at your door all day long." These words of deep affection made people feel lingering and touching. According to what he said in his letter, he had once walked alone under these willow trees on a moonlit night, staring blankly at the windows upstairs for several hours, until the dew filled his clothes and he felt too cold to bear, before slowly going home. Judging from this incident alone, his poem about wanting to be a green-feathered bird was not a lie written casually, but a real thought for this infatuation. It had been two months since she had seen him. Presumably, his infatuation had developed into a heart disease, and this heart disease had developed into this melancholy look. If you want to relieve his melancholy look, the only way to cure the disease is to relieve his heart disease. If you follow his wish, he will be happy. But it is absolutely impossible to do so in one's own family and life. As she was thinking this way, she saw the decaying willow branches and leaves constantly swaying in mid-air, which could just express the melancholy meaning in the eyes of a sad person. (129)

Special Feature

### Civic Training

— Yafei

The second round of civic training has finally arrived, and those who received the notification slips had no choice but to gather in front of the district office to listen to the instructions. The instructor was Mr. Cheng, the former director of the People's Education Center, and the assistant instructor was Qin Azhong, a model citizen of the village. On a drizzly afternoon, many villagers wearing tattered clothes and tied with tattered dark blue aprons, who were usually so isolated that you could catch ghosts, walked one after another to the large parade ground that was usually deserted. They all shrank their heads, raised their eyebrows, and waved their sleeves, standing one by one against the wall, motionless like wooden stakes. However, each person's face was filled with a kind of unwillingness and fear.

The lawn was quiet and silent. Although the citizens waiting for training would sometimes whisper to each other, or a few young and lively lads would inevitably tell a few jokes, the voices were so low that no one dared to speak loudly. Only the blue sky, white sun, and red earth flag at the top of the flagpole at the corner of the field was flapping in the wind. Opposite, a new notice was suddenly added to the public reading board. This was probably for the start of the second round of civic training!

First, the deputy instructor pinned a triangular symbol on the chest of each citizen and lined them up according to height. He showed them a few 'stand at attention' and 'at ease' postures and then explained various forms and methods to them. However, the villagers were completely ignorant, so no matter how hard he tried to explain, they still had no idea.

Instructor Cheng walked out of the district office. He glanced at me and walked over to greet me. I said:

"It's really not easy to teach them. You must be very tired!" He smiled at me and didn't reply. He walked across the parade ground on his own, while the citizens were being instructed by Deputy Instructor Qin. Instructor Cheng saluted.

He said something to Qin Azhong that we didn't hear clearly. Then he spun around a few times in the middle of the field, the leather riding whip in his hand whistling slightly, looking quite heroic and dignified.

The citizens had not yet received their uniforms, and Deputy Instructor Qin was only wearing a gray cloth military uniform, but Instructor Cheng's brand-new yellow-green woolen military uniform looked very good. On his hat was pinned a blue sky and white sun, and on the two hard collar tabs, red base, a gold line was drawn, and on each side of the line were three triangular objects, shining brightly in people's eyes.

'Stand at attention... At ease...' Deputy Instructor Qin took two steps back, made a standing at attention posture himself, and then stretched his right foot outward and shouted straightly. Then the citizens followed his example. After shouting 'at ease', Deputy Instructor Qin then taught them how to 'dress to the right', how to 'look forward', how to 'count off', and how to 'call the roll'. After the roll call, Instructor Cheng tucked a leather riding whip under his arm, then took out a Parker fountain pen and opened the roster to call the roll. After the roll call, it was time for lectures again. However, because Instructor Cheng was from Suzhou, he spoke pure Suzhou dialect, which sounded like a Suzhou opera performance on stage, very clear and pleasant.

The rain gradually became denser, and it was mixed with flakes of snow, as beautiful as a crystal curtain decorated with plum blossoms. At the same time, Instructor Cheng, Deputy Instructor Qin, and the citizens' clothes and hats were covered with a layer of white snow, so Instructor Cheng dismissed them hastily.

The Shin Shi News Agency reports: This time, the United States has suffered a devastating flood, affecting a wide area, and countless lives have been lost. According to reports in various newspapers and telegrams, at the time of the severe winter, the affected victims are in dire need of relief. After hearing the news, our country's government and the public, based on the human obligation of mutual assistance and mutual aid, generally believe that disaster relief and helping neighbors is something that should be done between friendly nations. Just as during the past Yangtze River floods in our country, American people also generously donated to help with relief. Therefore, various charitable organizations in Shanghai, such as the Red Cross Society, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, and the Children's Welfare Association, etc., jointly requested Mr. Zha Xiangxi, chairman of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, to convene people from all walks of life to discuss ways to help with the American disaster relief. Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, a meeting was held at the Confucius Mansion on West Aihongsi Road. Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Wang Zhengting, Zhao Jinxiang, Zeng Rongfu, Zou Lin and other persons in charge of the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations, the Red Cross Society, and the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, etc., were present. It was decided that at noon today, at the Central Bank, the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations would be responsible for convening representatives from various charitable organizations such as the Red Cross Society, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, and the Chinese Children's Welfare Association to organize a disaster relief committee, hold an establishment meeting, and begin fundraising efforts. The detailed rules for fundraising, etc., will also be decided at the same time. It is reported that Chairman Jiang and his wife, who are now in Fenghua, are also very concerned about this American disaster. They telegraphed Shanghai to express their sympathy for the fundraising efforts of all sectors.

### Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications Stabilizing Subsidiary Currency Exchange Rates

Copper coins received will be exchanged at the legal price; the Central Mint is working day and night to mint subsidiary currency

Recently, the price of copper coins in Shanghai has soared. The exchange rate at various cigarette and exchange shops is more than 280 copper coins per national currency yuan, which is more than ten coins different from the Ministry's fixed standard of 300 coins. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has strictly ordered the money industry and currency exchange industry associations to find ways to crack down on this. As for the subsidiary currency market prices announced daily by the money industry market, although they are handled in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, the black market prices are still high. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Finance has sent a letter to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, ordering them to find ways to stabilize prices and ordering the Central Mint to rush to mint subsidiary currency to meet the needs of the market. Now, in addition to the Central Mint working day and night to rush to mint currency, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications believe that when necessary, they will exchange the subsidiary currency previously received at the legal price in order to stabilize the price of subsidiary currency. However, because the end of the lunar year is approaching, the soaring price of subsidiary currency is a phenomenon that occurs every year. It is expected that after the end of the lunar year, it will return to its original state.

The Currency Exchange Industry Association yesterday asked the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request the Central Bank to maintain the uniformity and stability of the currency system and the balance of supply and demand. The document stated: "We hereby submit a request to ask the Central Bank to collect as much subsidiary currency as possible and set up more exchange offices to balance supply and demand and benefit the people's livelihood. Since the currency system reform, the legal price of old subsidiary currency has been convenient for all people and benefited the whole country. The government has been determined to unify the currency policy and has actively destroyed old copper coins and sent them to the mint for melting. Now they are becoming increasingly scarce. However, new copper coins are difficult to exchange due to the sharp increase in demand, and the market is not circulating enough. Demand exceeds supply, resulting in a money shortage everywhere. The exchange rate of new copper coins is actually mixed with the old steel yuan, with only 2,900 wen (that is, 97 coins) exchanged per yuan. Although the Central Bank exchanges them, it is limited to its own bank. Thousands of people go to exchange them every day, but there is only one exchange window and only three hours a day. Each person is limited to exchanging ten yuan, and the crowded situation is unbearable. Therefore, there are often those who wait all day and return in disappointment. Shops have few employees, and time is money. Exchanging money is so difficult that they all regard it as a daunting task. Other factories and warehouses issue wages and need to issue several hundred yuan. If one person is limited to exchanging ten copper coins, how can this be done? They seek other ways, and the price is high and low, disrupting the currency system. Furthermore, the difficulty with changing nickel subsidiary currency and corner notes to the legal currency at central banks for shops that have a large income, like game parlors or separate shops, is similar to exchanging copper currency. Those who cannot wait end up selling on the market at a discounted price. If this continues, the unified new subsidiary currency will be in danger of following the same path as the old copper coins and destroying the decimal currency. The association believes that this matter is related to currency policy and hinders people's livelihood. It believes that in order to maintain the uniformity of the currency system, the Central Bank must improve procedures, facilitate citizens, and set up more exchange offices or entrust other banks to collect and exchange as much as possible in various districts. It is not enough to correct this monetary damage. Therefore, it is recommended to your association to request the Central Bank to adopt and implement it. This will be convenient for the public. Sincerely presented to the Shanghai Senior Chamber of Commerce."

### National Hospital to Begin Construction Soon

Zhang Xijun stationed in Shanghai to negotiate; Shanghai medical community raises 100,000

Central Committee member Jiao Yitang, who is also the head of the Central National Medical Center, advocated the improvement of inherent medicine and drugs. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine has been popular overseas, and eight overseas branches have been established. Jiao Yitang deserves most of the credit for the development of traditional Chinese medicine overseas. Previously, Jiao Yitang, seeing that practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine each focused on their own unique experiences and techniques, did not organize a hospital in order to concentrate research and promote innovation. He once consulted with key figures in the central government and famous medical figures at home and abroad to initiate the Capital National Hospital. The Central Political Committee has already approved a subsidy of 100,000 yuan for construction costs. Jiao Yitang believes that the hospital is a pioneering undertaking and should be a national model. The equipment must be meticulous and the funds are still insufficient. Therefore, on the 19th of last month, he accompanied the director of the center, Zhang Zhongyu (Xijun), to Shanghai to visit magnates in the Shanghai medical community and various celebrities, and held a banquet at the New Asia Hotel to announce his opinions on soliciting funds for the National Hospital. All sectors expressed their approval, and the details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, Mao Zijian, Ding Jiwan, Shen Zhongfang, Ding Zhongfang, Zhu Ziyun, Wang Zhongqi, Xia Libin, Xu Xiaopu, Zhu Hegao, Gu Weichuan, Chen Chuxiang, Gao Zhiwen, Cen Zhiliang, Dong Bowei, Xia Qizhen, Kong Zhusan, Ye Chunqiao, Zhu Binglu, Tong Baoqing, Ling Zhijia, Yu Yangzhou, Ling Shoupeng, etc., are responsible for carrying out the work. A meeting was held a few days ago to discuss the matter. Jiao Yitang specially sent Zhang Xijun as a representative to attend and deliver a speech, and ordered him to take the lead in contacting fundraising matters. It is heard that the Shanghai medical community has identified 100,000, and more than 50,000 has already been raised. Several tens of thousands can be remitted to Beijing first on the 10th of this month to facilitate construction immediately. It is also known that similar efforts are being carried out in Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Hangzhou, Pinghu and other places. The floor plan of the hospital has already been drafted, and bidding and construction will begin soon.

### Central Committee Members Remaining in Shanghai Prepare to Attend the Third Plenary Session

The Central News Agency reports: The Third Plenary Session will be held in Beijing on January 15. Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai will all attend at that time. This reporter recently met with Central Committee member Xue Dubi, who said that he would definitely go to Beijing to attend at that time. It is said that other Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai will also go. Regarding the proposals, because there is still time before the meeting, they have not yet been considered.

### Various Organizations Jointly Submit a Petition to the Municipal Government Requesting Negotiations on Water Rate Increases

And sent a letter to the Taxpayers' Association urging them to argue on reasonable grounds

The First Special District Citizens' Federation and other organizations jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday requesting negotiations to prevent the British Shanghai Waterworks Company from raising water rates, and sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association urging them to argue on reasonable grounds. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Petition requesting negotiations

The document presented to the Municipal Government stated: "We are submitting this petition regarding the fact that the British Shanghai Waterworks Company in the Public Concession is disregarding the difficult times and raising prices again. We earnestly request that you quickly negotiate to stop this in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. We have investigated that the water rates set by the Shanghai Waterworks in the Public Concession have been charged at 75% of the original price list since April 1935. Users have already felt unable to bear the burden. The company authorities, insatiable in their greed, have recently used the excuse of falling exchange rates and increased expenses to secretly request the approval of the Public Works Department to change to charging 80% of the price, actually raising prices, which is deeply shocking. Therefore, our association held a joint meeting on January 30 to discuss this. Everyone believed that at this time of market depression and suffering for the people's livelihoods, tap water is needed by the public. If prices are raised again, users will be unable to bear the exactions and will provoke incidents. This is of great importance to public tranquility and social order. Moreover, the company's dividends are excellent, and there are many redundant employees, which has long been criticized by all sectors. From 1933 to 1937, the company's expenses increased excessively, and the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department also explicitly rebuked this. If the company is indeed in financial difficulties, it is the result of unreasonable measures. If a solution is desired, the company should be conscious and recognize that tap water is a public utility and should try to reduce profits and save expenses as much as possible. This is the only reasonable way. It was decided that the price increase of the British Shanghai Waterworks Company should be firmly opposed. We hereby state the facts of the matter and earnestly request that you quickly negotiate to stop the price increase in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and maintain the market. This will be convenient for the public. We respectfully submit this petition."

Letter requesting efforts to argue on reasonable grounds

The letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association stated: "We are writing to inform you that the British Shanghai Waterworks Company has decided to change the 75% discount on water charges to 80% starting from February 1 of this year, actually raising prices. All users are opposed to this because it involves an increased burden. A joint meeting of representatives of various organizations was held on January 30, and it was generally agreed that tap water is a beverage for all residents. This public utility should aim at the welfare of the public. In recent years, Shanghai has been affected by the 'January 28th' Shanghai Incident. Commerce and industry are depressed, and empty houses are lined up. Residents have risen up to demand rent reductions in order to maintain the status quo. However, the Shanghai Waterworks Company is disregarding the difficult times and is suddenly using the excuse of falling exchange rates to secretly ask the Public Works Department to change the discount, actually raising prices. It was decided that, in addition to submitting a petition to the Municipal Government requesting serious negotiations, we would also send a letter to the Taxpayers' Association urging them to argue on reasonable grounds. Accordingly, we are sending this letter to request that your association quickly negotiate with the Public Works Department on reasonable grounds and strive to achieve the goal of canceling the price increase in order to maintain the market. This is our earnest hope."

### Zhang Yuanruo Discusses the Chinese Unification Movement

Two Major Paths: Seeking Unification through the Rule of Law; Seeking Unification through Self-Reliance

The Central News Agency reports: The national unification and salvation movement initiated by various sectors in Shanghai has already attracted attention from all parties. This reporter believes that this matter is of great importance and cannot be effective with empty words. Yesterday, he specially visited political commentator Zhang Yuanruo to inquire about his specific opinions on promoting the unification movement. Mr. Zhang gave a detailed discussion as follows:

The whole country must take on the great task

A country is an organic collective. Unified and dynamic, it is the initial stage of completing national construction. If the Chinese nation is unwilling to lag behind and unwilling to be destroyed, it can only unite the entire country, unite from top to bottom, and strive for the construction of a modern and unified country. Therefore, national unification and salvation is undoubtedly an undeniable national policy at present. The entire country should not sit idly by and watch the country disintegrate, and should especially unite to take on and complete this great historical task of national salvation and nation-building.

The core of the problem lies in understanding

However, the essence of the problem, the core of the problem, is not the abstract theoretical debate about whether or not to unify, but the recognition of the correct path to complete unification. In the past, China has not been without unification movements, but historical experience tells us that because unification was not done properly, the more unification was mentioned, the more chaos was brewed, the more unification was wanted, the more division was formed, and the more unification was sought, the more division was manifested.

Two propositions of national theory

The fate of the Chinese nation, along with the deepening of the international crisis, has reached the final moment where a single hair can make a great difference and no further mistakes can be made. Therefore, what we must do now in the national salvation movement is, first, not to take risks and seek luck; second, not to speak empty words and false words, but to have practical, feasible, effective, and appropriate methods. Based on this understanding, I (Zhang said of himself) have never been willing to innovate, aim high, or be pragmatic about national salvation theory. I have always been sincere, practical, and honest. In recent years, I have had two consistent and unchangeable propositions on national affairs: first, legalism; second, self-reliance. These two propositions, although ordinary, have infinite applications. Even when applied to the unification movement, they have their powerful functions.

The relationship between the rule of law and unification

The close relationship between the rule of law movement and the unification movement can be said to be two sides of the same coin. Because the rule of law is something that is rich in universality, or even a tool for unified rule. According to the legalists of the analytical school, laws and decrees are the orders of the sovereign, and sovereignty has internal supremacy and absoluteness, which are the elements that constitute a country. In terms of the function of law, law is the "program of the world and the instrument of all things." The result of the rule of law should be "appointing the public and not the private, appointing the great way and not the small things," "not being a disaster within the law, not being arbitrary outside the law," and absolutely not allowing divergent or divisive actions. From a historical point of view, the reason why European countries can be peacefully unified is "because there is no meaning outside the law or action outside the law." It is the effect of practicing the rule of law and respecting the rule of law. From our own history, the reason why Qin was able to annex the six countries, unify the world, abolish feudalism, establish prefectures and counties, and establish the historical foundation of a great unified country was also the result of advocating and practicing the rule of law.

The relationship between self-reliance and unification

The relationship between self-reliance and unification can be said to be in two aspects. First, it is necessary to work hard on national construction and use economic and transportation construction projects to shorten the distance of space, break down the barriers of regions, increase the connection of interests in various places, and promote the unity of the national spirit of the people throughout the country. The stages of political evolution and economic evolution are corresponding. In 1540, France was divided into 16 governments. Even in 1789, each was still independent and self-governing, with more than a dozen conferences. The reason why European countries were able to destroy the old system of feudalism and establish a unified foundation was the result of the development of economic and transportation enterprises after the industrial revolution. Moreover, given the size of China, we must work hard to build. Secondly, we must create the belief of self-reliance. The work of unification and nation-building must be based entirely on the self-consciousness of the people and the self-reliance of the nation. Since the Republic of China, most people have been warmongering. Wanting to rely on foreign forces to achieve success only results in endless civil wars, only consumes the nation's vitality, and deepens the country's divisions. The recent tragedy in Spain is the result of not knowing self-reliance and relying on foreign forces, which led to the evil consequences of the struggle between the red and black forces. To unify the country, we must first awaken national consciousness, recognize the interests of the country, not be selfish, not be used by others, and be fair and just, creating a central idea that meets the needs of our own country, adjusting the contradictions between left and right, and eliminating ideological struggles. Otherwise, we will inevitably repeat the endless civil wars since the Republic of China, as well as the red and black struggles in Spain. In this way, not only will the unification and nation-building become an unrealizable dream, but the Chinese nation will also kill each other and be divided by the great powers. This is the so-called non-drama of national destruction, which cannot but be guarded against.

There is no other way to unify

The above discussion only involves concepts. To speak of its essence, it still needs special discussion. However, there is no other way to unify. Everything else is secondary. Now that the situation in Shaanxi has improved and the country is at peace, it is hoped that the authorities will take these two meanings as their basis and earnestly plan for them, seeking unification through the rule of law and seeking unification through self-reliance. If there is time in the near future, I will write a special essay to discuss with the people of the country, he said.

### Public Works Department Plans to Increase Property Tax by 2% Starting This Year

Property Industry Association Sends a Letter to the Taxpayers' Association Requesting Negotiations

The Xin Xin News Agency reports: The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Public Concession yesterday, requesting the cancellation of the Public Works Department's plan to increase the property tax by 2%. The letter stated: "We have repeatedly received statements from our members stating that, according to previous reports, the Public Works Department plans to increase the property tax in the concession by 2% across the board starting this year. We are extremely shocked. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the market has gradually declined, land prices have plummeted, and houses have been mostly empty. This bleak situation is witnessed by all. At ordinary times, the average citizen cannot pay the original rent and tax on time. If the tax is increased, it will make it more difficult for tenants to bear the burden. Even if the Concession authorities feel that this year's budget is insufficient, they should try to save money from the expenditure side. At this time, increasing the burden on citizens will make it difficult for the market to recover. The result will inevitably affect the income of donations and reduce it further, which is not a blessing for the municipal authorities. You should be asked to negotiate on ways to cancel this. We ask that you investigate the matter and handle it accordingly, as it is our deepest hope."

### Detailed Record of the Literary and Art Circles Symposium (Continued)

Chuan Donghua: Today, we originally invited all of you gentlemen, and you should have expressed your opinions first. Now, the host speaks first, which seems disrespectful. However, the chairman appointed me, so I have to obey. In my opinion, no matter what views anyone usually holds, they cannot be separated from the people of the country. Speaking of the literary and art circles, the first step is to start with oneself. What is the situation of the literary and art circles now? According to the statistics of the Publication Weekly run by Mr. Wang Yunwu, the sales of literary and artistic books are falling year after year. If this continues, we will have nowhere to eat. Considering the interests of the literary and art circles themselves, this phenomenon is very worrying. What methods can we use to save it? We can only have another Renaissance. Saving literature and art is saving our own lives. As everyone knows, unity is a method of relief. However, as Mr. Shao said just now, several attempts at unity have failed. Why did they fail? The reason is that everyone does not have a deep understanding of the meaning of the group. There are only small groups, not large groups. Small group A attacks small group B, so many forces are wasted. On the contrary, the large group has no strength. Therefore, we must transfer this wasted power to engage in the cause of the Renaissance. This is necessary. Secondly, for the Renaissance, we need to have conditions for social stability. This is the case in the literary history of any country. In the past, the strength used by the literary and art circles was not to seek stability in the literary world, but to create chaos in the literary world. Sometimes, the chaos in the literary world even caused disputes throughout society. How can literature and art be revived? Not long ago, this city launched a unified national salvation declaration. I once expressed an opinion, hoping to use peaceful methods to unify the situation of disunity. Now, this hope can be fully realized soon. Since the country has formed a unified situation, our literary and art circles should take this opportunity to transfer the power engaged in civil war in the literary world, unite everyone, and work together to build and revive literature and art. Therefore, a few of us took advantage of the dawning of China's future to invite you all to the meeting to express some opinions. What is the biggest reason why society cannot be stable? On the one hand, it is internal, but an even greater reason than internal is external. Therefore, we further hope to use the power of construction to jointly solve external problems. Only when external problems are solved can society be relatively stable forever. Only when society is stable can there be a possibility of literary and artistic revival. This opinion seems very superficial, but in practice, obstacles often occur in superficial places. Therefore, let’s not talk about other theories today. I hope to further study the stability of society from this superficial place, solve internal and external problems, and stabilize society. Only then can literature and art be revived. This is the greatest hope.

Shao Xunmei: Just now, Mr. Chuan said that it seemed disrespectful for the host to speak first. However, if we don't explain the meaning of this meeting first, I'm afraid you won't understand. So, after I explain, I will ask Mr. Chuan to supplement. Now, I might as well ask Mr. Hong Shen to further supplement the consistent opinions of the hosts.

Hong Shen: Distinguished guests, the six of us invited you to this meeting. I joined the latest, and my attitude may be the most blatant and firm. A few months ago, a friend talked about resisting the enemy. At that time, I said a word: if one day China is officially at war with the enemy, and I personally do not die on the front line, then everything I have said and done in my life is a lie. However, this meaning cannot force others to be the same as me, because everyone has their own views and feelings. Naturally, it is impossible for all literary and art circles to give up their work and go to the battlefield to die. This is just my personal willingness. Now the situation is getting more and more tense every day. Today, there are many things that I could have said politely in the past, but now I have to say them. In the past, there were many concerns, fearing that they would cause misunderstandings and abuses. Today, I have to express them clearly. The first point is that our literary and art circles must be thoroughly united, not just the dozens of people present here today. We must unite all literary and artistic workers across the country. For several years, we don't need to shy away from the fact that there are differences between the left-leaning and right-leaning in the literary and art circles. Now, regardless of whether we are left-leaning or right-leaning, we should put aside our own political thoughts and unite to do the work of saving the country and shedding blood. Everyone present here today, of course, you are all participating in this work. I hope that literary and art circles who are not able to attend due to circumstances will also participate. The first point is that, regardless of whether we are in or out of power, we must unite as one. This is something we don't need to shy away from. Our literary and art circles often have the mentality of being in or out of power. The so-called writers in power are those who are more or less close to the government. The so-called writers out of power are those who take a strict attitude to criticize politics. Now, we should no longer have this mentality. Everyone should unite as one. From my personal standpoint, the current government is working hard for peaceful reunification. Why are there still people who want to oppose it? Of course, everyone should support the government. Now, we are shouting the slogan of 'Unify the country and save the nation.' The slogan doesn't matter. We hope that it will be realized in fact as soon as possible. As long as we truly unify the country and save the nation, we will of course fully support it. You may think that the six of us are a bit strange. Why did we suddenly call this meeting and issue a declaration? But we are all in our thirties and forties. In our own history, we don't seem to be all bastards. Except for me, the other five are not very stupid either. Today, we invite you to the meeting. We must have felt that it was necessary based on our reason and understanding before we invited everyone to this meeting. Finally, I will recite another story. I once read a novel by Mr. Shen Congwen, the general idea of which is that there are two soldiers in the army who fight every day. One time, they carried a basket of rice back to the camp. On the way, they started fighting again, fighting until their heads were bleeding. Fighting is fighting, but the rice still has to be delivered to the camp. Finally, you look at me, I look at you, and the two of them get up and carry the rice to the camp. Now, all writers, between political positions and political positions, even if there have been some grievances in the past, today, we must give up these small grievances and unite to work hard for the biggest grievances. This is my little hope.

Shao Xunmei: We have made our intentions clear. Now, please express your opinions on the declaration of the unified national salvation movement.

Jian Youwen: Today, I am very moved to be invited by the six gentlemen and to hear your opinions. So, I stand up to say a few words. However, I want to declare in advance that my position is the same as yours. It is entirely the position of a writer. Regarding the opinions you have put forward, first, I fully agree with the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles Unified National Salvation Declaration. Second, I especially agree with the organization of the Chinese Literary and Art Association. I have been praying for this matter for a year or two, and I hope that this matter will be established soon. However, let's study it. It's not that there were no literary and art groups in the past. Why did the literary and art groups in the past have no results? There are several reasons for this. First, the literary and art circles have too much individualism, thinking only of themselves and looking down on others. How can this be united? Second, the small groups also have too much individualism. Group A attacks Group B, and Group B attacks Group A. Mutual attacks naturally cannot be united. Now, if we want to unite as a whole, there are a few points to pay attention to. First, it is best not to involve politics and not to engage in political movements, because individuals may have different political positions and political views. If it involves politics and engages in political movements, this association will be difficult to last. For example, if we want to propose to release Zhang Xueliang and let him go back in the association, then this association will have many internal disputes and cannot be established. Second, it is not necessary to seek complete unity of individual thoughts. If individual thoughts are forced, then this association may not be established. The reason why the Writers Association could not succeed in the past was because it had a background of political advocacy and political movements, and it also forced uniformity of individual thoughts. Therefore, I think there is one point that is most likely to organize the Literary and Art Association. Third, break the individualism. In the past, the so-called literary people looked down on each other. Now I dare to put forward a slogan called "Literary people respect each other." A literary person always has his merits, otherwise he would not be a literary person. Since there are merits, of course, we can be friends, and we don't need to look down on each other. Second, we need a group to study learning and literature. To avoid conflicts of individual thoughts, you are left-leaning or right-leaning to what extent, and what are the reasons, we may as well talk about it, and maybe we can communicate. Third, we need to contact each other emotionally. Although we cannot unify our thoughts, our emotions can be unified. Therefore, I put forward another slogan of "Literary people love each other." Based on these three points, to organize the Literary and Art Association, it will definitely be successful. With such a group, it will be easier for us to do things and speak. Finally, although our political views are different, we can always find some common ground. I believe that no one opposes patriotism, and no one does not approve of shedding blood and sacrificing for China. Based on this goal, we can unite and do our best. I believe that this will be of great benefit to the whole, to China, to culture, and to individuals.

Fan Zhongyun: At this time, everyone has realized the point of talking about unified national salvation. After the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang went to Nanjing, and the recent peaceful settlement of the Shaanxi situation all indicate that the general public has realized that China needs unity and can no longer have internal strife. However, I feel that people in the literary and art circles do not seem to have felt the significant impact of this trend of thought. The reason for this has already been said by someone, that the personality of literary people is too heavy and they look down on each other. But there is another reason, which is the result of the invasion of imperialism. How do you say this? You must know that imperialism not only uses military and economic means to invade, but also uses thought to invade. This is a great blow to Chinese culture. The reason why China has been able to unify for thousands of years is entirely due to the consistent culture of thousands of years. Chinese culture has not only unified China, but also unified the entire East. Countries such as Japan, Siam, Annam, and Korea have all been influenced by Chinese culture. Since the forces of imperialism invaded, they have destroyed China's inherent culture, and many people have forgotten the need for unity of their own nation and followed others. Just now, Mr. Jian said that no one opposes patriotism, but a few years ago, I was scolded as a patriot and opposed. At that time, we should talk about internationalism. When the three northeastern provinces were lost, we still heard the slogan of "Supporting the Soviet Motherland." With the "Soviet Motherland," is there still a Motherland China? Can a person have two motherlands? After this kind of thinking invaded, it made the unification of Chinese culture suffer a blow. Everyone can see the military invasion and economic invasion of imperialism. Therefore, everyone is indignant and wants to resist the enemy and defend against foreign aggression. But in the case of ideological anaesthesia, people do not know how they died even when they are dead. Because there is an ideological invasion and the unification of culture is destroyed, it is not easy for the unified situation in China to succeed. Especially at the present time, if we want to truly unify, we must not only be internal but also external. For example, recovering the four northeastern provinces is the true unified national salvation. However, recovering the four northeastern provinces is related to international relations. At this time of internal and external troubles, should our thinking be based on the Chinese nation? After recognizing this point, I feel even more the necessity of cultural and ideological unity. Just now, a gentleman said that as long as we can unify spiritually and ideologically, material construction will not be a problem. This is very true. Let's look at the Western countries. All countries with backward industries especially need spiritual development and unity. France's capitalist production system is not as developed as Britain's, but the French Revolution and the ideas of freedom and equality led Britain. Germany's industrial development was even later than France's, but Germany worked hard on philosophical thought, so German philosophy led the world. Russia's economic development was later than that of Britain and France, but it surpassed the whole world in terms of socialist thought. Since China's industry is backward, it needs a cultural movement even more. With a cultural movement, it can promote the unification movement and promote economic construction through spiritual construction. Therefore, I very much agree with the proposals of the six gentlemen. However, there may be some imperfections in the wording of this declaration. It is best to ask everyone to express their opinions and revise it, so as to promote a true society with everyone's opinions. (To be continued)

### Ministry Member Visits Shanghai to Inspect Fire Control

In view of the importance of fire control in the area of North Sichuan Road Hongkou in Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners live together, the Ministry of Interior of the National Government, Director of the Police Administration Department of the Ministry, Feng Yukun, and Inspector and Section Chief of the Ministry, Jiang Tianqing, came to Shanghai together and visited the Zhabei Third Section Fire Brigade. They were received by Deng Yecheng, the director of the association. They inquired in detail about fire prevention. They then visited the facilities and were very satisfied. Officers of the Fire Protection Unit of the Municipal Police Department also followed and arrived. The police station on North Sichuan Road also sent additional police officers to the gate of the Zhabei Third Section Fire Brigade to guard the post to protect them and take photos as a memorial.

### Special Cash Guarantee Method (Continued)

Full Text Published by the Bankers Association

II. For Bank Employees

Firstly, after the implementation of this method, employees can be exempted from finding guarantors and the various difficulties of begging relatives and friends to continue guaranteeing during annual guarantee renewals. Seeking help from others is not as good as relying on oneself. Secondly, adopting this method eliminates the need to pay huge insurance premiums annually, as with the credit insurance system. It also avoids the situation of using a 'limited guarantee,' where, if the limit is too high, it may deter potential guarantors and lead them to withdraw their guarantees. Thirdly, because this method has provisions for joint and several liability, the various funds collected are rarely used. When a substantial amount has accumulated, a portion can be allocated annually to establish schools for employees' children, consumer cooperatives, clubs, sports fields, libraries, and other welfare facilities. This will greatly benefit the employees' physical and mental well-being. Moreover, Article 21 of the plan has already stipulated the funds to be used, which ensures that it will not be like the nominal welfare facilities that commercial circles have organized in the past.

Fourthly, due to the provisions for joint and several liability and the deduction of Class B guarantee deposits, all colleagues will be able to care for each other in their duties, which will enhance camaraderie, mutual supervision, and prevention of fraud.

Fifthly, the Class B guarantee deposits paid by employees each month, excluding compensation for losses due to fraud (in fact, with the provisions for joint and several liability, fraudulent activities can be reduced), will be refunded to employees upon leaving their positions. The amount of refund will be determined based on the length of service, which is tantamount to incorporating a savings element into the payment of insurance premiums.

Sixthly, when the Class A guarantee deposits and public reserve funds accumulate to a considerable amount, in addition to using part of it for welfare projects, the bank may, at its discretion, invest in various productive enterprises to increase the benefits for both employees and the bank. This is similar to the lending practices of American credit insurance companies.

Seventhly, according to statistics from American credit insurance companies, the actual revenue from insurance premiums, after deducting discounts, commissions, and miscellaneous expenses, is only about 65% to 75%. This method is practical and does not have such losses.

Precautions for Implementing the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method'

First, adopting the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' requires determination, perseverance, and spirit. It is absolutely essential not to implement cash guarantees and insurance policies simultaneously, as this would not only fail to alleviate the pain of employees seeking guarantors but would also increase their financial burden in vain (however, this can be temporarily delayed when first implementing).

Second, when hiring employees, except for highly appointed personnel, procedures such as written and oral examinations should be followed. The past experience, work performance, and integrity of applicants should be thoroughly investigated. Caution should be exercised, and after hiring, there should be letters of recommendation from two people proving their good character. Such procedures should be implemented immediately.

Third, seeking ease and avoiding work are human nature. Bank employees, living in the extravagant society of the city, are easily misled if their will is weak, leading to disgrace and ruin. Examining the origins of fraud, more than 60% stem from a speculative and侥幸 mentality, hoping to profit and repay past debts. If they fail, they will inevitably resort to embezzlement and fraud. Therefore, to eliminate fraud, speculation must be strictly prohibited, employees' leisure activities must be improved, and employee training should be initiated to enhance their moral character. Such measures can actively cultivate good character in employees, and strictly prohibiting speculation and paying attention to daily words and deeds can passively prevent the motivation for fraud. Article 21 of the aforementioned plan already stipulates the source of funds for welfare facilities, making it even easier to implement.

Fourth, the duties assigned to employees must be as suitable as possible for their personalities, and their family income and expenses must be objectively assessed so that they can enjoy their work today and have hope for the future. This will stabilize their lives, calm their minds, and naturally increase their efficiency. If there are already employee dormitories, the close interaction of colleagues can further encourage each other and achieve greater results. Moreover, dormitory managers can closely supervise and assess each resident.

Fifth, in any organization, if one person specializes in one task for a long time, not only will they feel monotonous, but it will also easily lead to malpractices. Employees of all levels in British banks are often rotated, so cases of fraud are relatively rare compared to other countries. Therefore, employees should be transferred after holding a certain position for a considerable period to avoid the development of bad habits. From the employee's perspective, learning new skills can also increase interest.

Sixth, the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' should be strictly enforced according to regulations without hesitation. Making concessions to the environment may endanger the effectiveness of the entire method. Furthermore, the definition of the word 'employee' must be carefully considered as each bank has a different organization.

Seventh, if an employee commits fraud and conceals it, the original recommender should have the responsibility to immediately or at any time report the employee's conduct to the bank or send them to the bank. When hiring employees, the recommender should also sign and acknowledge this responsibility in the employee's resume and application form. After the abolition of guarantors, the bank becomes even more unfamiliar with the origins of employees, making it difficult to investigate when incidents occur. Therefore, requiring recommenders to report employees' conduct can reduce the abuse of favoritism and recommendations.

Eighth, in the event of fraud, in addition to criminal penalties and civil compensation being handled strictly according to law without any leniency, the name and photo of the perpetrator should be published in newspapers when necessary to prevent the rogue from rejoining society in the future.

Ninth, joint and several liability is the essence of this method. However, before implementation, a thorough investigation should be conducted to ensure clear responsibility and strive for fairness.

Tenth, employees with upright character and careful public service should be rewarded by the bank to commend them.

Eleventh, various articles of the employee service guarantee rules must be carefully drafted so that there is a basis for subsequent actions.

Twelfth, to facilitate the implementation of the cash guarantee draft, detailed implementation rules should be formulated to specify all implementation procedures. For banks with a small number of employees, they can cooperate with other banks to achieve the same results.

Thirteenth, each bank's accounting system must be strictly organized to make the new method more effective.

Fourteenth, auditors should be sent to each branch at any time to audit accounts and business operations. However, the personnel sent must be extremely secretive and carry credentials with their name, position, and photo attached to prevent infiltration by criminals. It is said that this is widely used in the British banking industry.

Fifteenth, at the beginning of their employment, employees should issue a written oath declaring absolute compliance with the joint and several liability and other regulations stipulated in the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' and never evade or shirk responsibility.

Sixteenth, cashiers and custodians of cash and negotiable instruments must not concurrently hold accounting or other positions.

Seventeenth, inspections of cash custody and accounts should be conducted internally and externally simultaneously.

Eighteenth, document signatures should be countersigned, and receipts and payments should be processed by at least two people.

Conclusion

Modern group organizations adopt a division of labor due to the complexity of affairs and the diversity of functions, while also emphasizing the spirit of cooperation. The work of each member of the group must be coordinated and adjusted through the cooperation of all members in order to operate flexibly. An individual's duties must be connected through the group to form an organic system, with the beginning and end corresponding and the veins running through, in order to exert its functions. Therefore, analyzing an individual's duties from the group's point of view has a social meaning and cannot be ignored. Looking back at our country's guarantee system, each person still individually seeks a guarantor, fills out a guarantee form, and is responsible to the group separately. Everyone plans for themselves and does not communicate with each other. The organization of affairs has reached the stage of collective division of labor, but the guarantee system has not yet shed the color of individualism, which is a contradiction in China's commercial management. People advocate the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method,' which has Class A guarantee deposits as self-guarantees, collects Class B guarantee deposits, and allocates internal guarantee deposits as public guarantees. It also makes people in related positions in the same industry jointly responsible, so that the duties and character of the staff in the same group are closely linked, sweeping away the malpractices of the past individualistic guarantee system, conforming to the modern 'massism' and the spirit of 'social connection,' and harmonizing with the collective division of labor organization. This is the theoretical basis of this method. Furthermore, new-style banks and shops, for the sake of careful review and prevention of loopholes, strictly implement 'internal checks and balances,' so each business process goes through the hands of several people, plus the application of the 'balance' principle in accounting. For preventing fraud, it cannot be said to be completely ineffective. However, this kind of mechanical check and balance can only supervise each other in form. Using it to manage modern groups with busy affairs is still insufficient. The repeated occurrence of fraud cases in the past is clear evidence of this. Although we do not expect the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' to be completely free of malpractices, in addition to the mechanical supervision in the original office work, it can also promote spiritual unity, so it can be concluded that it will be effective. Therefore, those who do not understand the deep meaning of this method may suspect why colleagues should be held jointly and severally liable for one person's fraud, which is not only unreasonable but also encourages wrongdoing. However, after reading the above explanation, they will surely understand.

I have heard of one person guaranteeing several or dozens of people. If fraud occurs among the guaranteed, the guarantor invites the guaranteed to be responsible for sharing the compensation; otherwise, the entire guarantee will be withdrawn. All the guaranteed agree unanimously. This is a common fact in Shanghai's commercial circles. Analyzing the funds paid by the guaranteed for joint and several compensation, its nature is almost close to mutual guarantee funds, which shows that jointly allocating funds to prepare for compensation for fraud losses is actually a situation that has evolved. The Class B guarantee deposit in the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is only adopting the existing habit. Moreover, central government agencies such as the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways have already adopted cash guarantees for their accounting and cashier personnel. The government agencies have already advocated it first, and the banking industry follows suit, which is also an inevitable trend. In short, the personal credit guarantee system has its own historical significance in the past agricultural and handicraft society. Today, our country has evolved from a simple agricultural economy to an industrial and commercial economy. The trend of the times is that personal guarantees will be eliminated. The new guarantee system will respond to the needs of the situation and fulfill its historical mission, without a doubt. Looking at the major foreign banks in Shanghai, those that use the insurance policy system are rare. Those that are still in use are mostly guarantees from compradors to the bank, which is not sufficient to be a definitive conclusion. However, the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' that we advocate is only a suggestion to correct the shortcomings of the current bank guarantee system and explore new system paths. Although whether it will produce malpractices during implementation remains to be indicated by experience, if it is promoted in a revolutionary manner, cutting through thorns and thistles without the slightest fear, there will be good results. Considering and gaining, there is an ancient proverb, so I will not hesitate to provide my humble opinion for discussion, and I hope for your wise decision and correction, and I will be grateful and increased.

### The China Mercy Childcare Association Held Its 8th Annual Meeting the Day Before Yesterday (Continued)

President Kong Xiangxi Presided in Person; Passed the Work Outline for the 26th Year

Mr. Pan's Speech

Director of the Social Bureau, Pan Gongzhan (represented by Zhang Binghui), delivered a speech entitled "Today's Childcare Undertakings in China." The original text is as follows: Our country only began to pay attention to children's issues after the rise of new education, and deeply felt that it was necessary to advocate child-centered education. Therefore, from the "Spartan" style of extreme destruction of children's individuality and the barbaric education of freedom, it has transformed into an education that creates free growth and development of individuality, which is suitable for the social and human evolution, and gradually recognized that "the 20th century is the century of children." However, strictly speaking, China's children's education only entered a new stage of development after the reform of educational policies in the 7th year of the Republic of China and the arrival of scholars such as Dewey and Mencius. Our country's education circles also have a deep understanding of the true meaning of children's education, but education must be a practical action. It is not enough to only understand some theories or to understand the importance of children's welfare. We must mobilize social forces and move towards the stage of practice. The China Mercy Childcare Association was created for this requirement and comprehensively seeks the welfare of general children in society. This cannot be said not to be the most concrete microcosm of China's childcare undertakings. Regarding the sacred cause of children and the welfare of the entire society, the development of the China Mercy Childcare Association's business must be multi-faceted, and its tasks are also very heavy. I am very happy to be at the 8th Annual Meeting of the China Mercy Childcare Association. All of you present are gentlemen and ladies who are enthusiastic about children's happiness and educating children. For the sake of the future of the Chinese nation and the current national crisis, dare to sincerely hope that everyone will pay close attention to the problem of increasing the happiness of our next generation and newborn children, so that every parent and teacher with children will become excellent nannies, and finally complete the task of national nannies. Therefore, with 110,000 enthusiasm, I would like to pay infinite respect to the nannies of the Chinese nation, and offer a little suggestion to colleagues engaged in childcare undertakings, hoping that everyone will discuss: (1) In terms of advocacy, we must make everyone know to respect children, cherish and protect children, and treat children as members of society, seeking children's happiness is the most effective behavior to ensure social welfare. Running children's welfare undertakings is not the result of a minority's compassion, but the discovery of the whole people's obligations. I hope that children's welfare undertakings institutions can develop in multiple directions, such as education, relief, protection of children, and various health institutions, which is the minimum attention we pay to increasing the happiness of children. (2) In terms of education, in addition to urging and assisting school education, we must also pay attention to the education of parents. In the past, we only recognized children as the object of education, but we did not know that parents are more important objects of education. As a result, children's education only dares to achieve very little effect. For example, 'Parents Education Research Association,' 'Nanny Education,' 'Wet Nurse Training,' 'Maternity Knowledge'... etc., have been extremely neglected. In the future, we should pay special attention to this point, so that parents' education and children's education will be carried out in parallel. (3) Relief and protection, most children live in suffering and are very unfortunate, which is everywhere. We should start with both the root cause and the symptoms, and promote the enactment and implementation of legal provisions related to children's relief and protection. In terms of treating the symptoms, we should pay attention to the establishment of relief agencies, which specialize in accommodating vagrant children and disabled children. In addition, relief such as orphanages, nurseries, children's parks, and the liberation of maids, and prohibiting the abuse of apprentice child laborers are also very important. It must be known that relieving children is the first step in protecting children's welfare. Therefore, general unfortunate children cannot talk about protection before they have received social relief. If there is no problem with life, of course, we can use protection methods to enable them to obtain a happy and fulfilling life. (4) In terms of health, we must practically promote the physical and mental health of children and their balanced development. Childcare institutions should have regular health guidance, so that the two departments of family health and children's health should have activities in terms of children's disease visits, mobile treatment, and special attention should be paid to children's mental health. Regarding this point, I very much hope that the China Mercy Childcare Association will be able to establish a mental health clinic in the shortest possible time to help children with mental disorders. The value to society is very great, and it can especially reduce children's crime. If there is a mental health clinic, the children's court can also be dispensed with. The above points are what China's childcare undertakings are striving to implement today, and they are also important guidelines for future development. Whether it is any nature, different children's mercy institutions, or children's central movement, such as Children's Year, Children's Happiness Society, Children's Holiday Homework Society, and various implementations of children's and youth camping, are all aimed at the happiness of children as the only object. Therefore, we must advance with these major goals, so that the happiness of children can be established from the external development of childcare undertakings, and reflect the vigor of society. I can definitely say that engaging in childcare undertakings is the most pleasant and valuable service to society. I personally admire it very much. Finally, I would like to respectfully wish all ethnic nannies good health.

### Tragedy at the New Asia Hotel

Traveler's Son Falls from the Sixth Floor and Dies Tragically

Room No. on the sixth floor of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road was occupied by a traveler named Ge from Nanjing a few days ago. Ge is from Anhui and came with his wife and others. Yesterday at noon, Ge was receiving visitors in the room, while his young son, Ge Lin, who was only a few years old, was playing with other children in the bathroom. Unexpectedly, because the bathroom window was not closed, Ge's child climbed up, leaning on the edge of the window bathtub, looking down. The child lost his balance and fell out of the bathroom window, headfirst down, falling on Tiantong Road. The child's head was broken, brain blood splattered, and his leg bones were also broken. He died immediately. When the other children screamed, Ge's father rushed in to see, but it was too late. Peeking down, he saw his own son lying dead on the road, and cried out in great grief. He rushed down to investigate. At this time, the nearby patrol police also arrived after hearing the alarm. The child was immediately sent to the Bazilu Sanitarium Hospital for advice, but it was already too late to return the soul, so he had to transfer the child's body to the coroner's office, pending a coroner's inquest this morning.

### Mu Shuzai Will Be Cremated Tomorrow Morning

Held at the Public Works Department Crematorium

Mr. Mu Shuzai, a senior gentleman in this city, passed away at noon on the 30th of last month. Yesterday at 2:00 pm, the coffin was placed in the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. More than 100 people from all walks of life, including Huang Renzhi, Gu Xinyi, and Tan Boying, came to offer condolences. The ceremony was simple and quiet. First, his brother Mu Ouchu reported on the course of the illness and treatment, saying, "My brother has a strong physique and extraordinary energy. He personally served for all local public welfare. In his later years, his blood pressure increased. Doctors and relatives repeatedly advised him to avoid being busy and to rest quietly. However, because of his nature, he was eager to be fair and righteous, so he did not pay attention. Therefore, since he suffered from cerebral hemorrhage on the 23rd of last month, although all methods have been exhausted, they have not been able to save him." After the speech, relatives and friends saluted and paid their respects to the remains. This time he was ill, he did not suffer, so his appearance was as if he were alive. During his lifetime, he was generous to others, and firmly instructed that he should be cremated after his death, and that the land in Yanghuan Township, Pudong, should not be occupied, in order to promote society. It is now scheduled to leave the International Funeral Home at 8:30 am on the 2nd of the month, passing through Kangnaot Road, Hede Road, and turning into Jing'an Temple Road to the Public Works Department Crematorium. The cremation will be held at 9:30 am. People from all walks of life, and important staff from the Shanghai South and Public Concession and French Concession fire brigades, will go to hold the rope.

### The False Accusation of a Lawyer Will Be Thoroughly Investigated

Zhang Jinrong Cries Bitterly, Begging the Court for Lenience

Lawyer Xuan Zhendong, acting as an agent for a rent collector, filed a lawsuit against Zhang Jinrong of Huaian, residing at No. 29 Gonghe Road, Zhabei, for arrears in rent. The Jiangsu High Court's second instance concluded that the amount owed was less than five hundred yuan, and according to the law, there was no third instance. Therefore, it was in the process of execution. Zhang Jinrong harbored resentment towards lawyer Xuan and falsely accused him at the District Court Procuratorate of fraud and breach of trust. He claimed that after the High Court's judgment, Xuan instructed Chen Jingqiu to come to a settlement, agreeing to resolve the matter with thirty yuan and not to appeal further. Unexpectedly, the creditor then proceeded with the execution to recover the debt, thus alleging that the lawyer committed fraud and breach of trust. Prosecutor Tang Rutiao opened a court investigation, finding that Zhang Jinrong owed more than three hundred yuan but only paid over thirty. How could that be a settlement? Moreover, since the amount was less than five hundred yuan, there was no legal basis for a third instance appeal. How could Xuan Zhendong, as a lawyer, not know the law and advise against the appeal? This was clearly a false accusation. The prosecutor then indicted Zhang Jinrong in court yesterday. Judge Miao opened the court, and Zhang Jinrong testified that he did not want to sue but was instigated by Wu Xiao-kai, also known as Wu Haibing, who runs a small hotel on Hengfeng Road. "I was really tricked," he said, begging the judge to show mercy, considering his family of over ten members, and burst into tears. However, the investigating officer found that the drafter of the complaint was Guo Zhang, from the law firm of lawyer Jidengyuan, and Jixun was Zhang's defense attorney. The officer then asked lawyer Ji, who claimed he had not written it and that it was a blank form that was used without his permission. He stated that the matter should be investigated. The victim, Xuan Zhendong, filed a civil suit, requesting that the judgment be published in the newspaper to restore his reputation. The judge instructed that the case should be thoroughly investigated before further hearings.

### The Municipal Council Refuses the Road Workers' Demands

Decides to Proceed with a Lottery Independently; Yu Qiaqing Will Mediate Today

According to the Dagong News Agency, over one thousand two hundred road workers of the Public Concession Municipal Council have been on a joint strike since the day before yesterday to protest against the Works Department's plan to lay off workers through a lottery system. The Municipal Council Works Department has decided to reject the road workers' demands. Both sides are taking extreme positions. Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing is scheduled to approach the Municipal Council today for mediation. The sentiments of the various parties are recorded below:

Independent Lottery

The Municipal Council Engineering Department originally planned to convene all road workers at the Engineering Department at 9:00 AM on the 30th to await the lottery for layoffs and to recall all work permits. Retained road workers would be issued new badges for identification. Unexpectedly, all road workers unanimously opposed the plan and went on a joint strike, making it impossible to carry out the lottery procedure. Therefore, it was temporarily postponed. It is now learned that the Bureau has decided not to interrupt its policy direction and will implement the lottery independently. After the procedures are completed, the road workers who are retained and those who are laid off will be notified. Meanwhile, work permits will be revoked at their addresses.

Refusal of Requests

Yesterday, a reporter from the Dagong News Agency inquired with the Municipal Council Engineering Department about how the various reasons and requests raised by the road workers to withdraw the layoff order would be handled. The responsible person of the Bureau stated that this layoff of nine-tenths of the road workers is one of the Municipal Council's methods of reducing staff and expenses, and it has already been decided at a meeting. It cannot be changed casually or revoked due to the workers' strike. In fact, there is no way to reverse it. Moreover, the lottery is a very fair way to determine who stays and who leaves. Even for the laid-off workers, the Bureau can still employ them as temporary workers when the road maintenance work is busy, so they will not be immediately unemployed. The Bureau believes that the road workers' sudden strike is likely due to instigation, and the Bureau is conducting a thorough investigation. It hopes that the workers will not be incited by outsiders and will implement the established methods.

Continuing the Strike

Yesterday, all the road workers continued their strike and decided that at 9:00 AM this morning, Li Jingchun, Liu Huanwen, Zhang Buying, Cai Furong, and Wang Shuangcai would form a petition delegation to petition various agencies, including the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, requesting assistance to maintain their livelihoods.

Forming a Picket Line

After the road construction workers of the Municipal Council implemented a joint strike, in order to maintain order, the delegation decided to organize a picket line, with ten people from each of the seven districts of Andong Road, He Road, Shajing Road, Tangsi Road, Suzhou Road, Maigen Road, and Datong Road, totaling seventy people, divided into seven teams, taking turns to be responsible for picket duties to avoid incidents.

Yu's Mediation

After receiving a request for relief from the road construction workers, Municipal Council Director Yu Qiaqing believed that the livelihoods of the road workers would be precarious once they were laid off, and it was also related to local security during the winter prevention period. Therefore, he decided to go to the Municipal Council this morning to meet with Director-General Fei Liyong to discuss a solution and to reply to the road workers on the mediation process at 5:00 PM this afternoon.

Citizens' Expression

The various district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Union, including the seventh, twelfth, sixteenth, twenty-seventh, and thirty-eighth districts, believe that the Municipal Council's current reduction of expenditures does not start with senior foreign staff but rather lays off Chinese workers who earn only a few angles of wages per day, causing a strike. Yesterday, they specifically affixed their seals to a letter to the Municipal Council, making a serious representation, requesting that the Works Department be instructed to withdraw the order.

### Supplementary Amendments to the Draft of Regulations for Income Tax Collection

Letter from Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, and Others to the Income Tax Affairs Office

Accountants Pan Xulun, Gu Xun, Qian Nai Cheng, Li Wenjie, Li Hongshou, Chen Wenlin, Tang Wenrui and others from the Lixin Accounting Firm in this city, yesterday sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, stating that they believe that the draft of the Regulations for Income Tax Collection should be supplemented and amended. The original letter stated: "In continuation, Xulun and others submitted a letter on the 22nd of this month, detailing the points that Xulun and others believe should be amended in the draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class I Income Tax promulgated by the Ministry, which was duly noted. Now, the points that Xulun and others believe should be supplemented in the draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class I Income Tax, and the points that should be amended and supplemented in the draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class II and Class III Income Tax, are listed below. With our humble opinion, we hope that it will be considered and adopted."

A. Points that should be supplemented in the draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class I Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax: ⑴ There are many cases where there are business establishments both domestically and abroad, but there is no independent accounting of the business donations and benefits between the head office and branches, and they cannot be calculated separately. In such cases, the domestic and foreign business income must be divided. There are only two ways to implement the division: one is the allocation method, and the other is the estimation method. However, the standards for allocation and estimation are not specified in the collection regulations and should be supplemented. Otherwise, those with head offices and branches both domestically and abroad will definitely have no way to calculate the domestic or foreign portion of their income. ⑵ Article 2 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the income of foreign diplomats is exempt from taxation. However, this provision is too crude. Does the term "diplomat" only refer to formal diplomats such as ambassadors, ministers, and chargés d'affaires, or does it include consuls and employees of embassies and consulates? Does the term "income" only refer to the salary income of their diplomatic duties, or does it refer to income other than their duties, such as interest on securities deposits and business profits, which are also tax-exempt? These should also be clearly stipulated in the collection regulations for remedy. ⑶ The draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class I Income Tax provides detailed regulations on how to calculate the revenue of ordinary retail stores and manufacturing factories, but there are no regulations on how to calculate the revenue of profit-seeking enterprises with special characteristics, such as insurance companies, construction companies, and installment payment sales stores. There are many such manufacturers in China, and they will inevitably feel at a loss when filing and paying taxes in the future. It seems that appropriate regulations should be made in the collection regulations immediately. ⑷ How should "public dues" be interpreted, and what should be included in its content? It seems that supplementary regulations should be provided because there is a big difference in the types and nature of public dues. Not all public dues can be deducted from the revenue. For example, the land appreciation tax and the special levy for road improvement (Special Assessment), as well as all levies that can increase the value of the taxpayer's assets, should not be included in the deductible amount but should be treated as capital expenditures. Also, should capital taxes, business taxes, and income taxes paid to foreign governments be regarded as public dues and deducted uniformly? These should be clearly stipulated in the collection regulations because there are many companies registered in Hong Kong and the United States within China's borders. ⑸ How should the depletion of all mining land and forest land of mining and forestry institutions be calculated? There is no clear provision in the collection regulations, and it seems that it should be supplemented. ⑹ Article 12 of the Implementing Rules states, "The purchase and sale of items, securities, or gold and silver currency that are unrelated to the business and whose income is not calculated under the income of the business shall be regarded as a one-time profit-seeking enterprise." This article on purchase and sale must set a time limit, for example, if the purchased item is still sold within two years, one year, or several months, and there is income, it should be taxed (this time limit should be increased or decreased depending on whether the nature of the item is a fixed asset or a current asset). If the sale is outside this time limit, it is a capital increase (Capital Increment) rather than a temporary profit, and income tax should not be paid. This time limit is extremely important. Since it is not stipulated in the Implementing Rules, it should be supplemented in the collection regulations to avoid disputes. ⑺ Article 15 of the draft stipulates that "last year's losses shall not be included in this year's calculation," which is consistent with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations and the Implementing Rules, but in fact, it does make taxpayers feel distressed. For example, a company with a capital of 100,000 yuan has been losing money for several years, accumulating losses of 80,000 yuan in total. This year, it is fortunate to have a chance to make a profit of 30,000 yuan, which is not enough to make up for the previous losses of 50,000 yuan. How can it have the ability to pay taxes? If the loss in the previous year cannot be offset against this year's profit, then it must pay the highest rate of income tax of one per thousand this year, which is one thousand yuan. The government is too harsh on taxpayers and goes against the principle of the ability to pay taxes. According to British law, losses within six years are allowed to be offset against this year's profit, which is the only way to cultivate tax sources. It seems that China should adopt this method. Although this is a problem in the regulations, it seems that it cannot be raised when discussing the collection regulations. However, in fact, there are many provisions in the draft of the collection regulations that correct or remedy the shortcomings of the regulations and implementing rules. The point that last year's losses can be offset seems to be among the remedies. (To be continued)

Special Issue on Life Insurance
— Inscribed by Chen Guangfu

### Ministry of Education Advocates Instilling Insurance Knowledge

The China Insurance Society and the Shanghai Insurance Trade Association are jointly requesting the Ministry of Education to instruct major bookstores to include insurance materials in textbooks in order to promote insurance knowledge. On the 4th of this month, a reply was received from the Ministry of Education, which stated: "Your telegram has been received. The request to add a section on insurance materials to textbooks for primary schools and public schools has been noted. The primary school curriculum standards have been revised and promulgated, which includes a savings item, which naturally includes insurance materials. In the future, when compiling teaching outlines, the insurance item can be included in the outlines. As for public school textbooks, they have already been compiled. In the future, when revising them, insurance materials can also be added." Therefore, the Insurance Society and the Insurance Trade Association immediately dispatched personnel to contact major bookstores. All bookstores expressed their approval and decided to include insurance materials in textbooks. From now on, insurance knowledge can be gradually instilled in the minds of young people in our country.

### The Effectiveness of Life Insurance

— Zhang Mingting

Life insurance is a type of insurance system that applies the principle of human mutual assistance and precise scientific calculations to distribute the losses suffered by individuals due to life risks to a group of many people, so that the unfortunate can be rescued and people's livelihoods can be guaranteed. Its function is sufficient to stabilize individual life, consolidate social organization, and promote national prosperity. It is the most important undertaking in modern social economic organization. It has long been successful in European and American countries. Our country today is in a time of economic decline, people's livelihood is poor, and society is unstable. This kind of undertaking is really a targeted medicine. The whole country should jointly promote it and actively advance it, in order to harvest the great effect of national recovery. The general efficacy is briefly described as follows:

(1) For the individual: Work at sunrise and rest at sunset, supporting parents and raising children, this is the normal course of life. However, misfortune is uncertain, and life and death are fixed. If something unexpected happens to a person, the economic source of the whole family who depend on it for a living will be cut off, and there will be no source for the needs of the elderly and young to be supported and educated. The tragic scene can be described! Ordinary people often feel depressed and uneasy because of this worry about the future, and the impact often leads to a passive life. If you join life insurance, the amount to be obtained in the future is enough to remedy the occurrence of unfortunate events? And to use it to take care of their affairs, so that the whole family can eliminate the worry of danger, and the individual can obtain peace of mind and body. This kind of psychological influence is enough to increase the vitality of life, cultivate moral improvement, promote the effectiveness of work, and contribute to the development of the entire nation's future, which is very large. Looking at the mortality rate of those who have life insurance, it is significantly lower than the mortality rate of the general population, which can be a significant proof of fact. Therefore, Hucbnere said: "All those who have the obligation to support their families should use life insurance to protect themselves... We should regard those who are not insured as criminals." These words are enough to explain how important life insurance is to the individual.

(2) For society: Life insurance is originally a social policy; in the passive aspect, it can prevent social diseases, such as poverty, unemployment, crime, and lack of education. All the bad phenomena caused by economic deficiency can be eliminated. In the active aspect, it can increase social welfare, such as charity, education, health, treatment, etc. All the plans related to people's lives can be used to organize, so that society will gradually move towards a healthy and bright field, and its effect is very great. The accumulated funds of life insurance in European and American countries are also mostly invested in public welfare professions; it is sufficient to show that life insurance is the driving force for building a modern society. As for the spiritual effect of life insurance on society, it is even more difficult to estimate; such as cultivating the habit of saving, the customs of thrift, the spirit of mutual assistance, and the concept of ethics, all have a great relationship with the progress of society.

(3) For the country: In addition to benefiting individual life and social organization, life insurance also has an extremely great effect, which is to concentrate the floating capital of the people. This small amount of floating capital, after being concentrated by life insurance companies, becomes huge capital, which is used to support the development of the national economy, promote national construction, and maintain government finances. Its power is very great. One-fourth of the capital of the national railways in the United States is supplied by life insurance companies. Other such as public debt rolls, industrial loans, and industrial shares also occupy a large part. During the European War, British and American life insurance companies raised as much as 200 million yuan in government war bonds. The benefits of life insurance to the country can be seen.

The above is just a brief description of the obvious effects of life insurance. It is so great and beneficial to individuals, society, and the country. No wonder that in recent times, those who peep into the rise and fall of a country often use the amount of life insurance insured by its people as a measure. May our people pay attention quickly, then the future of the nation may have something to do with it.

### Development of Life Insurance

— Xiang Xinwu

Life insurance is extremely developed in developed countries in Europe and America. The great contribution to social stability and national economy need not be reiterated. In our country, although it also has a history of several decades and the efforts of some people, it is like a newly sprouted flower, waiting to be nurtured. I have always studied life insurance, and I think that the development of this undertaking has three basic points: one is the supervision of national laws; one is the soundness of the organization of the undertaking; and one is the popularization of life insurance knowledge. And the three are indispensable! If national laws are not promulgated, the undertaking will lose its basis; if the organization of the undertaking is not good, the promotion will be difficult to be smooth; if life insurance knowledge is not widespread, the need will not arise. Recently, the government's insurance industry law is about to be implemented, and the insurance law has also been promulgated; the operation of life insurance is still progressing and gradually becoming reasonable; and the life insurance special issue, which bears the heavy responsibility of spreading life insurance knowledge, has been published. The life insurance undertaking seems to be able to enter the stage from flower to fruit because of it. At this time, we should be overjoyed. How can the people of our country recognize the economic donation of personal death, and then have faith in life insurance, and then take responsibility for those who suffer losses? Putting pen to paper, I can't help but pin my infinite enthusiasm.

Most of us rely on our daily income for a living. If we suffer an accident, our wives and children will lose their livelihood. If we want to seek salvation, it is only life insurance. Life insurance does not guarantee that we can live forever, but it compensates for the economic losses caused by our own reasons. — Ma Yinchu

### History of the Development of Modern Life Insurance

— Guo Yudong

The establishment of modern life insurance was after the establishment of the scientific basis of the death table, so if we want to study its history of development, we cannot but briefly explain the production of the death table.

The production of the death table began with Dmltius, a Roman jurist in ancient times, but the material is vague, and it is impossible to examine whether it is correct. Until the middle of the 17th century, the two major mathematicians, Rierd de Fermat and Blaise pascal of France, jointly published the Doctrine of Probabilities in 1654, the world began to know that the movement of human survival and death can be expressed in numbers. Secondly, at the end of the same century, Dr. Caspar Neumann, a religious figure in Germany, not only sorted out 15,869 death registrations in Breslau and Suesia from 1687 to 1691 by age and gender with great enthusiasm and amazing patience, but also investigated in detail those who were born in the same year and compared them with each other, and the basic material of the death table was thus formed. This material was sent by Neumann to Edmmud Halley, a great astronomer in England, for correction, and was highly appreciated by Halley. Therefore, Halley used this as a basis to publish The Morlrtality of Breslau in 1693, which was the beginning of the death table. The so-called modern life insurance is based on this. The following is a description of each country separately:

1. England England is the ancestor of life insurance. In 1698, the Meroers Company was established in London. The following year, The Society of Aidows and Orphans was established. However, after a short period of time, they all went bankrupt one after another, which was the earliest sacrifice of life insurance in England. Next, in 1706, according to the proposal of John Hartey, the AmicableSociety for a Pcrpetual Assurance was established. It was a mutual organization. The initial number of members was limited to 3,000, the insurance money was 100 pounds, and the annual premium was 6 pounds and 4 shillings. However, it was also dissolved due to lack of scientific knowledge. After that, in 1721, with the special permission of the Parliament, the two insurance companies, Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation and Assuranec Coporation, were produced. Speaking of the history of issuing life insurance policies, the above two companies should be the earliest. However, the first to start operating death insurance using a death table with a basis was The Society for the Equltable Assurance on Lives and Survivorships, which was founded in 1762. In other words, it is the ancestor of modern life insurance. This insurance company is a mutual organization, and most of the employees are highly educated upper-class people. Emphasis on quality rather than quantity is a consistent policy in its development process. It has been operating for more than 170 years and is still solid as ever. It occupies the most glorious history in the life insurance industry. The so-called Old Equitable is this company.

After the success of the Equitable Insurance Company, the foundation of life insurance in England was created by this. The number of companies that were established successively by 1933 was more than 70, and the total amount of insurance money, only in the UK, had reached 2,857.43 million pounds, ranking second in the world only after the United States.

2. The United States The United States is the base camp of life insurance. The amount of insurance money accounts for two-thirds of the world, and of course, its status is second to none. As for its history of development, the first operators started with the agencies of British life insurance companies. Later, in 17159, the Presbltarian Ministers Fund was established; in 1769, the EpiscopalianMinisters Fund was established. Both are mutual organizations, and the qualifications for joining are limited to pastors, and there is no benefit to the general public. The New England MutualLife Insuranc Company, which was established in 1835 with the permission of the Massachusetts State, was established to meet the needs of the general public. This company was organized in imitation of the British Equitable Insurance Company, and the fund was 100,000 US dollars. Secondly, the General Eiie and tiust Company, which was licensed by Pennsylvania in 1836, is a joint-stock company that independently operates life insurance in the United States, and it has become the two major fortresses of life insurance in the United States with mutual organizations. After the establishment of the Mutual Life of New york in 1842, life insurance in the United States developed vigorously and unhindered. According to the statistics of 1934, the total amount of insurance money has reached more than 98.5 billion US dollars; the total amount of assets has exceeded 21.8 billion US dollars; the total annual surplus is more than 2.2 billion, and its grand situation can be imagined.

### Life Insurance and the New Life Movement

— Guan Keguai

Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, New Life Movement branches have been established in provinces, cities, and counties across the country. As the movement has been promoted, the decadent atmosphere has undergone a transformation. To save the nation from disaster and revive the nation, promoting the New Life Movement is a fundamental and urgent matter. The New Life Movement takes the old virtues of our country over thousands of years, namely, the four principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, as its backbone, incorporates them into the New Life Covenant, and expresses them in daily actions, so that people can easily follow and practice them at any time. Human life has no inherent distinction between new and old. As long as one can diligently work hard and adapt to the current environment, it is new. The old virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in our country are often regarded by people as clichés or mere ornaments, and they cannot be implemented in daily life, which is most regrettable. The New Life Movement aims to fully promote these inherent virtues, creating a disciplined, orderly, systematic, and planned personal life, and extending it to the relationships between people, thereby creating a disciplined, orderly, systematic, and planned social life. Therefore, the meaning of the New Life Movement is to promote and develop the original virtues of our nation, creating outstanding citizens and an outstanding nation suitable for survival in the current environment.

Regarding how to promote the New Life Movement and what kind of life activities should be the object of the New Life Movement, there are corresponding regulations in the New Life Covenant. Observing the organizational outline of the New Life Movement Labor Service Corps promulgated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, it has been stipulated in Article 15 as 'Promoting savings and insurance movement'. It can be known that 'insurance' is an important object in the New Life Movement, which is undoubtedly true. Among the insurance movements, 'life insurance' is the basic element of personal new life movement. The great German economist Engels studied the life problems of people in various European countries for twenty years. The research results show that 'life insurance' is a major element in the standard life of people in various European countries. The following is a record of Engels' research on the percentage distribution table of average personal living expenses of people in various European countries as proof:

The above table is a study of personal living expenses, so the item referred to as insurance premiums naturally refers to life insurance. From this, it can be seen that the average personal living expenses of Europeans include the same amount for life insurance premiums and medical expenses, which is more than double the amount for transportation expenses. Life insurance premiums account for one of the eight major living expenses of Europeans. The importance of the position of life insurance in the standard personal life can be imagined.

Now, I will briefly explain the functions of life insurance in promoting the propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame advocated by our country's New Life Movement.

As the saying goes, 'Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know honor and disgrace.' It is rare for those who lack clothing and food to know honor and disgrace and abide by etiquette. How to maintain sufficient clothing and food at present is an important issue that needs to be resolved urgently by most people. However, even if clothing and food can be maintained at present, if one cannot prepare for a rainy day and plan ahead, once danger comes, clothing and food will be lost, and one will lose integrity and disregard etiquette, which is also a common occurrence. Life insurance is a guarantee to maintain sufficient clothing and food for individuals in the future, and also a guarantee to maintain personal integrity and etiquette throughout one's life. This is the function of life insurance in promoting 'propriety' as advocated by the New Life Movement.

Who can avoid disease, old age, death, and unexpected events? As the head of a family, being able to purchase life insurance when productive capacity is strong, so that those who are supported will not be distressed and helpless, lose schooling and care due to the above-mentioned dangers, this is the 'righteousness' that an individual fulfills to the family. Because of purchasing life insurance, being prepared for emergencies, being able to help each other in times of need, and helping the poor, this is the 'righteousness' that an individual fulfills to friends. Purchasing group life insurance for employees, so that employees can work with peace of mind, not having the idea of seeing something different and wanting to move, eliminating labor disputes, and promoting social harmony, this is the 'righteousness' that administrators fulfill to society. Life insurance can achieve all these righteous deeds. This is the function of life insurance in promoting 'righteousness' as advocated by the New Life Movement.

"Great wealth comes from heaven, small wealth comes from thrift." Life insurance does not necessarily require wealthy people to purchase it, but it values the ability of salaried classes with meager incomes to handle their income with integrity and thrift, allocating a considerable percentage for purchase. The money accumulated through this integrity and thrift, accumulated from small drops, will, at a considerable period, be like accumulating soil into a mountain, forming a huge sum of money. Even if one is not wealthy, one should be able to live a decent life. Even if one unfortunately dies midway, one's family can also obtain this huge sum of money to use for various undertakings. Therefore, life insurance is more effective and provides more guarantees than the method of integrity and thrift savings. This is the function of life insurance in promoting "integrity" as advocated by the New Life Movement.

Nothing is more shameful than not being able to be independent and relying on others, and nothing is more shameful than not being able to plan for oneself and one's family, so that oneself and one's family will beg for pity from others in the future. If one can think of times of need in times of abundance and purchase life insurance in advance as a guarantee, then why should one suffer the shame of begging for pity and relying on others? This is the function of life insurance in promoting knowing 'shame' and avoiding 'shame' as advocated by the New Life Movement.

What the New Life Movement advocates is to take the four principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as the backbone, and life insurance has the function of promoting the four principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Therefore, those who practice the New Life Movement must recognize life insurance and pay attention to life insurance!

### Taking in a Beggar Leads to a Wolf in the House: A Huge Sum of Money is Stolen from the Gold Exchange and Wasted

Madam Gao Gu is Moody and Regrets it Too Late; Gu Xingfu is Penniless and Looks Like a Beggar

Madam Gao Gu, a local woman residing at No. 15, Lane 384, Qipu Road, is 58 years old. She owns a considerable amount of property left by her late husband. However, she has a history of nervous disorders, which has been exploited by her relatives. A man named Gu Xingfu, 21 years old, claiming to be Madam Gao Gu's younger brother, was raised by her since his parents passed away. Around April of this year, Gu Xingfu suddenly stole two savings passbooks from his sister's Four Banks Savings Association, one for a fixed deposit of 2,000 yuan and one for a current deposit of 500 yuan. He secretly fled with them. He withdrew all the 500 yuan from the current deposit and managed to pawn the 2,000 yuan fixed deposit for 1,800 yuan.

He squandered the money on prostitutes and wanton spending. Within a few months, he had used it all up. His clothes became tattered, and he looked like a beggar. One day, he returned home, fearing his sister's condemnation. As the sun set, he had no way to think of a solution. So, he surrendered himself to the Huisi Police Station a few days ago. After investigation by Chinese detective Fang Qingyun, Gu Xingfu confessed that after stealing the passbooks, he discussed it with Liu Jimin, who lived at No. 25, Jua'an Lane, Xiangshan Road, Zhabei.

Liu worked as a clerk at Watson's Pharmacy and was a former neighbor of his, so they knew each other. Liu helped him pawn the 2,000 yuan fixed deposit for 1,800 yuan. Then, they opened a room on the third floor of the New World Hotel to discuss the distribution of the money. Besides Gu himself and Liu Jimin, there were also Madam Gao Gu's daughter

and son-in-law Shi Rong, making a total of four people. As a result, Gu got 800 yuan, Shi got 500 yuan, and Liu also got 800 yuan. The remaining 200 yuan was covered by a promissory note issued by Liu. Liu still lives in Zhabei, and Shi has returned to Ningbo. The Chinese detective went to Zhabei and arrested Liu. Gu and Liu were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court the day before yesterday. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the police station,

filed a lawsuit according to the law. According to Madam Gao Gu's complaint about the theft, Gu Xingfu is not my younger brother. He was a beggar since he was a child and often begged at my house. I took him in and raised him. Little did I know that I was bringing a wolf into the house and raising a snake in my bosom. When questioned, Gu Xingfu admitted to stealing the passbooks and sharing the money with Liu and Shi. However, this idea was also initiated by Liu. When questioned, Liu Jimin,

denied conspiring to share the money, saying that he saw Gu's luxurious clothes and lavish behavior and issued a promissory note to borrow 200 yuan from Gu, which he had returned and retrieved the promissory note. He then presented the promissory note to the court. After Judge Pan verified the confession, he ordered the two defendants to be detained and await another hearing at a later date.

### Apprentice Dies Tragically

Sent to Zhenru for Autopsy

Sun Quan, 26 years old from Wuxi, runs a blacksmith shop at No. 81, Dapu Road, Shanghai South. Yesterday afternoon, for some unknown reason, he beat his apprentice Yao Jincai, 14 years old from Yixing, to death. After receiving the news, the police station in charge took Sun, along with the deceased's father, Yao Jinbao, 50 years old, to the station for interrogation. The local guarantor was notified to report to the local court to appoint a prosecutor to visit the scene. It was verified that Yao Jincai had bruises on his face and legs. However, a purplish-black color was found on his lips, possibly indicating internal poisoning. The guarantor was instructed to carry the body to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for a detailed autopsy to clarify the truth and facilitate legal proceedings.

### The Gold Exchange Held its Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday

The Gold Exchange held its second annual shareholders meeting at the exchange's market yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Du Yuesheng. Executive Director Xu Busun reported on the business situation of the current session, and Supervisor Zhang Qingsheng reported on the account summary of the current session. The meeting was adjourned after the bell rang.

### Japanese Man, Kimura Koichi, Invents a New Method of Dendrobium Cultivation

It is Said That it Can Overturn the Herbal Classic's Theory

According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, Dendrobium, which is drunk every morning by the famous Mei Lanfang for longevity and beautiful singing, has long been noted by plant scholars around the world. However, because the yield of this Dendrobium is not high and the value is high, and it grows naturally on the cliffs of deep mountains and is not easy to cultivate on flat ground, it is a precious medicinal herb in Chinese medicine. Kimura Koichi, a pharmacist at the Pharmaceutical Research Room of the Institute of Natural Sciences in this city, has been studying Dendrobium since 1931. He went to the original producing areas of Taiwan, Guangdong, and Guangxi to collect a large number of materials. After years of research, he has achieved a major breakthrough, that is, Dendrobium, which cannot be planted on flat ground, has now broken through the difficulties and can be cultivated anywhere. He has worked hard for three years to not only be able to cultivate on flat ground, but also to revive those that have withered and died and discovered about 150 new species. In addition, the original plants of Dendrobium medicinal materials are divided into more than 30 species, thus obtaining a complete picture of the Dendrobium medicinal material science. This great invention has completely overturned the established theories on Dendrobium and the original plants of Dendrobium medicinal material science recorded in the herbal classic. Currently, Kimura has sent his thesis to Tokyo and will publish it soon.

### Zhu Qinglan Discusses Disaster Relief in Various Provinces

According to Xin Xin News Agency, Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. According to him, his trip to Shanghai this time is to attend the meeting of the Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Disaster Relief Association. Regarding the recent urgent disaster relief in various provinces, such as the 300,000 yuan Henan public bond, the Henan Disaster Relief Association has sold it for 183,000 yuan in cash, together with the province's disaster relief reserve fund of 30,000 yuan and the Shanghai Disaster Relief Association's 10,000 yuan, totaling 223,000 yuan. All of them have been distributed to the counties with the most severe disasters by the joint supervisory commissioner Tang Zongguo, totaling 220,000 yuan. The remaining 3,000 yuan will be allocated to disaster relief orphanages in the three disaster areas of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang to rescue orphaned children. The first disaster relief loan of 230,000 yuan in Guizhou was presented in person by Zhou Gongshen, chairman of the provincial disaster relief association, to request handling of Pingtiao in Nanjing, so that disaster relief can be provided continuously. The provincial supervisory commissioner Cheng Jingsheng also agreed, and the association presented the case to the court for approval. As for the second disaster relief loan of 100,000 yuan, it will be considered and relieved after Commissioner Cheng arrives in Guizhou for inspection. As for the 80,000 yuan of national currency for disaster relief in Xikang bandit areas, Supervisory Commissioner Shi Hongsan has sent personnel to various disaster-stricken counties to investigate and distribute. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation in the province, it may take two or three months to complete the work. In addition, disaster relief in Mazong Mountain in Qinghai and Ningxia is being investigated and distributed by Commissioner Du Shaopeng in the disaster areas.

### Dong Laizhou Opens a Brothel and Colludes with Relief Society to Claim Young Girls

Intent to Turn Young Girls into Prostitutes, Fortunately Rescued After Lawyer Reported to Society

Zhou Xiuying, a girl from Nanxiang, 15 years old, was adopted by Chen Wang, a Cantonese woman on North Sichuan Road, on November 17th last year. Due to abuse, she was sent by the court to the Women and Children Relief Society for care. On January 12th of this year, Dong Laizhou, a Tongzhou native who lives at No. 558 Peng Road and runs a brothel, colluded with Lu Chen, a woman from Nanxiang, and the girl's fugitive maternal uncle, Chen Heshang, to take Xiuying out of the Women and Children Relief Society. She stayed at Dong's brothel. Because she was young and had never received guests, a lawyer found out and wrote to the Women and Children Relief Society to send inspector Du Yongfang to report to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese detectives Chen Lianjing and Huang Yulin went to arrest Dong Laizhou and Chen Chen, and brought the girl Zhou Xiuying to the police station. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The girl was sent back to the Women and Children Relief Society. The other day, Judge Xiao Xieffen opened the Third Criminal Court for continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, stated that the date for cross-examination should be changed. He questioned Zhou, stating that Dong Laizhou was not her relative and Lu Chen was not her aunt. Taking the girl out was malicious and intended to turn Xiuying into a prostitute for profit, which was extremely despicable. He requested severe punishment. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao ruled that Dong Laizhou and Lu Chen be sentenced to three years in prison as a warning.

### Thirty Million Cantonese People Face the Threat of Starvation

— Jian Ping

With the problem of skyrocketing grain prices becoming increasingly serious, Guangdong, which relies on foreign rice and rice from other provinces, is inevitably experiencing a sudden and severe deterioration of its food situation, which was to be expected. However, precisely because of this, we cannot but pay close attention to this issue that affects the lives of people across the country. The "thirty million Cantonese people face the threat of starvation" is actually a prelude to the transformation of 450 million compatriots into starving ghosts.

Regarding the problem of skyrocketing grain prices, it is generally understood that hoarding by unscrupulous merchants and high-priced purchases by the enemy are the main reasons. However, using these general reasons to bypass the grain panic in Guangdong Province, although not unique, contains a great local phenomenon, which has its differences. In other words, the causes of the grain panic in Guangdong Province also have their local characteristics. I believe that those who have dabbled in writings on the grain issue in Guangdong Province, or who have been to Guangdong and lived there, may understand the source of grain supply in Guangdong Province. And what Guangdong Province lacks most is, of course, the main 'rice'. The figures for Guangdong Province's reliance on foreign rice and rice from other provinces are copied below:

"Since the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1912-1933), Guangdong Province has imported a total of over 179 million dan of foreign rice, with an average of over 8.1 million dan imported annually. As for the import of domestic rice from various provinces, the number is also considerable, with an average of over 2 million dan per year over the past 22 years, with Anhui rice accounting for half, and the rest being Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hunan rice. According to this, the combined import of foreign and domestic rice averages about 10 million dan per year." (According to Guangzhou correspondence published in this newspaper on the 26th)

From this figure, we see the following phenomenon: Guangdong Province almost entirely relies on foreign rice imports: and foreign rice imports account for more than 80%. From this perspective, the grain panic in Guangdong Province has been a "22-year" affair, no, in fact, it can be said to have been going on for an unknown number of years; and, if the supply of foreign rice stops one day, '20 million Cantonese people' are 'in danger of starvation' at any time. However, we have been ignoring this issue, which contains such great severity, without paying the slightest attention, until now that the crisis has become a reality, and only then do we "call for help" and "provide relief," which is not without the harm of the "treating the head when it hurts" policy. However, "it is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost," and the fundamental cure for this problem is indeed what urgently needs to be discussed at present.

The severity of the current crisis can be manifested in the following: First, "even inferior brown rice costs more than six catties per yuan." Second, "famine riots of robbing rice have occurred in Nanhai, Gaoming, Shunde, and Sanshui (these four counties are all first-class counties)." Third, "even Zhongshan County, which is known as a model county, is eating bran and sweet potato due to the rice shortage." Fourth, in Guangzhou, there are "groups of three or five people, going from store to store begging for food, and even if the police are dispatched, they cannot handle it." Now let's talk about the most terrible scene—Guangzhou "has only over 3.93 million catties of rice in stock, which is only enough for a few days." Of course, in such a dangerous moment, urgently seeking relief is indeed a necessary thing. Therefore, the four proposed methods, such as: 1. Exempt foreign rice tax; 2. Stop rice merchants from hoarding; 3. Reduce grain transportation costs; 4. Reiterate the ban on the export of domestic rice. All are last resorts, especially the first one, which is a method of "cutting flesh to heal sores." At the same time. In today's situation where food is in a state of panic across the country, shipping rice from other provinces to Guangdong is by no means a foolproof method. The crux of the problem of not being able to be self-sufficient and self-supporting cannot be reversed by four passive methods. The situation is critical, how can we sit idly by and watch 20 million Cantonese people starve!

### Reflections After Watching "Living in a Drunken Dream"

— Li Yi

Amateur Actors Perform at the Carlton

In terms of meaning, among the three programs performed by amateur actors this time, "Living in a Drunken Dream" is the most active. "The Demon of Desire" has too much of Tolstoy's flavor: "Thunderstorm" only exposes, although in this gloomy tragedy, there is also a Varvara who runs away with her lover: As for this "Living in a Drunken Dream," the Jia Lizhen here sees more than Nora, understands more, and leaves more clearly and correctly than Nora.

Therefore, if it is said that Nora's departure has only two paths, going home and becoming a prostitute, then Jia Lizhen should be outside these two paths. Her departure is no longer the concept of Nora, and what she is fighting for is no longer just for the so-called human rights. Her future should and must be more promising than Nora's.

Perhaps it is the limitation of the objective environment? It is a pity that, regarding Jia Lizhen's engagement in the aid-Sui movement, apart from telling us in the description, we did not even hear a single line on the stage. Although there is a line saying "the country must be loved," it is obviously not enough to give strength to Lizhen's later departure: I don't know Okse's original work, nor have I seen the adapted script, but based on the brief description, I dare to believe that the existence of Jia Lizhen's character must be written as "the country must be loved" on the one hand, and on the other hand, in her daily life, she is like other petty-bourgeois daughters, she cannot do without love, and she spends most of her energy on love. When the dream of love is shattered, she realizes that even Ji Dewen, who pursues her every step of the way, will turn away after knowing that she has been deceived and is pregnant. Therefore, she realizes that these problems are by no means her own personal problems, so she resolutely leaves and embarks on her new path.

In the original script, the patriotic part of Jia Lizhen may not have been much, but what we see now is really too little, so little that Jia Lizhen's subsequent awakening becomes sudden. Is this the director's negligence or the limitation of the objective environment? From the fact that there is the word "aid-Sui" in the description but no lines are seen, the latter reason may exceed the former.

It is gratifying to digest world-famous plays and adapt them to suit national conditions. "Living in a Drunken Dream" connects the current aid-Sui issue, and this effort is naturally even more admirable. In addition to the aforementioned Jia Lizhen, the insertion of the 'traitor' Jia Jiangnan who betrayed his friends, in principle, can of course exist and should exist, but, as we see it now, such a character as Jia Jiangnan is really too obscure (the reason for his terror is only explained in the third act, which is too late). In the tone of the play, the insertion of such a character as Jia Jiangnan seems to be hindered quite a bit in the atmosphere.

Such a character as Jia Jiangnan is not very harmonious with the tone of "Living in a Drunken Dream" (another example is the insertion of Mrs. Li). I think the problem with the director's technique is not unrelated. The director here seems to be too focused on jokes, so that when Mrs. Li comes on stage or Jia Jiangnan screams in terror from the room, the atmosphere of the play suddenly changes. Because of the suddenness, the feeling is somewhat unnatural.

Secondly, it is the issue of character portrayal. In "Living in a Drunken Dream," the character portrayal is very profound, and each person's personality is very obvious, but although the playwright has put white powder on their noses, the satire is still not deep enough. Once the satirical power of the play is weak, the impression given to the audience will also lose some of the expected effect.

Regarding the stage design, it is very beautiful here, just like the other two plays, but in my opinion, I think it is enough to build an indoor set. The roof can be omitted, and the treetops outside can be omitted. As it is now, the scenery outside is not of any special use, and when the door is opened, the shadow of the door is reflected on the sky curtain outside, which is also not very pleasant, so why not simply omit it? If it is said that it is to show the change of time, then even indoors, it can be changed with lighting.

Regarding the actors' acting skills, Gu Eryi and Shi Chao are both extremely good. Li Lin's role is very heavy, but here she has managed to do it with ease. Zhao Dan's acting is calm and experienced, but he still cannot be seen as a villain who deceives women's chastity: Li Qing, who plays Jia Jiangnan, and Lan Ping, who plays Mrs. Li, are good in acting, but because they are not in harmony with the tone of the play, they somewhat affect the impression given to the audience. Zhang Ke and Wu Mei work hard and are generally very responsible.

Regarding the effect, it cannot be considered bad, but I think the slogans of the crowd are not heroic enough. Perhaps it is because there are too few people shouting backstage, otherwise, the threat to the person who betrayed his friends would definitely be greater.

### Wu Mei and Li Lin Play Mother and Daughter Separately

### Patriotic Noble Lady

— Mu Yi

On Saturday evening, the ballroom of the Grand Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road was packed with distinguished guests from all walks of life. It turned out that a certain gentleman was holding a social dance party there.

Among the guests, there was a noble lady who attracted the most attention, because she was not only beautifully dressed, beautiful in appearance, and moved in rhythm, but especially her hair, which was black and bright, and exuded bursts of subtle fragrance from her hairline, which entered other people's nostrils and attracted their attention.

Those who don't know always think that the hair lotion she uses is a high-end foreign product, so that it can make her hair so black and so fragrant. In fact, the fragrant hair lotion she uses is the domestic "131 Hair Lotion," so she can truly be called a 'patriotic noble lady'. (Note: 131 Hair Lotion is a product of Wuzhou Rongfang.)

### Different Joys and Sorrows

— Fang Lin

The families of Mr. Jia and Mr. Yi live on the same street, but their families have different joys and sorrows.

The family of Mr. Yi is filled with a gloomy atmosphere. The adults and children are often sick. Neighbors often hear the moans in their house, and others often see the sad faces of their family members, because they do not pay attention to hygiene, and take ineffective medicines for their illnesses, causing the illnesses to drag on, so this gloomy phenomenon is created.

The family of Mr. Jia is the opposite of Mr. Yi's. Their house is filled with a happy atmosphere. The adults and children are all healthy. Neighbors often hear the laughter and joy in their house. ... Because their family usually uses sanitary products from Wuzhou Pharmacy, they rarely get sick. If they do get sick, they must use the good medicine prepared by Wuzhou, so that a major illness becomes a minor illness, and a minor illness becomes no illness.

### Wind and Cloud

— Liu Wang

Wind

There, in the distant hometown, whenever the setting sun lingered on the treetops of the sparse forest, on the narrow ancient road, there would be an elderly woman gazing towards the end of the road.

The woman was really too old. Her rickety appearance and slow steps proved that she had lived in this world for an infinitely long time. The arduous burden was beyond her ability to bear. For the sake of her husband, her children, and even every ruthless oppressor, she was finally bent over by many heavy burdens. Her unhealthy little feet, although weakened by the long white cloth that wrapped them when she was young, still helped a lot and replaced a lot of hard work when her husband was busy with farming. Now, all the strength of the past has disappeared, and she walks with a limp. If it weren't for the support of that cane, perhaps she would accidentally lose her footing and fall to the ground, never to be able to get up again.

The evening wind blew harder. It blew through the sparse forest, urging down the withered yellow leaves: it also blew through the old woman's temples, making the silver-white strands of hair all messed up. She raised her withered hand, slightly tidied her scattered hair, and moved forward a few steps with the cane. Her lifeless eyes gazed vaguely into the distance, where she deposited a hope, a warmth. She looked towards the other side of the distant road, where a young man would come. This young man was none other than her son, whom she had been thinking about day and night for several years.

Every evening, she always came with a cane, full of great hope, but always went home in disappointment in the twilight. No one understood her grief and compassion, and no one comforted her. Life withered and dried up in expectation.

The evening wind blew her silver hair, and when she used her withered hand to comb it again, all the white hair that was about to fall out had already fallen.

Cloud

"Floating clouds, a traveler's heart; setting sun, an old friend's feeling!" Every time a wanderer on the horizon reads these poignant lines that describe it so vividly, they can't help but shed tears.

Naturally, clouds are heartless things, they neither

## Page 22

have their own emotions, nor can they convey emotions for people. However, wanderers, after all, can hardly resist their sorrow towards them, which is naturally just the sustenance of people's emotions: however, the clouds are enough to symbolize the wanderers, and they are really too similar.

Floating clouds have no feet, so they have no fixed place of residence: they are just arbitrarily blown there by the pushing of the heavenly wind. And floating clouds are still fickle, they can become heroes, they can also become butterflies, and finally, perhaps everything will be completely scattered. This is just like the wanderer's unsettled whereabouts, drifting everywhere, living everywhere. Joy, sorrow, comfort, worry, all kinds of emotions are intertwined in the chest, but they turn into indifference.

When there is nothing to do, or when suffering from worries, one often stands in an open place, gazing sadly at the white clouds in the west, and often easily thinks of one's hometown. The fluttering white clouds are moving slowly, and this posture reminds people of the white-haired old mother's heavy steps. Perhaps at this time, the old mother is on the ridge, looking at the end of the road, waiting for the wanderer to return? And the deeper memory is those flocks of sheep on the grassland under the white clouds. When I was a child, I often grazed there, lying on the grassland and looking up at the floating clouds in the sky. There were many heroic ambitions and hopes entrusted in the depths of the white clouds. What about now? Nothing has been achieved, sadly gazing at the fluttering floating clouds, there is only a full of shame, and the longing for the old mother in my hometown!

### Boat

— Shen Bing

The boat carries the wind, carries the waves. The boat and the wind and the waves are rubbing against each other. Being grabbed, thrown, and stumbling as if unable to stand firm. The wind splits the boat, and the sea is trembling. The boat has also become a useless and clumsy person, like the Weakwater bird that cannot keep up with the battle of life, and the clumsy penguin, poetic feelings, and book meanings also hinder the scenery of the sea storm.

The boat is thrown into despair, and only sees a world of huge expanses of seawater.

The young boatmen hold the rudder, strangle the cable, and the sails kiss the dark water, like white butterflies flying towards black butterflies. The foam splashes higher than the ship's rafters, wetting their heads, wetting their chests, until the sails kiss the dark water, and the boat sways as if it has been knocked down, lying on the bed of the sea, and the young boatmen hold the rudder.

But as soon as the mast tilts, the boat struggles again. The boat body is dripping with water, as if it cannot bear the fatigue. The boat looks up and rushes into the sea, being splashed and played with by the seawater, tilting its body, with its head up and down in the fierce battle. Wind, waves, rise, fall, up and down, the sea journey is infinitely far. The boat is in despair, and only sees a world of full waves.

The boat stands upright with its mast, the sails are up again, and there are no longer storms and evil waves on the sea. The boat has created a peaceful and uniform speed. The seawater drags over the side of the boat like the embroidered edge of a skirt and flows backwards. The boat does not sail out of an eternal circle, from day to night, and from night to day.

Who is it, propping up their chin and listening? People are talking on the mast, and the boatmen are asking about the rain and the stars.

### Ballad Singing

Yang Binkui and Yang Zhenxiong's "Jade Kui Dragon"

Yuanchang (1120) from 11:15 AM to 11:30 AM

Opening piece: "Suzhou Scenery" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)

Gusu (Suzhou) is originally a walled city. Its customs and scenery are famous for their tranquility and elegance. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter make up the four seasons. The auspicious times and beautiful scenery are most pleasant. Golden-bridled horses. Oiled green carriages. Also, there are Mi Fu's boats and calligraphy treasures that are exceptionally refined. Those coming and going are all famous figures. Elegant anecdotes have been passed down through the ages. In spring, tour Dengwei Mountain to pick plum blossoms. The fragrant snow sea is evidence of past causes. On the thirteenth of the third month, there is a Pipa (lute) gathering. Red-clad men and green-clad women are crowded together. Zhixing Mountain villas have poetic encounters. The most wondrous sight is the Fan family tomb with its myriad pointed peaks facing the sky. In the scorching heat of summer, it is best to set out from Fengmen in a small boat. The lotus pond is secluded, and its poverty is accompanied by a delicate fragrance. In the evening, take a refreshing rain shower. Walking barefoot back home, the joy is doubled. The autumn breeze easily ages the autumn scenery. The fragrance of osmanthus flowers permeates a round of bright moon. Suddenly, the pearly throat opens, and the melodious singing is like boiling. Stone Lake's Shen Yue Lake boats sail. After touring all eighteen scenes of Misty Cliff, look up and see a curtain of green. It is said that there is a restaurant that simmers bass fish soup in the ditch. Since Yu Youren wrote poetry on the wall, the Jiangnan (regions south of the Yangtze River) flavor has nourished the perch. After autumn has passed, the late autumn arrives again. It is precisely the time when the maple leaves of Tianping Mountain are drunk with frost. Ten thousand branches and a thousand reds are delicately dripping. It is better than watching flowers in the second month of spring. Sometimes, one ascends Tiger Hill to admire the snow. Leaning on the curved railings of the Cold Fragrance Pavilion, one sees a vast expanse of white without Wei Zifu turning back to look. One only feels that the glistening sea of silver is pure and without dust. Occasionally, a guest boat moors at Maple Bridge. The hidden sound of the Cold Mountain Temple's bell is faintly heard. Zhang Ji's poetic soul brings people clarity in their dreams. Count the good scenery of the year from the beginning. I urge you not to waste this time. Make the effort to display the wax in advance as the year-end approaches.

Cao Xiaoying's "Jade Dragonfly"

Zhongxi (1040) from 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM

Opening piece: "National Flower"

Although the plum blossom is not the king of flowers. Its character is noble and stands out from the crowd. Since ancient times, poets have praised and determined it. It is honored as the champion of flowers and is unparalleled in the world. The chrysanthemum is the hermit among flowers. The lotus is also considered a gentleman. Zhou Dunyi loved the lotus, and Tao Yuanming loved the chrysanthemum. The interests of the two are very different. Do you know, the plum blossom combines reclusiveness and gentlemanship. Its nature is gentle, its character is noble, and its appearance is dignified. People in the world mostly praise the peach and plum blossoms. The peach blossom is charming, and the plum blossom is fragrant. The plum blossom only finds peace in constancy. It does not want to follow the trend and learn new makeup. It is elegant and refined and has no vulgar air. It is ashamed to compete with the peach and plum blossoms for fragrance. Without a good matchmaker, what harm is there? The fairy of Miaogu Mountain originally had no lover. Its mountain friends are pine and bamboo. The night breeze is clear, and the moon and frost are its companions. Common flowers should only listen to orders. Who is enough to be the first to herald the spring light? Therefore, it is said that when the new moon unfolds its eyebrows, the stars are mixed. When the old plum blossoms bloom, a hundred flowers are busy. Who knows who its confidant is when the sky is desolate and the earth is old? It is only said that the eyes of the world are blind. Unexpectedly, the amorous spirit also includes Lin Hejing. To find a kindred spirit, one must speak of Meng Xiangyang. Now, the determination of the national flower is even more glorious.

How do they weep, sob, and choke with sobs? The cuckoos wail. How is it so desolate? It is the Qingming Festival. The weather is not clear. Light smoke curls up. Sparse rain drizzles. It leads people to let their tears flow, gently and meltingly. Alas, life is like a dream. A dream is like smoke. Smoke is like rain, rain and tears. Together they drip, drop by drop, mourning Qingming. The intestines and soul are broken. The sound stops, but the tears don't stop.

### American Film Magazine Selects Top Ten Films

— Hua

In the recently published American Photoplay, ten films were specially put forward to select the best film of 1936, and readers were asked to vote autonomously to reject them. The film magazine has held a film election every year since 1902, and this year is the sixteenth time. After the best film of each year is selected, the film magazine will award a gold medal. Among these selected films, Norma Shearer has the most, such as "The Divorcee" in 1932 and "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" in 1934, both of which she starred in. In 1929, it was "The Divine Lady", starring Corinne Griffith; in 1930, it was "All Quiet on the Western Front", produced by Universal; in 1931, it was "Cimarron", produced by RKO; in 1933, it was "Little Women", starring Katharine Hepburn; in 1935, it was "Naughty Marietta", produced by MGM, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. What about 1936? We dare not predict now, but the publication specifically recommends "The Petrified Forest", which is based on the original work of Eugene O'Neill, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1936. The top ten films recommended by the publication are introduced as follows:

"The Petrified Forest" produced by MGM, starring Leslie Howard and Bette Davis.

"Dodsworth" produced by Walter Wanger, directed by William Wyler, starring Walter Huston and Ruth Chatterton.

"A Tale of Two Cities" produced by MGM, directed by Jack Conway, based on the original work by Charles Dickens, starring Ronald Colman.

"The Great Ziegfeld" starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. (This film broke the American film industry's box office record, screening for a total of twenty-two weeks)

"Libeled Lady" produced by MGM, starring Myrna Loy, William Powell, and Jean Harlow. (Released in the United States in December of last year, it was soon shipped to China)

"Modern Times" produced by United Artists, written and directed by Charlie Chaplin, co-starring with Paulette Goddard.

"Anthony Adverse" produced by First National, starring Fredric March.

"The Story of Louis Pasteur" produced by Warner Bros., starring Paul Muni.

"Nine Days a Queen" produced by Gaumont British, starring Cedric Hardwicke and Nova Pilbeam.

"Ramona" produced by Twentieth Century Fox, directed by Henry King, starring Loretta Young, a full color film.

### Short Shots of "Wealth and Glory"

Parents all hope that their children will be promoted to high positions and become wealthy in the future, so the names they choose mostly carry some auspiciousness. Although Ge Furong and Weng Shirong are servants who raise dogs in people's homes, their names are "Wealth" and "Glory" respectively.

Although people are poor, fate is not. The two poor fools unintentionally won the aviation first prize, realizing their names "Wealth and Glory."

The two poor fools who won the aviation first prize used the huge sum of money to support Suiyuan, fools who know how to love their country, fools who are willing to love their country, are really shaming ordinary traitors and misers!

### Visiting the Rehearsal of "Sunrise"

Ever since watching "Thunderstorm" on the stage, I have developed a deep admiration and liking for the playwright Cao Yu. His vivid and sharp writing portrays all aspects of real life ruthlessly. "Thunderstorm" is not only a success for the author's personal artistic creation, but also casts a rising torch for China's long-silent drama scene.

After the author's second masterpiece "Sunrise" was successively published in the Wun Ji Monthly, it not only aroused the attention of the audience who loved "Thunderstorm", but also our literary and drama circles have paid considerable attention to it. Famous writers such as Ba Jin, Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao... etc., have all expressed serious opinions on "Sunrise", and it is generally recognized as a more successful work than "Thunderstorm", a glorious harvest in the drama works of 1936.

Not long ago, I got the news that the "Drama Workshop" will prepare for the rehearsal, which is a very good news. Recently, I heard that it will be staged soon, and this desire also has the possibility of being realized.

It was a late night the day before yesterday. Due to a friend's appointment, I specially went to the club to visit their rehearsal of "Sunrise". As soon as I walked in, I felt a kind of tense atmosphere flowing. Men and women filled the entire room, and everyone was earnestly working on their work. Director Ouyang Yuqian was fully focused on the actors' movements and lines. Under his guidance, all the actors exerted their performing talents. Part of the actors are old members of the "Fudan Drama Club". Their past efforts are beyond introduction, and they are quite experienced in stage performance. This time, "Sunrise" will be excellent under their joint hard work.

I also visited their set. They are all half-section style, novel and unique, never seen before. The designers of this set are Yu Yeyu and Chu Yingyao.

According to the person in charge of the club, they decided that the date of the premiere is: February 2, the location is the Carlton Grand Theater in this city, and the performance dates in Shanghai are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th for three days.

They are all busy, so it's not convenient to disturb them too much. Fortunately, the day of meeting is not far away. Audiences who are eager for "Sunrise", wait!

### A Scene from "Get Rich Quick"

### Huaan Broadcasting

Sun Yu's "Spring Returns to the World" has few remaining shots, and he is now working hard on editing and dubbing.

Shen Fu's new film "A Match Made in Heaven", starring Han Langen, Bai Lu, Liu Jiqun, and Yin Xiucen, has been completed and will be released soon.

Zhu Shilin's new work "The Lost Pearl in the Sea of People" is now actively preparing to start filming. Although Zhu Shilin has been unwell several times, he has been able to overcome his illness and work diligently, never stopping. He also wants to break the shortest record for the production of "The Lost Pearl in the Sea of People". His spirit of hard work in art is worthy of much praise. The film stars many big stars such as Li Lili, Li Qing, Liu Qiong, Han Langen, Hong Jingling, and Yin Xiucen.

Cai Chusheng's "Wang Lao Wu" script has been written and sent to Beijing for review. As soon as it is approved, filming will begin immediately.

Tan Youliu's latest script, named "Mysterious Shanghai", is under review.

The General Factory's Actor Recruitment Committee has selected new actors with skills such as Ouyang Hongying, Ning Xuan, Zhang Wan, and Xia Xia, who have now joined the work, and the rest are still being selected one after another.

"The Lost Pearl in the Sea of People" has been approved by the Central Film Inspection Committee. In the film, Li Zhuozhuo plays an unfortunate abandoned woman, but she wants to be a progressive new woman, wants to not rely on men, work hard and support herself, and raise her daughter. But in this society, she is not allowed to do so, which leads to a very painful tragedy.

Li Lili plays a tour guide in "The Lost Pearl in the Sea of People". She is controlled by money and power, follows the crowd, and lives a subhuman life while bearing humiliation. This is the first time Lili has played this kind of role.

Director Fei Mu has obtained a new subject script after "The Bloody Battle of Wolf Mountain", and the name has not yet been determined.
