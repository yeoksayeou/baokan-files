### My Government's Envoys Abroad Send Notes to the Nine-Power Treaty Signatories

Japanese Troops Invade Our Sovereignty and Violate International Treaties; Failure to Stop This in Time Will Endanger World Peace; My Government Is Willing to Resolve the Dispute Through Peaceful Means

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wang Zhengting, today issued a memorandum to the U.S. Department of State. This document has also been submitted to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. It is reported that the content concerns the Chinese government possibly invoking the Nine-Power Treaty regarding the situation in North China. Ambassador Wang only stated, "China is prepared to take any peaceful measures." (Sixteenth National Telegram)

[Washington] It is not yet certain whether this document constitutes a formal invocation of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the signatory countries have indeed undertaken to respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The memorandum states that the sudden attack on Lugouqiao and the Japanese military's intrusion into North China clearly violate Chinese sovereignty and are in conflict with the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant. If such a situation is allowed to progress on its own, it will not only disrupt peace in East Asia but will also have unpredictable effects on the rest of the world. China has no choice but to use all its strength to defend its territory and national honor, but it is also prepared to resolve the dispute with Japan through all peaceful means of international law and treaties. Following his conversation with Hull, Wang Zhengting stated that he had discussed China's request for the United States and other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to take action regarding the crisis in the Far East. (Sixteenth Gan Central News Agency Telegram)

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, personally delivered a note to Secretary of State Hull. The wording is identical to that of the Chinese government's simultaneous delivery to England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Russia, and Germany. The gist is that the actions of the Japanese army in North China are actually undermining the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922, the Paris Peace Pact of 1928, and the Covenant of the League of Nations of 1919. It is asked that the State Department's experts are currently studying the note. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas Telegram)

[London] Chinese Ambassador to England, Guo Taiqi, today submitted a memorandum to British Foreign Secretary Eden, containing "the current situation of Japanese threats in North China." This document was also submitted to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, except for Japan. The document was also submitted to Germany and Russia. It is faintly heard that the memorandum roughly states that if Japan's aggressive actions in China are allowed to go unchecked, it will not only disrupt peace in East Asia but will also plunge the entire world into an irrecoverable disaster. The Japanese military's attack on Lugouqiao is actually an infringement on Chinese sovereignty and a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations. (Sixteenth National Telegram)

[Moscow] Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jiang Tingfu, visited Litvinov yesterday and personally handed over the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration on the situation in North China. The declaration stated that the Japanese military's sudden attack on Lugouqiao and the large-scale deployment of troops in North China are a blatant violation of Chinese sovereignty and a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Paris Peace Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant. The Chinese government intends to resolve all disputes between China and Japan through peaceful means. Ambassador Jiang also stated that the same declaration has been sent to all signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Seventeenth TASS Telegram)

[Berlin] The counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Germany today submitted a memorandum to the German Foreign Ministry. It is generally believed that this memorandum reiterates China's intention to resist Japanese aggression. It is reported that Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang expressed the same opinion when he visited German Foreign Minister Neurath on Wednesday. Neurath stated that Germany is willing to maintain peace. Ambassador Cheng replied at the time that China is also willing to have peace, but this depends on Japan. If Japan continues to take military action in North China, China will have no choice but to resist forcefully. (Central News Agency, Seventeenth, Reuters Telegram)

[London] The note states, "The current disturbance occurred on the night of July 7th, at which time Japanese troops were conducting exercises. The initial point of conflict was in the Lugouqiao area. Japanese troops have no right to be there at all. Article 9 of the 1901 Boxer Protocol stipulates that the locations where foreign troops are stationed do not include Lugouqiao, Wanping County, and Fengtai. Japan's claim based on this treaty is already untimely and has no basis at all. Even according to the text of the Boxer Protocol, Japan has absolutely no reason to station troops and conduct exercises in these places... Under the pretext of demanding to search for a missing Japanese soldier within the defense perimeter of the Chinese army, the Japanese army attempted to forcibly enter Wanping County, where the Chinese army was stationed, at night, knowing that the Chinese army would definitely refuse. They deliberately did this in order to launch a further act of aggression against North China. This is obviously evident." The note continues, "Currently, there are over a hundred Japanese aircraft and approximately 20,000 soldiers concentrated near Beiping and Tianjin. The Chinese authorities have exhausted all means, even allowing both sides to withdraw troops, in the hope of stopping the hostilities. However, every time a solution is reached, it immediately becomes invalid due to the Japanese army's renewed attack." The note concludes by stating that the Chinese government believes that "this act of aggression" actually undermines the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty as stipulated in the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. If it is allowed to happen, it will have major consequences in Asia and throughout the world. On the Chinese side, we are still prepared to negotiate any honorable agreement, "but the National Government of China must closely control the basic conditions for a negotiated solution, fearing that intimidating local authorities and promoting the division of North China are the usual tactics of Japanese soldiers, which are well known to the world." (Central News Agency, Sixteenth, Havas Telegram)

### U.S. Government Authorities Reiterate Solemn Position

Warfare Is Sufficient to Affect American Rights and Obligations; Opposition to Promoting Policy by Force; Interference in Other Countries' Internal Affairs Is Also Not Allowed

[Washington] U.S. Secretary of State Hull today issued a sternly worded warning, implying that China and Japan must not start a war in North China to avoid directly harming American interests. Although the article only reiterated American policy in forceful language, without directly naming China and Japan, its intent is self-evident as it was published at a time when the situation in North China was extremely critical. Hull's warning is straightforward and direct, one of the few such documents in recent years in the United States. It states, "Throughout the world, disturbances are not peaceful. People from all sides come to inquire about opinions or offer suggestions. The number is truly numerous. Any situation where armed conflict is already underway, or where there is a danger of armed conflict, is bound to cause the rights and obligations of all countries in the world to suffer serious threats. A serious armed conflict, no matter when or where it occurs, is bound to directly affect the rights and obligations of the United States. Therefore, I feel it is my duty to make the U.S. government's position known to the world. The United States is dedicated to safeguarding world peace and constantly innovating, sparing no effort. The United States also advocates avoiding the use of force to promote its policies and opposes interference in other countries' internal affairs." Hull also stated that the United States has consistently supported peaceful negotiations and faithfully fulfilling international agreements. All countries must respect the rights of other countries, and excessive trade barriers should also be reduced to achieve equality in commercial opportunities and limitations on international arms.

### Japanese Newspaper Issues Vehement Editorial

Advocating the Use of Force

[Tokyo] The Nichi Nichi Shimbun published a vehement editorial on the 17th, advocating for a swift resolution of the North China Incident. The editorial argued that China lacks sincerity, as has been proven over the past decade. Its current attitude is one of Chinese-style procrastination. Japan's conviction is to rebuild peace in the East. There is no other way but to use force. Japan has been too cautious, and China may perceive this as cowardice, which will only worsen the situation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### US and French Authorities Meet Again with Chinese and Japanese Envoys

Gu Weijun Issues Statement: Our Country Is Determined to Protect Its Territory

[Washington] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed his opinion today, saying that the United States should act jointly with other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. Based on past experience, he does not believe the United States should discuss matters concerning harm to China with China and Japan alone. In 1931, the United States sent a strongly worded note to Japan, urging it to respect China's territorial integrity, but Britain did not fully cooperate and merely sent a letter to Japan asking whether it intended to maintain the Open Door Policy in China. Japan immediately replied in the affirmative. Thereupon, the then British Foreign Secretary Simon declared in the House of Commons that Britain did not wish to be involved in the situation in the Far East. Looking back at Japan's reply in 1931, it stated that Japan's dispatch of troops to China to protect life and property did not violate the Nine-Power Treaty. China, as a signatory, naturally has the right to invoke the treaty and request full and frank consultations among the signatories when there is a danger of the treaty being violated. He has not yet decided whether today's memorandum from Ambassador Wang to Hull is a formal invocation of the treaty. When asked if the US Neutrality Act could be applied to China and Japan, Pittman replied that it could not at this time. Senator Borah stated that there is nothing in the Nine-Power Treaty that compels us to act. He will study the treaty and review the diplomatic history of the 1931 incident. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)

[Washington] US officials recently stated that the United States' attitude towards the situation in the Far East has not changed as a result of visits by Chinese Ambassador to the US Dr. Wang Zhengting and Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Suma to Secretary of State Hull today. Secretary of State Hull still advocates for maintaining peace in the Far East and is strongly committed to it. Political figures in the United States say it is still unknown whether China and Japan will go to war or make peace. The United States must wait for the situation to develop before deciding whether to invoke the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 16th)

[Washington] Japanese Embassy Counselor Suma visited Secretary of State Hull today for talks. Afterwards, Suma told reporters that he had explained to Secretary of State Hull the reasons for Japan's "firm attitude" towards China. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 16th)

[Washington] Suma told reporters that he had informed the Secretary of State of the Japanese government's firm intentions in North China. When asked if he had repeatedly assured Hull that the Japanese government had no plans to seize new territory in China, Suma replied that it goes without saying. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)

[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos met separately with Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Uchiyama, Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, and Soviet Ambassador to France Surits today to discuss the North China Incident. Afterwards, Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun issued a lengthy statement to Havas, saying that the Chinese government has informed all governments that China will not recognize any agreements concluded by local authorities in North China under duress from Japan without the approval of the central government. China is determined to resist by all means if Japan commits any further acts of encroachment on China's territorial sovereignty. He continued, "If northern China were to be controlled by Japan, it would become the prelude to a second Russo-Japanese War, and the impact would be unimaginable. Moreover, the fundamental principles of international law and international relations are now seriously threatened by Japan's attitude. China's independence is not only essential for maintaining the balance of power in East Asia, but also for maintaining the balance of power throughout the world. If Japan were to control China, not only would the vast interests of European and American countries in China be eliminated, but the danger to European and American colonies in Asia would also be extremely great."

In addition, Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Uchiyama told Havas that "there are good prospects for resolving the current dispute between China and Japan. Japan's protection of its interests in North China does not include military occupation of Beiping and Tianjin." He also said that Britain and France have not interfered diplomatically with the Japanese government, but have merely engaged in a form of contact based on humanitarianism. In France, it is rightly believed that peace in the Far East is a major condition for peace throughout the world. France has also applied to Japan and China in a friendly manner to maintain a moderate attitude. I am deeply impressed by France's impartial attitude and its full understanding of various issues in the Far East. We have the right to take the most appropriate "defensive" action if our people are "detained or mistreated," but this does not mean that the worst-case scenario is inevitable. In short, there is a possibility that the Chinese and Japanese authorities in North China will find a solution. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 16th)

### American and French Newspapers Comment on the Far East Situation

[Paris] Newspapers of both the left and right wings here continue to comment on the situation in the Far East, saying that the resistance Japan is encountering in North China is far greater than what it encountered in Manchuria previously. The Socialist Radical newspaper L'Œuvre stated that Article 7 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that the signatory powers should consult each other immediately when any situation arises that any one of them believes involves the application of the treaty. However, this provision may not be implemented, partly to avoid appealing to Italy and partly because European and American countries may not be willing to protest to Japan. On the contrary, "the main obstacle that Japan encounters in its rapid expansion into northern China is the rise of Chinese nationalism, the progress of the National Government, and the good reputation that outstanding elements of the new China have earned in countries around the world. The first result of this situation is that the new Chinese army, equipped with new weapons, is determined to defend the National Government and will not allow Japanese aggression." It is believed that Japan intends to start locally and gradually devour all of China to avoid a large-scale war. The Communist newspaper L'Humanité stated that the existing balance of power of the Pacific nations is no longer favorable to Japan for three reasons: (1) China has been unified, (2) there is progress in the anti-fascist movement within Japan, and (3) the Soviet Union is strong. The Socialist Radical newspaper L'Ère Nouvelle stated that Japan's attitude is endangering not only China but also the Soviet Union, "especially since the Soviet Union is committed to peace and has recently received clear proof of this (referring to the Heilongjiang incident)." The right-wing newspaper L'Ordre warned Japan not to act rashly, saying that if it does, the diplomatic achievements that Japan has gained in the last fifteen years will be diminished. "Other countries, especially the great powers, have also engaged in annexation, but their digestive power has not yet recovered," it said. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 17th)

[New York] Regarding the Lugouqiao Incident, major newspapers in New York published articles commenting on the 14th and 15th. The New York Times said that advocating that this conflict is a local event and advocating that the Nanjing central government should not interfere is a long-standing excuse for Japan to undermine China's territorial integrity. Japan's claim to develop the rich resources of North China is also a form of aggression. The current Konoe cabinet, with its so-called free will, is clearly controlled by the Japanese military. Regardless of what Japan's policy goals are, they have strengthened the self-defense of the Chinese people and made it difficult for European and American opinion to sympathize with them. The New York World Telegram commented that the Japanese army's night exercises in Chinese territory this time are reminiscent of the mischief that the Japanese made in 1931. Their proposed joint anti-communist defense in North China further shows their desire to open the gates of North China and allow their troops to run rampant. The New York Herald Tribune said that the fate of China today is only two paths: either watching the Chinese provinces fall one after another, or defending themselves by force.

### Taixu Sends Telegram to Japanese Buddhists

Guling. Master Taixu of Dalin Temple in Guling sent a telegram to all Japanese Buddhists. The telegram reads: To the Japanese Buddhist Federation at Zojoji Temple in Shiba Park, Tokyo, please forward to all Buddhist followers and military and civilians. Recently, the Sino-Japanese conflict has reached an extremely dangerous point, which will plunge the Chinese and Japanese peoples into years or decades of mutual strife and killing, ultimately leading to Japan's suicide and leaving the Earth in a tragic disaster. It is time to rein in at the precipice, quickly stop all military actions, and seek a path to understanding through equal diplomacy, so that the Chinese and Japanese peoples can ultimately truly join hands and open up the era of great unity for humanity. Whether this can be achieved depends on whether Japan can ring the bell and untie the knot. I know that there are many outstanding people in Japanese Buddhism, and more than half of the people are Buddhist believers. Now is the time to greatly open your compassionate hearts and enlightened eyes to save yourselves and others. I urge the Council to examine and implement this and send a telegram in reply. Taixu respectfully requests, news. (Special dispatch, 17th)

### On the Spirit of Science

— Xu Xusheng

Science is not merely an accumulation of research results; it is a method. Furthermore, to be more precise, it is not just a method, but a spirit. This is because its methods can be constantly improved, but its spirit remains eternally unchanged. What is this spirit? To explain it in detail would naturally be a complex and endless task, but to speak of it roughly, it is quite simple and clear, and anyone with a sound mind can fully accept it. What is this simple and clear principle? It is that we must use our own eyes to see, our own ears to hear... use our own senses to feel, and our own reason to deduce. These few words have two aspects: First, what we use must all be our own, not others'. It is neither that of the ancients, nor that of foreigners. To demolish the city walls near Xuanwu Lake for no reason, and then, upon hearing the protests from those with high noses and round eyes who claimed that the scenic beauty of Xuanwu Lake depended entirely on the contrasting backdrop of the ancient city walls, to quickly halt the demolition work; this is an example of not using one's own eyes to see. Because in the past, women in our country did not ascend to the upper floors of theaters, the actors who impersonated women created a strange, artificial voice. From then on, this erroneous practice spread, and everyone competed to imitate it, regarding it as the proper sound, to the point where female singers also imitated this sound. No one ever asked: When did any natural-born woman, singing at the top of her lungs, produce such a strange sound? -- The *Zhengsheng* sound in Peking opera is not far from the natural voice and cannot be generalized. -- This is an example of not using one's own ears to listen. Lacking deep sympathy and careful observation of the natural world and human society, but instead indulging in the squabbles of the Literary Anthology School, the Tang School, the Song School, or the Romantic School, the Naturalist School, etc., shouting wildly about "moons and rainbows, flowers and whatnot"; that is failing to use one's own senses to feel. Because foreign countries have auditing systems, we simply copied them, without understanding how the institutions of an industrial and commercial society could be applied to an agricultural society! In the end, if some fool actually tried to report and account for expenses truthfully, there would be no way to avoid being refuted! To the point where the wise, the foolish, the cheaters, and those who spent honestly, no one dared not "do" something when it came to expense reports! Superiors and subordinates deceive each other to comply with an auditing system that is completely incompatible with the social situation! This is the result of not daring to use one's own reason to deduce. -- Please do not misunderstand me when I say this: I am not saying that the auditing system should be abolished, nor am I saying that our old auditing system is superior to the current one. I am simply saying that societies with different economic conditions should have different auditing systems. Blindly copying others is useless. In our country today, education, the judiciary, and other social systems, almost all commit the same error. For decades, many disputes in society have arisen from those who studied in France copying the feelings and reasoning of the French, and those who studied in Germany copying the feelings and reasoning of the Germans, refusing to carefully study what our country's society is actually like, only grasping a superficial understanding, and shouting nonsense without matching their noses to their mouths. -- The second meaning of these words is that when we look, we should use our own eyes, and not other senses or psychological functions. By analogy, those who use their ears as eyes make many laughable mistakes. Walking in the wilderness at dusk, seeing a withered tree, because it is hazy and unclear, using one's own fearful emotions and imagination to supplement it, turning it into a terrifying phantom; that is also not fully utilizing the function of the eyes, but replacing them with other psychological functions, leading to very strange misperceptions. Unwilling to pay attention to the universally valid and undeniable principles in logic and methodology, only picking up fragments of feeling to defend bizarre theories; that is also not using one's own reason to deduce, but instead using incomplete feelings to replace it, which will also lead to an incurable academic attitude. Of course, human senses are often deceiving, and if you want to make it a basis for precise knowledge, you often need to use excellent equipment to assist it and correct it. Moreover, human senses are extremely limited. For example, if a sound wave is above or below a certain number, our hearing will not be able to sense it at all. Sometimes, with the help of machinery, we can perceive things that our original senses could not perceive. For example, due to advances in optics, we can sense ultraviolet and infrared rays that we never knew existed. But, no matter what, all of this is using our own efforts to maximize our own senses. Our seeing still has to use our own eyes, our hearing still has to use our own ears... our reasoning still has to use our own reason. All of these psychological abilities should assist each other, but they cannot replace each other. The great effectiveness of using one's own senses to feel and using one's own reason to deduce can be easily illustrated with a few examples: The development of Russian literature has only a history of two hundred years, and they are very close to the advanced Western European literary countries, making it very convenient to follow in their footsteps. However, the great Russian writers of the nineteenth century, such as Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, were certainly influenced by Western European literature, but their way of feeling was different. The profound emotions they possessed for all of humanity were something that Western European writers lacked. Therefore, although their history is very short and they were greatly influenced by the Western European literary world, they were able to bring out their own unique elements, which caused a great shock in the European literary scene. The development of Chinese literature has a history of several thousand years, but there are still no works that have caused a great shock in the world literary scene. In the last one or two decades, everyone has been diligently following in others' footsteps, and there has been considerable success, but works that can shake the world literary scene do not seem likely to be produced in the near future. The reasons for this are naturally complex, but the main reason is that Russian writers "dare" and are "able" to feel with their own senses, while Chinese writers, until now, do not seem to dare very much, and whether they can is even more difficult to say. The European Renaissance was originally just a revival movement, but after studying it for a short time, it was discovered that the Greek way of thinking was precise but empty. Following them completely would not lead to any major results. So, they bravely and diligently blazed their own trails, creating the modern empirical school, and only then did Western culture experience a great development in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This is also the result of being able to use one's own reason to deduce. Now, if our academic circles have no desire to make any achievements, then it is over. If we still want to make some achievements, then we must clarify this basic point: Following the purely Chinese viewpoint of those who advocate Chinese learning as the essence and Western learning for practical application will naturally not work. Following the purely Western viewpoint of those who advocate complete Westernization will also inevitably lead to a dead end! They have the old Chinese ways as a backing on one side, and the new Western ways as support on the other. That is naturally very convenient for those of us who lean eastward and then fall westward. The path we advocate, relying on our own reason, without support or reliance, going alone, is very difficult and inconvenient. However, convenience is one thing, and success is another. All those who have truly succeeded have come from very difficult paths. Mother Nature probably does not like lazy sons, so she is unwilling to give them easy paths to take, but uses all kinds of distressing methods to temper them, to see if they have the courage to break through the obstacles she has deliberately set up! Only those who have such courage can be considered Mother's worthy children, and are worthy of Mother's favor! This is an iron law of history, and no exception has ever been seen! So, where should we go from here?

### China's Trade with the US Sees Growing Development

Exports Exceeded 50 Million Yuan Last Month, Trade Surplus This Year Could Reach 60 Million

[Washington] The Department of Commerce announced today that China's exports to the United States have flourished by the end of May this year, resulting in significant profits for China's foreign trade. Experts believe that the majority of these profits have been used to increase China's deposit balances in New York and other Pacific ports. Based on current exchange rates, China's trade surplus with the US this year could reach 60 million US dollars. By the end of May this year, the United States imported $51,653,000 from China, an increase of 39% compared to last year.

Remittances from overseas Chinese in the United States and various Asian ports have also increased, especially in the rubber, tin mining, and sugar-producing regions. China's financial position is quite strong, as most imports are secured by credit, with little cash outflow. China is able to pay important bonds on time and maintain considerable foreign deposits. By the end of May this year, the United States imported $93,392,000 from Japan, compared to $67,787,000 in the same period last year. US exports to Japan were $140,325,000, compared to $79,415,000 last year.

### Roosevelt Approves the American Treaty

Specifies Consultation Methods

[Washington] The State Department recently announced that the various treaties signed by the US delegation at the Pan-American Peace Conference last December were signed and approved by President Roosevelt yesterday. The most important of these treaties is the Pan-American Peace Organization Convention, which contains two articles and a protocol.

Article 1: When the peace of the Americas is threatened, the signatory countries of the Paris Pact (signed in August 1928) or the Pan-American Treaty of Reconciliation and Non-Aggression (signed in October 1933) shall consult with other governments in the Americas on peaceful cooperation measures.

Article 2: If war breaks out between countries in the Americas, the other governments in the Americas shall immediately consult each other to determine the obligations stipulated in the Paris Pact and the Pan-American Treaty of Reconciliation and Non-Aggression, and to agree on methods of peaceful cooperation.

When the peace of the American continent is threatened by wars outside the Americas, the scope of the aforementioned mutual consultation measures shall be expanded.

The protocol states, "No country shall interfere, directly or indirectly, in the internal or foreign affairs of other countries. If this provision is violated by one of the signatory countries, the other signatory countries shall immediately consult each other to find a peaceful solution. Any disputes arising from the interpretation of this convention and this protocol by the signatory countries shall be resolved through reconciliation and arbitration procedures."

### Air Defense Drills in Two Major British Ports

Extremely Precise

[London] The sirens wailed incessantly in the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth at midnight today, marking the prelude to the most sophisticated air raid drills ever held in Britain. The entire port was blacked out, including the lights of ships and cars within the port. Residents delayed going to bed and crowded into shelters. Simulated gas bombs and incendiary bombs fell in the streets. Telephone operators and other key personnel wore gas masks. "The dead and wounded" were rushed to aid stations by rescuers. Fire brigades were engaged in dealing with imaginary fires. Air Minister Sir Philip Sassoon flew in and observed the work of the gas defense teams, rescue teams, and fire brigades on the scene, along with Air Vice-Marshal Game, the head of the Metropolitan Police, and many town police chiefs.

### Turkish Foreign Minister Leaves Russia for Home

Close Relations Between Russia and Turkey

[Moscow] The Turkish Foreign Minister, Rüştü Aras, and Interior Minister, Şükrü Kaya, have concluded their visit here and have taken the train back to Turkey via Odessa. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, Deputy Minister Stomoniakov, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Commission Yezhov, and members of the diplomatic corps saw them off at the station. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)

[Moscow] The Soviet government announced that during the official visit of Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras and Interior Minister and Secretary-General of the People's Republican Party Şükrü Kaya to the Soviet Union, they held several meetings with Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov and Foreign Minister Litvinov. After exchanging sincere and friendly opinions on international policies, the two sides believed that the following statement could be made:

First, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, established ten years ago, have been further consolidated through the signing of various border and multilateral treaties and agreements. To this day, after all international changes, they remain as perfect as ever, and their full value to the interests of both sides has been affirmed and proven.

Second, in order to preserve the aforementioned interests, the existing relations between the two countries must be fully maintained in the future and become an unchangeable and stable factor in the diplomatic policies of both sides.

Third, the friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey has been proven to be an extremely important factor for world peace. In order to promote world peace, the aforementioned friendship should be further developed.

Fourth, the tendency of aggression manifested in current international life has created a tense international situation. Therefore, all peaceful countries must pay special attention to safeguarding peace and general security based on the principles of the indivisibility of peace and collective security.

Fifth, the Soviet Union and Turkey's goodwill and mutual trust are based on a sincere adherence to the concept of peace and the aforementioned League of Nations principles, and a determination to jointly assist in organizing peace forces and avoiding supporting or rewarding aggressive forces, providing a basis for particularly beneficial cooperation and all factors in consolidating the potential for peace.

### Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet Naval Agreements Signed

Soviet Russian Far East Fleet Not Restricted. Anglo-American-French Naval Treaty Extended

[London] Great Britain signed naval agreements separately with Russia and Germany today. As a result, the 1936 Anglo-American-French London Naval Treaty has been expanded to include Russia and Germany. Signatories to today's naval agreement were Foreign Minister Eden and First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper for the British side, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop for the German side, and Russian Ambassador to Britain Maisky and the Soviet Russian naval attache for the Russian side. Currently, the Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet naval agreements still need to be ratified by the British, German, and Russian governments. The agreements will take effect simultaneously with the London Naval Treaty after the exchange of ratification documents. On the British side, the London Naval Treaty still needs to be passed by Parliament. The bill will give the government the authority to prohibit shipyards from building ships beyond the limits of the treaty. Foreign orders for arms must be reported to the government at any time. The bill will be presented for a second reading on the 20th of this month, and its passage seems unlikely to be a problem. In addition, France and the United States have already notified their approval. The British Dominions and the Indian government must also approve it. It is said that all formalities do not seem to be a problem. Around the end of July, the London Naval Treaty and other bilateral agreements can be implemented simultaneously. The Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet bilateral agreements are generally not much different from the London Naval Treaty, with only slight modifications in a few points to suit the special circumstances of Germany and Russia. Although the negotiations were conducted at the same time, the agreements were signed separately. Unfortunately, the provision in the London Naval Treaty that the gun caliber of battleships should not exceed 14 inches could not be suspended due to Japan's opposition. Therefore, this clause is no longer in the naval treaty and the Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet bilateral agreements. However, in view of the special situation in the Far East, the Soviet Russia declared during the negotiations that it would make appropriate reservations regarding the position in the Far East. Therefore, the Anglo-Russian agreement also stipulates that the warships built by Soviet Russia for use in the Far East are exempt from the obligation to report their contents. The Soviet Russia can also, after notifying the British government, not abide by the qualitative restrictions in the treaty in the Far East, and there is no need to take the procedures stipulated in Article 25 of the London Treaty. The Soviet Russian fleet had been allowed to decline since the end of the European War, and now it is being rebuilt. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that it should build several cruisers outside the limits of the naval treaty. For this practical reason, Soviet Russia can equip its new cruisers with 7-inch gun positions instead of 6-inch ones. Great Britain will now hold consultations with the Scandinavian countries, Turkey, and Poland, in order to sign the same bilateral treaties with these countries. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 17th)

### German Political Circles Attach Great Importance

Accepting Both Qualitative and Quantitative Restrictions at the Same Time, Claiming It Proves Germany's Desire for Peace

[Berlin] German political figures attach great importance to the signing of the Anglo-German naval agreement, believing that it is a contribution of Germany to curbing the preparation of competition, and is sufficient to prove Germany's desire for peace. It can also be seen from the fact that the method of resolving problems through bilateral negotiations is easier to achieve results. Moreover, Germany is now participating in accepting qualitative restrictions on the navy that have been accepted by other countries. Moreover, Germany is the only country that has accepted quantitative restrictions after the expiration of the Washington Naval Treaty. It is said that the German fleet is purely defensive. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)

[London] The Anglo-German Naval Agreement includes the following three clauses: ㊀ Concluding a "qualitative agreement," both countries mutually guarantee to notify each other of matters such as tonnage and cannon caliber before building new ships; ㊁ Publishing an agreement to supplement the 1935 Naval Treaty; ㊂ Exchanging notes regarding the construction of the large cruiser "Holiday." According to the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of June 18, 1935, the German Navy should not exceed 35% of the British Navy in terms of tonnage, but no regulations were made on the type of warships and the size of the caliber, because the signatories to the London Naval Treaty (1930) were in the process of negotiating. Germany therefore announced that it was willing to conclude a bilateral agreement with Great Britain to resolve these issues. After Great Britain, France, and the United States concluded the naval treaty, Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet bilateral negotiations proceeded until the agreement was signed today. The detailed contents of the three clauses are as follows: ㊀ The qualitative agreement stipulates that the size of warships is 35,000 tons, the caliber of the cannons is 40.6 cm, the maximum size of aircraft carriers is 23,000 tons, and the cannon caliber must not exceed 15.5 cm; large cruisers are 10,000 tons, the cannon caliber is 20 cm, small cruisers are 8,000 tons, the cannon caliber is 15.5 cm, destroyers below 3,000 tons must not be equipped with cannons with a caliber of more than 15.5 cm, the maximum size of submarines must not exceed 3,000 tons, and the caliber is 15.5 cm; ㊁ It is stipulated that the construction holiday for Class A cruisers ends on January 1, 1947, and can be shortened if Soviet Russia moves forward; ㊂ If a special event occurs, this agreement can be reconsidered, just like the 1936 Anglo-French-American Naval Treaty; ㊃ The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is valid until the end of 1942.

### England Expresses Utmost Sincerity on the Spanish Issue

Endeavoring to Preserve the Non-Intervention Policy, and Inviting South American Countries to Participate

[London] The Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session today and unanimously passed the British government's proposal as a suitable basis for discussion. The non-intervention policy has thus been extended. The British plan stipulates filling the gaps in the supervisory system and continuing the non-intervention policy. It has now been handed over to a subcommittee for discussion. The subcommittee will convene on Tuesday morning. At today's meeting, after Lord Plymouth, the chairman, quietly explained the British plan to the attendees, the committee members resolved to accept it in principle. However, several members reserved the right to propose amendments in the subcommittee. German representative Ribbentrop and Italian representative Grandi both praised the British government's thorough planning and declared that their governments were willing to recognize the British plan as a basis for discussion. Ribbentrop agreed to proceed quickly and therefore advocated that the plan be transferred to the subcommittee for handling immediately. French representative Corbin firmly stated that the French government insisted that the withdrawal of volunteers and the recognition of belligerent rights should be interdependent and not separated. Soviet representative Maisky reserved the right to propose amendments but also accepted the plan as a basis for discussion. The Portuguese ambassador stated that when the supervision of the French-Spanish border was restored, Portugal also intended to re-establish supervisors on its border. The chairman then spoke, urging everyone to do their utmost to ensure that this proposal would take effect as soon as possible. The British government deeply appreciates the efforts of all countries to jointly seek solutions to difficulties. The meeting was then adjourned.

When the chairman presented the British proposal, he stated that the proposal aimed to provide a solution that, even if not completely satisfactory to all parties, could be accepted by all. The British government firmly believes that this proposal does not give undue weight to any party's opinion. As a whole, this proposal is the best practical solution in the current situation. The committee is of course free to discuss and make necessary amendments. However, the British government closely believes in each item of the proposal, believing that if one of them is deleted or significantly altered, it will hinder other parts. The primary purpose of this proposal is to restore the supervisory system in accordance with the methods implemented before the withdrawal of German and Italian warships from patrolling. To achieve this goal, it is proposed that personnel be stationed in Spanish ports. These officials will only report the names and nationalities of ships arriving in the ports to the committee, indicating whether the ship carries a supervisor or has been granted an exemption from having one. Other supervisors will continue to perform their duties on board as they currently do. Therefore, the British government proposes that the supervision of the land border of Spain should also be handled on the same basis as before. The second purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the supervisory system in various ways and attach several practical conditions, allowing both warring parties to enjoy belligerent rights, but only after the satisfactory progress of the withdrawal of volunteers and the actual progress of the withdrawal is recognized. The Spanish war has been going on for several months. Its nature in an unusual situation is sufficient to be considered a war between belligerents. However, the situation does not conform to the usual rules. Since the non-intervention agreement has established a mechanism to prevent the transportation of arms and ammunition to all parties, the right to search at sea does not need to be implemented. As for the foreign volunteers fighting on both sides in Spain, their numbers are very large. Therefore, it is difficult to expect the governments concerned to view them as Spanish soldiers, not bound by foreign countries, and to consider them as part of a civil war in which all countries are neutral according to ordinary international principles. The British government therefore stipulates that the recognition of belligerent rights should be conditional on the withdrawal of these volunteers. Furthermore, when the United Kingdom and France pay attention to the four naval powers, and jointly implement patrol duties on the Spanish sea according to the agreement, it can be hoped that they will be able to deal with the naval difficulties that often occur during naval operations between the two naval powers, and prevent the occurrence of danger through joint action. Now that this kind of maritime unity is no longer possible, governments with maritime responsibilities must seek the best way to avoid their ships from being involved in unfortunate events. The British government believes that the committee should discuss the precise conditions so that the limited recognition of belligerent rights can be implemented. It is confident that with the cooperation and goodwill of the committee members, satisfactory detailed measures can be agreed upon. The chairman concluded by saying that it is urgent to reach a compromise and ensure the continued implementation of the non-intervention policy. The attendees recalled that the members of the previous committee had all reaffirmed their willingness to comply with this policy. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

[London] The Adjustment Committee for the Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session at 4 p.m. today. Representatives from all countries accepted the British compromise plan as a basis for discussion. The meeting ended at 5 p.m. The subcommittee is now scheduled to meet next Tuesday to review this plan. After the Adjustment Committee meeting this afternoon, French Ambassador Corbin spoke first, stating that before the issue of recognizing the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents is put to discussion, the following two issues should be effectively resolved first: 1. Sending neutral country inspectors to monitor Spanish ports; 2. Withdrawing volunteers from all countries. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)

[London] Regarding the non-intervention issue in the Spanish Civil War, the member states of the Adjustment Committee have accepted the compromise plan proposed by the British government yesterday as a basis for discussion. The representative of Italy also proposed inviting South American countries to participate. The British government then inquired with the embassies of Brazil and Chile about the opinions of their governments. At the same time, the British ambassador to Brazil will directly negotiate with the Brazilian government. According to reports, the ambassadors of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile to the United States recently met at the request of the Peruvian ambassador to discuss whether South American countries should participate in the Adjustment Committee.

### A Perspective on the Spanish Civil War (Part 1)

— (French Correspondence)

㊀Overview of the Civil War

The Spanish Civil War has been going on for almost a year since it broke out on July 18 last year. The rebel General Franco has received assistance from the world's dictatorships, Germany and Italy. He has no worries about various important military equipment and airplanes. Germany and Italy have also sent large numbers of regular troops to participate in the war, which has led to the prolongation of the war, and a victory or defeat has not yet been determined. When the rebellion began, the Spanish government relied entirely on the people as its support, hastily arming and participating in the fight against the rebel army. These popular troops, because they had not been trained in peacetime, and because the organization was complex with many different names and orders that could not be unified, had these two shortcomings, which led to repeated defeats in the war against the rebel army. In the Battle of Irun, it was lost because of a lack of ammunition (a train of ammunition, departing from Barcelona, was detained in French territory because the non-intervention policy had been implemented). In the Battle of Badajoz, according to a Reuters reporter's report, about 4,000 members of the government's militia were captured and massacred by the rebel army, and the entire wall was stained red with blood. The Spanish government deeply realized that the defeats in the two battles were not due to the inability of the soldiers to fight, but to the defects in the organization and unified command of the army, and specifically reorganized the army to unify command. The anti-fascist people of the world have also gone to Spain one after another to form the so-called International Volunteer Army to participate in the fighting on the Madrid side (a Chinese expatriate in Paris joined the team, specializing in rescue matters, bravely moving forward, and has rescued many injured people, which is greatly praised by the international team). However, in terms of military equipment, it has not been as sufficient and complete as the German and Italian armies, and the number of people is also smaller, which led to the fact that Madrid almost fell twice between November last year and February this year, but it was able to turn danger into safety, which cannot but be attributed to the merits of General Miaja, the commander-in-chief of the Madrid defense forces. Now the government army on the Madrid side has turned from defense to offense, and is winning victories everywhere and making progress. But why can the government army suddenly turn defeat into victory? The biggest reason for this is that the Italian army in charge of attacking Guadalajara in the northeast of the capital of Spain had no fighting spirit, was defeated in one battle, and retreated continuously (more than 1,000 people were captured, including many battalion and regimental commanders). The defeat of the Italian army was so rapid that it was beyond expectation, because many Italian soldiers were deceived into going to Abyssinia to work, and were forcibly landed halfway and forced to participate in the Spanish civil war. When the Italian army was defeated in Guadalajara, Mussolini was in Libya, and was furious when he heard the news, and hurriedly returned to his country ahead of schedule to discuss countermeasures. General Bergonzoh, the commander-in-chief of the Italian regular army fighting in Spain, committed suicide as a result. Now the Spanish government army is also using a very powerful wireless radio amplifier, installed on a car, and driven to the front line, where the Italian team of the International Volunteer Army is responsible for propaganda to the front, and it is heard that the intentional army is deserting and joining the government army. This is a general overview of the situation of the war in the ten months since the Spanish Civil War.

㊁A Farce by the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee

Since the Spanish Civil War began, the United Kingdom and France were the first to launch a non-intervention policy. Although Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Portugal, and other countries agreed, the so-called Non-Intervention Committee was organized in London to discuss the implementation of the non-intervention policy. It took a lot of talk and delayed a lot of time before Germany and Italy agreed to the issue of prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain to fight, which was implemented from midnight on February 21. (Here, the Non-Intervention Committee treats individual volunteers and government-forced volunteers as the same thing, which is really indistinguishable). However, Germany and Italy did not sincerely abide by this agreement. Since the ban, not only have they secretly continued to provide the rebel army with military supplies, but they have also felt that it was not enough, and then they made it clear that they used warships to transport regular troops. At the beginning of March, another 6,000 Italian troops were transported to Spain, and recently 1,500 German troops landed from Saint-Sebastien. Germany and Italy have violated the non-intervention agreement again and again. However, the British and French authorities, knowing that Germany and Italy were acting in this way, pretended to be deaf and dumb, thinking that this international fascist war flame, which was on the string and ready to be launched, could only be avoided by everyone standing aside and watching the sparks of war, which has now enveloped Spain, and only by resolutely continuing this non-intervention policy can the European war be avoided. The first step plan, the matter of monitoring the sea and land borders of Spain, was repeatedly delayed due to Portugal's opposition. After a long period of discussion, it finally overcame many difficulties and found a compromise, and finally implemented it at night on the 27th of last month, sealing off Spain's envelope. The advantages and disadvantages of this method, according to the discussions of people from various countries and the analysis of past facts, are really not optimistic. Moreover, German and Italian warships are stationed in the existing territorial waters of the Spanish government to implement monitoring. If Germany decides to become angry because the rebel army's war is unfavorable, the major coastal cities of the Spanish government are threatened by bombing. A few days ago, a famous French female writer, a former special correspondent of the Petit Parisien (who had been to China), Ms. Simone Téry, gave a public lecture entitled: "A French Woman's Record of Three Weeks in Madrid." When she talked about the tragic situation, all the listeners in the hall were in tears. She said: In the Battle of Malaga, 200,000 refugees fled to the border, and the road was blocked. 50 rebel planes repeatedly strafed back and forth with machine guns, regardless of the old, the young, the women, and the children, and the number of dead and injured was countless... Then, she attacked France's unreasonable implementation of the non-intervention policy and loudly exclaimed: Mr. Delbos! (French Foreign Minister) If you could see this kind of atrocities with your own eyes, I believe you would never continue to adhere to the non-intervention policy... Ms. Monley finally angrily protested: What the Spanish government lacks is gasoline vehicles to transport refugees. Gasoline vehicles are not military supplies. Why should they also be subject to the restrictions of non-intervention! Take a look, this is the result of the tricks played by the non-intervention policy.

### Municipal Party Headquarters and Other Groups Send Telegrams of Encouragement to Song Zheyuan and Others

Telegram from the Municipal Party Headquarters

To Mr. Song Mingxuan, Chairman of Tianjin, Upon hearing that there is talk in Tianjin of accepting the enemy's conditions, the news reports must not be true. We have always known that you, sir, prioritize righteousness and national interests, and take the protection of national sovereignty and the revival of the nation as your own responsibility. You have also compared yourself to Guo Ziyi and Zeng Guofan, so it is known that you would never want to risk the world's great disapproval and destroy your glorious history. However, today's affairs are clearly a matter of right and wrong, obedience and disobedience. Unification is what the country seeks, and division is what the enemy hopes for. The enemy's benefit is our harm. The enemy has always wanted to transform Hebei, Chahar, and Eastern Hebei, placing the two provinces outside the map of China. You, sir, as the head of the two provinces, have the responsibility to defend the territory and protect the country. You can fully serve the country, or you can die to repay the country. There is no room for humiliation or luck. Moreover, North China is the North China of all China, not just the matter of one or two provinces, let alone the matter of one or two people. You, sir, must follow the will of the central government and the trend of public opinion, and carefully respond, resolutely deciding based on the rights of the whole country, and never rashly decide based on the private opinions of one or two people, sacrificing national rights and the lives of the people. Moreover, the Northeast died without a fight, while Suiyuan was fully defended by resisting. The past is not far away, and it can serve as a warning. It can be known that hard work often has the possibility of victory, and humiliation has no chance of survival. With your wisdom, sir, how could you not know this? Now the people of the country regard you, sir, as Guo Ziyi and Zeng Guofan, and also hope that you, sir, will be Guo Ziyi and Zeng Guofan to protect national rights and preserve your reputation. We are eagerly looking forward to your telegram and hope that you will send us a telegram at any time so that we can quell the rumors. Sincerely, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters,

Seamen's Groups

In the bloody battle on the Great Wall the year before last, righteousness shocked the sky. Now the bandits have entered Tianjin and intend to sweep everything away. Since we have already resisted, we should start and end well, and preserve our reputation forever, so that our nation can survive. Today, 36 seamen's associations have formed this association (China Seamen's Anti-Japanese Support Association) to permanently support the war of resistance, and to pay tribute to the heroes of the nation, and to reward the royal army.

### Yesterday's Executive Committee Meeting of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association

Continuing the Operation of the Zhabei People's Education Institute

The Chinese Children's Welfare Association of this city held its 99th Executive Committee meeting at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road yesterday at 12:30 pm. Liu Wang Liming was elected as the chairman. The general manager, Xu Jianping, reported on the association's affairs for the past month, as well as the situation of disaster relief for children. It was briefly stated that the association's deputy general manager, Chen Tiesheng, flew to Chongqing on June 16th to discuss disaster relief for children in various regions with all sectors of society. Four shelters have been established one after another, located in Chongqing, Zigong, Santai, and Jiange, respectively. It is estimated that Chongqing can accommodate 1,000 children, Zigong and Jiange can each accommodate 300 children, and Santai can accommodate 500 children. The organization of each shelter is based on a committee system, specifically accommodating disaster-stricken children under the age of 16, limited to those who are extremely poor and destitute. In addition to providing food, clothing, and shelter, appropriate education will be given. The duration of operation is tentatively set for one year. After the work in Sichuan Province is completed, they will fly to Gansu and Shaanxi to continue inspecting the disaster situation. Furthermore, since the association began soliciting donations for disaster relief, it has received over 10,000 yuan from various sectors. The Ministry of Finance allocated 50,000 yuan, and the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association allocated 40,000 yuan. It is also reported that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will allocate approximately 3,000 yuan from the donation funds of primary schools to the association. Of the 40,000 yuan allocated by the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, 25,000 yuan has been allocated to Chongqing and 15,000 yuan to Zigong. Currently, the donation campaign is still ongoing.

Then, the meeting discussed association affairs and passed the following resolutions: ㊀ Continue operating the Zhabei People's Education Institute indefinitely. The name will be changed to the Shanghai Zhabei Children's Welfare and Education Institute. The number of children accommodated shall not exceed 14 years of age. ㊁ The resignations of Mrs. Niu Huisheng and Mrs. Franklin from the Executive Committee were approved. The vacancies will be filled by Ms. Zhang Xiangwen and Mrs. Yang Ge. ㊂ The association will send a letter to the American Chinese Children's Welfare Association in the United States, requesting a large sum of money to provide relief to children in disaster areas. After the above resolutions were passed, the meeting was adjourned.

Li Guang'an Discusses Rumors of Ji-Cha Listening to the Central Government and Clarifies That All Are Enemy Slanders, Explaining the True Meaning of Refusing Donations - Xin Sheng News Agency Reported that Li Guang'an, Director of the 29th Army's Shanghai Office, said yesterday morning that all kinds of rumors circulating outside regarding the Ji-Cha authorities are absolutely unfounded. He also confirmed this with a telegram from Qin Dechun and others last night, which briefly stated that the various rumors circulating outside are actually attempts to sow discord and confuse public opinion, not worthy of a scholar's smile, and therefore absolutely unbelievable. These remarks are nothing more than slander and injury by the Japanese side, intending to divide the internal unity of Ji-Cha and separate the connection between Ji-Cha and the central government. He hopes that public opinion will encourage them at all times. If one lightly believes unfounded rumors, it will fall right into the Japanese scheme. In short, from Chairman Song down, the entire Ji-Cha authorities, and the entire 29th Army are all determined to dedicate themselves to the country. Whether it is peace or war, everything will follow the orders of the central government. Mr. Li also talked about Song Zheyuan's refusal to accept donations from all parties, saying that Mr. Song had repeatedly expressed to people that in the past, during Ma Zhanshan and the 19th Route Army's resistance against Japan, there were comfort donations from all parties, but later there were rumors that the donations could not directly reach the lower-level soldiers, etc. Mr. Song believes that the army is supported by the country and has the salary it deserves. Resisting the enemy is the duty of a soldier and should not receive extra gifts from the people. This is also to express his hard work for the country.

### Jardine Matheson's Fuhe Vessel Runs Aground

Jiahe Sent for Rescue, Cargo to be Transferred First

The Fuhe vessel of Jardine Matheson, a British merchant firm, is currently sailing on the Sichuan River route. On the 14th, the vessel was carrying cargo from Yichang to be shipped to Chongqing. On the morning of the 16th, when it was sailing near ShihPaotuo, upstream of Wanxian County, due to the rapid current upstream and the receding water level in recent days, the vessel ran aground there. The Fuhe vessel's hull, its forward cabin, was stranded on the reef, causing it to collide and rupture. The front cabin immediately broke and flooded. After the accident, the shipowner urgently telegraphed Shanghai to report. Yesterday, the firm received the news and telegraphed the Jiahe vessel, which is currently sailing on the Sichuan River, to rush to the scene for rescue and to transfer the cargo from the Fuhe vessel to Chongqing. The Fuhe vessel is currently rescuing passengers inside the ship and they will be rescued soon.

### The Shanghai South Hospital Opened Yesterday

Acting Mayor Yu Personally Cut the Ribbon, Complete Equipment, Light Burden on Patients

The Shanghai Municipal South Hospital held its opening ceremony yesterday at 3:00 pm. Acting Mayor Yu personally presided over the ceremony. The details are recorded as follows:

Reorganization Process

The hospital was reorganized from the former Shanghai Public Hospital, located on Santai Wharf Street on the Bund. After being taken over by the municipal government, the buildings were renovated and the internal equipment was improved. Specialized doctors were hired. It is now the only relatively well-equipped hospital in Shanghai South. Although the opening ceremony was held yesterday, most of the wards already have patients, and the outpatient clinic has been open for days.

Attending Guests

Those who attended the opening ceremony yesterday included Acting Mayor Yu, Director Li Ting'an, Wang Xiaolai, Lu Bohong, Wang Binyan, Wang Shaozhai, Cheng Shuzhen, and more than a hundred people from the Chinese and Western medical communities. Zhu Gonghong, the president of the hospital, and all the staff warmly welcomed and provided tea and refreshments after the meeting.

Mayor's Speech

The opening ceremony was held at 2:00 pm. After the ceremony was held as usual, Acting Mayor Yu gave a speech, saying that although the municipal government is currently facing an extremely tight budget, it will do its best to promote public health construction for the health of the citizens. He hoped that the colleagues of the hospital would understand the government's hard work in reorganizing the hospital and should work harder to make the hospital's affairs develop day by day, so that the citizens in the South Shanghai area can have a reliable guarantee of health. All responsibilities are on you, and I hope you will not disappoint the expectations of the citizens. He also hoped that people from all walks of life will give more guidance and practical support, which is also what he prayed for.

Mr. Li's Report

Then, Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, gave a report, briefly saying that Shanghai Hospital was established at the end of the Qing Dynasty, initially established by private individuals, and later subsidized by local authorities and charitable organizations, and was named Shanghai Public Hospital. After the establishment of the municipal government, it also allocated funds for subsidies year by year, but due to the unsound organization and ununified administration of the Shanghai Public Hospital era, the hospital affairs became increasingly relaxed. On December 1, 1934, the municipal government ordered the hospital to be taken over and renamed Shanghai Municipal Hospital, and the Bureau appointed Wu Liguo, director of the Third Section, as the acting president, and Sun Jiazhai as the vice president, to reorganize the medical and nursing work of the hospital first, benefiting the patients. Later, Wu's president's work was cumbersome and could not be taken care of, and Zhu Runshen was changed to the president. On July 1 of this year, Zhu Runshen was transferred to the Bureau as a technician, and Zhu Gonghong was appointed as the successor. Since the reform of the hospital, it has made progress day by day, and it was fortunate that the former Mayor Wu allocated funds to rebuild the new house. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works planned the construction, and now the new house is completed, and the internal equipment is gradually complete. I hope that my colleagues will work harder, and the social people will help each other, and the hospital's diagnosis and treatment will strive for universality, and strive to reduce the burden of the patients, so that the general public can benefit from it.

Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony

After Director Li's report, Acting Mayor Yu performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The gate was decorated with a cross-shaped red ribbon. In the sound of military music, Acting Mayor Yu cut the colored ribbon and then opened the gate, and the ceremony was completed.

Internal Equipment

After the ceremony, Director Li and President Zhu led Acting Mayor Yu and all the guests to visit each room. The hospital is a three-story western-style building. In addition to the rooms used for offices, outpatient clinics, and other equipment, there are also wards with 130 beds. The wards are divided into three classes, the first class is the most expensive, the second class is the next, and most are the third class. There is a sanitation facility between every two wards, equipped with washbasins, bathtubs, and flush toilets. The first-class ward is 6 yuan per day, the second-class is 2 yuan, and the third-class is only 6 jiao. All medical and meal expenses are included. In terms of medical affairs, there are internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, dentistry, X-ray department, nursing department, pharmacy, and chemical examination room. In terms of physical therapy, there are new-style X-ray weaving machines, sun lamps, and thermal lamps. The operating room has the latest surgical machines, shadowless floodlights, new-style sterilizers, and surgical instruments. Other diagnostic and treatment equipment is sufficient for daily treatment.

### Chen Zongli and Others Petition for the Maintenance of the Bond Market

Three Points for Regulations and Procedures, Strictly Investigate Speculators

Xin Xin News Agency reported that Chen Zongli, Hong Meixiang, Huang Zhenhua, Hu Lichang, and others, in order to maintain the bond market, sent a clear telegram to Chairman Jiang in Gu Ling and Vice Minister Xu of Finance. Ning Changwei of the Economic Commission said that since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the national bonds have plummeted by two boards. Although there are bond merchants who believe in national bonds and buy at low prices, the plunge is so violent and unstoppable. The financial circles and gentry and merchants who believe in national bonds have suffered great losses. Vice Minister Xu convened leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to talk about the national bonds, and they should do their best to maintain them and offer suggestions for maintenance. However, unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to short sell at this time of national crisis, intending to cause panic and disrupt the financial rear. Not only can it not be stabilized today, but it continues to fall by two or three yuan. If a broker, such as a certain company, sells a large amount, the amount in the quota has reached more than 10 million yuan. If the quota is not strictly investigated, more people will follow suit, and the national bonds will fall sharply, which is very dangerous in the future. Now, as far as my limited knowledge is concerned, the regulations are as follows: ㊀ In accordance with the regulations of the Flour and Cotton Cloth Exchange, the market price of national bonds on July 15 shall be the lowest price. The Exchange shall only be allowed to buy, not sell short. ㊁ The Central, China, and Communications Banks shall be ordered to maintain as much as possible in accordance with the foreign exchange regulations, and each merchant shall be allowed to arbitrage and mortgage to the three banks without restriction, and be exempt from paying for tracing certificates. ㊂ Strictly investigate the empty accounts of those who take the opportunity to monopolize. If the above three articles are adopted and implemented, the credit of national bonds will be strengthened, and the financial situation may be stabilized.

### Opinions on Improving Housing Problems by the Shanghai Municipal Council Subcommittee

Approved by the Board of Directors with Amendments

Regarding the first paragraph of the ninth recommendation, which is to limit the height of future Chinese-style houses, the committee is aware that its purpose is to make all rooms so low that there is no way to build a mezzanine floor. However, this restriction may not be fair to the residents of the new Chinese-style houses to be built in the future. Therefore, it is proposed to delete the first paragraph, and the remaining paragraph can be incorporated into the eighth recommendation, that is, before the last sentence of the eighth recommendation, add the following suggestion: "The lane should maintain sufficient width, and in any case, it should not be less than five feet." Since the third recommendation is proposed to be amended as above, the second paragraph of the tenth recommendation can be deleted. The first paragraph is proposed to be amended as follows: "All mezzanine floors in houses used for industrial purposes, if they can be easily removed, or must be removed for safety reasons, should be removed immediately." It is more dangerous to build mezzanine floors in factories converted from residences. However, if the original recommendation is amended as proposed, the mezzanine floors built without authorization can be removed without causing excessive interference. The second paragraph of the fifth recommendation is proposed to be amended as follows: "The regulations should stipulate that the indoor air circulation and sanitary conditions should be improved, including adequate toilet facilities and more spacious and safe exits. In addition, it should also be stipulated that in the future, houses converted from residences into factories should not be allowed to build mezzanine floors as overcrowded accommodation places." In the seventh recommendation, before the phrase "houses converted into factories", it is proposed to add the word "future". Except for the above-mentioned amendments, the committee proposes that the board of directors approve and adopt the original report. The Public Works Committee of the bureau has proposed that the board of directors authorize the director of the Public Works Office of the bureau to add two public works officers when he deems it necessary to implement the committee's recommendations. It is also proposed to organize a committee to study and investigate the recommendations of the Housing Conditions Committee, with the Director of the Health Department, the Director of the Public Works Office, Miss Sinder, and representatives of the General Office or the Director, etc. as members. The committee approves the above two recommendations, but believes that some of the points to be studied, such as the explanation of birth control, are not within the scope of the bureau's duties. The committee wants to solemnly state that after the bureau adopts the report of the Housing Conditions Committee, it does not mean that the housing problem can be solved immediately. The bureau does not want to expel people who have no other houses to live in when implementing the recommendations in the report. The bureau will listen to reports on the progress of implementing various recommendations at any time, so that the bureau can know how to consider various plans in the future. However, the situation here is not within the scope of the committee's discussion.

### Yesterday, This Consulate Received Donations to Comfort the North China Soldiers

### The Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Investigate the Truth of Bond Market Changes

The bond market has been fluctuating for days, and people are quite uneasy. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, who is on a mission abroad, is very concerned and telegraphed Vice Minister Xu Kan to stabilize the bond market. In addition to Vice Minister Xu having convened people from all walks of life in Shanghai to talk about it, it is reported that the responsible department of the Ministry of Finance will now send personnel to Shanghai to inspect the accounts of various banks to report to the Ministry for verification.

### Completion of Witness Interrogation Procedures; Investigation of Promissory Notes to Commence

Further Announcement of Indictment or Non-Prosecution; Lawyer Representing Wu Sheng Presents Opinions in Court; Rumors and Hearsay Accusing People of Crimes is Unfair; Vice Chairman of a Brokerage, Shao Wenmei, Summoned in Another Case

After the cotton cloth exchange craze, the authorities investigated and concluded that Wu Jingding, Director of the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Sheng Yuan, Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Consolidated Tax Bureau, were involved in speculation and manipulation, violating Article 130 of the Criminal Code, which states: "Public officials who, by abusing their power, opportunity, or methods of their positions, intentionally commit crimes other than those in this chapter shall have their sentences increased by up to one-half; however, this does not apply if the punishment is specifically stipulated for public officials."

Exchange Law

Article 52: "Those who intentionally fluctuate the market price of an exchange by spreading rumors, using tricks, engaging in violence, or coercion shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no more than two years, or a fine of no more than six thousand yuan." The First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office is conducting an investigation, led by Prosecutor Song Genshan, who has conducted a fourth investigation at the Fifth Criminal Court. Those summoned are suspects Wu Jingding and Sheng Yuan. Additionally, the Shanghai District Court is handling a case of

Dereliction of Duty and Embezzlement

and needs to question Shao Wenmei, Vice Chairman of a brokerage, so a warrant was issued by the Special First Court. Therefore, Shao was also summoned to court today. The two suspects, Wu and Sheng, arrived before 9:00 AM, each accompanied by their attorneys Zhong Liankui, Tong Yuwen, Li Jinfu, Li Gongyin, and Li Guozhen. Sheng Yuan's other attorney, Ma Taohua, did not arrive. The audience, men and women, filled the seats. At 9:10 AM, Prosecutor Song, along with the court clerk, took their seats and summoned Sheng Yuan to the stand. He explained that if the

Evidence is Insufficient

according to law, no indictment will be issued. If both were engaged in transactions at the exchange and did not violate the law, there is no reason to pursue the matter. Therefore, both should speak truthfully; otherwise, if substantial evidence is obtained through investigation in the future, it will be detrimental to both. Sheng replied that he was truly implicated innocently. The court then asked Sheng about his siblings. He answered each question, stating that he has eight brothers and eight sisters, with three brothers and three sisters still alive. He

Ranks Seventh

among the siblings. His sisters are the Fifth Miss, Seventh Miss, and Eighth Miss. The Fifth Miss lives on Avenue Joffre, the Seventh Miss lives on Yu Garden Road, and the Eighth Miss lives on Gordon Road. Their addresses are unclear. The Fifth Miss's husband, Lin Weiyuan (phonetic), is divorced. The Seventh Miss's husband, Zhuang Zhijiu (phonetic), is in business and works for a foreign firm. My father passed away between 1914 and 1915, leaving millions in family assets. We divided the inheritance over twenty years ago. The Fifth Miss and Seventh Miss conduct transactions, but since we have lived separately for many years, I am unaware of their activities. Their finances are

Independent

Each has approximately several hundred thousand in assets. Whether their transactions are speculative or collaborative is unknown as I have not inquired. Our family's ancestral hall is named Shushantang. I do not know Anderson or Dong Zaisun. This time, I am truly implicated innocently. The testimonies of various witnesses are either hearsay or speculation, placing unfounded accusations on the defendant, which is unfair. Accusing people of crimes based on hearsay is

Truly Unjust

Furthermore, I have absolutely not conducted any transactions at the exchange. Now that I have been accused, I request that the court compel the accuser to present concrete evidence. Relying solely on rumors is hardly fair, he stated. The court then summoned Wu Qiding to the stand. He testified, "I have never engaged in cotton yarn trading. It is unjust to assume that I have traded cotton yarn based solely on Chu Qiaqing's statement that I have done so before. Moreover, I was part of the team investigating the cotton exchange craze. How can suspicion be

Placed Upon Me

I can give up my official position, but I must maintain my integrity. Therefore, I implore the court to uphold justice and thoroughly investigate the matter," he stated. Prosecutor Song, after reviewing the testimonies, stated that the process of interrogating witnesses is now complete, with only the investigation of promissory notes remaining. Therefore, if there is no need for further hearings, there will be no more. An announcement of indictment or non-prosecution will be made. He then instructed the attorneys of the accused

To Present Their Opinions

First, Li Jiefu and Li Guozhen, attorneys for Sheng Yuan, stated that Sheng Yuan's investigation was based on alleged violations of Article 34 and Article 52 of the Criminal Code and Exchange Law. The latter article requires conditions such as spreading rumors and using tricks. According to the official letter from the Ministry of Industry, Li Xiangming stated that Sheng Yuan was a major speculator, which the Ministry's investigation also indicated. However, there is no concrete evidence. Furthermore, when the court questioned Mu Xiangming, Mu claimed to have heard it from Lan Ting, but when he was in court, he

Denied It

Stating that Mu was mistaken. According to Mu, there were two reasons for the craze. One was the government's plan to raise foreign loans to redeem domestic debts to reduce interest rates. The other was the shortage of cotton yarn and high demand. The Ministry added a conclusion to Mu's statement, stating that it showed collusion between officials and merchants to engage in manipulation. However, the first reason was based on Minister Kong's statements abroad, which

Were Widely Reported

The second reason is a fact. How can it be attributed to rumors spread by the accused? The Ministry's basis, besides Mu's statement, also included Lu Qiaqing's statement. However, both Mu and Yu stated in court that it was mere rumor. Yu stated that the Ministry's records indicated that Sheng Yuan was definitely a member of the Qixing Company, which he denied. It is

Unlawful

to accuse people of crimes based solely on rumors. Therefore, the court should issue a non-prosecution order. Then, Qin Liankui, Tong Yuwen, and Li Jinfu, attorneys for Wu Qiding, rose to present their opinions, stating that according to Article 3 of the official service regulations, public officials who accuse others of crimes must be as loyal and cautious as when performing any official duty. However, the Ministry's accusation this time

Implicated

Wu Qiding, who had no evidence. The only basis was that Wu Qiding's name was registered under Dai Xinghua's name in the Yuanda Company ledger. However, upon inspecting the ledger, the character "Wu" was initially written as "Hu," and then corrected. This shows that Wu had no connection with the company. Even the surname was initially written incorrectly. Furthermore, Tie Xinghua testified that Wu was indeed unrelated. To manipulate the exchange's market price, one must have transactions within the exchange. Since the accused

Had No Transactions

then why would he manipulate the market price? The Ministry, considering the accused to be an official responsible for collecting cotton yarn taxes, concluded that he was involved, which is adding fuel to the fire and forcibly imposing guilt. This is not being loyal or cautious. After interpreting the testimonies of various witnesses, they also requested a non-prosecution order, and in the non-prosecution order,

Detail the Reasons

so that the public may understand the truth. Then, Prosecutor Song summoned Shao Wenmei to court to question her on the points entrusted by the Shanghai District Court. Regarding whether Finance Minister Zou and Public Debt Division Director Jiang Luofu were present when he inspected the yarn exchange on July 3rd, Shao replied that many people from the Ministry of Finance came that day. They only recognized Minister Zou and did not know if Jiang was among them. Prosecutor Song then ordered her to leave the court and adjourned the session.

According to the English "Greater Shanghai Evening Post," a sailor named Gong Chailishi, who recently became an American citizen, carried a trunk to the Jardine Wharf on Wednesday night, intending to board the "Steel Mariner," a ship about to sail to Manila. He was stopped by an Indian guard who wanted to inspect the trunk, but Gong refused. The Indian guard then called another Indian guard for assistance. Gong then threw the trunk into the Huangpu River. Unexpectedly, as soon as the trunk hit the water, the lid opened, and some of the opium it contained spilled out. A nearby water patrol recovered sixty-three small bars, each weighing five taels. Gong was arrested and sent to the American Consulate. According to his confession, he was a Colombian from South America. When he arrived in Shanghai, he received a message instructing him to go to the corner near the post office of the New Asia Hotel on Sunday. He did not know anyone in Shanghai, but out of curiosity, he went. He saw a Chinese man who greeted him in a car. The man asked him if he wanted to earn money without labor. He answered ambiguously. Later, he met the two men again, who offered him 1,500 yuan to take a trunk to the Philippines. If he encountered any problems, he could throw the trunk into the water. The name of the person receiving the trunk in Manila would be given to him when the ship sailed. He, tempted by the immediate gain, agreed. The two Chinese men have not been apprehended. Chief Judge of the United States Court for China, He Laimike, set bail at US$5,000. Gong, unable to pay the bail, is temporarily detained in the Ward Road Prison, pending further hearings. According to a reporter from this newspaper, when passengers boarded the American ship "Steel Mariner," which was docked at the Qichang Line Wharf in Pudong, some threw a large quantity of iron ingots placed in their luggage into the Huangpu River to avoid inspection. After someone reported this to the Water Patrol, officers were dispatched to salvage the items. In the first retrieval, sixty-three cans were recovered, each containing five taels of opium. Yesterday morning, another forty-five cans were retrieved, totaling one hundred and eight cans, totaling five hundred and forty taels. They were taken into custody pending further action.

### Luring a Young Girl to Watch Lanterns and Introducing Her to a Paramour for Rape

Fearful of Returning Home, the Girl Complained to Her Grandmother; Jiang Yungao and Liu Duanshi Detained and Sent to Court

Huang Yaoge, a local resident who owns a printing shop, is 48 years old and lives at No. 10 Ziyang Lane, Cengshan Road, Hongkou. He has a daughter named Baoshu, who is 15 years old. She lives with her parents. A few months ago, a Hubei woman named Liu Duanshi, 24 years old, rented a room in Huang's house. She was unfaithful and had an affair with Jiang Yungao (40 years old), a laborer in the weaving room of the Taikoo Wharf. Recently, Liu Duanshi, wanting to please her paramour, lured Huang Yaoge's daughter, Baoshu, out on the evening of the 14th of this month to see the lanterns in the French Concession. They went to Room 16 of the Dongwu Inn on Route Wagner in the French Concession. Jiang Yungao and Liu Duanshi, working together, made the girl spend the night with Jiang, while Liu quietly left. Huang Yaoge, seeing that his daughter had not returned home, suspected that the lodger, Liu Duanshi, was involved. After repeatedly questioning her, she pretended to search for the girl and reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. However, Baoshu, after being away from home for two days, feared that her parents would be angry, so she dared not return home. She went to her grandmother's house at No. 8 Shude Lane, Rue Bellesoeur, in the French Concession and tearfully told her grandmother what had happened. Her grandmother then informed Baoshu's father, Huang Yaoge, who reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. Liu Duanshi was arrested and confessed to her affair with Jiang Yungao. Jiang was also arrested. Since the incident occurred in the French Concession, the case was transferred to the French Police Station. Yesterday, Liu Duanshi and Jiang Yungao were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Court President Liao presided over the hearing. Police Department lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, accusing them of violating public morals and requesting an extension for further investigation. After briefly questioning the plaintiff, the victim, and the defendants, the court adjourned the session until 8:00 AM on the 24th for further proceedings. The defendants were remanded to custody.

### Father Disapproves of Daughter's Unauthorized Marriage, Daughter Attempts Suicide

Father-in-Law Publishes Warning, Son-in-Law Panics

Zhang Hongyue, a native of Pudong, is 46 years old and works at the Zhonghua Book Company. He lives at No. 673 Rue Bellesoeur in the French Concession. He has a daughter named Liangji, who is about to turn twenty. After graduating from middle school, she is now studying at the Zhenru Southeast Medical College. A few years ago, she met and became acquainted with Qiu Shaoxian, a young man from Guangdong (26 years old). Qiu helped Liangji with her school expenses, and they developed deep feelings for each other. Liangji's father, Zhang Hongyue, also approved of the relationship and tacitly considered Qiu Shaoxian as his future son-in-law. Unexpectedly, Liangji recently changed her mind and became strongly acquainted with Qin Huilin (23 years old, residing at No. 33 Fuyu Lane, Haller Road, Hongkou), a fellow villager. They developed a romantic relationship, and without notifying her father, she secretly published an engagement announcement with Qin and officially married him at Qin's house on October 27th. When her father learned of this, he expressed his opposition and published a statement in the newspaper, giving Liangji three days to return home, or he would take legal action. Qin Huilin, upon seeing the announcement, panicked and asked people to mediate with the girl's father. However, the girl's father had already set his sights on Qiu Shaoxian and firmly refused mediation. Liangji, seeing that a positive outcome was unlikely, in desperation, attempted suicide. At 3:00 AM the previous morning, she left home and swallowed two engagement rings (one gold and one ivory). Her lover, Qin Huilin, discovered that Liangji's face was pale and knew something was wrong. He immediately sent her in a car to the McGeary Jen Chi Hospital for treatment. The hospital, as usual, reported the incident to the police. Since the girl's home was in the French Concession, the Public Police Department notified the French Concession, and detectives were dispatched to investigate.

### Doctor Flees House, Female Corpse Found Inside

Prosecutor Seeks to Understand the Truth, Performs Autopsy on Scene, Death Caused by Illegal Abortion

In the western wing of the downstairs apartment at No. 3 Buliu Lane, 888 Avenue Edward VII, lived Wang Zhinan, a doctor from Suzhou, along with his wife and daughter. At approximately 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, the second landlord, a woman named Yan Fengshi, suddenly noticed that Wang and his family had abandoned the house. She also discovered the corpse of a woman, approximately thirty years old, in Wang's residence. She reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The corpse was taken to the Phylong Road Crematorium. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhang, accompanied by medical examiners, to the crematorium. To understand the truth, Zhang ordered medical examiners Wei and Zhang to perform an autopsy on the scene. The autopsy revealed that the woman had died from an illegal abortion. The corpse was then sent to the Pushan Cemetery for burial.

### Backed by the Strength of the People

— Mu Chu

Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the entire nation has been extremely indignant. The officers and soldiers of the Twenty-Ninth Army declared that "Lugouqiao can be our burial ground," while Zhang Zizhong declared, "Zhang will never do anything to let the people down." Japanese newspapers also stated that "China's anti-Japanese sentiment is strong." The people in the rear are enthusiastically providing support and sending telegrams of consolation. The entire prison population of Ba County, Sichuan, sent two telegrams on the 16th: (1) fasting to raise funds to comfort the Twenty-Ninth Army soldiers defending the territory; (2) telegram to superiors requesting permission to fight against the enemy, hoping to be assigned and led to the front lines. The telegrams also stated, "Although prisoners do not have the rights of citizens, they have the obligations of nationals, and their patriotic hearts dare not be in vain." (Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th) Mr. Wang Jingwei said: "If people harm us, we cannot but resist!" Now that the Japanese authorities "decided not to interfere in the governance of North China," even prisoners without "the rights of citizens" are willing to fulfill "the obligations of nationals" and voluntarily fast to raise funds to comfort the soldiers defending the territory. We cannot ignore this unanimous voice of the people.

However, news came that the officials of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council were holding so-called "peace" talks with the Japanese in the form of a local incident, and Song Zheyuan, who had achieved great feats at Xifengkou, also sent a telegram on the 15th, saying: "Since the unfortunate Lugouqiao Incident, people from all walks of life at home and abroad have sent telegrams of condolences and have donated funds to comfort the army. With such enthusiastic support, the entire army is moved. This incident is only a local conflict, with few casualties. Moreover, the state has raised soldiers for a thousand days to use them for one moment, and to serve the country and be wounded in battle is the duty of soldiers. The army has regular pay during peacetime and military expenses during wartime. Zheyuan believes that it is inappropriate to seek assistance from compatriots at home and abroad for such small conflicts. While we are very grateful for everyone's kindness, we dare not accept the donations. If a major international war occurs in the future, and the whole country is mobilized, with huge sacrifices, it will not be too late for the state to coordinate donations from compatriots." The state has raised soldiers for a thousand days to use them for one moment, and to serve the country and be wounded in battle is the duty of soldiers, which does not need to be explained, and everyone knows it. The army has regular pay during peacetime and military expenses during wartime, which everyone also knows. However, the reason why compatriots at home and abroad donate funds to comfort the army is to express the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in the rear, which is the so-called "popular sentiment." This valuable spirit should not be rejected outright, and when a powerful enemy is pressing down, accepting donations from compatriots often does not lead to "shame." This is one point. Furthermore, saying that "this incident is only a local conflict" plays right into the hands of the Japanese, allowing them to nibble away at our territory while heavily surrounding us. And can the so-called "peace" talks guarantee that the Hebei-Chahar authorities will uphold their solemn declaration of "never sacrificing national sovereignty?"

The entire nation has unanimously risen up to resist the enemy and save the country, and at the same time, everyone's attention "is focused on Nanjing, on whether it is preparing for military action" (Reuters, Central, 16th). Now may be the time for "national mobilization, with huge sacrifices!"

At this critical moment, we hope that the truth is as stated by the Twenty-Ninth Army's Shanghai Office: "The other side has sent representatives to contact us, making requests, but we will never accept them. There is no agreement at present, and there is no loss of national sovereignty or territory." And in Song's reply to Mr. Sun, Song, Du, and Yang, he stated: "Our army is actively preparing for war at every moment" (Local news, 16th).

Backed by the strength of the people, we must not accept any unofficial "peace" talks.

### After Watching "Golden Field Village" of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

— Li Yi

From "Romeo and Juliet" to "Wu Zetian" is progress, and from "Wu Zetian" to the first part of this "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," "Golden Field Village," is further progress. Being able to progress is undoubtedly gratifying.

Regarding the historical facts of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," as with "Wu Zetian," I can only express my shallowness and apologize for not being able to say a single word about it. Therefore, I can only be a reader regarding whether what is written in this play distorts the historical facts of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and whether the personalities of several leading figures such as Hong Xiuquan, Feng Yunshan, and Yang Xiuqing have been fabricated by the author. I am prepared to read the works of experts who have studied history. Fortunately, the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" is not far from the present, and there are many books on the literature of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" recently published in bookstores. If experts do not regard the play as a trivial skill, I think this wish of mine can always be fulfilled. Then, even if I have seen only a little bit of the records of the historical facts of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," how dare I "teach fish to swim?"

I am a pragmatist. Therefore, for an individual performance, its evaluation, I think,

## Page 20

should be viewed from its sum. Of course, if criticizing, it should be analyzed, and this analysis should preferably have percentages, giving it a fair and accurate evaluation after careful observation. However, for the audience, this analysis is mostly secondary. The impression they see and get is always the whole. As for me, I am exactly an audience member, so my afterthoughts can only be used as reference material for the "Yishi" troupe, to see how the performance of "Golden Field Village" evokes a response in a certain type of audience.

Regarding the significance of "Golden Field Village" being staged at present and its objective effect, I would like to first quote some words from the playwright Mr. Chen Baichen: "Historical plays are about correctly evaluating a subject in history that is related to real life and recreating it through artistic means, not simply moving the history books," "I do not admit that what it (referring to "Golden Field Village") stages has no connection with real life, nor do I admit that it abandons the times, let alone that it is a speculative work catering to low-level tastes!" Based on such a perspective, the author tells us in the first act that "the Qing court ceded land and paid indemnities, which further increased harsh taxes and levies, and corrupt officials and bureaucrats were worse than robbers, and yamen runners were no different from jackals. With 'officials oppressing the people and the people rebelling,' the world became 'full of bandits.'" "Guangdong and Guangxi have been plagued by years of disasters, with wails of misery everywhere. The rich create 'local militias' to protect themselves, while the poor 'Hakka' people suffer from hunger and cold, and have no way to appeal, thus planting the seeds of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution." Such a phenomenon, comparing the past with the present, still exists. What is even more gratifying is that the playwright and director have paid attention to the strength of the masses, attributing the victory of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to this group of people who took the risk, while the root cause of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's failure is foreshadowed in the "manipulation of power by a few villains," and hundreds of thousands of people are kept in the dark. This is not only recording history but also criticizing history. (Whether it deviates from historical truth should be another matter.) Using such a creative attitude to handle historical plays, its objective effect is consistent with the subjective motivation, and there is naturally a great possibility of achieving success.

The second reason why I like this play is that the characterizations are distinct, and with the director and actors' serious efforts, it becomes even more endearing. What is even more gratifying is that the acting skills of several newcomers are not weaker than those of the "veterans." For example, Shu Qiang, who plays Yu Tingzhang, Jin Naihua, who plays Li Yiwen, Fan Lai, who plays Shi Dakai, and Lu Fu, who plays Ma Yunshan, all have excellent achievements here, making people even more convinced that as long as they are used appropriately, newcomers are not incapable of acting. As for the "veterans," Wei Heling, Zhang Manping, and Ying Yin all make me happy. Tao Jin's acting in this play, among the plays I have seen him in, should be one of his best, although he is a bit weaker in the sixth act. Zhao Dan plays Wang Xiucai here, and the role is not important. If it is seen as dispelling the star system, then this should also be commendable.

Regarding the director, the tone of the play is very harmonious with the script. Coupled with the rough but not crude stage set, it has a kind of natural and thick beauty. However, the song "Fighting for the Jiangshan" still lacks grandeur. It always feels like it lacks a kind of vast, earth-shattering power. In some places, perhaps because too much emphasis is placed on the compactness of the play, the climax is not supported. However, fortunately, this is not very obvious. Generally speaking, it can be said to be very tight.

As for lighting, "Yishi" can be said to be unmatched among the theater troupes in the country. The third amateur performance brought drama to light on the stage, and in this "Golden Field Village," lightning and rainbows were created. Although the lightning flash is still not fast enough, and a few times it seems to make the audience feel a pause, it can probably be corrected after a few performances due to proficiency.

However, the position of the lights should be noted in the dark, so as not to be seen by the audience. For example, in the first act of "Golden Field Village," there is a scene (I can't remember which scene) in which the overhead lights can be seen (I was sitting in the seventh row), and in the sixth act, the side lights can also be seen. This small oversight, although it can be corrected with a wave of the hand, leaves a different impression on the audience.

### No Strength Should Be Overlooked

— Jie Ren

Many things are often done out of necessity, and are not what one originally intended. Take the case of those who become traitors; who would originally want to be one? It's certain that no one is born to be a traitor. However, it must be said that those who are depraved and willingly act as accomplices for evil should naturally be considered separately. And there are many such examples. The newspaper's Tianjin dispatch on the 15th stated:

"...The Japanese Army's accounting department stationed in Tianjin secretly organized plainclothes teams within the Japanese concession in mid-June... Recruited ruffians, provided them with training, and gave each person a daily living allowance of six jiao. By the night of the 7th of this month, after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, this plainclothes team numbered about 600 people... They were issued a rifle each by name, ready to be deployed... However, due to incomplete preparations, it was delayed until about 3:00 AM on the 12th when a small number of vanguards were dispatched... Our security forces have extremely solid defenses, so the hastily assembled plainclothes team did not dare to act rashly. They temporarily changed their plans and, in the small alleys near Gushen Street and Fuli Lane in the Nanshi district, a small part of the plainclothes team fired more than ten shots at the Chinese area. Fortunately, our security police at the Yijin Lane intersection were also prepared... These plainclothes team members were usually local thugs and ruffians who did not understand military affairs. Their fundamental goal was to swindle money from the Japanese, and they had no courage to sacrifice their lives. After firing a few shots, they fled with their heads in their hands..."

Naturally, they did not, and would not, estimate the advantages, disadvantages, and importance of this matter. But to say that they intended to betray seems too assertive, right? They fundamentally didn't know anything. We can see that the biggest reason they enlisted was because they were driven by life's necessities. Life is the most cruel and ruthless. A certain side saw this vulnerability and cleverly exploited it. We don't know how many times we've seen this kind of thing.

However, this doesn't mean there's no solution. Naturally, the most fundamental solution is to ensure that they are not driven by life's necessities. But this issue is so significant and difficult to resolve, yet it must be resolved. However, the problem is not so simple. What's more important is to awaken them. People, after all, have humanity. If they have an accurate understanding, they will certainly not recklessly engage in shameless acts of betrayal. From this, we can see how essential this work is at present, and it is especially necessary to link it to practical actions.

At the beginning of the nation's survival crisis, we must mobilize every member to work together to save the country, and no strength should be overlooked. It is our fault, and a loss to the nation, if any strength is used by the enemy. Now the sound of gunfire has already begun in North China! We must mobilize every member and must not overlook any strength, thereby weakening our overall strength. Now is the time for everyone to unite!
