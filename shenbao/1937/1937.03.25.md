### Cigarette Merchants Petition for Delay in Tax Increase

[Nanjing] Representatives from the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association, including Ding Yuanqing, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 24th. At 10 AM, they visited Secretary-General Weng of the Executive Yuan to submit a petition, personally explaining the difficulties faced by domestic cigarette merchants and earnestly requesting that the Ministry of Finance temporarily delay the imposition of a 20% consolidated tax increase. In the afternoon, they visited the Ministry of Finance to petition, and a representative from the Tax Affairs Department received them, promising to forward their intentions. (24th Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Upon hearing of a proposed increase in cigarette taxes, the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association was alarmed. They dispatched a delegation consisting of the association's chairman, Sun Weiting, and representatives from five companies: Nanyang, Huacheng, Fuxin, Huamei, and Lixing, namely Liang Zhixun, Xie Jishen, Ge Xiongfu, Jing Qiankun, and Bao Gengsheng. The delegation arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 24th to petition various government agencies, including the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting a temporary delay in the tax increase. They also submitted written petitions, which were received by representatives from each agency, who promised to forward them for consideration. The delegation concluded its mission and returned to Shanghai by train in the afternoon to report to the Industry Association. According to the delegation, there are two reasons for requesting a temporary delay in the tax increase: First, since private cigarettes have not yet been eradicated, increasing cigarette taxes would expand the market for private cigarettes, harming legitimate cigarette merchants and affecting national tax revenue. Second, during the rainy season, cigarettes are prone to mildew. If taxes are increased, retailers will stock up on inventory, risking spoilage, which would threaten both national revenue and the industry. The delegation also stated that once private cigarettes are thoroughly eradicated, increasing taxes can be reconsidered without harming either the country or the merchants. If a tax increase is unavoidable at present, it should only be applied to higher-grade cigarettes, which can be absorbed in terms of business and cigarette prices, while lower-grade cigarettes should not be taxed for the time being.

### The Issue of Maritime Traffic Safety

— Dou

The "Fuhai" steamer, which travels between Kunming and Kunyang, encountered a hurricane on the 22nd of this month while returning to the province and tragically sank. Of the 140 passengers, it is reported that only two were rescued. The severity of the disaster is shocking. While the true situation is still under investigation, rumors suggest that the ship was old and poorly maintained and had previously suffered an accident. The authorities failed to learn from their mistakes and continued to overload the ship, leading to this loss. Therefore, the disaster was not only caused by the fury of the wind god but also by human negligence.

In the past two months, unfortunate news of maritime incidents has repeatedly appeared in newspapers. Recently, there was the "Changde" steamer grounding on Sheshan Island, the "Helun Qianjiang Ping" steamer sinking, and further back, the "Lao Shutong" steamer's accident when sailing through the Qingtan shoals. The "New Beijing" steamer encountered danger outside Zhenhai port. On a smaller scale, the "Hai Yi" and "Qing Ning" steamers collided, and the "Huikang" and "Fuyang" ships ran aground. On a larger scale, the Guangdong ferry "Minzu" sank, resulting in the tragic deaths of over 200 passengers, and the "Yongxin Kuai" overturned in Pingwang, with over 40 people killed. Such frequent disasters and repeated accidents, with lives lost and losses difficult to calculate, are a significant issue of concern for water transportation.

It is understood that ensuring complete safety at sea is difficult. Sudden storms and hidden reefs can easily lead to danger with the slightest carelessness, not to mention pirate attacks and fires. With the progress of scientific civilization and the improvement of human facilities, transportation has gained a reputation for speed and efficiency, and maritime navigation has also reduced its risks. However, the occurrence of these continuous disasters is truly regrettable. When considering the unpredictability of travel, we should seek the root causes of these problems. Looking at past events, some are due to negligence in steering, while others are based on inadequate equipment. If they are not natural disasters that are impossible to avoid, then human efforts have been lacking. The way to learn from these incidents is to ensure that those in charge of maritime affairs have a sincere understanding, coordinate with each other, and that the maritime authorities recognize the importance of human life and use their inherent powers to overcome personal considerations and implement supervision. Inspect ship hulls and improve equipment (1); select helmsmen and assess their experience (2); specify weight limits and strictly prohibit overloading (3); report weather conditions and maintain communication (4). If we can mutually encourage each other, strictly enforce regulations, and learn from past mistakes, then tragedies like the "Fuhai" steamer may not occur again.

### Japan and Italy Form Political Compromise

Japanese authorities deny it, commercial treaty negotiations are in progress

[Rome] A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy in Italy announced today that Italy and Japan are about to form a political agreement. (23rd National Telegram)

[Tokyo] A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry today denied the claim that Japan and Italy are currently planning to form a political compromise, stating that negotiations for a Japanese-Italian commercial treaty are currently underway, but no events of a political nature have been discussed.

### Britain Strengthens Defenses in Hong Kong and Malaya

[Hong Kong] The British government has allocated 20 million this year to strengthen Hong Kong's defenses. The army has increased from four regiments to six regiments, and the air force has increased the number of bomber squadrons. The results of Hong Kong's recent military exercises show that its air defense capabilities are weak, and efforts are being made to strengthen them. (24th Special Dispatch)

[Hong Kong] According to sources from responsible parties here, Britain will soon send two more army battalions to Hong Kong, or possibly also transfer several squadrons of air force bombers to Hong Kong. In the next two years, defense spending will increase to HK$40 million due to current plans, but Hong Kong's defense program does not stop there and will need to be expanded in the future. (Central News Agency 24th Reuters Telegram)

[Singapore] According to the defense budget, the troops stationed in Malaya will increase by one infantry battalion, bringing the total to four battalions, and will add at least three squadrons to the Royal Air Force. The added infantry battalion will likely be stationed in Penang, and one squadron of the Royal Air Force will also be sent there. The defenses in that area have already been greatly strengthened. The 2nd Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment, which is expected to arrive from Gibraltar on April 3, will be stationed in the newly built Changi barracks, which is located at the mouth of the Johor Strait and provides access to naval and air force bases. One of the added Royal Air Force squadrons will likely be based in Sembawang, where two aircraft stations and staff accommodations are nearing completion. Another squadron will likely be based in Yishun, which is one of Singapore's inland airfields. The third squadron will be based in Tengah, which is also an airfield. It is believed that Sembawang will have strong anti-aircraft defenses. (Central News Agency 24th Reuters Telegram)

### US-Philippine Conference

Contents not announced

[Washington] Philippine President Quezon held a meeting here today with Maynard, the newly appointed US High Commissioner to the Philippines, and Sayre, the Assistant Secretary of State. The details of the meeting were not announced. (Afterward, Sayre had a secret one-hour talk with Quezon. The three men then held a 20-hour discussion with General Cox, the head of the territorial department, in the office of Lieutenant General Embick, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, mainly regarding the fundamental relationship between the United States and the Philippines. Sayre told Associated Press reporters that army matters were not discussed, but because the Philippines is still under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army, the meeting was held at the Department of the Army. At that time, Sayre read President Roosevelt's instructions to Maynard, followed by a lengthy discussion, but the contents of the instructions were not announced. Sayre further stated that the experts on the committee studying the early independence of the Philippines will be selected from those with a broad vision to avoid being obscured by trivial details. Both sides have now agreed that the purpose of the committee is to greatly benefit the Philippines both during its autonomous period and after independence so that it does not have to rely on others. Quezon will travel to New York tomorrow morning and return to the capital on the 29th to attend meetings of government departments and committees. (23rd National Telegram)

### Japan Has No Intention of Restoring the Anglo-Japanese Alliance

Intends to find ways to resolve four issues, including reaching a compromise on China. To seek an adjustment on the North China problem after the closure of Parliament

═Foreign Minister Sato answers parliamentary questions═

[Tokyo] During the House of Representatives budget meeting last night, Kazue Nakamura of the Seiyukai raised the issue of restoring the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's response can be summarized in the following three points: (1) Restoring the Anglo-Japanese alliance is an extremely serious issue that Japan is currently sincerely considering, and the American side has also made similar proposals. (2) From the perspective of the League of Nations Covenant, restoring the Anglo-Japanese alliance is very difficult. (3) Even if the Anglo-Japanese alliance is not adopted, it would be fortunate if mutual friendly relations could be established between the two countries. From the above response, it is clear that Japan does not intend to restore the Anglo-Japanese alliance, which is an important indication. However, in order to get closer to Britain, Japan intends to find ways to resolve the following four issues: (1) Reaching a compromise on the China problem. (2) Adjusting commercial relations between Japan and Britain and its colonies. (3) Reaching a compromise on the issue of arms reduction. (4) Reaching a compromise on the issue of immigration. Foreign Minister Sato attached particular importance to the issue of compromise on China, and therefore, after the closure of Parliament, he plans to first seek an adjustment on the North China problem to eliminate various suspicions and concerns on the British side. However, Sato has not provided any concrete indication of what kind of measures he has to resolve the North China problem. However, it is generally believed that Foreign Minister Sato will do his best to resolve this most difficult problem. As for the measures that Sato has in mind, they can only be discerned by observing the development of events. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)

### Britain Willing to Facilitate Anglo-Japanese Amity

China's prosperity and stability benefit the entire world

Eden answers questions in the House of Commons

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden said in the House of Commons today in response to a question from a member that the British government was pleased with the desire for cooperation with Britain expressed by Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi and Foreign Minister Sato, as the British government is also keen to find ways to promote Anglo-Japanese friendly relations. Britain believes that China's prosperity and stability are not only needed by its neighboring countries but also benefit the world, and therefore, progress in Sino-Japanese relations is most welcomed by Britain. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)

[London] The House of Commons also discussed the issue of Sino-British trade today. Conservative MP Rhys Jones first asked whether the British government had recently exchanged views with Japan to ensure that those who wish to trade with China can obtain free territory within China's sovereignty. The Foreign Secretary answered in the negative, but the government believes that what is satisfactory is that the Japanese government is not unaware of the British government's intentions. Subsequently, National Conservative MP Pollitt asked whether the British Ambassador to Japan would be instructed to inquire into the remarks recently made by Japanese Foreign Minister Sato, which were sufficient to indicate Japan's willingness to respect China's sovereignty and discuss methods of equal trade with China. Deputy Minister Crampo replied that Sato's remarks gave him hope that various issues would be exchanged in a friendly manner, but he could not agree with Pollitt's proposal to inquire with the Japanese government.

### Japanese House of Representatives Questions Diplomacy towards China

Sato clearly declares that he will not abandon the Three Principles

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives budget meeting continued last night and adjourned at 11:20 PM. During the meeting, representatives of various small factions raised sharp questions on diplomatic issues. Tadashi Ikezaki, who does not belong to any political party and is a well-known Japanese naval affairs writer and authority on Pacific Ocean issues, questioned Foreign Minister Sato Naotake, saying that the Foreign Minister had previously stated that diplomacy toward China should be based on an equal footing and proceed from a new starting point. If this is intended to maintain the principles of equality and mutual benefit, is the Foreign Minister planning to abandon Hirota's Three Principles toward China and other demands? Sato replied that he had no intention of abandoning Hirota's Three Principles, but all matters would need to be reviewed. Ikezaki then asked the Foreign Minister about his intentions toward the bogus East Hebei organization and the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. Sato replied that when negotiations with China are resumed, the North China problem would likely need to be placed at the top of the agenda, but it is currently difficult to comment on the government's views on the above-mentioned issues. Ikezaki then asked, is the rumored plan to convene a five-minister conference to discuss the China problem to be regarded as an extension of the previous three-minister conference? Sato replied that he intends to center the China problem on cabinet meetings but will often hold discussions with relevant ministers when possible. Ikezaki also said that regardless of whether it is a three-minister or five-minister conference, judging from the methods adopted so far, the government's policy is often hindered by the military, which makes people feel that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has gone astray, which is extremely confusing and unclear to the people.

### Army Minister Sugiyama Denies Military Interference in Diplomacy

Army Minister Sugiyama Gen then took the podium and replied that regarding China policy, the military has never hindered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in North China, due to the existence of various military agreements, there are often independent actions, but these still need to be based on the orders of the central government. Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa agreed with the Army Minister's reply.

### Sato's Subtext Expresses Subtle Operations

The above questions and answers are not only interesting but also contain extremely important significance. For example, Foreign Minister Sato refused to express his views on the bogus East Hebei organization and the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, while at the same time stating that he had no intention of abandoning Hirota's Three Principles. On the other hand, he also admitted that the demands made on China needed to be reviewed. The subtext is worthy of our consideration, as it expresses a subtle diplomatic operation that is different from the ordinary. As for whether Foreign Minister Sato will change his beliefs in the future when implementing his policy, this is the most meaningful and important point in Sino-Japanese relations.

### Pessimistic Outlook on Future of Sino-Japanese Economic Relations Reiterated by Dongbao

Toyota and Others Return to Nagasaki, Impression of China Visit Favorable

[Tokyo] The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun once again expressed pessimism today regarding the future of Sino-Japanese economic relations. The gist of the newspaper's editorial is roughly as follows: China has recently been paying extreme attention to the situation within Japan. China also believes that a confrontation has already occurred between the national camp and the liberal front in Japan, and that the opposition between the two camps regarding Japan's continental policy is particularly sharp. Therefore, it attempts to use the Japanese financial and political circles and anti-reporting circles within the liberal front to restrain the progress of Japan's continental policy. This kind of attempt, coupled with China's insistence that economic cooperation is inseparable from the resolution of political issues, is evident. Although China superficially expresses "hopes for assistance," it has never actually felt the need for economic cooperation with Japan, nor has it requested Japan's assistance. Therefore, Japan should not be misled by superficial appearances to prevent falling into China's trap. The newspaper concludes by saying that instead of dreaming about the results of the trip of Kenji Kodama and others, it is more important to hope that after their return to the country, the views of all circles towards China can converge. The newspaper's opinion deserves attention, as it is nothing more than a suggestion that Japan should adopt a tough attitude towards China in a united front. In recent days, the opinions and news reports of newspapers here have gradually felt a shift from the usual state of affairs. Furthermore, the newspapers here today published news regarding the Tianjin customs authorities inspecting Japanese goods, the Nankou Inspection Office of the Ping-Sui Railway inspecting the luggage of Japanese residents, and the Chinese side's publicity for the memorial ceremony for the military and civilians who died defending Suiyuan, which is quite unpleasant. Whether this trend implies the actions of some force behind the scenes is extremely noteworthy. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)

⊙Nagasaki Three members of the economic mission to China, Toyota, Miyake, and Akiyama, returned to port at Nagasaki today at one o'clock in the afternoon aboard the Nagasaki Maru. A summary of the three's statements is as follows: What the results of our investigation of the Chinese economy are should be announced by the head of the delegation, Kodama. In order to avoid misunderstandings in advance, we will remain silent on matters such as talks. When the ship set sail yesterday, we happened to read a Shanghai newspaper that reprinted a report from a certain inland newspaper commenting on the results of the mission. We believe that the remarks were based on speculations based on the frank opinions expressed during the first cordial meeting. Later, in light of the progress made, we recognized the need for early correction. We want to say a word about this. The Chinese economic mission, led by the current Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, visited here the year before last and established the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. This time, the association convened its first joint meeting, and we attended as a reciprocal gesture, which everyone knows. After arriving in Shanghai on the 14th, the delegation first paid their respects to important figures in the National Government, and that evening, they took the night train to Nanjing, staying for two days. They received a warm welcome from the relevant ministers and other officials and civilians, and were given special hospitality by the President of the Executive Yuan, Chiang Kai-shek. He has now recovered and is leading by example, determined and striving for domestic unity and adjustment, attempting to build a new country. We were very impressed to be able to see the capital with our own eyes. On the 17th, they returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, and that night, they attended a welcoming banquet held by the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, gathering hundreds of key officials and civilians from the two countries in one hall, enjoying themselves to the fullest. On the 18th, they attended the general meeting, which was safely concluded as planned. As for the proposal to expand the investigation department for the purpose of linking economic research and cooperation between the two countries, it was unexpectedly approved, which was a small but happy victory. From then on, following the scheduled procedures, cordial meetings were held on the mornings of the 18th and 19th, where opinions were exchanged as much as possible. From the 20th to the 22nd, joint discussion meetings were held separately in the financial and industrial sectors. At this time, after attending banquets hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and others, the mission temporarily adjourned. The above discussions were conducted in an extremely clear atmosphere, and considerable results have been achieved. However, the contents are currently being finalized by the head of the delegation, Kodama, and will be announced soon. The warm welcome given by Chinese officials and civilians to our mission this time can be said to be a rare event in recent years, and that the beginnings of economic cooperation between the two countries were obtained in a relatively short period of time is due to the enthusiasm of the chairman Zhou Zuomin and others, as well as the Chinese side, needless to say. In other respects, the enthusiasm and prestige of the head of the delegation, Kodama, contributed even more, which we hope our country's government and public will especially remember. As for the cordial meetings on the 18th and 19th, political arguments were also made without reservation, centering on the North China issue, and among them, the unanimous opinion of the other party was that the current attitude of Chinese officials and civilians towards Japan is not actively anti-Japanese, but passively resistant to Japan. They believe that the North China issue is a major issue for the survival of the country, so they have no choice but to adopt this anti-Japanese attitude for self-defense. If Japan can come forward to resolve the North China issue, then they will sincerely cooperate to seek stability in Asia. However, such political issues should be avoided as much as possible, and it is proposed to focus on economic issues that can be implemented now, to be discussed and researched. After all, the beginnings of the above-mentioned cooperation were obtained. Regarding this point, we believe that this mission has achieved some success, and that in the future, the investigation departments of both sides should be the center of continued research to strive for realization. Finally, our mission's feelings are that the general Chinese public is enthusiastically committed to reform and revitalization, with each person fulfilling their duties and working exceptionally hard, which is admirable. We sincerely express our best wishes to China, and at the same time, we hope that our country's government and public will also have a new understanding of this. (Kyodo News dispatch, 24th)

### Annual Report of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation

Criticism from London Newspapers

[London] The full text of the report presented by the chairman, Peterson, at the annual meeting of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has now been sent to London, where it has been widely criticized by newspapers. The Morning Post said today that Peterson pointed out that the current situation in China is not as tense and chaotic as in Europe. From this, it can be seen that the current political turmoil in Europe can be summarized. People used to think that China was plagued by frequent turmoil, but now reading Peterson's optimistic tone, I can't help but yearn for it. The annual meeting of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation often arouses great interest among Londoners, because what it states is the concept obtained by experts inspecting China's economic and political progress. The Daily Herald said that this report is full of detailed information and is proof that the Far East has occupied an important position in the world's recovery, which is very exciting. At the annual meeting of the Chartered Bank, Chairman Kaidu also said that the general situation in China is indeed better than it was a year ago. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 24th)

These perpetual leaseholds will now be changed to ordinary leaseholds, marking the last vestige of extraterritoriality in Japan. It is found that ninety-nine British citizens, forty-three American citizens, twenty-five French citizens, and several Swiss, Swedish, Italian, Portuguese, and Belgian citizens in Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Kobe, Osaka, and other places currently own approximately one hundred and twenty-five acres of perpetual leaseholds.

### Italian Representative Openly Declares Active Intervention in Spanish Civil War

Resolutely Refuses to Withdraw Volunteer Soldiers, Adjustment Committee Work Stalled

[London] At a meeting of the sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War this morning, the Italian representative, the Ambassador to the UK, Grandi, resolutely refused to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from various countries fighting in Spain. According to Germany and Italy, the previous 20 firmly insisted that this issue should be discussed simultaneously with the issue of "neutralizing" the Spanish government's gold deposits abroad. At the sub-committee meeting this morning, the Soviet representative accepted the discussion of the "culturalization of gold deposits" issue, and the sudden change in his original attitude was quite surprising. As a result, general observers felt uneasy and were deeply afraid that this matter might cause serious diplomatic disputes. Grandi's tone was resolute and unwavering, enough to make people believe that Mussolini, the Italian prime minister, upon hearing the news of the Italian army's defeat in the Guadalajara province of Spain during his inspection in North Africa, wanted to wash away this shame, and made this decision after returning to the country. The sub-committee meeting this morning was already stalled, so it continued to meet in the afternoon for three hours, hoping that Grandi's attitude could be eased, but the result was serious, remaining the same as before. It is heard that at the afternoon meeting, the chairman of the sub-committee, Lord Plymouth, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, insisted that Grandi should explain the reasons for refusing to discuss the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers. Grandi immediately replied that only the Italian government had the right to explain these reasons, and that as long as the Spanish civil war continued, no volunteer soldiers should leave Spanish territory for a single day. After this shocking statement, representatives from France, Sweden, and other countries spoke one after another, saying that Italy's attitude was enough to endanger the life of the Adjustment Committee, and the Soviet representative Maisky even said that it would endanger European peace. At this point, Chairman Lord Plymouth again stated that the statement made by the Italian representative was extremely serious in nature, and that he would immediately consult with the American government. Other national representatives, including the German representative, Libotvivov, also said that they should consult their respective governments. The sub-committee then drafted a communiqué. The Italian representative did not want to include Grandi's declaration in it. It is said that the content of the communiqué also mentioned that the sub-committee is currently considering inviting non-European countries to cooperate. After the sub-committee adjourned, British Foreign Secretary Eden, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, and French Ambassador Corbin immediately held talks to discuss the situation caused by Italy's attitude.

### Italian Move Causes European Anxieties

British and French Newspapers Comment

[London] Regarding the issue that volunteer soldiers from various countries should withdraw from Spain, the Italian representative, Ambassador to the UK Grandi, refused to discuss it at the sub-committee meeting of the Adjustment Committee yesterday morning. British newspapers unanimously believe that this move is enough to cause a serious situation. The Daily Mail reported that "Ambassador Grandi's declaration yesterday has shown that Italy's attitude is bound to interfere in the Spanish civil war." The News Chronicle reported that "The only hope for the future of the situation depends on the joint determination of the policies of Britain and France, taking consistent action, and persevering to achieve it." The Daily Herald reported that unless Mussolini reconsiders the attitude he adopted yesterday, the non-intervention policy will be completely swept away. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 24th)

[Paris] The Italian representative resolutely refused to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from various countries within Spain at the Adjustment Committee meeting yesterday morning. French newspapers unanimously expressed concern about Italy's attitude. "Le Jour" reported that "In the last forty-eight hours, the European situation has suddenly become gloomy, and government authorities in various countries are indeed worried. The reason for this is nothing more than the Italian attitude. Generally speaking, after the Italian army recently suffered a defeat in Spain, Mussolini was unwilling to show weakness, and his return to the country was inevitable. This is why all countries feel panic." The General Confederation of Labor's newspaper "Le Peuple" reported that the Italian premier has no great power, but because various countries are either timid or deliberately ingratiating, he considers himself able to shout and intimidate. Now Mussolini can act arbitrarily without any scruples, which makes Britain and France feel uneasy and no longer conceal it. "Paris Soir" reported that "Is Italy going to send reinforcements to Spain again? In short, the current situation is the beginning of an international crisis, and we cannot but be afraid of it." The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper "L'Oeuvre" reported that "The general impression in the Rhône region is that the policies adopted by Italian Premier Mussolini towards the Spanish civil war may intensify in the future, even using gas to aid the war as soon as possible. In other words, he will not hesitate to obtain the final victory at any cost." The Socialist Party's newspaper "Le Populaire" advocated that Italy's intervention in the Spanish civil war should be exposed to world opinion, and the monitoring system should be strictly implemented immediately. The Communist Party's "L'Humanité" said, "We advocate that France should issue a public declaration stating that it can no longer tolerate Italy's adventurous actions in Spain. In order to increase the strength of this declaration, we do not need to resort to force, only to restore the normal relationship between France and the Spanish Republican government will be enough."

### Fascist Anniversary, Mussolini's Speech

Accuses British Pacifists of Hypocrisy, Encourages Blackshirt Comrades to Rise Up

[Rome] After returning to the country from Libya, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini took the opportunity of the 18th anniversary of the founding of Fascism today to deliver a harsh speech to the Blackshirts at the Palazzo Venezia. His speech roughly stated, "Blackshirt comrades, today is the 18th anniversary of the founding of Fascism, but this is the first time to celebrate with the reality of the empire after completing the long-cherished wish of Fascism. Moreover, today's celebration is just on the second day after I returned from Africa. All matters during my trip to Africa coincided with the planned plan. During the journey, I personally saw Italian workers turning the infinite Guanghan into fertile and prosperous cities. The broad avenues of Libya, which I personally inaugurated, are one of the best and longest avenues in the world, comparable to the magnificent Roman highway. Now the outside world has aroused a storm for our beautiful fascist Italy, but this storm is only a storm on paper. In this torrent of ink, the British Anglican priests are drumming their tongues, adding ugly to us. Their behavior is hypocritical, seeing the speck in other people's eyes, but not seeing the beam in their own eyes, but they are not enough to shake the calmness of our hearts. We are willing to deal with their hypocrisy with unwavering sincerity. Our sense of truth is enough to resist their lies. Our contempt is enough to reject their blind hatred. Moreover, Italy has already tasted the taste of economic sanctions before, but the result of economic sanctions is the surrender of those who implement the system. We should loudly denounce these movements, which are caused by those who engage in pacifism, which is the foundation of all disputes and conflicts. These pacifists are no less than the true enemies of peace, and are in the opposite position to the European cooperation method we adhere to and practice. Some say that Italians are forgetful, which is a big diamond, that is, a misunderstanding of outsiders who only know the fur and have no knowledge. In fact, Italians have extremely strong memory and great patience. After the Battle of Adua, we waited quietly for forty years before avenging our previous shame. If the memory of Italians declines in the future, we will rise again to stimulate them and make them reborn. Comrades of the Blackshirts, do not forget, and prepare yourselves urgently, this is today's order! (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 23rd)

### Mussolini's Remarks Cause Repercussions, Anglo-Italian Relations Tense

British Public Opinion Unleashes Criticism, Italian Diplomatic Authorities Lodge Protest

[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in Piazza Venezia today is generally regarded as direct evidence of the increasingly tense relations between Britain and Italy. British newspapers have severely criticized Italy for the massacre carried out after the assassination attempt on Governor-General Graziani by the Abyssinians, which Italy found quite embarrassing. Mussolini's trip to North Africa this time, and the speeches he gave along the way, further worsened the situation. Some diplomats here believe that the current situation is as serious as when the British fleet concentrated in the Mediterranean in 1935. It is said that if the League of Nations allows the Spanish government's request to intervene in the Spanish civil war, Italy will withdraw from the non-intervention agreement. Foreign Minister Count Ciano met with British Ambassador Sir Drummond last night for a long time, and it is said that Ciano protested to the British Ambassador about the attacks by British newspapers. As for what has most angered Mussolini recently, there are the following five things: ㊀ The recent statement by the Archbishop of Canterbury, saying that Anglo-Italian friendship cannot make him forget Italy's atrocities in Abyssinia. ㊁ The defeat of the Italian army in Spain. ㊁ Anti-Italian demonstrations in Austria. ㊃ The Spanish government's request for the League of Nations to intervene in the civil war and prevent Italy from aiding the rebels. ㊄ Britain's invitation to the King of Abyssinia to attend the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor. (National Army, 23rd)

[London] Since the defeat of the Italian army in the Guadalajara province of Spain, British newspapers have written articles commenting on it (according to some British newspapers, the Battle of Guadalajara province and the battle in which the Italian army was defeated by the Austrian army in the Carabaretto area during the war were compared with each other). It is learned that when Foreign Minister Count Ciano met with the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, yesterday, he considered the British newspapers' comments to be anti-Italian propaganda, and called British attention to it, saying that this kind of propaganda may cause the most serious repercussions for the friendship between Britain and Italy. Some observers believe that the Italian Ambassador Grandi's resolute refusal to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from various countries at the meeting of the sub-committee of the Adjunct Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War this morning was due to the British newspaper propaganda. It is now hoped that after the anti-Italian publicity stops, Italy will accept the discussion of the volunteer soldier withdrawal issue. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 23rd)

[London] Evening newspapers here all reported that the deterioration of Anglo-Italian relations has not been as severe as it is today since 1935. The political circles also believe that the situation is serious, believing that Mussolini's speech will cause adverse repercussions. It is learned that Foreign Minister Ciano has just asked the British Ambassador to Rome about the attitude of the British newspapers regarding Mussolini's inspection of Libya. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that the Italian naval exercises in the Mediterranean prove that Italy cannot obstruct traffic in the Mediterranean, because the effectiveness of aircraft bombing warships is still questionable, and a powerful fleet will never be hindered by submarines. If Italy wants to control the Mediterranean, it must have a large number of main battle ships, cruisers, destroyers, and aircraft carriers. Since Britain and France have reorganized their armies, Italy's navy and air force have become increasingly dwarfed. (National Army News, 23rd)

Britain has also accepted Belgium's desire to be released from its obligations as a guarantor state under the Locarno Treaty. In this regard, well-informed sources also said that France has also expressed its agreement and notified Belgium a few days ago that Britain and France will issue a joint declaration before the by-election for the House of Representatives in the Belgian capital (Belgian Prime Minister Janson will compete with Fascist Rex Party leader Degrelle).

The Belgian King replied, "Please wait until my country asks Britain for help before doing anything." (Havas dispatch of the 23rd from Central News Agency)

The majority of left-wing representatives in the parliament agreed on a resolution expressing confidence in the government's maintenance of the people's right to association. It is expected that Prime Minister Blanc will soon issue a statement clarifying the government's attitude towards fascist organizations. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd from Central News Agency

[Paris] Today, during the French Chamber of Deputies' discussion of the Clichy riot, Prime Minister Blanc refuted a portion of the remarks made by his subordinates in the Chamber. He said that the meeting on the 16th to incite the public to protest against fascism was a major mistake, because the authorities' responsibility is to educate the public, not to incite them. Blanc's speech was repeatedly interrupted by rioters, and the left and right factions attacked each other with language so vile that it was unspeakable. Blanc said that the Clichy police fired in self-defense, but it was inappropriate to fire without orders.

Tokyo

The Japan-Burma Commercial Agreement, which was provisionally adjusted on March 1st, has now been released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the form of a statement as follows: Burma is scheduled to separate from India starting on April 1st. Therefore, to stipulate the future commercial relationship between Japan and Burma, representatives of both sides recently conducted negotiations in Delhi, and opinions have largely converged. The main points are as follows:

Japan and Burma mutually agree to grant each other most-favored-nation treatment in trade. Japan can export 65% of the total amount of cotton from Burma (but no matter the year's harvest, it does not need to exceed 70,000 bales). Japan can import 42 million yards of cotton cloth per year. If Burmese cotton cannot be imported in the stipulated quantity, then the quantity of Japanese cotton cloth exports can be reduced by 300,000 yards for every 1,000 bales of cotton that are not imported. If Japan cannot purchase the cotton it is entitled to, then the percentage of cotton cloth will not be reduced. Japan should, in principle, export 42 million yards of cotton cloth, including 15% of coarse cloth, 10% of bleached cloth, 45% of printed cloth, and 30% of other colors. However, various goods can be transferred according to the following conditions:

(A) The transfer shall not increase the total amount of import distribution. (B) The increase or decrease in the quantity of various cloths shall not exceed 20%, and the increase or decrease in the quantity of dyed goods shall not exceed 5%. The export of remnants not exceeding four yards per piece is limited to 1.5 million yards per year. The content of this agreement is consistent with the opinions of both parties' representatives and will soon be formally signed in London between representatives of Britain and Japan.

### Chairman Lin Passes Through Wuchang on His Way to Guangdong

All Circles Gather at Hanyang Gate to Welcome Him, Inspects the Provincial Government and Party Headquarters Before Departing South

Hankou Correspondence Chairman Lin of the National Government is traveling to Guangdong to pay tribute to the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and to inspect the construction situation in various provinces. On the 20th, he departed from Nanjing on the Yong Sui warship and arrived in Hankou to transfer to Guangzhou. Upon hearing the news, all circles in Wuhan prepared to welcome him. Welcome arches were erected at the Hanyang Gate and ferry terminal in Wuchang. Flags were hung throughout the three towns of Wuhan. At dawn on the 22nd, more than 1,000 people, including heads of various agencies, civil officials of the rank of recommendation or above, military officers of the rank of colonel or above, and leaders of people's organizations, gathered at Hanyang Gate to greet him. The security brigade was responsible for security, and the police band and honor guard were distributed on both sides of the riverbank. The streets of the provincial capital were patrolled by the military police. The patrol team and mounted police of the Provincial Police Department patrolled back and forth. At 9:00 AM, the Yong Sui warship arrived and anchored on the Wuchang river. The Min Quan warship, which was originally anchored there, immediately raised its flag and fired a salute. Party, military, and political figures such as He Chengjun, Huang Shaohong, Peng Guojun, Chen Panling, and Wuhan University President Xing Gong boarded the ship to greet him. Chairman Lin told He and others that he would take a car to Hunan after disembarking and did not intend to stay in Wuchang. He and others suggested that since it would be late at night when he arrived in Changsha by car, he should rest in Wuchang for a while and depart in the afternoon. Chairman Lin agreed and decided to inspect the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, as well as visit Wuhan University. At 9:30 AM, Chairman Lin boarded the Jiang Han Guan patrol boat Xia Guang and left the warship. The officers and soldiers of the Yong Sui warship lined up, played music, and fired a salute to see him off. Warships from various countries anchored in Hankou also fired salutes at the same time. The sound of firecrackers and military music on the shore was deafening. The welcoming personnel stood respectfully on both sides of the road. Chairman Lin led He, Huang, and others to disembark calmly and nodded in response to the welcomers. After disembarking, he first went to the Provincial Party Headquarters. Special Commissioner Peng Guojun led all the design committee members to greet him. He then summoned all the staff to listen to his instructions. He said that Wuhan was the area of the first uprising, and many martyrs sacrificed their lives to achieve the current glory. Therefore, Wuchang has great significance in revolutionary history. Local autonomy is the foundation of democracy. Without local autonomy, a constitutional system cannot be established. Therefore, the current important task is to follow the teachings of the Premier and promote local autonomy. China governs the country through the Party. Although the institutions of the government and the Party are different, the ideology and spirit are consistent. Therefore, the Party and the government should cooperate absolutely to achieve local autonomy. Party comrades should also go deep into the countryside, lead farmers, workers, and merchants, and promote various undertakings to consolidate the social foundation. At the same time, they should also pay attention to the outstanding people in the countryside and find ways to attract them so that they can work together to promote autonomy. This is the responsibility that Party members should currently bear." He then met with reporters and told them that he had personally participated in the battle during the Xinhai Uprising and stayed in Wuchang for a long time. After the fall of Hanyang and the defeat of the Party army, Jian Yuanhong and he did not leave Hongshan immediately. The current Provincial Party Headquarters is the former Military Government. He was deeply gratified to revisit this old place and see the rapid progress in various construction projects. Finally, he said that after paying tribute to the Huanghuagang martyrs in Guangdong, it was still undecided whether he would return to Nanjing via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway in Hunan and Hubei or go to Guangxi. At 10:30 AM, he went to the Provincial Government. Huang Shaohong led the heads and committee members of various departments to greet him. At 10:50 AM, he gave a speech to all the staff in the auditorium, saying, "Wuchang was a place I used to visit during the Xinhai Revolution. In recent years, all construction has progressed very rapidly. Just looking at the streets, I feel completely changed. Other aspects, such as the neat roads and clean city appearance, also give people a pleasant feeling. Seeing you all wearing uniforms and working together in one office, I feel that the work is intense. The Premier once instructed that work should be scientific. No matter what you do, you must be organized. Even hard work will not feel hard if you are organized, and the efficiency will be very high. This lesson should be practiced at all times. Now, all provinces are working together in one office. The meaning is to reduce wasted time and increase efficiency. This province was the first to implement joint office work. I am sure your work is very intense and very hard. However, in your spare time, I hope you will still use your precious time to study hard. The ancients said, 'Study well and you can become an official, and do well as an official and you can study more.' Now the world's science, politics, and philosophy are changing rapidly and advancing rapidly. If you can study them in detail, you will not only increase your knowledge, but also cultivate your spirit. In society, you will be a model for others, and in the family, you will be a model for your children. In the future, if the country needs it, you can also take on important responsibilities." At 11:00 AM, he attended a banquet hosted by the Provincial Government. At 3:00 PM, he visited Luojia Mountain and the National Wuhan University. At 5:30 PM, He Chengjun hosted a banquet in the Wuhan University reception hall. At 6:15 PM, he departed from the Bin Yang Gate station to board the train to the south. Deputy Chief of Staff Lu Chao, Li Youchu, Director of the International Etiquette Section of the Ceremonial Bureau, Aide-de-Camp Zhang Zhong, and Xi Chulin, Director of the Hunan Provincial Government's Office in Nanjing, accompanied him. Ling Hongxun, Director of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau, also accompanied him to take care of him. It is estimated that he passed through Changsha on the morning of the 13th without stopping and went straight to Guangzhou. (March 22)

### Land Survey Underway in Jiangxi Province

Dividing the Province into Three Districts for Aerial Surveying, Work on the First and Second Districts Has Been Completed

Nanchang Correspondence, The original land tax in Jiangxi has been deeply plagued by long-standing abuses, and the land survey is currently the only important task. Therefore, the Provincial Government has been using aerial surveying since the year before last, and all 83 counties in the province will be surveyed in three phases. The method is to use Spardon-style aircraft to photograph cadastral maps, and use triangular pin contraction to shorten the length of triangular side points to control the improvement and correction methods to facilitate splicing. The counties in the first district, including Nanchang, Fengcheng, Gaoan, Dongxiang, Linchuan, Qingjiang, and Xingan, and Jinxi, have been surveyed and completed, with an area of 20,293 square li. The eight counties in the second district, including Chongren, Yihuang, Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng Taihe, Anfu, and Xiajiang, have also been surveyed and completed, with an area of 20,063 square li. Currently, the aerial surveying work in the third district is underway, and the investigation work is being carried out at the same time. The boundary and land boundary surveys are conducted first for reference in land registration. The plot survey will be conducted at the same time as the land registration to save time. The area of each plot after the investigation is calculated using a planimeter, and the calculations for Xinjian, Anyi, and Jinshi counties have been completed and are currently being calculated for Qingjiang counties. As for the creation of plot maps, they have always been made by tracing and printing the original aerial survey plot maps, with each person drawing about 450 plots per day. The transfer writing and printing method has been changed, and the work efficiency has been increased by one-half. For all the counties where the survey has been completed, land registration offices are set up in the counties and districts to carry out the first land ownership registration. After the registration, a map and a property management certificate are issued for tax assessment. The tax rate is 10 per mille. For example, the total land value of Nanchang County is 54,384,166 yuan. At 10 per mille, 543,840 yuan should be collected. The original land tax and labor service tax will be cancelled, and a collection book and a string of tickets will be prepared. The Baozhang will collect the tax household by household after verification, and a notification slip will be sent to the property owners to pay the tax in two installments on July 1 and November 1. However, the purchase of aircraft for aerial surveying requires a lot of money, and the surtax on land tax is not enough to solve the urgent need. The Provincial Government has issued 3 million yuan of land bonds and deposited them with the bank. In the future, the surtax on land tax for aerial surveying in various counties will be used to repay the principal and interest of the bonds. After the land in this province has been surveyed by air, the property rights are determined, the area is accurate, and the tax rate is fair. The transfer of ownership is based on the property management certificate, and the long-standing abuses can be eliminated.

### Nanhui

Establishing a Special Training Class for Opium Addicts

The method for random inspection of opium addicts who have quit in this county has always been that the county government orders each district to notify each opium addict to go to the district, where the examiners sent by the County Hospital will go to inspect whether there is any relapse. The procedure is simple and leads to abuses. Now, in order to strictly conduct random inspections, the county government has established a special training class for opium addicts who have quit. The inspections and training are unified and carried out in batches. The goal is to enable opium addicts who have quit to gain common knowledge, strengthen their physical fitness, and make it easier to observe and understand those who have relapsed. The special training class will be held in batches of about 100 people, and the training period will be one week or ten days per batch.

Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been abnormal, with sudden cold and heat waves, resulting in a rampant outbreak of meningitis in the market, and people have died one after another. Fortunately, the Health Office is trying to put it out. Yesterday (the 24th), the weather suddenly turned cold again, and the Fahrenheit thermometer dropped to 44 degrees. At about 10:00 AM, hail fell, as large as broad beans, shaking the roof tiles. It stopped at 1:00 PM, but the sky remained cloudy. Spring snow continued to fall at 3:30 PM and did not stop until night. The beans and wheat in the countryside have been hit hard by this, and the harvest will be greatly reduced. Meningitis and measles have been discovered again in the Zhangjingqiao area of the Sixth District, and the patients are mostly children. Efforts are currently underway to put it out.

### Reconstruction of Wu Bridge Has Started

The Huangbudun Wu Bridge in Xiyi was started in the third year of the Republic of China and completed in two years, costing 37,000 yuan. The bridge is 27 feet long and 24 feet wide. Steel pipes are used for piling below, and steel bones are used above to support the bridge deck, which is made of Western pine and spans the canal. It is the main road between Suzhou-Wuxi and Xiyi. However, due to years of disrepair, the bridge piles have rotted, making it quite dangerous to drive cars. The Construction Department is now trying to repair it and has limited the completion time to one month. The construction of a pontoon bridge began on the 23rd and is expected to be completed in about three weeks. The cost of opening the bridge for traffic is 26,000 yuan.

Dasheng Workers Petition

The Qidong Second Factory of Dasheng Yarn Factory has been shut down due to poor business. The female workers of the factory, fearing that they would be unemployed and have no means of support, sent three representatives, Xi Maiqun, Gu Qingchen, and Zhang Chengyuan, to the province yesterday to petition various agencies, requesting that Nantung Dasheng Factory be ordered to stop dismantling the factory and to raise funds for restoration. The first factory should expedite the handling of threads and strive for an early start to work in order to maintain the original industry and the livelihood of thousands of workers. It is reported that Special Commissioner Zhang Gongren of the Provincial Party Headquarters received them and promised to submit the matter to the special commissioner meeting for discussion. Director Zhou of the Provincial Government and Director Wu of the Construction Department received them on behalf of their respective chairmen and promised to forward the matter to the chairman and director for review.

### Yangzhou

Lightning Strikes Electric Meter, Injuring Two

In Yangzhou, after the establishment of spring and already three days after the Spring Equinox, despite continuous overcast and rainy weather, the season hasn't yet reached the point of hearing thunder during the Awakening of Insects. Yesterday (the 23rd) around eight o'clock in the morning, the sky suddenly became gloomy, followed by a burst of rain. Red and swift lightning struck one after another. When the second thunderclap struck with force, the electric meter outside Xu Ning Gate near the China Glass Lampshade Factory was affected and exploded with a crash. Factory worker Yang Yichun suffered head injuries, and Ma Dehuai was knocked down with back injuries. Both regained consciousness after a while. Another student's clothes were burned and he was also knocked down, but he quickly recovered.

Grain Store Robbed in Hangjiaji

The Taifeng Grain Store in Hangji Township, Fourth District, owned by Wang Diandong, had a reasonably good business. At one o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, sounds of a wall being dismantled were heard outside the store's back door. Wang heard this and, suspecting thieves, led a group of people to open the door to investigate. Unexpectedly, more than a dozen bandits were already hiding on either side of the wall outside the door. When the door opened, the bandits rushed in with guns. As they entered, they fired a shot to prevent anyone from making a sound. They then overturned chests and ransacked the place, coercing Wang's family members to hand over valuables. It is said that the losses were substantial. After the robbery, the bandits disappeared without a trace. The township head, Wang Zhengbao, reported the incident to the district office, which in turn reported it for investigation and pursuit.

### Nantong

Searching for Bandits in the Surrounding Villages

In the four rural areas of this county, banditry has become rampant due to the scarcity of food between harvests. The police are currently conducting searches in multiple directions, utilizing the Baojia system to conduct sweeps. In recent days, they have uncovered bandit hideouts in various areas of Oufang Township and Puliu District, capturing more than a dozen bandits including the notorious Chen Heshang. All have been taken to the county government for interrogation.

Boat Capsizes, Six Lives Lost

Since the start of the spring fishing season, the weather has been rainy. Fishermen continue to go out to sea for fishing as usual. The day before yesterday, the large fishing boat belonging to Cao Jiru, a fisherman from the Lake Gang, was sailing to the waters off Mount Putuo amidst heavy rain. Unexpectedly, the wind picked up on the sea as night fell, causing the boat to capsize. All eight crew members drowned.

### Taizhou

Continuous Rain Affects Vegetables and Wheat

In Wenling, continuous torrential rain has been falling day and night for the past ten days. The accumulated rainfall is estimated to be over four chi (feet). The water levels in the rivers and harbors in the four rural areas have risen sharply, preventing boats from traveling. The low-lying farmland has been flooded, submerging the blooming rape flowers and the sprouting wheat. The farmers are extremely worried. If the rain continues, the impact on the harvest is feared to be unimaginable.

### Glimpses of the South Seas (1)

— Junshi

The islands of the South Seas, in the past, were mostly territories of our country and have long become the second home of our overseas Chinese. However, since the eastward expansion of European and American influence and their foothold in the South Seas, the political environment is no longer what it once was. The overseas Chinese face many difficulties and have all become parasites in someone else's backyard. Reflecting on the past and present, one cannot help but feel deeply moved!

The islands of the South Seas include the Indochinese Peninsula, the Malay Peninsula, and what is known as "Malanai," a collective term for the islands. Projecting out from the China Sea, scattered like stars and chess pieces between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, are hundreds and thousands of islands, large and small, all encompassed within. Due to their location in the tropics and the moderating influence of the ocean, the temperature, although high, is neither scorching in summer nor bitterly cold in winter. Agriculture flourishes, with harvests in all four seasons, and production is abundant, unparalleled in the world, truly deserving of the name "Land of Gold."

The majority of the inhabitants are Malays. Buddhism and Islam were both prominent in the past on the various islands of the South Seas. Therefore, Indians, Burmese, and Arabs are interspersed among them. There are even more overseas Chinese. Although the number of Europeans and Americans is small, they hold a dominant position. Thus, the inhabitants of the South Seas islands are extraordinarily diverse in terms of race, and there are still many uncivilized aborigines. Their peculiar customs and exotic traditions provide valuable materials for sociologists and historians to study.

Overseas Chinese endure hardship, excel in trade and migration, and remit funds back to China every year, compensating for one-third to one-half of the total personal surplus, which is no small matter in maintaining the national economic structure.

I previously traveled to the South Seas, passing through territories belonging to the British, Dutch, Siamese, and Vietnamese. What I heard and saw, in bits and pieces, regarding the South Seas' customs, people, society, products, economy, politics, education, and issues related to the overseas Chinese, are all collected and stored, without regard to order, as reference materials for researchers.

1.  Awakening of the Malay People

The Malay people truly deserve to be called a race that knows how to enjoy life! Their lives, barely able to sustain themselves, facing starvation if they don't work, would seem to inevitably sink them into sorrow. Their narrow dwellings would also be enough to make one feel unpleasant, but they don't care at all! They still know how to enjoy themselves. They always participate in street dancing (local dances). When they hear Ronggeng Malay songs, they simply tap their feet to the beat and sing aloud. There are always Malays taking naps in the shade of trees on the grass.

In areas near the coast, many Malays live together. Whenever the sun is about to set, outside their village-like Malay houses, you can always see men and women laughing and joking wantonly and without restraint on the grass. That happy and harmonious atmosphere is truly enviable.

Going a little further, in front of a small Malay-style house by the roadside, a young woman wearing an undershirt, exposing the upper half of her breasts, sits leisurely on the floor, while a man sleeps peacefully, resting his head on her fat thighs.

The above is a passage from "The Long Summer of the South Seas." It depicts the Malays' peaceful, comfortable, and joyful life, where all the world's petty squabbles are irrelevant to them. But in reality, the lives of most Malays are not necessarily entirely like this.

The islands of the South Seas have the reputation of being a "world's fair of human races." Those who arrive in the South Seas are particularly interested in observing and investigating the South Seas races. The races of the South Seas consist of indigenous peoples, foreign races, and many mixed races. Each race is further divided into numerous branches, totaling no less than several dozen. Some already possess advanced culture, crafts, fine arts, and literature, which have all reached a very high level, such as the Filipinos and Javanese. Others remain in the Stone Age, headhunting and cannibalistic tribes, such as the Bataks of Sumatra, the Achinese, the Dayaks of Borneo, and the Papuans of New Guinea, who are the most fierce and cruel. The murals in the Batavia Museum depicting the various foreign races of the Dutch East Indies show more than forty species, in a variety of forms and colors, a magnificent sight!

However, the master of the South Seas islands must be considered the Malay people. Of the approximately 60 million inhabitants of the Dutch East Indies, more than 50 million are Malays. Among the more than 3.5 million inhabitants of the Federated Malay States, about 1.8 million are Malays. Of the more than 10 million inhabitants of the Philippines, nearly 10 million are of Malay descent. The Malay people are distributed throughout the South Seas, numbering no less than 80 million, which can be considered a great number! Therefore, the focus of observation and investigation is concentrated on the Malay race.

▲ Chapter 53, B, New Placement, add the following two sections on "Testing":

The resistance weight of the new-style hurdles can be tested by pulling the center of the bar with a simple spring scale or by using a rope with one end hooked to the hurdle bar and the other end passing through a pulley with a weight attached. (End)

P> City Party Headquarters and Social Affairs Bureau Jointly Convened University Outstanding Students' Get-Together Yesterday

▲ Over 230 Outstanding Students from 24 Schools Attended

▲ Director Pan Reported, Committee Member Tong and Section Chief Jiang Gave Speeches

The joint event of the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, a get-together for outstanding students from universities and specialized schools, was held at Huzhi, Caizhou Road, yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. Over 200 people attended. Director Pan reported, and Tong Xingbai and Jiang Jianbai gave speeches. Details are recorded as follows:

Attendance

The attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Tong Xingbai, Committee Member of the City Party Headquarters; Jiang Jianbai, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau; Liu Xuru, Director of the Training Section; Yu Zhongbiao, Chief Secretary of the Education Section of the City Party Headquarters, and 238 outstanding students from 24 schools (list attached). The presidium consisted of Pan Gongzhan, Tong Xingbai, and Jiang Jianbai; the emcee was Nie Haifan; the recorders were Wang Gongxia and Chen Dongbai; the Chief Secretary was Liu Xuru; and the hosts were Yao Xiuji, Kang Ou, Peng Zhenqiu, Fan Jiabiao, Cao Peizi, Wu Jianren, Chen Hongnian, Yang Jialin, Zhang Ruli, Jin Zhan, Qian Kezan, Xiong Pengnan, Long Xia, Qu Qinghan, and others.

Director's Report

Chairman Director Pan reported, in brief, "Today is the get-together for outstanding students from universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools, jointly organized by the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau. We have been considering holding this event for a long time. However, due to the time required to draft the procedures, this is the first time we are holding a trial run. We plan to continue promoting it in the future. I will briefly report to you the significance of holding this get-together: ㊀ We know that university students in China today are in a very hard-earned position. Of course, there are some young people who have entered university but still feel bored and dissatisfied. However, among young people of the same age, there are even more who do not have the opportunity to enter university and receive higher education. Therefore, young people who are able to enter university are already outstanding. If they did not have superior talent, environment, or opportunities, they would not have the good fortune to step into the halls of university. Therefore, students who can enter university are all outstanding. Originally, if we could invite all university students together, that would naturally be best. However, because the number is too large, it is not easy to accommodate everyone. Therefore, we can only ask the presidents of each school to help us select students from each grade who are excellent in academics, physical fitness, and character to hold this get-together for outstanding students. This is the only feasible method we could come up with under the circumstances. However, in addition to hosting you, we extend the same warm sympathy to the general students who cannot participate due to the large numbers. ㊁ In this time of extreme national crisis and national revival, it is most important to build a good foundation among students and young people. To enable the general students to build the foundation for national revival, we must find ways to encourage them to strive for progress. To encourage them to strive for progress, we rely on the joint efforts of parents, teachers, classmates, and people from society to make outstanding students even better and to make general students learn from outstanding students. Therefore, we must select outstanding students. We hope that the selected students can take on the responsibility of setting an example in school and maintaining excellent performance in society, exerting a good influence on the general public, and striving for progress in academics, physical fitness, and morality. When it comes to national talent recruitment, we should "select the virtuous and the capable." This is because virtuous and capable people can do things, and, even more importantly, they can continue to "select the virtuous and the capable." As the saying goes, "Get the right person, and things will thrive." This is the method of talent recruitment. We can apply this to young students as well. Selecting outstanding students allows you to help the Party and government in selecting general students with strengths and merits, encouraging them to strive for progress, and introducing them to everyone. Our expectations for you are very high. We hope that after participating today, you will take on the responsibility of being pioneers among students and young people for our national revival. Only in this way can you be worthy of yourselves, the school authorities, and the nation. ㊂ Since you have been selected to participate in the get-together for outstanding students, you should naturally (A) strive for even greater progress for yourselves and (B) take responsibility for guiding and helping your classmates. But when it comes to point (A), what methods can you use to strive for even greater progress? Simply put, there are two, or rather one, attitude and one method. First, you must always maintain an attitude of "knowing insufficiency." Because learning is endless, even though you are already excellent in academics, physical fitness, and character, you must still constantly examine whether there is anything in which you are not as good as others. You must never be complacent. Only by knowing insufficiency can you progress. Only by progressing can you know insufficiency even more. As the saying goes, "Only after learning do you know insufficiency." But conversely, "Only by knowing insufficiency do you learn." Because you don't understand a certain subject, you go to learn it. After learning it, you should be content. But the ancients said, "Only after learning do you know insufficiency." This seems contradictory, but you must believe that when a person is young, they are often easily satisfied. For example, students from elementary school to middle school often think they understand all subjects and are very satisfied. But the deeper you study, the more you feel inadequate. This is something you learn from the experience of learning. So these two sentences are cyclical. Because you know insufficiency, you go to learn. After learning, you know insufficiency again. Only in this way can you progress permanently. I hope you will always maintain an attitude of "knowing insufficiency." On the one hand, you must have self-respect and not be self-deprecating. But don't let the title of "outstanding student" cause you to abandon your original spirit of striving for progress. You should always "know insufficiency." Second, I hope you understand "knowing where to stop." As the saying goes, "Only by knowing where to stop can you have stability, and only with stability can you be calm..." The "knowing where to stop" and "knowing insufficiency" seem contradictory, but they are not. Now I will briefly explain what "knowing where to stop" means. The Great Learning says, "The way of great learning consists in manifesting clear virtue, in loving the people, and in abiding in perfect goodness." Therefore, "knowing where to stop" means knowing where to "abide in perfect goodness." Perfect goodness is the supreme ideal. You must reach the highest ideal. Although you are now excellent, you are not yet perfect. You must continue to progress and become more excellent each year in order to become an ideal, perfect citizen of modern China. Therefore, "knowing where to stop" and "knowing insufficiency" are complementary, not contradictory. Because you know insufficiency, you progress. This is the attitude you should hold in the process. Knowing where to stop is the ultimate goal we should complete, with perfect goodness as the ultimate goal. When it comes to point (B), how can you guide and help your classmates? To guide other students to work together, you must first understand the meaning of holding this get-together and spread this spirit to the general students. I also said this in the get-together for outstanding middle school students. You young people should pay attention to observing the strengths of others and not just focus on their shortcomings. A person's character, talent, learning, and skills must have strengths that can be learned. Therefore, I hope that you will "know insufficiency" for yourselves and "see the virtuous as if you cannot reach them" for the general students. In this way, you will be able to get a lot of help in doing things in the future, and you will be able to succeed in great undertakings and achieve national revival. As the saying goes, "Those who gain the Way have much help." The so-called "gaining the Way" means, on the one hand, that you can always know your own shortcomings and go to improve yourself, and, on the other hand, that you always observe the strengths of those around you, praise them, and develop them. If you can know your own insufficiency and strive for progress, and always pay attention to the strengths of others, you can naturally gain confidants. As the ancient saying goes, "A scholar dies for a confidant." If dying is possible, what else isn't? There is no reason why you can't guide, help, or work together. I hope that after participating today, you will embrace the attitude of knowing insufficiency and abiding in perfect goodness in your self-improvement, and the attitude of "concealing evil and promoting good" towards the general students, encouraging them to strive for progress. I hope you will work hard in this way to make the atmosphere of all universities in Shanghai one of excellence, where everyone strives for national revival.

Committee Member Tong's Speech

Just now, Director Pan said that being able to become a university student is already excellent, and you are the outstanding among the outstanding. It is hard to come by and very precious. In the past few years, there have been few opportunities to meet and talk with university students in Shanghai. I am very excited and happy to be able to meet and talk with you today through the opportunity of this get-together. You are outstanding students who stand out from the crowd. I believe that you all have lofty aspirations and a bright future. Young people are the backbone of society and the lifeline of the nation. The task of national revival rests on the shoulders of young people. You are all young people, and you are the outstanding among young people. Your responsibilities are extremely important. In theory, "we should aspire to do great things, not to become high officials." Great things are things that one person can do for hundreds, thousands, or millions of people, meaning that what one person does can benefit hundreds, thousands, or millions of people. This is a great thing. You all have the goal of doing great things, but whether you can achieve this goal depends entirely on whether you have a method, not on fate. Today, the new belief of young people that I want to talk about is method. First, we must believe in our own view of life. Only after determining our view of life can we believe in it, strive forward, and achieve any aspiration. Of course, everyone's view of life cannot be the same, but we must determine a direction in life, which is to enrich life and develop life. Enriching life means enriching the conditions that life should have. Humans are the most intelligent of all things, so we must fulfill the inherent meaning and responsibilities of life in order to be different from other things. For example, in addition to solving our own lives, we must also solve the lives of others. In addition to benefiting ourselves, we must also benefit others. Only in this way can we fulfill the meaning of life. Otherwise, living in the world is just wasting time. There are three necessary conditions for enriching life: ㊀ Enriching your own knowledge. This is indispensable, because all the rights and wrongs, good and evil, advantages and disadvantages that people encounter require knowledge to judge. Therefore, knowledge is the compass of life. Youth is the best time to seek knowledge. I hope you will not fail to live up to this golden age. ㊁ Cultivate your own talents. Having knowledge is not enough; you must also have the talent to exert that knowledge. This talent means being able to write, speak, and do. ㊂ Temper your own character. This character refers to the broad sense, including will, thought, and integrity. You must have a firm will to succeed in doing things, and at the same time, you must have integrity. If you have lofty aspirations, you should not be discouraged by temporary unemployment. Next, when it comes to developing life, it means that one should not only cultivate oneself, but also develop one's knowledge and talents to benefit the world. The first is to be able to achieve merit in one's lifetime. Merit is not about size; anything that benefits society and the masses is merit. The first step is to benefit future generations. Although oneself may die, one's career should still allow future generations to enjoy the benefits. This fulfills the meaning of developing life. I hope you will strive forward, he concluded.

Section Chief Jiang's Speech

Briefly stated: ㊀ We should now look at people from the perspective of the country and society, not as individuals but as members of society and the country. Therefore, you outstanding students are not outstanding individuals but are outstanding members of society and the country who will serve society and the country in the future. ㊁ In addition to developing in all aspects, you should also have a special strength in a certain discipline. Otherwise, you may be eliminated in this society of division of labor. ㊂ Seek practicality, not fame. You are outstanding students and already have fame. Now you must work hard and do things practically to achieve permanent fame that matches reality, he concluded.

Student Speeches

The City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau temporarily announced five topics: ㊀ Self-improvement is the basis for serving humanity. ㊁ Making things is the purpose of serving humanity. ㊂ Restoring self-confidence, strengthening mutual belief, and enhancing mutual trust are sufficient to strengthen the organizational power of the nation. ㊃ Storing up practical knowledge, preparing the courage to act, and cultivating the benevolence to save the world are the goals of students' self-improvement. ㊄ The bad habits that Shanghai university students should reform. The presidium randomly selected five speakers, each with eight minutes to speak. The speakers selected were: He Jiajun from Datong University, who spoke on "Self-improvement as the basis for serving humanity"; Ma Zhenfu from the Law School, who spoke on "Self-improvement as the basis for serving humanity"; Long Wei (female) from Fudan University, who spoke on "The bad habits that Shanghai university students should reform"; Xia Chengyu (female) from the National Conservatory of Music, who spoke on "Self-improvement as the basis for serving humanity"; and Xu Shaoti from Jiaotong University, who spoke on "Restoring self-confidence, strengthening mutual belief, and enhancing mutual trust are sufficient to strengthen the organizational power of the nation." After the speeches, gifts were distributed. In addition to some of the same gifts as the previous middle school students, there were also books such as "Eastern Miscellany," "Education Magazine," "Current Affairs Yearbook," "Ta Kung Pao," and "Youth's Self-cultivation and Training" from the Life Bookstore.

In addition, there are about 1,800 schools established by the City Party Headquarters and private individuals who are enthusiastic about literacy education in factories and companies, with about 87,000 students enrolled. The sixth session of literacy schools is about to begin, with a total of 83 schools and 222 classes. We hope to make continuous efforts to completely eliminate illiteracy in this city in the near future. However, this matter is of great importance. All of you present today are education experts. I hope you will criticize and help so that this great work of building the country and educating the people can be completed. (End)

### The Public Works Bureau Held a Board Meeting Yesterday and Passed an Increase in the Municipal General Tax

Chinese Directors Argued Forcefully, But the Voting Resulted in Failure by One Vote

The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession passed a proposal yesterday afternoon to increase the municipal general tax to 16 percent. Although the five Chinese directors opposed it, they were outnumbered, and the proposal passed by a single vote. The details are as follows:

Chinese Directors Opposed: The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession proposed to increase the municipal general tax from 14 percent to 16 percent for some time. On the 22nd, the Bureau held a Finance Committee meeting and formally decided to submit the proposal to the Board of Directors for approval and implementation. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese directors held a preliminary meeting to discuss their opposition, hoping to overturn the proposal.

Board Meeting Passed: The Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau held a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The directors present were Chairman Arnold, Directors Keswick, Yamamoto, Potter, MacNaughton, Mitchell, Bu, Guo Xu, Xi Yushu, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, and Yu Qiaqing. Chairman Arnold presided over the meeting. After the proposal to increase the municipal general tax to 16 percent was put forward, the Chinese directors successively stood up and spoke, explaining the economic downturn in Shanghai in recent years. Although there has been a slight recovery last year, it is still difficult to restore to the original state for a while, and it is difficult to increase the tax again. Chairman Arnold then explained the financial difficulties, stating that without increasing the general tax, it would be almost impossible to balance the financial revenue and expenditure. After a long debate, a vote was held. As a result, except for the five Chinese directors who unanimously voted against the proposal and the two Japanese directors who remained neutral, the six British and American directors present voted in favor. The proposal was passed by a vote of "five against six." It is rumored that the Bureau has decided that the new tax rate will be implemented from July 1st of this year.

### Chairman of the Harmony Chamber of Commerce Praises China's Progress

Agricultural Production Increased Last Year... Commercial Recovery... Leadership Achievements... Popular Support

Yesterday's North China Daily News reported on the important remarks made by Chairman MacKinnon of the Shanghai Harmony Chamber of Commerce at the annual meeting held on Tuesday afternoon at the North China Daily News Building on the Bund, discussing the general business situation in China. Although it is something we have often heard, it can also be seen that foreigners in Shanghai have a general goodwill towards our country. The summary is as follows:

Mackinnon said: "Last year, I expressed my opinion at the annual meeting that several factors indicated that the worst economic recession that China had experienced for many years had reached its peak, and a turnaround could be expected in the future. This view has now been realized. It was not until the winter of last year that the improvement began, which was largely due to the good harvest, which increased the purchasing power of the villagers. In addition, the political situation in most parts of China was relatively stable, so the commercial recovery was even easier. The cooperation between Nanjing and Guangdong, and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident, were two important aspects of political progress. Domestically, the authorities now only have to deal with the Communist Party. The extent of the central government's power has never been as great as it is today. However, the only shortcoming is that the puppet autonomous government in North China, with the assistance of foreign forces, still exists, allowing smugglers to take advantage of the opportunity. The scale of this smuggling is unprecedented anywhere in the world. The Nanjing government is well aware of the harm this causes to the recovery and progress of China's economy and has done its best to take various severe steps to deal with it. Unfortunately, its power cannot reach those lawbreakers, so many efforts have been ineffective. Although customs duties have been greatly reduced due to smuggling, loan repayments secured by customs duties can still be paid. This is largely due to the proper measures taken by Minister of Finance Kong. China's overseas credit has been greatly restored. Not only have many railway loans and foreign debts that were overdue for a long time been repaid, but also a firm plan has been adopted to seriously control the income from customs duties. This important development has been praised by renowned financiers such as Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, and the price of Chinese securities in the London market has risen sharply. This is a clear indication that the world has regained confidence in China. Throughout the past year, China's political situation has become more stable than before, thanks to the efforts of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. When Chiang resigned due to the Xi'an Incident, the government refused to accept it, believing that national affairs still needed to rely on Chiang's services. The recent expression of popular support for Chiang has made him aware that the public approves of all his efforts. Chiang's achievements are also due to the assistance of his wife. Wang Jingwei has recently returned to China from Europe and has made a strong declaration on China's future policy. The most noteworthy aspect is the recovery of lost territories. There has been great progress in the transportation of railways, highways, and wireless telephones last year, which is closely related to the unity of the country (and the import and export of goods in the interior can be faster, which has greatly benefited businesses). An income tax was promulgated last year, but a method has not yet been agreed upon with diplomats to apply it to those who enjoy extraterritorial rights. A new insurance law was also announced, but it has not yet been implemented due to many difficulties. Speaking of the legal system, I would like to express a fervent hope that the laws regarding mortgages have various inconveniences, causing industries of great value to be idle and useless, which is a major obstacle to the recovery of the market. I hope the authorities can improve it. Military spending accounts for a large part of the national expenditure. Unless a portion of this expenditure is transferred to more profitable enterprises, public utilities will still be affected, and high tax rates will have to be maintained, causing a heavy burden on the general public. Regarding export trade, I would like to endorse the opinion recently expressed by the chairman of the Shanghai Export Merchants Association, giving export trade the opportunity to develop and not interfering with it politically. Although diplomatic representatives from both China and Japan have held talks several times, there has been no significant change. The situation in North China remains the main obstacle to resolving the differences between the two sides. I hope that a possible solution can be found as soon as possible so that both sides can get what they want. Rural reconstruction has made good progress due to the abundant harvest of farmers last year. The exchange rates of the gold pound and the US dollar were stable last year, with very little fluctuation. This is the effect of the Chinese government's first year of currency control. Judging from various matters, there is a hope of an upward trend in trade next year. There is one thing that must be reported: with the implementation of the legal tender, all prices in the interior will inevitably rise, and the labor unrest demanding increased wages will inevitably follow. The total amount of customs revenue last year has been seen in the customs report, but I must tell you that although it was reduced by 50 million yuan due to smuggling, the revenue still increased by about 90 million yuan compared to the previous year. Other matters have been seen in the annual report and monthly publications, so I will not go into detail." After the chairman finished his speech, he appointed new officials and adjourned the meeting.

### Income Tax Implementation Rules Cannot Be Changed Easily

Deadline for Capital Reports is Approaching

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's request to amend the income tax implementation rules has been approved by the Ministry, but it is not appropriate to change them easily. The deadline for capital deposit reports is the end of March. The details are as follows:

Provisions Cannot Be Amended: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly held classes on income tax, with more than 1,000 shop assistants attending. In order to facilitate the implementation, it has also invited representatives from various chambers of commerce and trade associations in the city to discuss in detail and request amendments. After the meeting, a special committee was established to study the implementation rules and requested 14 amendments or additions. On March 5th, the committee submitted these requests to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance for adoption. The most important of the 14 points is: ㊀ The retention of public reserve funds is intended to increase the financial strength of shops and prepare them for operational needs. In terms of not distributing the reserve funds to shareholders, it is the same as new capital invested in the shops by the shareholders. The current restriction, allowing only one-half to be incorporated into the capital, does not reflect the intention. It is requested that the phrase "one-half" in the first item of that article be deleted and replaced with "those with public reserve funds may calculate it according to the total amount incorporated into the capital." ㊁ The stipulated tax refund period is because taxes are paid on a regular basis, so tax refunds should be handled in the same way to avoid merchants waiting for years and suffering losses. It is understood that after the submission was received by the Ministry of Finance, it was approved with document number 481: "It is understood that the request to amend and add to the implementation rules of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax involves legal matters and cannot be changed easily. The submission has been sent to the Income Tax Affairs Office for reference. Please be informed accordingly."

Deadline for Capital Declaration: The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Regarding the case of trade associations submitting reports on capital, etc., our office quickly invited representatives from various trade associations to talk in batches. All the methods for reporting income tax matters by the participating merchants of various trade associations have been discussed and the designated staff of our office. If there are any points that are not clear or have questions, they will be answered one by one. Our office has learned from the talks with the representatives that the various trade associations can take the responsibility of leading the industry and fulfill the task of assisting the government. We are very pleased to have you do so. There are very few trade associations that did not participate in this meeting, and our office has also sent the printed reports to them for reference. However, it has been found that the deadline for reporting one of the items that merchants should report, ㊀ the capital amount report form or the company share report form, ㊁ the merchant's deposit receipt report form, and ㊂ the salary income amount report form for January of this year, ㊃ the interest income amount report form for January, and ㊄ the withholding list, has passed. Each merchant should submit the above report forms to their respective trade associations by the 27th of this month, and the trade associations should submit them to our office within two days (i.e., by the end of March) for registration and review. This is the last grace period. In addition to informing each representative face-to-face, we are also telegraphing your association to request that you notify all trade associations to promptly inform them and handle the matter separately. Please do not delay any further. This is what we earnestly hope for. (Signed) Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance"

### Japanese Rogue Carries Contraband into the Country, Refuses Inspection, and Assaults Customs Officers

Carrying a Large Number of Morphine Needles - Two Customs Officers Assaulted - The Rogue Has Been Handed Over to the Japanese Consulate General for Investigation

According to the Central News Agency, at around 11:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese ship "Chichibu Maru" arrived in Shanghai from Japan. When the ship docked at the Huishan Wharf, customs officers from the Jianghai Customs went to inspect the ship as usual. Unexpectedly, after the ship docked, a large group of Japanese rogues swarmed out of the cabin with heavy objects. Customs officers Zhang Wenzhi and Li Longjin saw that they were in a hurry and carrying heavy objects, so they rushed to urge them to return to the ship for inspection. Unexpectedly, the rogues punched Zhang and Li in the face and fled. Customs Officer Zhang's nose was injured and bleeding, and Customs Officer Li's face was swollen. After being attacked, Zhang and Li still bravely chased after them. Because the rogues were carrying heavy objects and wearing wooden clogs, they stumbled and fell to the ground. The customs officers gathered around and detained the rogues. After inspection, it was found that the rogues were carrying a large number of injection needles for injecting morphine, which is a prohibited import. After receiving the report, the customs authorities were extremely angry that the rogues had brought the contraband into the country and assaulted customs officers. The rogue who committed the assault was escorted by personnel from the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai to the Consulate for investigation.

### Thai Trade Commissioner to China, Weile, Returned to Hong Kong Yesterday

According to the Central News Agency, the Sino-Thai Association was established in Beijing, and the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors was convened, electing Zhou Qigang and the Thai Trade Commissioner to China, Weile, as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, and He Lian as the standing supervisor. President Chiang and 30 others were appointed as honorary directors. The day before yesterday (23rd), Weile visited various agencies in Beijing and then came to Shanghai, staying at the New Asia Hotel. He also visited President Yu and President Liang in Shanghai to bid farewell. When reporters visited Weile yesterday, Liao Liejin, who was sent by the Sino-Thai Association to see him off, translated for him. According to Weile, the impression he got in Beijing this time was very good, and he was very grateful for the hospitality he received from all parties. The reason why the Thai Trade Commissioner's Office to China was first established in Hong Kong is that the trade relationship between Thailand and South China is closer than that with Central China. In the future, efforts will be made to develop in various parts of Central China, and efforts will also be made to establish an office in Shanghai as soon as possible. During the conversation, he also showed reporters the precious gifts given by Chairman Chen Shuren of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and his love for them was evident. Weile has already taken the Russian Empress ship back to Hong Kong yesterday, and Ying Jun will return to Beijing to report after sending Weile off. It is also learned that Cai Zengji, manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, held a banquet at the Capital Hotel to bid farewell to Weile before his departure.

### The "Changde" Steamship Was Safely Rescued Yesterday Morning

Although the Cargo Was Stolen, the Ship's Property Was Fortunately Preserved - Thanks to Mr. Xu Zufan

The "Changde" steamship of the Liyuan Shipping Company ran aground on the Xiaowei Sandbar outside Wusong and was abandoned by the crew. Later, Xu Zufan, a surveyor from the China Ship Insurance Joint Association, took 70 coolies and escorted the entire crew of the abandoned ship back to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 21st, they boarded the rescue ship "Muller" and sailed to the vicinity of Xiaowei Sandbar to rescue the ship. On the morning of the 22nd, the crew returned to the ship and saw that the contents of the ship had been stolen by

Sea Bandits - All the cabin doors were opened, and there was nothing left of the public goods that could be taken. The crew's luggage, clothes, wire ropes on the deck, and food in the kitchen were all swept away. The important mechanical parts of the steering platform and the wireless radio parts, anything that could be dismantled, had all been stolen. The extent of the loss is evident. Fortunately, the large cabin was filled with coal, which the bandits did not want, so it remained untouched. On the morning of the 22nd, when the tide rose, the sea water was 21 feet deep, and the ship's draft was 23 feet. Mr. Xu immediately ordered the rescue to begin. The first day failed to rescue it, because Mr. Xu, given that the ship was already 43 years old and the hull had sunk into the sand trough, if he dragged it with force, he was deeply concerned that it would be like the Taikoo's "Jian" ship, which broke in two. Therefore, he stopped working after the first tow and ordered the cargo to be unloaded after investigation. Because there was no barge, he had to

Dump Coal into the Sea - About 300 tons, reducing the ship's draft by one foot. However, the sea surface around the ship was only 18 feet deep. At 8:00 AM on the 23rd, the engine room was flooded by waves, and the water had been pumped out. The ship's water also heated. Then for the second tow rescue, but the sea fog was so dense that it was difficult to see anything. Mr. Xu was afraid that the weather would change drastically, and if it could not be rescued this time, there would be little hope in the future. Then, "Muller" was commanded to sail, and Mr. Xu guided everything. The sea was full of risks and disasters. But at 9:10, the steamship was safely towed out of the sandy sea and into the deep water. The structure of the ship was without damage. However, it could not navigate due to the stolen machinery. So "Muller" continued to tow it,

Guided Sailing to Shanghai - During the 70-nautical-mile voyage, there were various difficulties. Fortunately, the large tugboat "Kristin Muller" that Shanghai dispatched twice opened to, and escorted to return to Shanghai. At Wusong at 10 pm that night, The Maritime Administration is investigating the sailors who left the ship without authorization and returned to Shanghai, disregarding the property of the shipowner and passengers, which is shocking. The shipowners at the time were deeply concerned that after the crew left the ship, the complete ship would be taken away, which would be unthinkable. Fortunately, Mr. Xu Zufan safely rescued the ship. The shipowners, cargo owners, and insurance industry all felt that his preservation of the ship and cargo was like recovering the lost property and were extremely grateful. Now the hull must be inspected after the cargo is unloaded.

### Record of Mr. Fujiyama's Remarks in a Japanese Newspaper

It is said that China, both high and low, is enthusiastic about national construction

The Japanese newspaper "Shanghai Daily" translated by Wairensha stated that the Japanese economic mission that recently visited China formally concluded its exchange with the Chinese side on the 22nd. The mission was disbanded in Shanghai, and members acted freely, returning to their respective countries one after another. Among the members, the youngest, Mr. Aiichiro Fujiyama, president of Dai-Nippon Sugar Manufacturing Co., Ltd., visited China for the first time. Accompanying him were Director Takami and Mr. Nakamura, secretary of the Japan Sugar Industry Federation. They are currently staying in Shanghai, continuing cordial talks with leaders of the sugar industry on the Chinese side. They are scheduled to return to Japan on the 27th aboard the Shanghai Maru, accompanied by Mr. Kodama, the mission leader, and others. Mr. Fujiyama, 41 years old, is a young Japanese entrepreneur. This being his first visit to China, his impression of the emerging China is different from others. The reporter visited Mr. Fujiyama on the 11th floor, Room 5 of the International Hotel on the morning of the 23rd. He spoke highly of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and China's determination to build a unified nation, saying: "Previously, the China I heard about from books and other people was just a country with a blurred picture. After coming to Shanghai and Nanjing, I realized how awakened China has become in reality and its enthusiasm for completing national unification. This is not limited to key figures in the Nanjing government, but also young officials, clerks, and the so-called intellectual class, even students and merchants are all acting under the same consciousness, which can be seen everywhere. Moreover, political and industrial figures fully understand the efforts towards economic construction, which is deeply felt. If this situation continues, China's political and economic development will inevitably take a new leap sooner or later. At the numerous welcome parties held for us, this enthusiasm was often frankly expressed, which was very touching. To complete national unification, it is essential to join hands with neighboring Japan, which shares the same script and culture; otherwise, the goal may not be achieved. This straightforward expression of spirit is particularly appealing. Under such circumstances, if Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has a foundation, Japanese investment in China will likely be automatically promoted in the future. The results of the discussions between Chinese and Japanese business leaders over the past three days have been promising in this regard. The reason why opinions between China and Japan cannot be aligned is that the Chinese side is too sentimental about the past, misunderstands the reality, and makes political demands. Chinese business leaders insisted on discussing political issues, which greatly surprised the Japanese members. In short, there are still many twists and turns to the realization of true Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, which still requires mutual effort. At least, creating an atmosphere for open discussions between business leaders of the two countries on cooperation on public occasions is the biggest gain of this visit. When the delegation was invited to a tea party by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Chiang specifically asked Mr. Fujiyama to accompany the delegation leader Kodama to a separate room to reminisce about the old days because of his previous acquaintance with Mr. Fujiyama's father, Reita Fujiyama, and the late Eiichi Shibusawa. Mr. Fujiyama talked about the conversation with Chiang at that time, saying that Chiang asked, "When I met your father in Japan ten years ago, he was still suffering from foot pain. How is he now?" This made him deeply feel Chiang's strong memory. Even he could not remember whether his father had foot problems ten years ago. It is no coincidence that Chiang has the faith of Chinese youth. Also, when departing from Nanjing Airport on the 17th, Chiang specifically sent his aide-de-camp, Qian Dajun, to present his business card and said, "Please say hello to your father. I am very sorry that I cannot see him off," and so on.

### Haiheng Steamer Departs Shanghai This Afternoon

Xiamen-Philippines Line Maiden Voyage Postponed to the 18th

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new steamer "Haiting" for the Xiamen-Philippines route has been repaired at the Jiangnan Shipyard and moored at the Jinliyuan Wharf.

The Business Section Chief, Zeng Guangqing, will take this opportunity to travel to Xiamen to oversee everything. The Philippine flag has also been prepared for hoisting when the ship arrives in the Philippines. The Passenger Ticket Section Chief, He Quansheng, is temporarily unable to travel to Xiamen due to busy official duties.

### Wen Liang, Who Studied Police Administration in Japan, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Mr. Wen Liang, who was sent by the Shanghai Municipal Government to Japan to study police administration some years ago, has completed his studies and returned to Shanghai yesterday aboard the Japanese mail ship Chichibu Maru. According to reports, Japanese police achievements are the best, with a reputation as the first in the world. All those who come to Japan praise the peace and order of Japanese society. However, the reasons why Japanese police have their current status are: ① The public understands and cooperates with the police; ② Japanese police have a spirit of loyalty to the emperor, love for the country, integrity, and devotion to public service; ③ Diligence and hard work. Our country's politics are now on track, and the police should also strive for reform. In the past, our country's police focused on a centralized system, which was also appropriate for the time and place. In the future, we should adopt a decentralized system, imitating Japan's "special zone system." Villages should set up police posts, and cities should set up police stations, striving to be close to the people.

### Sugar Merchants' Groups Hosted a Dinner Yesterday for Japanese Sugar Merchants

More than 20 people including Mr. Fujiyama attended. Zheng Zenan, Yuan Liang, and others delivered speeches.

The National Sugar Production and Sales Association of China and the Sugar Industry Association hosted a dinner yesterday at 12:00 noon at the Lido Garden in honor of the members of the Japanese economic mission visiting China, including Aiichiro Fujiyama, Chairman of the Japan Sugar Industry Federation, and Japanese nationals Seiji Nakamura, Goro Takami, Kishii Yamanishi, Kanroku Oyama, Ryosuke Hatada, and Zuitō Araki, as well as more than 20 people including Yuan Liang, Huang Jiangquan, Lang Guangrui, Shi Yuchun, and Zheng Zenan from the sugar industry. The following is a record of the speeches.

Mr. Zheng's Speech: After taking their seats, Zheng Zenan, on behalf of the hosts, stood up and delivered a speech, saying: "Today, the National Sugar Production and Sales Association of China and the Sugar Industry Association are hosting this banquet for Mr. Fujiyama and the Japanese guests. We are greatly honored by your presence. Mr. Fujiyama's visit to China is to promote genuine friendship and economic cooperation between the two countries, and we deeply hope for its success so that China and Japan can achieve co-existence and co-prosperity. Mr. Fujiyama has expressed his hope for the development of our country's sugar industry and his willingness to assist us with Japan's excellent sugar manufacturing technology, for which we are especially grateful. He has also proposed inviting colleagues to visit Taiwan to observe the sugar manufacturing industry in the near future. We have always had this wish, but it has been difficult to fulfill due to various circumstances. Now that we have received Mr. Fujiyama's personal invitation, we may organize a tour group in April to visit the various sugar factories' great equipment and sugar manufacturing technology as a reference for our country. Regarding Mr. Fujiyama's hope to increase trade between Japanese sugar and China, we will certainly work hard. However, we have several points of view that were presented at the banquet on the 11th, and we are very grateful that Mr. Fujiyama will take them back home to ease our ardent hopes. Mr. Fujiyama's stay in Shanghai is short, and although we have had the opportunity to hear his teachings, we have not been able to have a thorough discussion, which is regrettable. Therefore, we especially hope that Mr. Fujiyama can come to China often so that we can learn more from him. Today, we have only prepared simple food and wine, which is very inadequate, and we apologize deeply. I would like to raise my glass to wish Mr. Fujiyama success on this trip."

Mr. Yuan's Speech: Yuan Liang then delivered a speech, saying: "This Japanese economic mission came to China and frankly and thoroughly discussed the points of disagreement between the two countries since the September 18th Incident. Not only Mr. Fujiyama personally, but also all the members of the mission have deeply understood this. We hope that you will convey this to the Japanese government and public after returning home so that relations between the two countries can improve. We also hope that your factory's sugar products will come to China and expand sales, which is secondary. Sino-Japanese friendship has been loudly proclaimed for a long time, but it has been difficult to achieve due to a lack of sincerity in the past. However, there is now a good opportunity, and we hope that you will take on this important mission and gradually promote its success."

Mr. Fujiyama's Reply: Finally, Fujiyama replied, saying: "I am very grateful for the warm hospitality I received on this visit to your country with the economic mission, and I am also very grateful for this banquet today. I have gained a full understanding of the situation in your country. After returning home, I will certainly try to implement our mission to harmonize relations between the two countries and implement economic cooperation. I also hope that you will come to Japan as soon as possible. After April each year, the raw materials for the sugar factories are exhausted, and the machines may be stopped. Moreover, the cherry blossoms in our country will be in full bloom at that time, which is perfect for sightseeing. I very much hope for the development of your country's domestic sugar. Our country's sugar manufacturing technology is not something to boast about, but it is certainly superior. If you need assistance, I am very willing to contribute. Today's banquet has been very grand, and I would like to express my gratitude."

### Disaster Relief Funds for Henan Province Arriving

Finance Minister Kong Continues to Pledge 100,000 Yuan Advance; Three Banks Also Advance 100,000 Yuan

The United Relief Association of various charitable organizations in Shanghai previously sent Zhu Qinglan, Lu Bohong, and Mu Guanchu to Henan Province to investigate the severity of the disaster. Since the disaster in the province is extremely serious, Lu Bohong returned to Shanghai first. He reported the findings to Finance Minister Kong the day before yesterday. Kong, considering the plight of the disaster victims in the province, has decided to advance another 100,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance in addition to the 100,000 yuan previously promised.

### Representatives of Cigarette Factories Take Petition to Beijing

Detailing Difficulties and Appealing for Exemption from Tax Increase

The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association recently heard that the government was considering increasing taxes. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, a meeting was convened, and it was unanimously agreed that handmade and hand-cranked private cigarettes were rampant in various provinces and had not yet been eradicated, which had greatly affected the cigarette merchants' business. Moreover, the prices of various raw materials have recently soared, and cigarette production costs have invisibly increased. If the selling price is slightly increased, it is feared that private cigarettes will take the opportunity to sell, making it difficult to advance or retreat. Now that the rainy season is approaching, cigarettes are easily moldy, which is even more worrying. If taxes are increased again, it will be unbearable. Therefore, it was decided to send Shen Weizhu, chairman of the association, and supervising committee members Shen Xingde, Bao Gengsheng, Jing Yimeng, Liang Zhidong, and Ge Xiongfu to Beijing that night to petition the Central Political Committee, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Tax Administration, requesting a temporary suspension of the tax increase. The following is an excerpt from their petition: "Presenting a petition regarding the rampancy of private cigarettes and requesting exemption from tax increase in order to cultivate tax sources and maintain business, we respectfully request your review. In recent years, the cigarette business has been repeatedly affected by handmade and hand-cranked private cigarettes, resulting in significant losses for the cigarette merchants. Since the tax increase on December 5, 1931, the selling price of lower-grade cigarettes has increased due to the tax increase, causing the expansion of private cigarettes in various provinces, which has greatly affected the revenue of national taxes and the business of cigarette merchants, with no compensation. Later, with the strict suppression by the authorities and the assistance of cigarette merchants, the power of private cigarettes was slightly reduced. If we can continue to work hard and handle the situation properly, it is hoped that private cigarettes in various provinces can be eradicated, which will benefit the country and the merchants. However, the proposal for a tax increase has arisen before private cigarettes have been eradicated, which has shocked and dismayed the cigarette merchants. Now, we humbly present this to your committee: ① The rise and fall of the cigarette business is related to the prevalence of private cigarettes. Therefore, the higher the cigarette tax rate, the higher the selling price, and the faster and wider the sales of private cigarettes. It is found that the retail value of private cigarettes in various provinces is only about three or four copper yuan per ten cigarettes in Shanghai, while the lowest selling price of taxable cigarettes must reach ten copper yuan, more than double that of private cigarettes, causing private cigarettes to spread like wildfire, while the cigarette merchants' business is declining, and the revenue of national taxes is also affected. Moreover, the prices of raw materials have recently soared, and cigarette production costs have invisibly increased. The cigarette merchants are planning to increase the selling price to compensate, but they are still hesitant for fear of affecting business. The difficulty of advancing or retreating can also be seen. If we ignore these facts and increase the tax rate again, the distance between the selling price of taxable cigarettes and private cigarettes will be even greater, and how can their business be asked about? If you want to buy ten cigarettes for ten copper yuan, how can you get them? And the power of private cigarettes will inevitably expand accordingly, which will not only greatly affect the cigarette merchants' business, but also damage the national tax revenue. This should be withdrawn from the proposal for a tax increase in order to cultivate tax sources and maintain business. After private cigarettes are eradicated, then we can discuss the tax increase, which will not hinder the country or the merchants. If our government is really considering increasing tax revenue, it can slightly increase the tax on upper-grade cigarettes. In terms of merchant strength and cigarette prices, it seems that it can be reluctantly borne, which is completely different from the situation where lower-grade cigarettes must not be taxed. ② Now that it is the rainy season, cigarettes are easily moldy. If taxes are increased at this time, retail stores will inevitably store more inventory, which will inevitably lead to moldy places, threatening both national taxes and business. This is the second reason why the tax increase should be temporarily suspended. In summary, the cigarette business is greatly affected by private cigarettes, and there is still no solution. The threat to lower-grade cigarettes is particularly great. If we add taxes again, it will only make private cigarettes spread more and more, and the situation will become impossible to solve. The association believes that this matter is related to the vital interests of cigarette merchants and the abundance or scarcity of tax sources. We dare to express our feelings and request that, in addition to submitting the request to the superiors, we respectfully report the reasons why the tax should not be increased, and respectfully request your committee to consider the commercial situation and approve the instructions from the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Finance to maintain the status quo, exempting the tax increase in order to cultivate tax sources and maintain business, and we will wait for your orders with utmost trepidation. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Wang of the Central Political Committee, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, and Director Wu of the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance."

### Zhang Guixing's Corpse Examined After Injury; Qiao Yinglin Denies Murder

Zhang Guixing, a 19-year-old tea worker from Yangzhou, working at the Jinji Silk Flower Shop at No. 12 Gongxuli, Guangdong Road, was allegedly playing with his companion Qiao Yinglin around 6:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month, smearing oil used for cleaning bicycles on each other's faces, which led to a dispute. Qiao then allegedly hit Zhang on the head with a spittoon, causing him to fall to the ground injured. He had been bedridden ever since. Around 7:00 p.m. the night before last, his condition worsened. Dr. Zang Boyong was called for treatment, but it was ineffective. Zhang's father, Tongtai, immediately reported the incident to the local general police station. Detectives Jindes and others were sent to investigate. Zhang refused to be sent to the hospital for treatment, so there were no results at that time. Unexpectedly, Zhang died at 11:00 p.m. that night. The next morning, Zhang's father reported to the police station again. Detectives then sent the corpse to Renji Hospital for a brief examination before transferring it to the Pillon Road morgue to await examination. Qiao Yinglin was arrested and detained in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court for detention. Around 10:00 a.m., the First Special Court appointed Prosecutor Song Genshan, accompanied by Forensic Doctors Wei and Zhang, clerks, and others, to the morgue to examine the corpse. After the detectives explained the situation, Qiao Yinglin, a 25-year-old from Pudong, stated that the deceased first smeared oil on his face, and after he retaliated, he fled to a small room. The deceased then chased him and pushed him to the ground. There happened to be a spittoon there, which he was holding in his hand, and the deceased came to snatch it, causing himself to be injured. The deceased's father, Zhang Tongtai, also submitted a report requesting an inquest. Judge Song determined that the cause of death was unclear and ordered that the corpse be dissected before further review.

### Coal Gas Vehicle Testing Committee Successfully Builds Coal Gas Vehicle

To Participate in the Beijing-Yunnan Exhibition Tour, Open for Public Viewing Tomorrow

The Coal Gas Vehicle Testing Committee, organized by the National Highway Transportation Committee, has been established for a year and a half. Director Zhang Dengyi has been diligently studying and devoting himself to the cause. Now, the coal gas vehicle independently built by the committee has been successfully completed. It will participate in the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Exhibition Tour, organized by the Executive Yuan of the National Government, in early April, embarking on a long-distance journey. The car's features surpass those of ordinary coal gas vehicles: ❶ Ignition is extremely fast, igniting in one minute and starting in five minutes. ❷ It can use both charcoal and anthracite as fuel. When using anthracite, it is durable and can reduce the frequency of adding charcoal and increase engine horsepower. ❸ The gasifier is installed inside the car body, no different from a gasoline car in appearance, and the design is aesthetically pleasing. It is said that the car will participate in the Beijing-Yunnan Exhibition Tour and plans to detour through Hangzhou, taking the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to Zhenjiang and then to Beijing, performing along the way before heading to Kunming, covering a distance of over four thousand kilometers. Mr. Zhang will accompany the trip. It is also scheduled to host a public viewing at the Public Bus Management Office at 252 Xiexu Road at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 26th), demonstrating the ignition, starting, and driving procedures. Starting from the 27th, the car will be displayed on Heping Road for public viewing.

### Election Dispute in the Soy Sauce Industry

Was it Forged Ballots? Was it Defamation by the Defeated?

Han Xingwei, Chairman of the Shanghai Soy Sauce Industry Association, and directors Fang Kelin and Wan Dongsheng, were elected on December 10th of last year. However, member Qian Xichu discovered that more than sixty of the ballots were forged and filed a complaint with the District Court. Prosecutor Li investigated and prosecuted Han, Fang, and Wan for obstructing voting under Article 146 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Wu opened the court. Prosecutor Li requested to change the charge to forgery of documents under Article 126 of the Criminal Law. According to Han's testimony, after the election on November 10th of last year, the former chairman Zhang Dalian went to report to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department. The original ballots were taken to his home by his secretary based on our report, but it is unknown whether they were opened or not, etc. Fang and Wan's testimonies were similar. Their defense lawyer claimed it was defamation by the defeated Zhang Dalian. The court concluded the debate, and the verdict will be announced on the 31st.

### Police File Appeal in the Blood Soul Eradication Group Case

The Original Judgment Found Jiang Zhonghe and Others Not Guilty; Police Believe Investigation Was Incomplete

Jiang Zhonghe, manager of Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory and Xidou National Goods Company, Ren Jinping, secretary of the Fish Market, and Wang Jingzhi and Wang Zixiang, etc., participated in the Blood Soul Eradication Group organized by Zhang Zilian of the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory. Under the guise of patriotism, they threw bombs at various businesses to achieve their fraudulent financial goals. After the incident, the police arrested Jiang and others and escorted them to the First Special Court. Wang Zixiang's confession revealed:

Disturbing Order

A fine of three hundred yuan was imposed. Jiang Zhonghe, Ren Jinping, and Wang Jingzhi were declared not guilty, and the main suspect Zhang Zilian, who was at large, was wanted. This has been reported in this newspaper several times. It is now known that the Bureau of Public Works expressed dissatisfaction with this judgment and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, along with Associate Judges Nie and Zhou, convened a hearing in the First Criminal Court. The appellants hired lawyers such as Wu Linkun to appear in court for defense. The police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated:

Reasons for Disagreement

Divided into two parts: ❶ Regarding the acquittal of Jiang Zhonghe, Ren Jinping, and Wang Jingzhi, it is stated that the reason why the Bureau of Public Works prosecuted Jiang and others, and the reason why the original court issued arrest warrants for the defendants, was because the confession of the accomplice Wang Tiemin proved that the aforementioned appellants also participated in the Blood Soul Eradication Group. Therefore, when Jiang and others were arrested for trial, the accomplice Wang Tiemin should have been brought to the case according to law to testify in order to discover the truth and serve as the basis for a guilty or not guilty verdict. Now, the original trial was conducted while Wang Tiemin

Had Not Been Apprehended

Before the truth was discovered, a verdict of not guilty was pronounced. The appellants naturally cannot accept it. They should request the original judgment to be revoked and a new judgment to be made, and request to bring Yu Tiemin back for questioning according to their authority. ❷ Regarding the part of Wang Zixiang sentenced to a fine of three hundred and one yuan, it is believed that the punishment is too light. The various illegal circumstances of the Blood Soul Eradication Group, which used patriotism and national salvation as slogans and extortion as its purpose, have come to light since the accomplices such as Wang Tiemin were arrested. This kind of

Despicable Means

Compared to those who are starving and desperate, taking risks is even more inferior. Now, only a fine of three hundred yuan is imposed, and the original trial did not do its best to investigate, so it cannot be accepted. Therefore, the appeal was made. Subsequently, Presiding Judge Yu questioned the appellants one by one and listened to the lawyers of both parties. After the debate, the debate on this case was concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 30th. The appellants still each posted a bond of two thousand yuan.

Spring Snow Falls, Detrimental to Agriculture

Recently, the climate in this city has been inconsistent, with alternating sunshine and rain, seeing several changes in a single day. After a thunderstorm and wind and rain on the evening of the 22nd, the past two days have turned cold again, resembling the depths of winter. The sky was overcast all day, with occasional rain, but it stopped as soon as it started. Suddenly, around 5:00 PM yesterday, snowflakes fell, lasting for about a quarter of an hour, turning into snow pellets mixed with drizzle. At the same time, the northwest wind blew tightly, and the weather changed dramatically. Around 6:50 PM, snowflakes fell again, large and numerous, rolling down. The momentum was very strong.

### Weak Woman Drifts, Sues for Property Division

Shen Yilu, a local woman, is twenty-four years old and lives at 49 Panjiazhai, Triangle Area, Xujiahui, Shanghai. In the District Court, she sued her paternal uncle Shen Hongding (living at 8 Dingxingli, Zhaojiabang Road, Old West Gate) for property division, stating that because our ancestors valued the family system, communal ownership was considered the highest virtue, so it was passed down for generations without division. There is more than one mu of land and dozens of tile houses on Zhaojiabang Road, managed by the defendant alone for many years. The plaintiff lost her parents at a young age and has no brothers. Her sisters also married early. Alone and destitute, she has no choice but to ask the defendant to divide the ancestral property so that she can maintain her livelihood. The defendant has malicious intentions, deceiving the plaintiff's weakness and incompetence, and wants to embezzle the plaintiff's due property. The defendant did not agree to the original request, only promising to give a few hundred yuan to settle the matter. Therefore, asking the defendant is like seeking skin from a tiger. The plaintiff filed a request for mediation, which was unsuccessful. Therefore, she asked the court to order the delivery of the title deeds of the ancestral property and to divide them proportionally. Yesterday, the Presiding Judge questioned, but the defendant did not arrive. The plaintiff stated that because she lost both parents at a young age, she was sent to an orphanage by her uncle, so the contents of the property were unclear for a while. Now she is drifting and struggling to make a living by sewing. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Lawsuit for Embezzlement of Public Funds by the Sixth District Tea Workers' Union

The Reorganizing Committee Sues the Former Standing Committee Members; Both Defendants Released on Bail Separately

The Reorganizing Committee member and Standing Committee member of the Shanghai Sixth District Tea Industry Union, Zeng, and lawyers Li Huayan and Zhang Juansheng, filed a complaint in the District Court against the former Standing Directors of the Union, Yu Yuanru and Yu Naigeng, for embezzling public funds, stating that the defendants were elected in May of the twenty-first year. Due to corrupt management, on February 7th of this year, the plaintiffs were appointed by the Municipal Party Department as Reorganizing Committee members and Standing Committee members. After taking over, examining the accounts, they discovered:

Embezzlement of Public Funds Was Enormous: ❶ From May 16th of the twenty-third year, the membership fee was collected from 147 members, each paying 2.4 yuan, totaling 592.8 yuan. The operating fee was collected from 192 members, each paying 3 yuan, totaling 576 yuan (deducting 17.4 yuan in arrears). The above totaled 1,151.4 yuan, but checking the recorded income and expenditure ledger, only 440 yuan was received. The remaining 700 yuan was not recorded. ❷ The union's finances were quite affluent, so in the name of the union, the remaining funds from previous years were deposited in the Bank of China and the Siming Bank, and a custodian committee was appointed

Responsible for Custody: After receiving the Party Department's instruction on February 7th of this year to send personnel to reorganize, the defendant Yu Yuanru sent a letter to the plaintiffs on the 18th of the same month, scheduling the handover procedures for the 21st of the same month. Unexpectedly, Yu Yuanru secretly took the seal of the custodian committee and went to the two banks to withdraw all the funds. The plaintiff feared that he would abscond and reported it to the Xinzha Sub-bureau, which detained Yu Yuanru and released him on bail with a reliable shop as guarantor. Therefore, it is requested that he be punished under Articles 56 and 226 of the Criminal Law. The defendants Yu Yuanru first argued that the accounts were the responsibility of the

Economic Review Committee, which had nothing to do with them. As for the bank deposit book, it was already withdrawn from the twenty-fourth year of the Republic because the custodian's stamp was handed over to him. Therefore, out of curiosity, he advanced and deposited the odd amounts to avoid canceling the deposit book, etc. At the same time, Yu Yuanru hired lawyer Tao Ran to separately sue the plaintiffs Zhou Qigui and Li Hua for obstructing freedom and defamation, stating that Zhou Qigui was the secretary of the union, manipulating union affairs, coercing loans, colluding with Li Hua, alienating comrades, and inciting workers,

Deliberately Appealing to Superiors, Resulting in Reorganization: Five people, including Li Hua, were sent as Reorganizing Committee members. The plaintiffs handed over in compliance with the order. Because the union had no large amounts of remaining funds to satisfy their personal desires, they were greatly disappointed. At 7:00 PM on the 4th of this month, they took six or seven ruffians to the plaintiff's home, but he was not there. They arbitrarily searched and intimidated the family, forcing them to hand over [the funds]. At 11:00 PM, they returned, and at 12:00 AM, the plaintiff returned home and encountered them at the entrance, almost suffering a fatal blow. Fortunately, the police arrived and he was able to escape and falsely claim that the public funds he handled were not clear. After the bureau investigated,

He Was Released the Next Day: The next day, in the name of the Reorganizing Committee of the Shanghai Sixth District Tea Workers' Union, he issued a notice wantonly attacking, including statements such as "the plaintiffs have committed crimes first." Therefore, he committed crimes under Articles 302, 304, 306, and 310 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Li Xuedeng summoned them for questioning. The court ruled that the part of Yu Yuanru's lawsuit against Zhou Qigui and Li Hua for obstructing freedom was linked to Li Hua's lawsuit against Yu et al. for embezzlement and should be temporarily suspended until the embezzlement case was concluded before proceeding with the trial. The embezzlement case of Li Hua against Yu et al. was opened by Judge Wu Xiangzu, who ruled that Yu Yuanru should pay a shop bail of 1,000 yuan, and Yu Naigeng should be available at any time. The case was adjourned for further questioning.

Questioned Zhang Ganqing, he overturned the confession in the police station, claiming that the cent notes found on him were borrowed from his friends Zhang Moju (200 yuan) and Wang Shugen (60 yuan) as capital for weaving cloth, not robbed, and he did not kill a foreigner. The judge questioned why he confessed in the police station. He replied that he could not bear the hardship and was forced to confess. After the court verified the confession, it ordered a postponement until April 1st for further questioning. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Sujia Railways Revise Train Schedules

To Be Implemented on April 1st

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus have revised the train schedules for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line and the Sujia Railway, which will be implemented on the 1st of next month. According to the bureau's announcement, the most important change in this revision of the train schedule is that the 31st Shanghai-Zhahe downhill train will be advanced to depart from Shanghai North at 12:50 PM. After all Beijing-Zhahe intermodal trains are changed to run via the Sujia Railway, they are separately added to the Beijing-Shanghai 3rd train, the Sujia 255th train, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo 31st train. Before the connecting trains at the Wuxian and Jiaxing stations are connected, the waiting time is still too long. After this change, the stopping time at the two stations can be shortened by 50 minutes, providing considerable convenience for intermodal passengers. However, after this change, the travel time of the 31st train on the entire line must be extended by 10 minutes, which is still not satisfactory. Therefore, this method is still a temporary measure and needs further planning. In addition, the bureau, in view of the current spring outing season, will add temporary passenger trains up and down each day between Shanghai North and Wuxi on the Beijing-Shanghai Line from the 26th to the 29th of this month, selling only passenger tickets for Shanghai North, Wuxian, and Wuxi. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, two special charter trains will be added, scheduled to depart from Shanghai North to Zhahe on the 25th of this month and return from Zhahe to Shanghai North on the 29th. The travel schedule can be inquired at the Railway Bureau.

### Japanese Troops at Yongfeng Building and Patrols Affect Hongkou Business

Municipal Federation Branch Petitions the Municipal Government to Quickly Negotiate with the Japanese Consulate for Withdrawal

The 25th Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation submitted a petition to the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters yesterday, requesting negotiations for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Yongfeng Building, as well as the dismissal of sentry posts and patrols. The original text reads, "Submitting a petition to request a consultation with the Japanese Consulate to quickly withdraw the country's stationed troops and patrols on North Sichuan Road, so as to maintain commerce and reassure the public. The Federation is deeply concerned about the current difficulties and the economic depression in the city. Since the 'January 28th' Incident in Shanghai, rumors have been rampant for years. The Zhabei District and North Sichuan Road have always borne the brunt. For example, the dilapidated walls and broken tiles from the past have not yet been rebuilt. The number of residents is decreasing day by day, and there is no hope for recovery. All kinds of economic downturns are the reason. Although the citizens have repeatedly requested the Citizens' Federation to forward the request to the Party and government authorities, no tangible results have been seen yet, and the patrol teams travel back and forth all day long, which significantly affects commerce. How can the Federation sit idly by and wait for death, given the need to revitalize the local area and stabilize society? It is with reluctance that we dare to submit this petition again, begging for a quick response to public opinion, to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate, to withdraw the stationed troops from the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road, and to dismiss the sentry posts and patrol teams along the road, so that residents can sleep peacefully, and commerce can expand, recover, and prosper. This would be fortunate for the country and society. Sincerely submitted, etc."

Previously, due to careless remarks, she was considered by the police to be related to the sensational case of the corpse in a suitcase. She was sent to the First Special Court, where she was found not guilty and acquitted. The police were dissatisfied and appealed to the First Branch of the High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Lin was released on February 10 this year. However, Lin did not repent. Less than a month after her release, she stole a woolen sweater from Wu Baolin, a one-year-old female student at Taihe Primary School on Huade Road. She was arrested by Wang Yongjun, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, and sent to the Special Court for detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. During the postponement, Detective Wang found that Lin Gendi had sneaked into the Dongqu Primary School of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Huade Road, Huishan Road, on the 4th and 5th of this month, using the excuse of going to the toilet alone, and forcibly stripped off two woolen sweaters worth ten yuan from Wang Su'e, an eight-year-old female student. She confessed to pledging them for money. Yesterday morning, this case was continued by Judge Ye Shengchao in the Fifth Criminal Court. Police Attorney Zhang Shizhu filed a lawsuit according to law, stating that the defendant had committed three counts of theft and requesting punishment. In addition, girls Wang Su'e and Sun Zhenmin testified about the circumstances of being stripped of their woolen coats by the defendant. When questioned, Lin Gendi admitted it without denial. Judge Ye verified the confession and sentenced Lin Gendi to eight months of imprisonment as a warning.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Junshan

Now we talk about the results of political evolution.

The result of modern political evolution is to divide today's world into two major factions. How are they divided? According to personal observation, one side is the winning side, and the other side is the losing side—that is to say, one side is the rich and powerful side, and the other side is the poor and weak side. Let's take a look: today's multi-party political countries include the four major powers of Britain, the United States, Japan, and France. Everyone, think about it: haven't they always been rich and powerful? Haven't they been victorious? The other side, such as Russia, Turkey, Germany, and Italy, weren't they countries that failed or lost in the war? Even now, they are still not as rich and powerful as Britain, the United States, Japan, and France. Therefore, we can see that this entire human world has been divided into a huge chasm by struggle—that is, it has formed two factions: the rich and powerful and the poor and weak. In order to fight for their own survival, poor and weak countries cannot but unite to resist foreign oppression. As for the victorious countries, there are three reasons why they have been able to maintain party politics to this day.

The first is economic development. Economic development is naturally the basis for victory, because economic development has ample opportunities, and nothing feels urgent (dangerous, so there are ample opportunities to make military arrangements. Second, they were victorious in the war and had great gains. Third, the domestic parties have a long history. For example, the British Liberal Party and Conservative Party have hundreds of years of history and have a great foundation. The same is true for the American Democratic Party and Republican Party—these two parties have existed as long as the country. France is also in the same situation. Only Japan's political parties have a short history because of the recent Meiji Restoration, so there is often a sign of wavering. Therefore, we can see that the reason why various countries can still maintain the pattern of party politics is that there are other reasons—the main reason is that "the granary is full, the country is powerful, and the people are wealthy," so they can maintain it. But the countries on the other side are just the opposite. We see that Italy, Russia, Turkey, and Germany are all countries that failed or lost in the war, suffering invasion and oppression, and their national economies are also declining, declining to the point where they can hardly sustain themselves. Therefore, there are also three reasons why they have moved from multi-party politics to one-party politics: (To be continued)

### Cao Shuming's Lecture on Soviet National Defense Groups (Continued)

Furthermore, no political party or faction can not only fail to establish itself politically, but also cannot exist or even operate in the Soviet Union. In the past, during the Soviet Union's nation-building process, it experienced several intense civil wars. As a result, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the work of "pacifying the interior" has been successfully completed, and all reactionary forces have been completely eradicated. Because of this, the Soviet Union's politics have a center of gravity, a solid foundation, and can engage in all construction work. This point is really worthy of our special attention.

Third, Diplomacy: Diplomacy is based on domestic policy. In order to promote the development and consolidation of domestic construction, the Soviet Union had to seek peace. Since its founding, the Soviet Union has advocated a peaceful diplomacy. Now, the international situation is increasingly urgent. In a modern, highly scientific environment, any war between Country A and Country B may affect Country C, Country D, and other countries. In order to maintain its own status quo, the Soviet Union must hope for and strive to maintain world peace. The Soviet Union's peaceful diplomacy has further evolved, joining the League of Nations, strengthening the League's strength, and maintaining collective security organizations. At the same time, it has signed a number of non-aggression treaties with major powers, special conventions on the definition of aggression, and mutual assistance agreements. Litvinov once said, "Peace is whole and indivisible." He insisted on the principle of complete disarmament by major powers while striving to maintain a system of collective security. Stalin once said, "The Soviet Union will not take an inch of land, nor will it give up an inch of land." Under the principle of territorial integrity, the Soviet Union adopts a peaceful foreign policy. So far, it is still striving for peace and avoiding war. As long as the Soviet Union's territorial sovereignty is not violated, I dare say that the Soviet Union will not abandon peaceful diplomacy. (To be continued)

### Foreign Firms are Selling Heavily, and the Exchange Market Finally Cannot Withstand It

Yesterday, foreign firms were selling aggressively in the exchange market, and although banks were buying, the market was still loose. Initially, overseas telegrams reported that major London banks were shrinking both in the near and far months by 125. The New York silver market was unchanged. The forward silver price in Montreal generally fell by 2.5 cents. The price of raw gold in London was unchanged. The British pound rose by 2.9 cents against the US dollar, the British pound fell by one cent against the French franc, the British pound was unchanged against the Japanese yen, the US dollar rose by 25 against the British pound, the US dollar rose by 15 against the French franc, and the US dollar rose by 2 cents against the Japanese yen. The Central Bank's quoted price remained the same for both England and the United States. The Customs Gold Unit remained flat. The exchange market opened in the morning, and the recent selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling, 1 penny, and 625. The US dollar was 29.78125 yuan, which was flat for the British pound and slightly loose for the US dollar compared to the previous closing. After opening, foreign firms and Chinese merchants continued to sell. Foreign banks were buying. HSBC's quoted price remained the same for both England and the United States. It was still difficult to boost and turn hard. The silver balance tax shrank by half a cent. After entering the market, Chinese merchants made up their positions, and the Dong exchange rate was slightly softer that day. Until the closing, the recent selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 625 and 65625, and the US dollar was 29.78125 yuan, which was loose by 0.015625 for the British pound and hard by 0.012125 for the US dollar compared to the previous closing. The forward price was the same. Foreign firms' selling appetite was extremely strong, but banks also absorbed vigorously. The transactions for half a day are recorded below.

### Silk and Tea: The Silk Market is Still Brewing

The Indian silk market trade is lively.

Yesterday, overseas silk markets were weak in both Japan and the United States. The near-term price in New York fell by one cent, and the far-term price fell by two cents. Japanese silk 83 and 75 degrees each fell by three cents. Shanghai silk fell by four cents, and Guangdong silk fell by three cents. Lyon remained sluggish, with no price changes. Yokohama's spot price fell by 20 yuan, and the futures price fell by 4 yuan. The Shanghai foreign silk market was also quiet as a result. Foreign firms and manufacturers were hesitant due to the uncertainty of the silk prices in Japan and the United States, and both buyers and sellers felt hesitant. People were watching from the sidelines. The Indian silk market has recently been slightly active. Double palace, Ji Li, and Sichuan silk have been sold daily. Silk users in Hangzhou have not been buying enthusiastically, and there has been no large-scale transaction in this city. The silk market situation seems to be brewing and waiting for a change.

### Raw Silk Exports Increased in the First Half of March

—Market prices also increased accordingly—

Since March, silk prices in both Chinese and foreign silk markets have repeatedly risen, and the market prices in the Japanese and American exchanges have repeatedly reached new highs. As a result, exports from Shanghai have also become more active. Shanghai's raw silk exports in the first half of March were also higher than in the previous period. A total of 872 bales of white Guangdong silk and 153 bales of other silk were exported, totaling 1,025 bales, which was an increase of 445 bales compared to the second half of February. Among them, 262 bales were shipped to Europe, 640 bales were shipped to the United States, and 123 bales were shipped to India and other regions. In the past half month, the price of silk in Yokohama has risen from 860 yuan to 910 yuan, and the near-term price in New York has risen from 1.82 yuan to 2.00 yuan. (The above prices refer to March 1st and March 15th). As of recently, although there have been some ups and downs, as of the day before yesterday (March 13th), the spot price in Yokohama has reached 955 yuan, and the near-term price in New York has reached 2.07 yuan. The average price of Shanghai silk in the first half of March was: 13.15 strips of high-grade white factory silk were 880 yuan, A-grade was 860 yuan, B-grade was 810 yuan, and 83/20.22 strips were 820 yuan. Since the beginning of the second half of the month, the domestic and foreign silk markets have become stronger. The statistics of raw silk exports in this period and the destinations are listed below to observe the situation of overseas Chinese silk in this period. (Unit: bale)

### Piece Goods: Western Suit Linings Sell Quite Well

The trade of wool and woolen fabrics was still prosperous yesterday. Western suit woolen fabrics sold better than ordinary Chinese-style fabrics. Linings for Western suits sold quite well. The selling prices were slightly higher than last week. Japanese and domestic floral fabrics sold well. Domestic Hongsheng brand sold for 63 cents, Japanese number one sold for 65 cents, and number two sold for 55 cents. There are few imports of black charcoal linings from the East and West, because the prices and tariffs are high. Most of the products used in the market are Hongsheng goods, number one sold for 1.6 yuan, and number two sold for 1.25 yuan. Ningbo Jiangshan horse tail lining sold for 23 cents, Western French suit lining sold for 62 cents, Japanese lining sold for 40 cents, and second-grade sold for 37.5 cents.

### Food: Bulls Shift Their Attention to the Far Month Wheat Market, New and Old Stocks Diverge

Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, as the end of this month approached, there was a strong desire to close out long positions, and merchants were also actively hedging and selling in the coming months. Therefore, the near-term price fell slightly by 1 to 2 cents. However, due to weather conditions, hoarding and buying in the far month remained strong, and the price rose by 1 to 2 cents before noon. Later, as the bulls in this month had no intention of receiving the goods and largely hedged in the far month, the near-term and far-term prices diverged in the afternoon. The price in this month fell sharply by 7 cents, and the prices in other months uniformly rose by 2 to 3 cents, forming a situation where the near-term price fell and the far-term price rose. Spot wheat arrived and sold evenly, and the market was stable. A total of 5,000 bags were opened throughout the day, with Jiangbei wheat at 6.27 yuan to 6.3 yuan, Guangshui wheat at 6.09 yuan, Tiantai wheat at 6.2 yuan, and Huangqiao wheat at 6.25 yuan. Fuxin entered 3,000 bags, and Shenda entered 2,000 bags.

### Factory Stocks Recovered at Low Prices, Powder Market Rises Sharply

Yesterday, the powder market opened in the morning with reports of foreign wheat prices. Chicago's near-term price rose by 16 cents, and the far-term price fell by 16 to 28 cents. Canada's price rose by 4 to 10 cents. Liverpool's price was 125. The overseas market atmosphere was still gloomy, and the cold weather was still deep, which would hinder the development of wheat seedlings. Therefore, the desire to buy the far month remained strong. The opening price for July and August was especially good, and the second and third sessions gradually rose, steadily improving. However, as the end of this month approached, off-site bulls realized that the situation was difficult to reverse and there was no room for maneuver. Therefore, they tried their best to release their positions in the morning, and the opening price fell sharply by about 2 cents. After the floating code was exhausted, the price difference between March, April and the rest was too great. The factory took the opportunity to recover their positions, and the price rose sharply in the afternoon. Throughout the day, the volatility in this month was the most violent, with fluctuations of 5 to 6 cents. The price in April also rose slightly in the afternoon, and the price in the far month turned stable. There were small fluctuations in the afternoon.

### The Inventory of Thin Rice is Relatively Abundant

—Guangdong Xiang Rice Arrivals are Also Pouring In—

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various groups were similar to the previous day, with a total of 5000 to 5 (plus additional numbers) 11,100 to 11,200 stones arriving, including more than 20 numbers of thin rice. The weather was gloomy in the morning, and the sellers tried to push up the price, but sales were flat and the purchase enthusiasm was low. Only the Qingdao group purchased more than 1,000 bags, so the market situation was mediocre. Except for the effort to stabilize the price of Ku Geng, the remaining thin rice stocks are abundant, so the sellers inevitably have the intention of loosening their positions, and the market price alone has fallen by several cents. Sheyang Jian and Bian Ai Wu were unchanged.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 10 ships arrived from various roads in Hexia. The sales of various goods in the market were normal due to the sudden cloudy and rainy weather. The market price of high-quality white Geng was firm, and the price of medium-grade was slightly tight. The price of early thin rice was still soft, and the prices of Baiyuan and other goods did not fluctuate much.

(Guangdong Xiang Rice) Yesterday was even more silent. It was heard that the Guangdong gang had access to foreign rice and was waiting and watching without taking action. Other gangs also had no smooth sales. Although the Beiyang gang purchased 200 bags of Jihong and the Quanzhou Xiamen gang purchased 156 bags of Jihong yesterday, the turnover in this street was less than 1,000 bags. But new loads kept arriving, with 3,000 to 5,000 to about 10,000 bags arriving every day. With the arrival of more goods and slow sales, the market is ultimately unable to increase prices, and the market price is declining again, down nearly 10 cents. Since the stagnation of Guangdong, the price of each rice has decreased by about 34 cents.

### Soybean Cake Prices Unanimously Decline Slightly

The market for standard soybean cakes has been sluggish in terms of actual sales for several consecutive days, leading to market fluctuations. Manufacturers are holding firm, while customers and speculators are taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in a stagnant market situation. Although spot soybeans showed some signs of activity yesterday, supply remains plentiful, and Dalian reported lower prices. Therefore, the closing price for standard soybeans saw a slight decrease of two to three cents. The price of standard soybean oil initially improved in the morning but stabilized in the afternoon due to selling pressure. Forward contracts were being offloaded by trading firms and manufacturers, and with Dalian reporting lower prices, the price immediately fell by two dimes. The digestion of soybean cakes has not yet gained momentum. Due to unfavorable weather yesterday, many longs sought to exit, causing prices to decline by one or two cents.

### Soybean Prices Not Likely to Rise Soon

The soybean market experienced a brief surge in prices a few days ago. However, as of yesterday, it was once again overshadowed by negative sentiment from various sources, causing the upward momentum to falter. Yesterday's rain and news of lower prices from Dalian further dampened market confidence. However, those holding inventory, mindful of high costs and the difficulty of seeing lower prices in the producing regions, are mostly sticking to a strategy of holding onto their goods for sale. Therefore, the overall market remains one of resistance. There were no significant price fluctuations yesterday, and the volume of transactions decreased. The transactions included one truckload of Bengbu soybeans, over four hundred packages of Dangshan soybeans, one truckload of Yingzhou soybeans, over a thousand packages of Hankou Za soybeans, and two hundred and fifty packages of Du soybeans and yellow soybeans.

### Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Factories Report Further Price Reductions of Thirty Cents

The sugar market trend was flat and weak yesterday. The Public Association's pricing for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar and transshipped goods remained unchanged. The market for Dongbai No. 489 was relatively soft. The original prices were quoted for the local factories’ cotton white sugar such as Zhenji, Jinxin, and Dahua. For the No. goods, only Jianbang continued to open with thirty cases of Quanzhou Qing slices, priced at eleven dollars and sixty cents, unchanged. According to telegrams from Shantou, the producing region of domestic Chaoqing sugar, prices had decreased by another thirty cents. For example, the price for Tiqing sugar was thirteen dollars and forty cents, Huanggang Qing thirteen dollars, and Longgang Qing twelve dollars. However, cotton red sugar was relatively firm, requiring fourteen and a half dollars for genuine brands. The joint venture company sold a batch of Guangdong sugar through bidding yesterday, with the transaction including 100 bags of Shunde Factory's Five Rams brand white sugar at twelve dollars and sixty-five cents, and 470 bags from Dongguan at twenty-two dollars and sixty cents, and 500 bags of No. 22 second-grade coarse white sugar at twenty-one dollars and fifty cents.

### Dried Goods: Shima Longan Pulp Production Prices Ease

The price of sun-dried longan pulp from Shima rose by one dollar during the spring season this year. However, due to exceptionally slow sales in various regions recently, the production prices in Shima have declined despite the upward trend of Guangdong longan meat. According to correspondence from Zhangzhou, the quoted prices have eased by two dollars compared to previous levels. Local traders eager to sell their stock are also easing prices accordingly.

Random Thoughts

### Poisoning from Eating Puffer Fish

— East

Wu Yucheng, a leather worker, lived with A Fu, A Si, and three other people. Yesterday morning, A Fu brought back a package of puffer fish roe, cooked it immediately, and invited Wu Yucheng and the others to eat it. Wu Yucheng, fearing death, did not eat it. Only A Fu and one unknown person ate it together, drinking sorghum liquor and praising its delicious taste. Unexpectedly, within half an hour of eating, they felt dizzy and their hands and feet became numb. Wu Yucheng knew they had been poisoned and immediately hired two cars to take them to Renji Hospital for treatment. After treatment, A Fu, due to consuming too much, succumbed to the poison and died around 5 o'clock. The other person who ate with him is also said to be in critical condition.

Stories of people dying from eating puffer fish are frequently seen in the newspapers. We have a saying, "Risking death to eat puffer fish." Since it's "risking death" to "eat puffer fish," people don't pay much attention to the poisoning incidents. However, it is said that puffer fish tastes extremely delicious. For the sake of "deliciousness," even if it means "risking death," although it's not worth dying for, there are still people who eat it. The above news is an example.

A few days ago, while having dinner with friends at a restaurant, I saw a glass frame hanging on the wall that boldly stated, "This restaurant specially invites famous chefs to prepare delicious puffer fish." According to the waiter, many people come to the restaurant to eat puffer fish, and no one has ever been poisoned. He even explained in detail the points to pay special attention to when cooking puffer fish. However, like the leather worker Wu Yucheng, we didn't dare to "risk death" for "deliciousness" and only smiled and asked about the price, which was answered as "one dollar and eighty cents per pot."

This price may be unbelievable to A Fu and the unknown two ghosts. I have flipped through many old newspapers, and the reports of poisoning from eating puffer fish all involve people who obtained puffer fish from fish stalls or purchased them cheaply and brought them home. In mid-August of last year, there was even news of a dead ghost picking up a package of puffer fish roe from the beach: as with the item above, it only said that "A Fu brought back a package of puffer fish roe," which was probably of "unknown origin"? I just can't understand the psychology of the people in Shanghai. Some are tired of eating delicacies and specially run to vegetarian restaurants to eat a vegetarian meal, while people like A Fu and A Si insist on tasting the flavor of fish. If they can't afford live fish, dead fish will do. If they can't afford crucian carp or carp, even puffer fish will do, or even puffer fish roe. And they clearly know that there is a risk of poisoning from eating puffer fish, because they don't know the cooking method for puffer fish that costs "one dollar and eighty cents per pot." The "heroic words" of "risking death to eat puffer fish" only show its superficiality.

However, having the courage to "risk death to eat puffer fish" is good. Now is the time for us to "risk death to eat puffer fish"!

### From Sailor to Financier (Part 1)

— By Keith Williams, translated specifically from English.

To earn enough money to free yourself and your family from base concerns, to free your mind to work on more worthwhile endeavors, and to enable your position to help others, is everyone's responsibility.

Please remember that these are the words of a man who made a fortune five times and lost it completely four times. In my mind, going from rich to poor is very common, and no more unusual than going from poor to rich. Sometimes my situation was worse than being empty-handed. Not long ago, I owed £100,000 one day, and the next day, after paying off the debt, I had £100,000 left over. Let me tell you how this happened.

I sometimes stayed in a hotel in London, from whose window I could see the benches on the Thames Embankment. During two of my bankruptcies, I slept on those benches for two nights. That was not my darkest period, because I was illuminated by the light of the future, and I could find a way out. Nor was it a time of idleness. I want you to know now that it was a very active period. I established the foundation of my happiness during these two periods, the first time in 1918 and the second time in 1932.

In my past forty-two years, I have slept in worse places than the benches on the Thames Embankment, and in more comfortable places than large hotels. I left my hometown of Wales at the age of fifteen. I worked with my hands and mind to make a living. I worked as a sailor in various oceans, as a groom on a ranch in Texas, USA, and as a salesman, clerk, cafe owner, bank clerk, and later became a financier, and did many other businesses.

My difficulties were not all economic. Let me start my record of seeking wealth with the love affair I encountered for the first time, because that incident was indeed the starting point of my life's work. I met a woman during the European War, and we fell in love and became confidantes. Later, I was transferred to India. When we parted, we made vows of eternal love and unchanging hearts. In my dreams, I often saw her beautiful figure. I wrote her letters almost every day and sometimes sent telegrams to comfort her.

Before the war ended, I returned to her village in her hometown. My legs were now one high and one low, I was missing a shoulder blade, and my right arm had a bayonet wound. I asked her when we could get married. Unexpectedly, her reply was, "Never marry you!"

At that time, I felt like I had fallen into an abyss and was extremely discouraged. So I withdrew all the hundreds of pounds I had saved from the bank and spent it recklessly, until it was all gone. One night, with no money in my pocket, I sat on a bench on the Thames Embankment, silently thinking. This was not a big deal. I had been penniless in South America and Africa, I had been stranded on the beach of Argentina, and I had spent the night in a slum.

Suddenly someone gently patted my shoulder. I turned around and saw a middle-aged man in a dinner suit.

"Come have a cup of coffee with me," he said kindly.

"I don't want your coffee!" I turned away and replied.

"Do you have money to buy it yourself?" he pressed.

"No, I don't have a penny on me."

"Why are you upset, liquor? Or women?"

"Not liquor."

He closed his mouth and remained silent for a while, and then used a new strategy to move my heart.

"Look!" he said, "I don't want to patronize you. I would like you to make more friends. I have been in the exact same situation as you before. I eventually found a way out. Friend! Would you like to have something to eat with me?"

Hearing this, I couldn't help but stand up, and silently, lazily followed him. He called a streetcar, and the two of us got off in front of a building on Wang Street and went inside. It was already late. The table was set with utensils for two people's dinner. I thought that if he hadn't met me, someone else would have come to dine with him. While waiting for the food to be served, we sat in armchairs by the fireplace. He took a large, double-folded white piece of paper from the drawer and handed it to me.

"Would you like to write down on it the happiness you imagined you would have if you married that woman?" he asked respectfully.

I took the paper and hesitated for a while. I was very reluctant to write an answer. Then I thought again, if I refused him, it would seem rude, so I began to write.

I first wrote the word "happiness." I wanted to write more, so I continued with "family," "love," "joy," "children," and so on. In the blink of an eye, I had filled a sheet of paper.

Now he said, "Would you like to write down all the bad things, all the unhappy things, that you imagined you would have?"

I couldn't think of a single one.

He nodded and said, "I thought so too." At this point, the dishes were served.

### Sai Jinhua (8)

— By Chen He

Sai Jinhua could not establish herself in Shanghai and soon returned to the north. However, she feared that the family of Sai's former husband, Hong, would interfere. But in fact, she had to return to the north! Therefore, after much thought, she disregarded flattery and currying favor and associated with local dignitaries and celebrities. Fortunately, it went smoothly, and she was able to gain a temporary foothold. This was truly not an easy task!

### Moving

— Lin Fei

I have been living in this noisy city for, I would say, three years. Three years is not a short time!

Every day, I take the bus to the office, and in the evening I take the bus back to my residence.

These things have never given me any feeling. Like a weak cow, I must work for my master, despicably tired of this cruel life.

Often, because of some minor trivialities, I begin to feel the sorrow of a wanderer, without light, without warmth, without sympathy or comfort. I am abandoned in this unfamiliar crowd, and I silently swallow every bitter tear.

Gradually, I became familiar with the personalities of these people. I learned what price to pay to gain people's affection.

However, I cannot do this, I cannot satisfy people's needs of me. So, I became depressed, and I imagined that I should have a home—a quiet home for a lonely person.

This thought lingered in my mind for about three weeks. Finally, on a drizzly evening, I moved.

This is a house near the wilderness. The landlord is a kind Russian lady. From her gray temples and the wrinkles on her forehead, I can see that she is at least fifty years old. But she does not appear to be old. She helps me sort out the clutter nimbly.

In the room, there is a small wooden bed, a dark and dilapidated sofa, and a table with only three legs left—because it leans against the bed, so it does not collapse. However, these are enough for me to use. I look at each piece of furniture with greedy eyes and joy.

In the middle of the room, there is a five-light electric lamp hanging. Due to the lack of light, the room looks even dimmer. Gloomily, it feels like stepping into an ancient monastery.

I lit my pipe and leaned back on the sofa. The old landlady, seemingly unwilling to be lonely, stood in the middle of the room, talking about her own story.

But this did not arouse my interest. I just responded unconsciously.

I took a deep drag on my cigarette, and my throat felt unusually dry. I wanted to drink a cup of tea, but in the deep night, I could not get any water.

I coughed, and the excessive exhaustion made me want to rest immediately. So, I explained to my landlady that I had to sleep, and she left the room with a helpless expression.

I stood up from the sofa and walked lazily to the bed.

I began to stretch out comfortably, imagining some beautiful dreams.

Outside the window, the clear sound of rain dripped, and the gentle breeze leaked in through every crack in the wall, wonderfully, I had a warm feeling.

Like Napoleon imprisoned on a deserted island, I loved this house intensely.

Finally, I settled down in this peculiar way.
