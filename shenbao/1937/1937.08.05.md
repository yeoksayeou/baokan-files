⊙Guilin Bai Chongxi left the Governor's Office at 9:00 AM on the 4th by car and went to the Ertang Airfield to fly to Nanjing. Li Zongren personally saw him off.

At the airfield, Bai told reporters that the national crisis is so severe that the whole country should launch a nationwide resistance war under the guidance of Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang's recent talks and four demands are the minimum requirements for the survival of our entire nation. This trip of mine will bring the loyalty of the people of Guangxi Province to the Central Government in resisting the enemy. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

### Frontline is Quiet and Uneventful

Our army still holds the original positions. Traffic between Beiping and Tianjin has been restored. Qin Dechun and others arrive in Nanjing to report.

[Baoding] The frontline is quiet today. Our army on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines still holds the original defense positions without moving. Enemy planes come to scout from time to time, flying very high and not dropping bombs. (Special dispatch from the 4th)

[Tianjin] This place is relatively calm. Traffic between Beiping and Tianjin, which was suspended for a week after the incident, has resumed this morning. The train departed from Tianjin Station at 8:00 AM, mostly with foreign passengers. The Tianjin Dagongbao newspaper has suspended publication from today. The English evening newspaper, which was founded just a few months ago, has also voluntarily suspended publication. (Special dispatch from the 4th)

[Baoding] Civil Army Commander Sun Dianying came to Baoding on the morning of the 4th to visit various authorities and make reports, and returned to his defense area that evening. Also, Shi Yousan has left Baoding and is still going to the front. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

[Jinan] The plane arrived in Dezhou at 9:00 AM this morning and the scout returned north immediately. The Japanese troops who arrived in Yangliuqing yesterday are restoring traffic, totaling more than 200 people in twelve armored vehicles. They did not go today. (Special dispatch from the 4th)

[Baoding] Japanese planes came to Baoding again at around 10:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, circling for about ten minutes before flying away. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

[Nanjing] Song Zheyuan sent Qin Dechun and Shi Jingting to Nanjing to report to the Central Government on the progress of the war in Beiping and Tianjin and to request instructions. Qin and others arrived in Nanjing at noon on the 4th and are scheduled to return north on the 5th. A reporter visited Qin and, according to his account, the battle in Beiping and Tianjin was unprecedentedly fierce. The 37th Division had conflicts every day since the night of July 7th. The Liu Zhensan Brigade of the 38th Division clashed with the Japanese army in Langfang on the evening of the 26th, repeatedly gaining and losing ground, and fought fiercely for three days and nights. On the 27th, our 132nd Division was advancing in Hejian Renqiu. A unit encountered the enemy in Tuanhe. The enemy bombarded and attacked with aircraft, artillery, and tanks, which was extremely fierce. Our army calmly responded, advancing without retreating, and therefore suffered heavy losses in this battle. On the 28th, there were battles in the suburbs of Beiping. The areas of Nanyuan, Xiyuan, Beiyuan, and Huangsi were all bombarded by heavy artillery and aircraft. In total, the war lasted more than twenty days, resulting in the deaths of one deputy army commander, Tong Linge, and one division commander, Zhao Dengyu, with a total of more than 5,000 officers and soldiers killed or wounded. The enemy also suffered heavy casualties. The reason for the losses in this war was that the defense line was too long and concentration was not completed. In addition, the enemy used a large number of aircraft, artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles to fight us in close combat, and our reinforcements could not arrive in time due to transportation issues, which led to Nanyuan being broken by the enemy. In the battle of Tianjin, the bloody battle lasted two days and nights, which was especially heroic, but the success fell short, which is regrettable. Generals Sun Dianying and Shi Yousan fought bravely against the enemy and have completed their deployments according to the predetermined locations. Our Chinese nation seeks to establish a foothold in today's world and only seeks a way out in resisting foreign aggression and war. This issue is a major national plan and should be quietly listened to by the government. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)

### Chairman Wang's Speech

“Everyone must speak the truth, and everyone must take responsibility”

[Nanjing] Chairman Wang delivered a speech on the evening of the 4th at 8:00 PM on the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "Everyone must speak the truth, and everyone must take responsibility." The original text is as follows:

Fellow compatriots, at this critical juncture of survival, what I want to say are just a few words: everyone must speak the truth, and everyone must take responsibility. Speaking of responsibility, it is something that everyone has. Those serving in government agencies each have their own responsibilities, and those serving in social organizations also each have their own responsibilities. From the government's perspective, how were things handled in the past, how are they being handled now, and how should they be handled in the future? This is certainly a great responsibility. From society's perspective, the blood and sweat provided by the people over the past few years have really been considerable. Besides the legal contributions to the country, there have also been many obligatory donations, even entertainment taxes. It can be said that they have fulfilled their responsibilities. However, compared to Japan's "forceful addition of a budget for the so-called 'North China Incident expenses'," which amounts to 400 million yen with a single stroke of the pen, what is the difference? There are two of the most heartbreaking sentences in Chinese history: one is Zheng Guo's saying that he falsely prolonged the life of Han for several years, but his success ultimately benefited Qin for generations to come. Clearly knowing that he could not save Han from its demise, he merely wanted to prolong its life for a few more years. Such a method of using ginseng soup to prolong the final gasps is ultimately not a solution. The other is Zhang Ti's saying that when Wu was about to fall, not a single person died for the cause; is this not a disgrace? Clearly knowing that he could not save Wu from its demise, he only wanted to die to fulfill his heart's desire. However, thinking that after his death, those who did not die would become slaves, how could he rest in peace? This is ultimately not a solution either. So, we must discuss how everyone can take responsibility. In my humble opinion, if everyone wants to take responsibility, then they must first speak the truth. Speaking the truth means that the heart and mouth are one; what one thinks in their heart is what one says with their mouth. This is very important. China twice fell as a nation at the end of the Song and Ming dynasties. The biggest and oldest reason for the fall of those nations was the failure to speak the truth. What they thought in their hearts was not what they said with their mouths. The best method was to not take responsibility oneself, but to watch how others would take responsibility. When it was time for peace, they desperately criticized peace; when it was time for war, they desperately criticized war, because peace would lead to losses, and war would lead to defeat. The best method was still to place oneself in a position of innocence. In any case, it was others who should die. Thus, Xiong Tingbi's head was displayed in the Nine Border Regions, and Yuan Chonghuan was executed by slow slicing in the marketplace. The tragedy of this lies not in the loss of their lives, but in the fact that all their methods, in this atmosphere where everyone did not speak the truth and did not take responsibility, only resulted in hitting walls everywhere. Besides using death to atone for their responsibilities, it was simply impossible to think of a way out for them. Nearly a hundred years have passed since the fall of the Song, and nearly three hundred years have passed since the fall of the Ming. Such a long period of national humiliation has been enough to endure. Since the 19th century, the loss of a nation has not only been through military force; all aspects of economy and culture can become tools for the loss of a nation. Therefore, once a country falls, there is absolutely no chance of recovery. Apart from Poland, which was restored due to special circumstances, there is no other example that can be cited. During the Great War, Russia was defeated by Germany and nearly fell, and Germany and Turkey were defeated by the Allied Powers and nearly fell. However, they were able to preserve themselves and are now able to revive themselves. This is all because, at the point of near demise, everyone made a firm resolution to save the nation and strive for survival, and everyone was willing to speak the truth. Peace would lead to losses, so honestly admit the losses and seek ways to compensate after the losses. War would lead to defeat, so honestly admit defeat, and fight again after defeat, and keep fighting even after repeated defeats, until a situation of survival after demise is achieved. There is no other clever trick to this; it is simply speaking the truth. This speaking the truth is not something trivial. Everyone can speak the truth, and then everyone can take responsibility. Conversely, if everyone does not speak the truth, then everyone will certainly not take responsibility. The result of everyone not taking responsibility is, apart from the loss of the nation, what other path is there? We know that there are now wars between strong countries and weak countries, and wars between weak countries and strong countries. In wars between strong countries and weak countries, the strong countries utilize their abundant strength and swift movements, aiming to annihilate the weak in one fell swoop, leaving them with no ability to fight back. In wars between weak countries and strong countries, the weak countries know that their strength is insufficient, but they have already made a firm resolution to fully utilize all the mental and material resources they can use, without leaving a single drop. Then, while their own strength is exhausted, the strength of the strong country is also consumed. Thus, the strong country cannot help but have concerns. We must know that the strong country's attitude towards the weak country is like that of a glutton, insatiable. If they taste sweetness, then naturally they will eat more and more sweetly, and there is no reason for them to stop eating, unless they taste bitterness. Only then will they suppress their desire to eat. Therefore, if we can fully utilize all the mental and material resources we can use, without leaving a single drop, then at the very least, we can make them taste some bitterness. There is another level we must also understand: modern warfare is not only a tangible war, but also an intangible war. A strong country, even if it does not confront other strong countries with military force on a daily basis, if its ambitions are great, it will inevitably create many enemies. Its military force already suffers from the pain of being prepared in many places, let alone the fact that in addition to military force, there are economic wars, commercial wars, industrial wars, etc. These intangible wars are fought with lives at stake at every moment, with not the slightest bit of compromise. Therefore, when a strong country engages in a tangible war with a weak country, consuming its military force and even its financial resources, it is no different from creating a flaw for other strong countries to exploit. What begins as a certain amount of consumption ultimately becomes a fatal wound. No matter how strong a strong country is, it cannot be without concerns about this point. Understanding the above significance, we can see that when a weak country is forced to fight a strong country, the inevitable sacrifices are absolutely unavoidable. And these inevitable sacrifices are definitely not buried in vain, without any effect. Conversely, refusing to sacrifice, or sacrificing without inevitability, then the strong country will not only swallow easily, but also digest easily. This will truly make it eat more and more, not only will it not develop flaws due to consumption, but it will also use this weak country as a resource to swallow other strong countries. Some people say, "Although we are a weak country, we must not overestimate our strength too much, nor underestimate it too much. Overestimating it will lead to recklessness, and underestimating it will lead to depression." These words are indeed words of wisdom. However, the word "estimate" is not easy to achieve. For example, at the beginning of the European War, Germany originally wanted to concentrate its forces within the shortest possible time, defeat the French army, and directly enter Paris. At that time, Germany estimated that its own military strength would definitely be able to do so. However, later, encountering the resistance of Liège in Belgium and the established line of the Marne River in France, the original plan could not be achieved. This was because Germany overestimated its own strength and underestimated France's strength, leading to this. German military science is world-renowned, yet it still inevitably made errors in estimation. Also, in the recent Italian attack on Abyssinia, military observers from various countries all believed that Abyssinia was mostly a barren desert, and there was also a rainy season. When the rainy season arrived, the Italian army would definitely not be able to advance. However, later, Italy's advance was rapid, and Abyssinia was completely defeated, not even waiting for the rainy season. The estimates of general military observers were completely wrong. From this, it can be seen that the word "estimate" is not easy to achieve. Generally speaking, when a strong country uses force against a weak country, it will definitely want to use the power of thunder to crush it in one blow. At this moment, the only thing this weak country can do is to brace itself and try its best to struggle. The longer it struggles, the more hope there is for survival. Apart from this, there is really no way to survive. Someone also said, "Although we are a weak country, we are peace-loving. If we are invaded, we will definitely receive the assistance of those who respect peace." These words are indeed words of wisdom as well. However, while we are indeed peace-loving, the existence of peace does not depend on the desire to love peace, but on the power to maintain peace. To speak of loving peace without the power to maintain peace is not loving peace, but rather despising peace. There are indeed countries in the world that respect peace, but only knowing how to respect peace without knowing how to bring out power is better called a mocker of peace than a respecter of peace. However, bringing out power is not easy. First, we must first bring out our own power. Second, the so-called "drawing a sword to help when injustice is seen on the road" is indeed a morality that humans should have. However, in the current situation of numerous countries and nations in the world, which country or nation does not draw its sword for the survival of its own country or nation? Which country or nation is willing to draw its sword for the survival of another country or nation, unless there is a common interest? Even if there is a common interest, there is still much room for pondering over the relative importance and urgency, after looking around with a raised sword. From this, it can be seen that when a weak country is invaded, it relies entirely on its own efforts to struggle. The longer it struggles, the more hope there is for survival. Apart from this, there is really no way to survive. Then someone said, "In that case, is it not difficult to fight the strong with the weak?" Napoleon said that there are no difficult words in the dictionary. We say that there are no easy words in the dictionary. Because knowing that it is difficult and saying that it is easy is bound to lead to casual talk and casual actions. Speaking is not truthful and acting is not responsible. Conversely, knowing that it is difficult and saying that it is difficult, knowing that it is difficult and still facing the difficulty, then that is speaking truthfully and acting responsibly. This determination and courage will naturally increase tenfold. Even if the difficulty is ten times greater than this, it can still be overcome. Let us all speak the truth, and let us all take responsibility. We do not conceal, we do not shirk, and we do not make grand pronouncements to incite unnecessary impulses, because this kind of impulse is prone to depression. We do not indulge in extravagant hopes to incite idle hopes, because these hopes are prone to disillusionment. In summary, we maintain the attitude of a weak country, and we hold firm to the determination to die. Unless the strong country puts down its butcher knife and becomes a Buddha on the spot, otherwise, the unanimous cry of the entire nation will be, as stated in the Oath of Tang, "When will this sun perish? I will perish with you!" (Central News Agency, 4th)

### Song Zheyuan's Telegram Entrusts Feng Zhi'an to Act as Military Agent

[Baoding] Song Zheyuan telegraphed on the 3rd: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Chairman Zeng of the Military Affairs Commission, Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan, all Yuan Presidents, all ministries, committees, provincial and municipal governments, all Commanders-in-Chief, all Pacification Commissioners, all Commanders, all Army Commanders, all Division and Brigade Commanders, all Commanders are aware, all organizations and newspapers are aware. Since Zheyuan was ordered to preside over the military and political affairs of Hebei and Chahar, I have always felt the responsibility was great, working diligently day and night, originally hoping to consolidate sovereignty for North China and protect the construction of the Central Government. Therefore, I have spared no effort in maintaining Tianjin and Beijing. Unfortunately, our military preparations were incomplete, and the concentration of troops was not completed, and the Japanese had already preemptively attacked us. Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred on July 7, our 37th Division fought the Japanese for more than 20 days from Lugouqiao to the Babaoshan area. Our regimental commander, Ji Xingwen, was injured but did not retreat, and our soldiers suffered more than a thousand casualties. On the 26th, the Langfang Incident broke out again. Our 38th Division's Liu Zhenshan Brigade was stationed in the area and fought the enemy, advancing and retreating several times. Officers and soldiers suffered approximately 500 casualties. On the same day, the enemy again attacked our Guang'anmen, which was repelled by our guarding soldiers. On the 27th, our Tongzhou Anti-Rebellion River garrison was also under enemy pressure, suffering heavy casualties. On the 28th, the enemy used a large number of airplanes, tanks, and various mechanized units to attack our Nanyuan, Beiyuan, Huangsi, and Shahe. Nanyuan was the location of our military headquarters and its various units and the 3rd Regiment of the 38th Division, jointly commanded by Deputy Commander Tong Linge and Division Commander Zhao Dengyu, fighting fiercely with the enemy all day. In this battle, our officers and soldiers suffered more than 2,000 casualties. Deputy Commander Tong Linge and Division Commander Zhao Dengyu both died for their country. The garrisons in the Beiyuan and Huangsi areas were the troops of Shi Yousan and Ruan Xuanwu, suffering more than a thousand casualties. On the 29th, the enemy attacked Tianjin, and our 38th Division troops stationed in Tianjin fought the enemy for two days, suffering more than a thousand casualties. In summary, our officers and soldiers suffered approximately 5,000 casualties in various battles, and the losses of other military supplies are incalculable. The above is a brief overview of the current operations of our army, which is indeed a long-planned plan of the enemy, and also a result of Zheyuan's improper handling. I should be severely punished by the state. The military affairs of the 29th Army have now been entrusted to Division Commander Feng Zhi'an as an agent, and I have been approved by the Central Government. Zheyuan has been feeling unwell since the recent events and intends to take a leave of absence for recuperation to serve the country again. Fearing that the country does not understand the truth, I hereby report sincerely, hoping for a clear understanding. Song Zheyuan kowtows." (Central News Agency, 4th)

### The Typhoon Passed Through the Capital and Entered Anhui

[Nanjing] Due to the passage of a typhoon through the capital city on the 4th at noon, there was a violent wind and rain, the magnitude of which has not been seen in recent years.

### The Atmosphere of Anglo-Italian Friendship is Becoming Increasingly Thick

England and France Still Maintain Friendly Relations; The British Government's Policy is Pragmatic

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in the House of Commons a few days ago, advocating the improvement of relations between Britain and Italy. Yesterday, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano issued a statement to an American newspaper reporter in response, expressing his support for improving relations between Britain and Italy. Responsible figures here were quite pleased to learn of Ciano's statement, but believe that the mutual coordination hoped for by Britain and Italy should not cause any change in the friendship between Britain and France, because British-French friendship is the cornerstone of British policy. Moreover, for the sake of maintaining European peace, mutual coordination between Britain and France is indispensable, and there has never been a time like today. (Havas News Agency, 4th)

[London] Regarding the true significance of the exchange of messages between the British and Italian Prime Ministers, well-informed British sources recently commented that Britain's purpose is to ease the tense situation in Europe, and not to create new friendships that would harm Britain's inherent friendships. Italian sources said that, according to reliable sources, the Italian government's purpose is to extend the understanding reached by Britain and France to Italy, and there is no intention of alienating Britain and France. In addition, American political figures also explained the attitude adopted by Britain, saying: (1) The Four-Power Pact (signed by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy on July 15, 1933) is clearly opposed by most European countries. Britain does not want to revive it, but only to urge the four countries (also the signatories of the Locarno Treaty) to conduct talks on the future treaty of Western Europe. (2) Regarding the recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, Britain does not want to use it as a bargaining chip, but only wants to adopt a pragmatic policy, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the position of the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)

[Rome] Regarding the content of the exchange of letters between the British and Italian Prime Ministers, Italian responsible figures refused to express anything. Newspapers only use news from reporters stationed in the capitals of France, Germany, and Britain as commentary material, and point out that major European countries are interested in this matter, but no clear news is published that is sufficient to supplement it. The general Italian public believes that this exchange of letters is not so much a prelude to negotiations between Britain and Italy, as it is a kind of expression, with the purpose of promoting friendly relations between the two countries. In the eyes of observers, although the wording of the letters between the British and Italian Prime Ministers is extremely humble, it is quite empty, and it is advocated that the two countries have the need to restore traditional friendship, but it is not stated on what basis this should be done. It is generally believed that when Chamberlain and Grandi talk, the issue of British recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia will definitely be discussed, and if Britain and Italy conduct negotiations in the future, they must use this issue as a starting point in order to have a hope of success. (Central News Agency, 3rd)

[London] The exchange of friendly letters between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has aroused hopes in London that this move may create a new atmosphere in Anglo-Italian relations. However, Reuters has learned that neither side has made any promises nor discussed any details. The various plans reported in the press are purely speculative and have no factual basis. When British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke in the House of Commons on July 30 regarding the Mediterranean situation, Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi first consulted with Eden and then visited British Prime Minister Chamberlain, conveying a friendly message from the Italian Prime Minister. Chamberlain then replied with a personal friendly letter, and soon Mussolini also responded with a letter. Both letters were expressed in ordinary friendly terms and had no direct relationship to the Spanish Civil War, the Locarno Treaty, Abyssinia, or other specific issues. However, it is generally believed that the exchange of private letters between the Prime Ministers of Britain and Italy can dispel mutual doubts, and the British and Italian governments have the same views on the Mediterranean situation explained by British Foreign Secretary Eden. This point may also be seen in the exchange of two letters between the Prime Ministers of the two countries. According to reports, Eden said a few days ago that Britain is determined to protect its own interests in the Mediterranean, but has no intention of provoking the interests of any other country. Therefore, it is hoped that any issues can be resolved through frank discussions in Rome and London. British political circles generally feel that there is now a considerable opportunity to achieve something on the basis of the existing close friendship between Britain and France. If this is then transferred to the improvement of relations between Britain and Italy, the general tense atmosphere in Europe can be expected to ease. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)

### The 1938 British Shipbuilding Plan

Adding More Than Ninety Ships of Various Sizes; Naval Aircraft to Increase to 550

[London] The naval reporter for the "Daily Telegraph" stated that the British Navy's shipbuilding plan for 1938 is roughly the same as in 1937. Well-informed sources expect that one to five battleships, six or seven cruisers, and a considerable number of destroyers, submarines, and other small boats will be built. The number of naval aircraft stationed on aircraft carriers will increase from 230 to 550 in the next four years. The reporter estimated that the number of warships currently being built by Britain this year will reach 664,000 tons, which is a new record in peacetime. The new warships include five 35,000-ton battleships, five 22,000-ton or 23,000-ton aircraft carriers, eight 9,000-ton to 10,000-ton cruisers, five 8,000-ton cruisers, five 5,300-ton cruisers, sixteen 1,850-ton super destroyers, twenty-four 1,650-ton large destroyers, eighteen 540-ton to 1,520-ton submarines, and twelve speedboats.

### The Stalemate of Non-Intervention is Expected to Be Broken

The Soviet Union's Attitude is Becoming More Moderate

[London] Reuters diplomatic reporter has learned that the Soviet government is now willing to reconsider its attitude that it will not grant the belligerent rights to Spanish Nationalist leader General Franco unless all volunteers, including the Moorish troops in Spain, are withdrawn. It is widely believed that this move may break the stalemate of non-intervention and achieve a resolution. The Soviet Union's decision is based on the announcement by Germany and Poland that they agree in principle to withdraw volunteers, conditioned on the withdrawal of a number sufficient to satisfy the Non-Intervention Committee. The Chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, Lord Plymouth, is currently consulting with representatives of major powers on the date of the next meeting of the committee. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)

### The Vatican Denies Recognition of the Spanish Rebels

⊙Vatican City: It is rumored that the Vatican has already recognized the Spanish Nationalist government, and the Nationalist government has dispatched Marquis de Essina to be its representative to the Vatican. Responsible figures here must deny this, saying that there has been no change in the relationship between the Vatican and the Nationalist government. The former unofficial representative of the Nationalist government to the Vatican, Anjias, has recently been transferred to the post of Ambassador to Germany. The vacancy has been filled by the former Spanish Ambassador to the Vatican, Essina. As for the Pope's unofficial representative to the Nationalist government, the Archbishop of Toledo, Edomes, continues to serve. In addition, Pope’s former representative to Albania, Anderinuitti, went to the port of Bilbao in Spain after it was occupied by the Nationalist forces to protect the interests of the Basque autonomous region and its archbishop, but he did not have diplomatic status, and he was not stationed in the Nationalist government. His role was only as a representative of the church. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas)

### Intention to Build a Highway in Abyssinia

Highway from Addis Ababa to the Red Sea Coast Officially Opens

[Rome] The Italian government has recently constructed a wide highway in Abyssinia, stretching 1,200 kilometers from Addis Ababa to Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea, and the port of Massawa. The highway was originally completed in June of this year, but due to the onset of the rainy season, the authorities took the opportunity to test the road's durability during the heavy rains. After considerable improvements, the official opening ceremony was finally held on the first of this month. On that day, two fleets of cargo trucks departed simultaneously from Addis Ababa and Asmara. In addition, a route from Asmara to Gondar in northern Abyssinia, passing through the Lasta region of the Tafari River, has also recently opened to traffic. More than sixty cargo trucks travel back and forth daily, making for a thriving business. (Central News Agency, Havas, 3rd)

### Jewish Congress

Opens in Switzerland

⊙Zurich, Switzerland The 20th Zionist Congress opened here last night, with over 600 representatives from various locations. The congress immediately discussed the Palestine issue and the report submitted by the British Royal Commission. Congress Chairman Weizmann also read a letter from British Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, stating, "We will study the results of your deliberations with the utmost attention, and we hope that your congress will create peace, prosperity, and a sound administrative system for Palestine." Weizmann then provided an account of the various events that had occurred in Palestine last year, saying, "Many Jewish residents died in the disturbances, but we remained calm and maintained our daily lives. The report submitted by the Royal Commission, while being the most valuable document on Zionism, unfortunately contains fundamental errors, namely, the so-called current mandate system cannot be continued. The Royal Commission's conclusion was likely influenced by the turbulent atmosphere at the time. In reality, the mandate system can still be implemented, and there should be no restrictions on the immigration of Jews to Palestine." (Central News Agency, Havas, 3rd)

### President Roosevelt Expresses No Intention to Stabilize Currency Value

International Situation Changes Rapidly; Adjusting the Monetary System Is Not Appropriate; Leith-Ross to Visit the United States

[Washington] President Roosevelt wrote to Senator Thomas, expressing "complete sympathy with Thomas's proposal to stabilize the dollar and control agricultural product prices." The letter was released by Thomas today and read to the Senate Agriculture Committee. In the letter, the President stated, "The United States is still seeking to establish a currency that will not change its purchasing power and debt value after thirty years. However, now is not the time for strict stabilization, as the international situation is changing rapidly, and strict stabilization by the United States would be quite dangerous." At the same time, Thomas also released a letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles, stating that the Federal Reserve shares the ultimate goal of promoting economic stability. According to Thomas's proposal, a federal agency would be established to control currency prices and raise commodity prices to the average price of 1926. (National Telegram, 3rd)

### Danger on the Western Zhejiang Seawall

Seawall Damaged in Multiple Places by Giant Waves; Large Numbers of Laborers Hired to Rescue; City Nearly Flooded

[Hangzhou] On the morning of the 3rd, a hurricane-fueled tidal surge struck the western Zhejiang seawall, destroying the earthen seawall, the surface of the Haiyan highway, and the bus station, disrupting traffic. The Hangping Section Engineering Office, in conjunction with the county government, dispatched workers to rescue the situation. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 3rd, the wind and waves remained extremely fierce. The soil attached to the seawall outside the east gate of Haiyan was washed into a pool, and a section of the highway, about 30 meters long, was also washed away. In addition, about 50 meters of the stone seawall with the "Tenan" and other characters in the fourth district collapsed. Fortunately, the earthen seawall was still blocking the tide, preventing a major disaster. The top layer of the "Wei Wu" character firewood seawall was swept away by the giant waves, and the soil attached to the "Xi Yin" character sloping stone seawall and other Tan Shui projects was also washed away, creating an extremely dangerous situation. The Hangping Engineering Office is supervising the engineering team, together with the local government, to hire a large number of laborers to rescue the situation and ensure safety. Upon receiving the report, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau He Zhitai, accompanied by foreign consultant engineer Bairangdu and engineers Zheng Quhua and Chen Liyi, rushed to the site to investigate, instruct on rescue measures, and report to the Construction Department of the provincial government. (Special Dispatch, 4th)

[Hangzhou] The continuous gale and torrential rain have now subsided slightly. Near Wangjiabu above Yuhang on the Hanghui Road, the water level has risen four to five feet, and traffic has been suspended. On the Hangfutong Road, the sections of Gaoqiao in Fuyang and Luzhu in Xindeng have been flooded, making it difficult for passenger cars to pass, and service has been suspended. Several sections of the Zhixia section of the Tongjian Road have been washed away and are currently being repaired. Also, due to the Haiyan road surface being washed away on the Huhang Road, Hangzhou-bound passenger cars only go to Ganyou, and Shanghai-bound passenger cars only go to Zhaoyou. Passenger cars between Hangzhou and Linhai are still barely operating today, but because the water level between Xin and Sheng has risen to the road surface, service may be suspended again if it rains tomorrow. (Special Dispatch, 4th)

[Hangzhou] This morning, the hurricane seems to have left Zhejiang and moved elsewhere. The wind force has gradually weakened. The Qiantang River ferry resumed normal operations at 5:00 AM. Passengers and merchants traveling on the Huhang and Zhegan Roads, who had been stranded on both the north and south banks, crowded to cross the river. Additional ferries were added, and it is estimated that more than 30,000 passengers crossed the river in the morning and afternoon. All small steamers have resumed service. However, around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when the wind and waves on the Qiantang River were at their peak, a cargo ship capsized near the south bank, resulting in significant losses. The express station between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou was temporarily repaired this afternoon, but was soon blocked again. The Nanjing-Shanghai telegraph line has been repaired and is open for communication. (Special Dispatch, 4th)

[Hangzhou] The embankment of the Puyang River along the Zhegan Railway has been completely washed away. The water level from Baimen to Zhuji has risen five to six feet, and the bridges from Anhua to Zhengjiawu have been washed away, cutting off traffic. Trains bound for Nanchang have been suspended, and trains bound for Hangzhou only go as far as Yiwu Suxi. It is feared that service will not be restored within one or two days. The water level in Zhuji City has risen six feet, and the entire city has been flooded. (Special Dispatch, 4th)

He smiled often, and the children sat on the ground in a circle. The King sat in the middle, singing with the children. He then watched the children play a special ball game. When a child fell at the King's feet while fighting for the ball, the King quickly moved out of the way. Afterwards, he ate with the children. He then placed a hat in the children's name and drew one. The child drawn gave a speech, with a two-minute time limit. A gunshot was fired to indicate when they should stop.

### Mayor of Nanjing Ma Chaojun Speaks on the Issue of Self-Defense and Resistance

Exhorts City Government Employees to Assist the Front Lines in Uniting to Resist Aggression

Nanjing Correspondence: The city government held Premier Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Week at 8:00 AM yesterday, attended by all employees and presided over by Mayor Ma. After leading the ceremony, he delivered a speech on the issue of self-defense and resistance, stating: "Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Beiping and Tianjin have fallen one after another. Beiping is our country's hometown for hundreds of years, and Tianjin is our country's only important town in the north. We are deeply saddened on the one hand, and extremely excited on the other. All the soldiers of the 29th Army were able to rise up in unison, holding a determined resolve to bravely resist. In particular, the martyrdom of Generals Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu can shake the earth and make the ghosts cry. We are deeply moved by this spirit and can foresee that China will be able to revive. As for Japan, since the Sino-Japanese War, it has had the intention of destroying China. Primary schools constantly instilled knowledge on how to destroy China. The Russo-Japanese War, which was fought on Chinese territory, set an unprecedented record in world history. More recently, Japan has seized the privileges of the three northeastern provinces, further proving Japan's ambition to invade China. Premier Sun Yat-sen often told us that Japan's invasion of China is not accidental. The northeast and northwest routes are the most dangerous. Unfortunately, his words have come true. Japan is using a policy of encroachment, gradually advancing. If China does not resist, the invasion will never end. In recent years, our country has been working hard on construction. Japan, seeing that it will be unable to invade once our country is completed, has been constantly plotting to slander and undermine the development of our country's construction and prevent our country from moving forward. A country that takes advantage of others' dangers cannot be held accountable with righteousness. However, since the Japanese army invaded Tianjin, its atrocities of killing the innocent and destroying culture are unheard of in all countries of the world. This barbaric act will not only fail to reduce our courage to resist, but will only demean its international standing. At the same time, the Japanese warlords are acting arbitrarily, war-loving in nature, and destroying peace in the Far East,妄想妄想以武力併吞中國, Our only choice for self-defense is to unite and rise up to resist aggression, making the final sacrifice to seek the survival of the nation. The tyranny of the Japanese warlords will eventually lead to their own destruction. Although we are now a weak country, if we can resist to the end, we will surely achieve final victory. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly told us that we have reached the final moment. Only sacrifice can lead to survival. The colleagues of this government have the responsibility to maintain the capital, and I am confident that everyone can be a member of the national revolution and can embrace the determination to sacrifice themselves. There are five hopes for everyone: ㊀ We are still in the rear, and we should work hard to step up preparations. ㊁ When things happen, remain calm and deal with them, and do not panic. ㊂ Lead the people to maintain social order, such as stabilizing prices and stabilizing finance. ㊃ Prevent traitors and conduct strict reconnaissance. ㊄ Guide the people to engage in air defense. In short, those of us in the rear should establish close contact with the front lines, invigorate our spirits, and assist the front lines in resisting aggression. Be like wartime in peacetime and like peacetime in wartime, and calmly deal with the situation in order to overcome the difficulties and achieve final victory. Now the morale of the people is very high. There is only one goal for the whole country, which is to resist aggression and save the country. As for temporary or partial setbacks, they will not discourage our spirit. We should continue to work hard, persevere, and continue to struggle, implement Chairman Wang Jingwei's call to resist aggression, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, save the future crisis and permanently protect the safety of the nation."

### Gao Junting's Troops Pledge Allegiance

Contacting the Garrison Commander Liu Mao'en; Concentrating and Awaiting Orders to be the Vanguard in Killing the Enemy

Wuhu Correspondence: The remnants of bandits in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces have been actively suppressed by the National Army in recent years. The border area between Anhui and Zhejiang has long been cleared, and the area between Anhui and Jiangxi is also completely stable. As for the areas near Henan and Hubei, after being supervised and suppressed by Wei Lihuang, the Director of the Border Region of the Three Provinces, the scattered remnants of bandits who were hiding in various places have been eliminated one after another. The bandit troops of Gao Junting, which had a larger number of people and guns, have recently pledged allegiance to Liu Mao'en, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eleventh Route Army stationed in the Anhui border. The troops, numbering more than 2,000, have voluntarily abolished all illegal organizations and expressed their willingness to concentrate and await orders to be the vanguard in killing the enemy. After Liu carefully investigated and confirmed that the bandit's move was indeed sincere, but because he was responsible for suppressing the bandits, it was not appropriate to accept their surrender hastily, he went from Lu'an via Hefei to Wuhu and then to Nanjing on the 2nd to ask the military authorities for instructions. The remnants of bandits in the border areas of the three provinces, which have been causing trouble for many years, can now be completely eliminated. (August 3rd)

Current Commentary

### "Government Colleagues Have Completely Unified Opinions"

— Yong

Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's aggression against us has lasted for six years. During these six years, we have both resisted and negotiated. These actions have consistently been conducted under the national policies established by the government, which has always been clear to the people. As for the Lugouqiao Incident that occurred on July 7th this time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek again declared twice from the 19th onwards, establishing the limits and clarifying national policies regarding the critical juncture of war and peace, thereby announcing them to the world.

The power of the state is entrusted to the government. Since the authorities have established national policies, the officials should abide by them. Before the major plans are decided, the outstanding talents can express their opinions freely to ensure perfection. Once a decision is made, everyone in their position should diligently perform their duties and devote their talents to a common goal. In this critical state of the nation, those who are out of office have already abandoned their personal opinions to dedicate themselves to the country’s difficulties. How could government colleagues harbor doubts or dissent, disrupting their steps and undermining their strength? The saying "Government colleagues have completely unified opinions" is something we deeply believe in. The spread of rumors was specifically addressed and refuted by the Central News Agency yesterday, which is appropriate.

The so-called national policy, as declared by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, is vivid and clear. The most insightful and警醒 words are: "We only have sacrifice and resistance," and "Only by risking the lives of the nation can we seek our final victory." It is undeniable that we are a weak nation. When a weak nation confronts a strong one, there are only two paths: surrendering or resisting to the end. Now that the strong enemy has come, conquering cities and seizing land, it has long exceeded the threshold of war and peace. Since we are unwilling to give up, we should fight to survive and exert our utmost in resistance. The national policy is established; only this one word remains. Steadfastly adhere to it without wavering, regardless of whether one is in or out of office.

As for the government authorities, based on the standpoint of national policy, they have concrete plans and carefully considered implementation to effectively mobilize and deploy resources. Let us leave that aside for now. However, there are those who, lacking modern knowledge of political and military affairs, out of a desire for complete victory, give rise to concerns. They eloquently express their views in front of their superiors, and pace anxiously in their rooms when alone in deep thought. In reality, these worries are unnecessary. But understandably, their concern for the country is genuine. I dare to speak plainly to them: when a war begins, it should aim for the most economical use of time and resources, and the least amount of losses, to strike the enemy and achieve victory. But now, as a weak nation, we do not hesitate to engage in prolonged battles, resulting in scorched earth across vast lands, brave soldiers dying in battle, the old and weak being left in ditches, and the suffering of the people. These are hardships that other warring parties try to avoid, but we willingly endure them. Given the vastness of our territory, the size of our population, the abundance of our resources, and the simplicity of our supplies, even scorched earth tactics can exhaust the enemy's large army, and prolonged resistance can deplete the enemy's resources. An exhausted army with depleted resources is incapable of fighting. This concept of ultimate victory is demonstrated by the fact that Japan, at the very beginning of its military mobilization, immediately implemented tax increases and expanded its budget, further strengthening our belief.

Since the national policy has been determined and repeatedly emphasized by the authorities, and the war has already begun, the people have no choice but to move forward. From today onwards, the people should patiently await battle reports. Initially, there is no need to question the gains or losses of minor skirmishes. It is essential to wait for the final victory. However, Japan, after exhausting its military aggression, is now attempting to achieve its goals through diplomatic means, as if to supplement its military strength with diplomatic maneuvers. As the aggressor, there is nothing Japan will not do. However, our iron principles are firm, and our major plans are long decided. The government colleagues have unified opinions, and the people of the entire nation are vowing to be loyal and devoted. Looking towards the soldiers suffering in Tianjin, there are no tears to express their feelings. Facing the martyred compatriots, they swallow their grief in anguish. Surely, no one would dare to violate the national policy, exceed the final limit, abandon the life-and-death moment, and willingly become a sinner for all time. At this moment of national survival, officials and colleagues are united in heart, which is truly commendable. I especially express its meaning as a guarantee for ultimate victory.

### Japan's Active Aggression Against China: Second Supplementary Budget

Totaling 410 Million Yuan, Special Tax Bill Submitted to Parliament, Konoe Responds to Assembly Members' Questions, Maintains Non-Expansion Policy

[Tokyo] The plenary session of the House of Representatives opened at 1:55 PM today. Due to the urgent submission of the Special Tax Bill for the North China Incident, the atmosphere in the assembly hall suddenly became tense. After first deciding on ten agenda items, it approved eight items, including the Gold Production Bill, based on the committee chairman's report. Five proposals from assembly members were entrusted to committees. There was a recess at 2:50 PM. (4th, Domei News)

[Tokyo] The source of funds for the second expenditure on the North China Incident is to be secured through increased tax revenue and the issuance of public bonds for the North China Incident. The details are roughly as follows:

㊀ Increase tax revenue: 66 million yen in actual revenue for the current fiscal year. ㊁ Increase tax revenue: 36 million yen receivable for the next fiscal year. ㊂ Additional issuance of 308 million yen in public bonds for the North China Incident. If combined with the 96 million yen issued in the first round, the total amount would reach 404 million yen. According to Finance Minister Kaya's explanation, the supplementary budget for the second phase of the North China Incident is 410 million yen, which can be divided into the following categories: 5 million yen under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 300 million yen for the Ministry of the Army, 100 million yen for the Ministry of the Navy, and 3.3 million yen under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance (for public bond expenses), totaling 408.3 million yen. (4th, Domei News)

[Tokyo] At 4:00 PM on the 4th, the government submitted the Special Tax Bill for the North China Incident to the House of Representatives. At the same time, it released the rationale for the bill as follows:

In order to raise funds to cover a portion of the expenses for the North China Incident, a special tax for the North China Incident will be established. Income tax and temporary profit tax will be increased. At the same time, a special tax will be levied on a portion of dividends and interest on public and corporate bonds, as well as on specified goods. This is the reason for submitting this bill. (4th, Domei News)

[Tokyo] The plenary session of the House of Representatives continued in the afternoon. After approving five items, including the Tax Rate Amendment Bill, the Special Tax Bill for the North China Incident was urgently submitted. After the Finance Minister's explanation, questioning began. Shinohara Rikuro of the Minsei Party first questioned the reason for limiting the implementation period of the bill to one year. Finance Minister Kaya replied:

This tax is a direct tax levied on those with greater taxpaying ability, and we do not want to make this tax permanent.

Next, Mr. Sunada Shigemasa stated:

The situation in North China has now expanded. To resolve the situation, I wonder if the government intends to convene an extraordinary session of parliament.

Prime Minister Konoe replied:

The government is adopting a local and partial solution, and originally did not want the situation to expand. The policy has not changed to this day. If the situation actually expands, we will also adhere to the established policy. Even in extremely adverse circumstances, we still intend to adopt flexible response measures. The government will definitely do so. Whether or not to convene an extraordinary session of parliament, I am unable to explain at this time.

Mr. Kiyose Ichiro stated:

It is said that this tax increase has the meaning of a donation, but I fear that the amount is too small and it is inconvenient to demand that the national sentiment be tense, so that donations from all sectors can be rationalized. What does the authorities think?

Finance Minister Kaya replied:

It is commendable that the entire nation is united in dealing with matters, but from a financial perspective, there is no need to exhaust all efforts. Mr. Kawakami Buntaro asked:

This tax increase is a tax on all classes and seems to avoid mass taxation. But in the event that the situation unfortunately expands, will we still adhere to this policy to the end?

Finance Minister Kaya replied:

If the incident worsens, there may be a need to consider the tax issue. But in the current situation, there is still no need to exert all our efforts. Because this tax is a direct tax, it should not cause the prices of necessities to rise.

After Kato, Watanabe, and others had some questions and answers with the Finance Minister, the questioning ended and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. (4th, Domei News)

### Japan's Aggression Against China Violates International Law

American Newspapers Advocate Invoking the Nine-Power Treaty, Countries Responsible for Far Eastern Peace Should Assume Joint Responsibility

[New York] Public opinion here on Japan's active aggression against China advocates invoking the Nine-Power Treaty. The New York Eagle published an editorial stating: Japan claims to maintain peace in Asia, but its aggression against China is still actively advancing. The Nine-Power Treaty was signed jointly by China, the United States, and Japan. Violating this treaty violates international law. Therefore, countries such as England and France have recently indicated to Japan that all countries must be jointly responsible for peace in the Far East. (4th, Central News Agency)

### Russian Newspaper Denounces Japanese Military Atrocities

Soviet Consulate in Tianjin Vandalized, Russia Vows Retaliation Against Japan

[Moscow] Regarding the incident of Japanese anti-White Russian vandalism of the Soviet consulate in Tianjin, the News reported: "The shameless atrocities of the Japanese warlords and their White Russian pawns have made the entire Soviet people enraged. These aggressors, not satisfied with insulting the Chinese people, are now challenging all sides. The destruction of the Tianjin consulate was clearly directed by the Japanese warlords. They are using all means to provoke the Soviet Union. Their atrocities will receive an appropriate response from the Soviet Union, and their faces as troublemakers, challengers, and bandits will be branded before the entire civilized world."

Pravda stated: "Not satisfied with occupying Tianjin, the Japanese warlords are even intentionally clashing with French soldiers and organizing attacks on the Soviet consulate. At that time, the leading officials of the Japanese consulate shrank back like turtles, refusing to meet with the Soviet consul and attend meetings of the consular corps, openly provoking disputes on the one hand and hiding from people on the other. What is their baseness and shamelessness? The reason why the Japanese warlords dare to openly loot Chinese cities, even in concession areas, is the same reason why Japanese imperialism can freely invade the entire China: the Chinese people, although willing to resist foreign invaders, are not sufficiently organized, and the open connivance of other capitalist countries encourages Japan to recklessly slaughter as if they are bandits." The newspaper concluded: "The Japanese warlords and their White Russian bandits have repeatedly provoked on the Soviet border in the past, but they have also received merciless responses. They have realized that the Soviet territory is inviolable, and now they are using despicable means to vent their anger on the Soviet building within the land they have forcibly occupied. But this kind of vicious provocation will not only fail, but will eventually encounter an appropriate retaliation." (3rd, TASS)

### Suma Visits American Authorities to Exchange Information on the Far East

[Washington] Suma, the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States and the former Consul-General in Nanjing, exchanged information with the Department of State today regarding the situation in the Far East. Afterwards, Suma told a reporter from the Associated Press that the incident of the Soviet consulate in Tianjin being looted was also mentioned, but Japan believes that this is a dispute between Russian factions. Although the plan for American expatriates in Shandong to concentrate in safe locations was discussed, it was merely an exchange of information, as this matter is purely related to the American government. Suma also said that he had notified the Department of State of the news of Chinese troops moving north, but details could not be published. (3rd, National News)

### Germany Reaffirms Neutral Stance on China-Japan Dispute

[London] Local authorities have already denied reports that British Foreign Secretary Eden has asked Germany to mediate the China-Japan conflict. It is said that it is unknown whether the British Foreign Secretary harbors such intentions, and it is pointed out that such efforts can only be considered after both parties involved in the Far East dispute have clearly expressed their hope for mediation. (3rd, Haitong News)

[Berlin] A report by the Soviet official news agency claimed that England had asked Germany and Italy to mediate the Far East dispute, which has caused surprise, because Germany and Italy "benefit from the escalation of the international situation," and Germany is an ally of Japan. They also participated in inciting the recent conflict in Heilongjiang. Local authorities pointed out that this report clearly intends to provoke disputes and intensify the current tense situation. Germany is not an "ally" of Japan and has only signed an Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan. In view of this malicious report, the Anti-Comintern Pact is indeed necessary. Germany is completely neutral on the Far East dispute, maintains friendly relations with both sides, and does not want to assist Japan. Regarding the Heilongjiang conflict, Germany has no interests in that area and has no reason to participate in inciting it. Germany hopes to take steps to eliminate this report that causes disputes. (4th, Haitong News)

### Italian Newspaper Reveals Pro-Japanese Bias

[Rome] The chief editor of the Italian News published an editorial today, stating that the Far East incident will not turn into an international dispute at present. It goes without saying that the League of Nations is powerless. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States maintain normal friendly relations with both Nanjing and Tokyo. At the same time, they clearly stated that they will not directly or indirectly interfere in this matter, given Foreign Minister Hirota's declaration that he firmly rejects any mediation. Therefore, the Far East dispute will be purely a China-Japan affair, but it will have an impact on the position and policies of all countries. (3rd, Haitong News)

[London] The temporary demand from Japan for chartering British ships is currently a characteristic of the shipping market. According to The Times, Japan chartered two British ships yesterday for Far East trade for a period of six months, with charter rates of ten shillings and sixpence and eleven shillings respectively. This demand from Japan has not yet ended, and charter rates for merchant ships may continue to rise in the face of needs from all quarters. Japan is demolishing old ships, so it currently needs to charter ships to make up for the shortage. In addition, Japan is transporting large quantities of steel from Europe and India, and the import of scrap steel from the United States to Japan has also increased recently. The Times stated that if Japan is at war in China, it will inevitably use a large portion of its merchant ships in the Far East. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)

### Roosevelt Pays Attention to the Situation in the Far East

[Washington] President Roosevelt announced today that he may not have the opportunity to visit the Philippines this year. Roosevelt originally planned to travel to the Philippines in the autumn after Congress adjourned.

### The Lingering Aftermath of the Typhoon in Shanghai

The Wind Blows Towards Anhui Province; Ships Dare Not Venture Out to Sea; Shanties Collapse and Electric Wires Kill

After making landfall in Hangzhou Bay, the typhoon from the Pacific Ocean directly struck Shanghai on the night before last. Due to its fierce winds, the damage it caused was significant everywhere. Although it has now largely moved out of the Shanghai area, passing through the Tai Lake basin and entering the interior, the tail end of the storm continues to lash the city. Bamboo fences, wooden barriers, and other less sturdy structures have been blown down. Scattered debris litters the streets, and the storefronts and residences on both sides have been greatly transformed. Because the tail of the storm has not yet passed, the damage in various places remains substantial. A description of yesterday's situation follows:

The Wind Travels Northwest

Yesterday morning, according to the report from the Great Observatory, the typhoon's force remained extremely strong, with a speed of sixty nautical miles per hour, heading north-northwest. At 6:00 AM yesterday, it was located at longitude 119 degrees and latitude 32 degrees, approximately in the southern Jian Lake area on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui. By the 2:00 PM report, the typhoon had passed Zhenjiang and swept over the capital at 3:50 PM, reaching 22 degrees north latitude and 118 degrees east longitude. The wind direction had also shifted to due north, seeming to threaten the Bengbu area, which would greatly affect inland crops. It was also learned that Shandong and the Yellow Sea area were experiencing strong northeasterly winds due to the typhoon's northward trend. The upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River were hit by gale-force winds and rain, while the lower reaches had overcast skies and strong southeasterly winds. The Jianghai Customs signal station had removed one of the two warning globes yesterday morning, indicating that the wind force was beyond 100 nautical miles and not as turbulent as the previous day's roaring and howling, although the flow was still continuous, it was gradually becoming milder.

Shipping Disrupted

The typhoon struck Shanghai for over a day and night, disrupting maritime traffic. After forty hours, some shipping resumed yesterday afternoon, but some had not yet recovered. Among the Chinese and foreign vessels leaving port in the morning were the Nippon Yusen's Ryuta Maru, Da Lai's Jackson, and Great Britain's Ka什伊顯. An hour later, Jiang Shun, Shun Tian, Bei Fang, Guang Dong, Hai Yuan, Tai Shun, Zhou Shan, Da Xing, Xin Ming, and others, totaling eighteen ships, successively departed. Each ship went to the Wusongkou to assess the winds and waves before deciding whether to proceed. City ferries, small steamers, civilian boats, sampans, and barges within the Huangpu River all stopped running and sought shelter in small harbors, gradually resuming operation only after 10:00 AM yesterday. A few small steamers were seen operating on the river surface. Due to the typhoon, the wharves on both sides of the Huangpu River were unable to load and unload cargo, causing work to stop for forty hours as well, gradually resuming loading and unloading around noon yesterday. By the afternoon, small sampans still dared not venture out in the wind and waves. The Ningbo-Shanghai route ships Xin Jiang Tian and Ning Yu were sheltering in Zhenhai, while the Xin Ning Shao and Xin Bei Jing, which were in Shanghai, suspended their voyages. Yesterday afternoon, the Ning Shao's Xin Ning Shao and the Wenzhou-Taizhou route's Zhou Shan and Da Xing ships, seeing that the wind had left Shanghai, normally set sail and left port. However, upon reaching Wusong, they deemed the sea conditions too dangerous and dared not venture out to sea, so they returned to Shanghai to wait for the next sailing. It was heard that the Ningbo's Ning Xing and Xin Jiang Tian had already left Ningbo. The Shi He ship of the Gong Ji trading firm of this port unloaded its cargo at Twelve Forts and sailed back to Shanghai. While sailing on the Fushan estuary sea, they encountered the typhoon. To avoid danger, the ship quickly dropped anchor, but the wind force was too great, and the large iron anchor chain broke, causing the anchor to sink to the bottom of the sea. Fearing an accident, the ship steered towards the shore and avoided one, but the hull was slightly grounded, fortunately they escaped danger immediately. The ship sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, informing that they were returning to Shanghai. As for whether other ships had accidents, the companies had not received reports yesterday.

Lights Out

When the typhoon struck Shanghai at midnight the day before, the wind force was extreme, so it was very strong when it struck Shanghai. As the wind howled, buildings rattled, and citizens were awakened from their sleep. The streetlights and some residential lights in the areas of Shanghai's Min Guo Road, Zhong Hua Road, Xieqiao, and Gaochang Temple went out for two hours because the main lines were affected by the wind. The telephone lines in the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Longhua areas were cut because of their proximity to the coast. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau dispatched workers to repair them immediately, and they were completely restored by last night.

Special Zone Number Two Streets

In Shanghai's Second Special Zone, i.e., the French Concession's Huangpu Bund, Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, Avenue Joffre, and other roads, the larger trees on both sides of the roads were blown down, and the smaller ones were uprooted and toppled. Also, lower-lying roads and streets, such as the Caishi Street area from the east end of Zhengjia Muqiao Street to the Dongxi Zilaihuo Street, and routes like Rue Massenet, Rue Saussure, Route Mercier, etc., were knee-deep in water due to the overflowing of Jiangshui and underground sewers. The worst was the French Municipal Council's two sides of Avenue Joffre opposite Shangxian Fang. In other areas of the concession, shop signs and laundry racks on the balconies were blown down in several places, fortunately, no one was injured. As for the fallen trees, the Municipal Council hired workers yesterday morning to replant them or clear them away.

Many Collapsed Houses

The situation of house collapses in Zhabei has been briefly noted in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that behind the billboard next to the standard clock at the northern end of the Xin Zha Bridge also collapsed a kitchen room and a section of high wall along the road. Also, at No. 19 and 20 of Dexing Li across from the Xinmin Road Xin Zha Police Station, two empty buildings collapsed, fortunately, no one was injured. In addition, almost all awnings were destroyed, resulting in considerable losses. The awning of the Shanghai-Taicang Automobile Company's car factory at the intersection of Hutai Road was also blown down by the strong wind and fell on the electric pole at the entrance. Yesterday, the awning was removed and the electric pole was repaired. In addition, eight or nine out of ten of the thatched sheds in various places, such as Tanziwan, Dayang Bridge, Pingjiang Bridge, Pushan Road, Zhonghua Xin Road, Gonghe Xin Road, Liuying Road, etc., were damaged. Yesterday afternoon, it was seen that the poor people in those places were repairing them. At the same time, in Zhabei, due to the high tide of the Wusong River (commonly known as Suzhou River), low-lying areas, such as the Pendang Lane Nunnery to the Old Rubbish Bridge section, the Xin Rubbish Bridge to Wuzhen Road Bridge section, and the Xin Zha Bridge west to the Sampan Factory section, had river water rising onto the land in the lowest places. The worst was the east end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge, in front of the Bank of Communications warehouse. Due to the siltation of the sewers, the accumulated water had not drained away until around 3:00 PM yesterday. The wind blew into waves, and employees entering and leaving the warehouse had to cross the water on long planks. A dozen naughty children were playing happily in the water.

Electric Wire Kills

On the Pudong Tangqiao Pudong Avenue side, many electric poles were broken by the strong typhoon the day before. Some electric wires fell to the ground, and some were hanging. Unfortunately, a man, about thirty years old, wearing a Xiangyun yarn short shirt and black Indian silk pants, passed by. Because the hanging electric wire blocked the road, he reached out to push it away. Unexpectedly, the current shocked his hand, as if it were glued on. At the same time, a gust of wind wrapped two electric wires around his body, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. Afterwards, someone notified the electric company to come to the scene and cut the electric wires, but there was no way to revive the dead. Upon inspection, the word "王" (Wang) was tattooed on the dead man's right arm, and the letter "S" was tattooed on the tiger's mouth of his right thumb. Yesterday, the local headman reported to the local court for verification. ㊁ At the Lai Yi ferry Beihuo Tang Road, the chimney of the tiger stove opened by the local Xí Guānróng fell down and hit Xi's head, fortunately, the injury was light and he is expected to be safe. ㊂ Twenty to thirty thatched sheds were blown down in the area of Eighteen Rooms and the Blue Chimney Wharf. The Jiangbei poor people had nowhere to live and were exposed to the wind and rain, in a very pitiful situation. ㊃ Hundreds of trees planted on both sides of Pudong Avenue were blown down, causing regret among passersby. ㊄ At 9:00 AM, the Yizhong Tobacco Factory in Lujiazui temporarily stopped work due to wind and rain, causing a false alarm among the workers. ㊅ Generally, male and female workers working in various tobacco and cotton factories in Yangshupu had no boats to cross the river and return home in the evening after going to the factories in the morning. ㊅ Countless fences were blown down everywhere. Calculated by the length of connections, there were at least a thousand zhang. ㊇ Pudong and Puxi's mail was suspended for a day due to the interruption of traffic on the Huangpu River, and postal service only resumed yesterday morning.

Telephone Restored

They are scheduled to go to a certain place today to implement their work.

### Manzanar Maru Fully Loaded with North China Refugees Arrives in Shanghai Today

After the outbreak of the North China Incident, foreigners and Chinese people from Tianjin, Dagu, Yantai, Qingdao, and other places in North China flocked south to take refuge. Since the Shanghai-Ping train could not directly reach Tianjin, refugees from the Pingjin area mostly changed to taking ships south by sea.

It is hereby stated that the Japanese soldiers have been violating police authority and threatening public order in the area for more than a day, and have recently taken off their masks and revealed their barbaric nature, hostile to world civilization, hostile to world progress, and hostile to world peace. The facts are clear, and public opinion has condemned them. Peace has decided to fight them. Even the Chinese and foreign newspapers in this port, especially the British and American newspapers, have criticized them with all their might! It is clear that democratic governance is striving for light. In accordance with the preceding letter, we hope that this report is based on facts that do not yet exist, but your bureau is responsible for the public order within the area and has an unshirkable responsibility, so as to ensure that these rumors do not exist.

If police officers have private affairs, they should also avoid going to the Nanshi, Zhabei, and other areas outside the concession, but this directive has no other meaning, but is to ensure the security of the concession.

Ms. Liang Donates a Large Batch of Silverware

Since the establishment of the fundraising committee of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association to raise national salvation donations from all walks of life, people from all walks of life have been donating funds and items to various collection agencies, which has been very enthusiastic. Yesterday, the association received a large batch of silverware from Ms. Liang Yiqing, wife of Chen Beilan, the former general manager of the Hong Kong Zizhi Daily, including nineteen silver tripods and other items, of great value. The association has now separately counted, numbered, and preserved them for the needs of anti-enemy support. Ms. Liang, as a widow, has been greatly admired for her enthusiasm for national salvation in donating such a large amount of silverware, so a letter has been sent to thank and commend her.

Students Launch Iron Donation Movement

All the female students of Kun Fan Girls' Junior High School on Changbai Ke Road are carrying out an iron donation movement to save the country. They have already collected one dan of iron. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Citizen Federation of the First Special District, saying: Respectfully, the prelude to the war has begun, and the nation is facing a critical moment of life and death. All our citizens should do their best to contribute their wealth and exert their strength to overcome national difficulties. Only in this way can the nation be saved. Rear support work must be actively carried out, so that the soldiers on the front line have no worries. Considering that the people of the country have always paid little attention to scrap copper and iron, the enemy takes the opportunity to buy it to meet the needs of wartime. If prevention is not taken urgently, the damage in the future will be unimaginable. Our school, in view of this, has initiated a collection of a thousand catties of scrap copper and iron from all students and their relatives, and specially sent it to your association to be transferred to the government. This move can not only prevent traitors from buying scrap copper and iron and reselling them to support the enemy, but also increase the raw materials for manufacturing military supplies in our country. We respectfully ask your association to strongly advocate and petition the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to hold a student iron donation movement, so that hundreds of thousands of catties of scarce steel and iron in this city can be collected easily. This matter concerns national salvation, and we hope you will consider it with gratitude.

Shipping Merchants Strictly Prevent Renting Vessels to Support the Enemy

According to insiders in the shipping industry, there are quite a few national vessels rented to Japanese merchants. However, it is understandable that the ships could not be taken back due to prior contracts. At this critical time of resistance against the enemy, there are actually treacherous merchants who only care about profit and still want to rent out ships to support the enemy, which is simply insane. It is also said that the relevant authorities are closely investigating and trying to ban this.

Bean and Rice Industry Raises National Salvation Donations

Lu Juxing Salted Goods Store at No. 196 Xizhen Town, Yangjing, Pudong, is opened by Lu Atao. His son, Lu Liugen, is 18 years old. Since childhood, Yao Lindi (17 years old) was raised as his daughter-in-law.

### Yu Shunxing Leather Trunk Store: Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Dispute

Daughter-in-Law Claims Trunk as Her Own, Mother-in-Law Sues for Severance of Relationship

Yu Shunxing Leather Trunk Store, located on Jixiang Street in the French Concession, was opened by people from Beicai. When the old owner was alive, it had many branches and dominated the Shanghai leather trunk industry. The old owner passed away ten years ago, and his sons also managed to revive the business for a time. However, recently, it is not as prosperous as before. The old store on Jixiang Street is currently managed by the old owner's second wife, Yu Cai, who employs Jiang Afu as the manager. Yu Cai only has daughters, namely Cai Yu, Chen Yu, and Lu Yu. On the male side, the first wife bore Yu Jinliang, who also runs a leather trunk business under a different banner. Additionally, there is

an adopted son named Yu Shangzhi, who opened Yu Yuansheng Leather Trunk Store at 52 Huayi Street in the South City. Yu Shangzhi passed away on May 10th of this year, leaving behind his widowed wife, Yu Tang, and several orphans, in dire straits. All that remained were about five hundred leather trunks in the store, valued at over a thousand yuan, which was insufficient for funeral expenses and to provide a livelihood for the widow and orphans. Therefore, the body was displayed for two or three days. Finally, a mediator was invited to the scene, and Yu Cai, the aunt, promised to allocate two tile-roofed houses and ten mu of land in Wafang, Beicai Town, Pudong, and provide monthly expenses. In return, Yu Cai would handle the Yu Yuansheng Leather Trunk Store on Huayi Street. However, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were not on good terms, and problems arose regarding the monthly living expenses. Recently, when customers came to Jixiang Street to purchase,

Yu Cai instructed Jiang Afu and her daughters Cai Yu and Chen Yu to go to Yu Yuansheng on Huayi Street to take away the leather trunks. Yu Tang refused, resulting in a conflict. As a result, Yu Tang and Cai Yu were both taken to the police station. However, as it was a family dispute, they were both ordered to return home. However, Yu Tang and Yu Cai were unwilling to give in, and their relationship had completely broken down. Yu Tang then sued her aunt, as well as her husband's sisters and Jiang Afu, in the local court for robbery and assault. Yu Cai also recounted her daughter-in-law's shortcomings and requested the court to sever the relationship. Summons were issued on the past two days, and the matter is awaiting investigation.

### Young Woman Falls into a Brothel, Cries for Help from Window and is Rescued

Enduring Four Customers in One Night, Unable to Bear the Suffering, Brothel Owner Arrested and Prosecuted by the Police

Zhang Wang, a young woman from Huzhou, aged twenty-three, was lured to Shanghai by Chen Zhu, a woman from the same hometown, ten days ago. She was lodged at 54 Chuanji Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. The day before yesterday, on the pretext of recommending her to work in a factory, Chen Zhu sold Zhang Wang to Zhao Xiao, a Yangzhou woman who ran a brothel at 41 Longmen Road, forcing her into prostitution. In one night, Zhang Wang had to serve four customers. Zhang Wang found this kind of inhumane life no different

from a living hell and could not bear it. Yesterday morning, she took the opportunity to open the window and loudly cried for help. Nearby Chinese constables heard the alarm and reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched Detective Wang Xichang. Wang rescued Zhang Wang from the brothel and arrested the brothel owner, Zhao Xiao, along with prostitutes Wang Zhao Di and Wang Xiao Ru Yi Zi. Zhao Xiao was detained, and the others were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for shelter. The police also worked with detectives from the Zhabei Police Bureau to locate related persons Chen Zhu, Qian Gong, and Zhao Lu at 54 Chuanji Lane, Xinjiang Road.

All three were detained at the police station to await documentation and transfer. Yesterday morning, Zhao Xiao was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Luotang stated the above situation and prosecuted Zhao Xiao for violating Article 300, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, for restricting freedom. According to Zhang Wang's statement, she was from Huzhou, aged twenty-three, and had been living in her hometown with her husband, Zhang Bingmu. Ten days ago, a woman named Ye A'san (i.e., Chen Zhu) came to my house, saying she had something important and asked me to go with her. I went with her, but that night I was

taken to Shanghai and first lodged in Zhabei. Until the day before yesterday, Ye A'san said that she had recommended me to a factory and urged me to go to work quickly. I was then taken to the defendant's place and locked in a room. I still didn't know I had fallen into a brothel. Until the evening, the defendant and a maid forced me to put on makeup and stand on the street to solicit customers. Then I realized I was trapped, but under their lewd power, I had no room to resist and could only let them do what they wanted. Later, I received a man in a suit who said he would pay two yuan and forty cents for the night. When we entered the room, I refused to comply, and the man also

expressed sympathy and left, promising to help me. Unexpectedly, the defendants still forced me to receive customers. I then received a man in short clothes who paid two yuan and was raped once. However, the defendant still refused to give up and continued to force me to solicit customers. Afterwards, I received two more customers, but they both sat briefly, paid, and left. The money was all taken by the defendant. It wasn't until after three o'clock in the morning that I was able to rest, but the door was locked. When it was about to dawn, I managed to open the window and cry for help, and the police came to rescue me, she stated. The defendant, Zhao Xiao, gave evasive statements, denying that she ran a brothel and forced prostitution. Judge Huang discussed the matter and ordered her to be detained for further questioning on August 10. Zhang Wang was temporarily detained at the Jiliang Institute to await notification of her husband to come to the court for verification.

### Female Criminal Enters Jail with Tears in Her Eyes

Habitual Offender Relapses Soon After Release; Though Expressing Repentance, the Law Offers No Leniency

Lu Xiulin, a woman from Pudong, thirty years old this year, though past her prime, is fashionably dressed. She had been imprisoned several times before for committing theft. Not long after her latest release, she relapsed. On the afternoon of the 17th of last month, at around 4 p.m., she entered the third-floor pavilion room at 74 Remi Road in the French Concession and stole thirty-two yuan in cash and several pieces of clothing. As she was about to leave, she was discovered and stopped by Dai Shan, the landlady. Dai had someone go outside to call the police, who arrested Lu and sent her to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Criminal Division Chief Jian Ning presided over the first criminal court to question her. The Police Department prosecuted her for habitual theft. Subsequently, the victim and witnesses testified about the theft and how it was discovered. Lu Xiulin's testimony was cunning and evasive, and she repeatedly expressed remorse. After reviewing the evidence, the court sentenced Lu Xiulin to four months of imprisonment for habitual theft. Pending the appeal period, she was transferred to the detention center. Lu Xiulin entered the jail with tears in her eyes upon hearing the sentence.

### Japanese Employee of Gonda Textile Mill Commits Suicide Grieving Over Warmongering of Japanese Military

Makino Ichiro Grieves Over Son's Death in Battle; Swallows Smoke (Opium?) After Conscription Notice, But is Rescued

According to Shenzhou News Agency, a Japanese employee of the Gonda Textile Mill revealed that Makino Ichiro, an employee of the factory's engineering section, has been working at the factory for over ten years. He usually works diligently and lives in the factory without his family. Last year, his two sons in Japan were conscripted into military service. After the outbreak of the North China Incident, the two sons happened to be serving in North China. In the battle of Tianjin and Beijing, both sons died simultaneously. Upon hearing the bad news, he was filled with grief and angrily cursed the domestic military cliques for their warmongering, which caused the people to suffer endless pain. Recently, he received a notice of conscription from his home country, causing him to be deeply stimulated. He expressed that rather than dying unconsciously on the battlefield, he would rather commit suicide. Therefore, he swallowed opium to commit suicide. However, his colleagues in the factory discovered it and rushed him to Fumin Hospital for treatment, and he was saved. He is now being monitored by his companions to prevent him from committing suicide again.

Hu A'er, a 32-year-old worker from Wuxi at the Hongxiang Iron Factory at Chunjiang Pier, Pudong, was forging an axle tube for the rudder of a ship in the furnace at 9 a.m. the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, after the forging was red-hot, it suddenly exploded, and the red debris scattered all over his body, killing him instantly. The incident was reported to the police station, but due to the typhoon and suspension of ferries, the local bailiff, Lu Shunlong, did not report to the local court for an autopsy until yesterday. However, the deceased's brother, Hu Donglin, petitioned the court for an exemption from the autopsy. The petition was approved by Prosecutor Chen, and he signed a bond in court and was allowed to arrange for the burial himself.

### Extortion Through Letters Accompanied by Threats with Hand Grenade

Cigarette Store Owner Reports to Police in Fear; Extortionist Apprehended in Another Case and Brought for Interrogation

Wu Genjin, a 51-year-old local, the owner of Shunxing Cigarette Store located at 159 Jianweilu Road outside the West Gate of the French Concession, had saved up some money through thrift and hard work. This attracted the attention of criminals. On the afternoon of the 15th of last month, at around 4 p.m., a criminal threw a letter into the store. Wu picked it up, opened it, and read it. It was an extortion letter demanding 10,000 yuan, along with two handgun bullets. The letter arranged to

negotiate payment on the Old Garbage Bridge on the 22nd and 23rd of the same month. Wu ignored it. On the 24th, Wu received another letter stating that if he continued to ignore them, they would resort to using hand grenades, and they arranged to meet on the 24th and 25th to negotiate. The letter also said, "You have two sons, one grenade for each of them. You have money, but who will you rely on later," and so on. After receiving the second letter, Wu became anxious and reported the letter and the evidence to the French police, requesting an investigation. Unexpectedly,

the criminals in this case were arrested by the Public Concession Police Bureau in another case. Three suspects were apprehended and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. After investigation, the French Police Bureau requested the First Special Court to issue a document to send detectives to the First Special Court to transfer the three suspects into French Custody. Yesterday they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where they were interrogated by Liao Ning, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court. One of them, Chen Deqing (40 years old, from Funing, residing at 11 Xujiawu, Xujiajiu Road), another Zheng Mingde (also known as Lao Wu, 48 years old, from Yancheng,

residing in a shanty on Shanzhong Road), and the third Chen Deyu (40 years old, Chen Deqing's younger brother), gave evasive statements and also stated that the extortion letters were instructed by Feng Da, who is still at large. Subsequently, the Police Department's lawyer requested a postponement of the investigation to gather more information and arrest the remaining accomplices who are at large, and request the court to hear the case. After reviewing the evidence, the court ruled to reschedule the hearing for 9 a.m. on the 10th of the month. The defendants were returned to custody.

### The Importance of Urban Air Defense Preparedness Under Attacks by Bombers and Incendiary Bombs

— Alarming

The decline of international morality and the use of cruel weapons such as bombers and incendiary bombs by irrational countries have become commonplace! In the event of an air raid, a region's cultural institutions, administrative centers, magnificent buildings, and lives and property are all subjected to the enemy's unbridled devastation! In addition to our heartache, we must rise up to seek ways to prevent it.

Countries with complete air defense equipment can make any enemy bomber lose its bombing effectiveness. This point is still difficult to achieve in China today!

Before the European War, London had no so-called air defense facilities, and it was at a loss when enemy planes attacked. After the outbreak of the war, people gradually began to pay attention. After a considerable period of time, air defense facilities gradually became more comprehensive. In recent years, enemy planes have been unable to fulfill their bombing ambitions!

At the beginning of the European War, when bombers were first discovered attacking London, the citizens were panicked and at a loss, running around chaotically, resulting in a terrible situation. Countless lives and properties were sacrificed under the German planes! Until the end of the war, when citizens saw enemy planes attacking, they were able to calmly respond, taking predetermined steps. When the alarm sounded, the city was empty, and there were preparations for evacuation everywhere, and the air defense facilities were meticulous.

The purpose of the enemy's inhumane bombing is actually to disrupt the public's morale, create their fear of war, and cultivate their cowardice. Under these circumstances, the citizens must have at least a minimum knowledge of air defense. Merely being terrified is detrimental and useless! The government should also pay attention to air defense facilities and promote them in conjunction with each other, so that they can be effective. It is regrettable that countries that love peace often do not pay attention to this during peacetime! They should know that military preparedness is the backing of peace. Without it, we will be fish on the chopping board, only to be slaughtered!

After the January 28th Incident, some enlightened people paid attention to the importance of air defense facilities. This Lugouqiao Incident and the enemy's occupation of Tianjin and Beijing, gave us even more profound lessons! There is no shortage of specialists in the country, and they should rise up to organize air defense research institutions, make contributions to the government, and train citizens. The authorities should also pay full attention to this, and the task is so urgent that no delay is allowed!

### Retreat and Sacrifice

— Tang Ming

I have always paid close attention to Chairman Wang's speeches. Moreover, I have also had the honor of hearing him give impassioned and inciting speeches directly on several occasions.

This time, Chairman Wang returned to Nanjing from Lushan and delivered an extremely important speech. He gave a very concise explanation of the six years of forbearance, as follows: "We know that Japan is constantly invading China. Since the September 18th Incident, it has been killing its way into China step by step, and China has been retreating step by step. Why is China retreating step by step? Because China is sixty or seventy years behind Japan in progress, and China's national strength cannot stop Japan's invasion. So, what has been China's diplomatic and internal policy since the September 18th Incident? In summary, diplomatically, we cannot stop Japan from killing its way in step by step, but we can only think of ways to make it advance more slowly. China cannot but retreat step by step, and can only think of ways to make us retreat more slowly. Why do we want to slow down? Do we want to take this opportunity to seek temporary peace and survive? No, we just want to take advantage of this slowness to free up some time to do various preparatory work in internal affairs to strengthen our resistance. This has been China's diplomatic and internal policy since the September 18th Incident."

Chairman Wang then explained the success of the government's construction in both spiritual and material aspects after the signing of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement and the Tanggu Armistice Agreement. However, what is this "success" for? Chairman Wang said: "We are the people of a weak country. What we call resistance has no other content. Its content is only sacrifice. We want to turn every soldier and every piece of land into ashes so that the enemy cannot get anything into their hands. This meaning is indeed harsh, but if we don't do this, there will be even harsher things following behind. In essence, if we don't sacrifice, then we will only be puppets." It is to make the whole country devoid of anything, for the final sacrifice.

We agree to sacrifice, and we are preparing our weapons and lives to fight the enemy. But the end of our sacrifice is to seek survival. Our creed is not to seek survival by retreating, but to seek survival by sacrificing. At the same time, we hope that the government can transform the tenacious spirit of enduring humiliation and retreating repeatedly for the past six years into a tenacious spirit of resistance throughout. Then, our resistance will never be a desperate resistance of trapped beasts, nor will it be a resistance of defeatists where every soldier and every piece of land becomes ashes. We are a war of liberation, a war to build a new country and maintain world peace. Our friends are all over the world at the lowest levels!

### The Last Lesson

— Ziming

On the morning of July 8, Wanping County, which was in a sweet sleep, was suddenly awakened by a burst of urgent gunfire.

"The Japanese soldiers are drilling again!" This was the thought that rolled through the minds of everyone who was awakened from their dreams. But ever since the Twenty-Ninth Army retreated to Lugouqiao last year, the Japanese soldiers' wanton behavior in Wanping had become commonplace. The people of our own country are not up to par, so who can the common people resent? It's called drilling, but they are armed with live ammunition. The bean fields are trampled, the houses are pierced with holes, and being hit with rifle butts is even more common. But what can the common people do? They hate it in their hearts, but they have to close their doors and sit at home waiting for death.

### The World of Running Dogs

— (By Wang Mei)

At this moment, in a small school in the county town, the bell for waking up had just rung. Hearing the urgent sound of gunfire, the old tea room attendant deliberately rang the bell with force, as if to vent his frustration.

The students all jumped out of bed. They all liked to secretly peek at the Japanese soldiers' drills, and almost every elementary school student had learned practices such as "kneel down" and "charge," sometimes dividing into two teams, A and B, in the playground, representing China and the Japanese, and fighting each other.

The principal was a scholar in his fifties, his hair already graying, but he was happy to stand and watch, nodding, at his students' subconscious patriotic performances.

But today, when the elementary school students gathered on the upper floors to watch the Japanese drills, the principal ran to stop them, ordering them to go to the church, and canceling morning exercises for the day.

The students all obeyed the principal, as if listening to their father's instructions. They immediately and quickly went to the church, sitting down without a sound, as if sensing an impending terror.

The principal stood upright at the teaching desk, silent for a long time, forgetting how to begin to tell his beloved elementary school students the ominous news he had received last night.

The sound of gunfire rang out again, and every pair of small eyes looked at each other, surprised and afraid, hoping that the principal would explain it to them immediately.

"This is the last lesson!"

The principal said these words with all his strength, but he couldn't continue immediately, and two lines of clear tears hung from his eyes.

"Children, this is the last lesson!" he repeated, "Last night, the Japanese, under the pretext of a missing soldier, demanded to enter the city for inspection... This is Chinese land, children, can we allow them to do this?..."

The children listened quietly, their eyes fixed on the principal's face, letting each of his heavy voice spread out.

"Of course not!" the principal clenched his fist, "They then opened fire to make trouble... and even bombarded our county town with artillery, but our loyal 29th Army has already returned fire..."

As he spoke, the principal unfolded the map on the wall and pointed with his finger to the terrain of Wanping and the Lugou Bridge, explaining, "Since the 1918" incident, our four eastern provinces have been seized, and last year they occupied Fengtai. The Japanese ambition is pressing closer step by step. Recently, they have wanted to pressure Beiping to achieve their long-cherished wish of controlling the entire North China. And to pressure Beiping, they must first seize the Lugou Bridge, because the Lugou Bridge is the throat of Beiping: to seize the Lugou Bridge, they must first seize Wanping, because Wanping is the guardian of the throat of Beiping..." The principal's voice rose higher and higher, almost drowning out the gunfire outside, "So, can we abandon Wanping, abandon the Lugou Bridge?"

A sudden commotion, dozens of small mouths shouting the same voice:

"No!"

"Yes!" The principal nodded, as if taking a breath, "Now, our loyal 29th Army is vowing to live and die with the bridge, and County Magistrate Wang has already ordered the city to be defended, and to continue the war of resistance after the reinforcements arrive. This is the final moment for the Chinese nation, every Chinese person should participate in the work of national salvation, so, I say today is the last lesson!"

## Page 16

The church was temporarily silent, but it felt as if an explosive powder was permeating the air. The principal slowly rolled up the map.

"We are scholars, so naturally we cannot go to the front line to kill the enemy, but the rear needs us to provide assistance to those loyal brothers. We must immediately organize a comfort team to fulfill our responsibility as citizens, to comfort our brothers resisting the enemy. Children, who is willing to participate, raise your hand."

Countless hands were raised simultaneously, and strong hearts were connected to each other.

A Bloody Tragedy

This tragedy is too bloody! I believe I will never forget it, never, ever!

Perhaps it's my hobby: I like to stand on that product of civilization - that high, solid iron bridge, crisscrossed by cars and trams, looking at the yellow, polluted Huangpu River water, and indulge in solitary thoughts for a while.

It was a little after 2 pm on the 30th. I was passing by Tilanqiao on business, so I leaned on the iron railing again, looking down at the yellow river water. A few small boats, loaded with watermelons, were rowing east. Actually, I wouldn't pay attention to these figures at all. My mind was full of all kinds of thoughts. That day, I was pondering over that Tianjin telegram - the one I saw in the morning paper. The telegram said: "The Japanese army in Tianjin city took kerosene and set fires everywhere! When residents tried to escape outside, the Japanese army at the street corners used machine guns to strafe them!" At that time, I refused to believe that the news was true. Because in the present 20th century, especially the imperial army of a civilized nation like Japan, would never commit such savage and barbaric acts as primitive people! Perhaps it was a rumor? Perhaps it was fabricated by the news agency? Or perhaps the telegram was translated incorrectly? While my mind was indulging in all sorts of bizarre thoughts, suddenly, a "grinding" sound rose behind me. I quickly turned around to see what was happening. I saw a ×× armored car speeding up from under the bridge. So: the tram stopped; the cars stopped; pedestrians frantically and hurriedly fled to both sides of the bridge, and the armored car drove over even more urgently! When it was about to reach the end of the bridge, the bloody tragedy unfolded!

Oh my God! What a tragic scene! A woman, about forty years old, was already lying in the blood under the iron wheels of the armored car! The bright red blood was still gushing upwards! At this time, those who were afraid of trouble were afraid that disaster would befall them, and had already run away; the timid also hid in the corners of the bridge, not daring to come out; a few foreign cars passed by, and they poked their heads out of the windows to take a look, then sneered a few times and ordered their drivers to continue forward. Just at this moment - when the armored car was about to drive away, an Indian constable suddenly came and shouted loudly for it to stop! Who knew that a ×× soldier in the armored car also jumped out quickly, his face ferocious, drew a pistol with one hand, pointed it at the Indian constable's chest, and said something in a language I didn't understand. The meaning was that he wanted the Indian constable to let him drive away, otherwise he would shoot him dead! The Indian constable wasn't flustered either, he drew his pistol, opened the safety, and also pointed it at the ×× soldier's chest, bravely saying, "You shoot! If I die, you die too!" Sure enough, the ×× soldier yielded. The car number was copied down by the Indian constable, and the ×× soldier was also taken away by the Indian constable! When the ambulance came to carry away the injured woman, she had already lost more blood! It looked like she was about to die!

At this time, many compatriots came to help. They all helped to carry the injured person into the car. Is this the compassion of us Chinese people?

At that time, I remembered a story, which said: "A Chinese person scolded an Indian constable, saying, 'You slave of a subjugated country!' But the Indian constable calmly retorted to the Chinese compatriot who scolded him, saying, 'You're not much different'!" These words were originally intended to insult us, and we would never admit to the 'almost' of being 'not much different' from a 'slave of a subjugated country'! Now, unexpectedly, the Indian constable, a 'slave of a subjugated country', dared to bravely draw his pistol and make a righteous resistance to the ferocious and evil ×× soldier, while we Chinese, who are not yet 'slaves of a subjugated country', and whose own compatriots are sacrificed, dare not protest to the ×× soldier. How shameful is this! However, one might also say: we have no weapons and cannot resist him. Then why don't the senior military generals in North China, who possess heavy troops, dare to make a righteous resistance to the ×× soldier? Compared to that Indian constable who is already a 'slave of a subjugated country', what will they be like?

The Tianjin telegram that I had been hesitating about quickly led me to decide that it was indeed true. Think: in Shanghai, where sovereignty is still autonomous, the ×× soldiers are still so brutal, regarding the lives of Chinese people as worthless. Then in the fallen Pingjin, the lives of Chinese people are certainly even less important!

Readers: don't be fortunate that the one who died a violent death was not you, nor your wife, sister, mother, or even your relatives and friends. You must know! Today, or tomorrow, this cruel fate may befall you. Your blood, your flesh, will not arouse their mercy. They are vicious beasts, they are demons who kill without blinking an eye! They want to eat your flesh and drink your blood. No one can escape this tragic calamity, unless we, the weak, unite and resist him with force, and beat him to death! Only then will we have a way to live, only then can we live! Otherwise, this tragic fate will eventually come one day! We will eventually be eaten of our flesh and sucked of our blood and die one day! We are still alive now, and this is only a matter of time!

Yesterday, I passed by Tilanqiao again, and those ×× armored cars were still running as fast as lightning. Fortunately, I dodged a little faster, otherwise, wouldn't I have been sacrificed by the foremost armored car?

A "cattle herding" child on the bridge warmly advised me: "Next time you have to be careful! You better run faster! ×× people don't pay for killing people! Didn't they run over an old woman yesterday?"

I nodded sadly. (Jin Ge)
