### Adoption of the Metric System for Automobile Odometers and Fuel Gauges – Implementation Measures

Drafted by the Ministry of Industries, Promulgated for Implementation

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Ministry of Industries stating that the construction of urban roads and highways in our country has progressed rapidly in recent years, and the number of automobiles in use has increased significantly, while most odometers and fuel gauges installed in domestically used automobiles are measured in miles and U.S. gallons, respectively. As the new system is being universally promoted throughout the country, such non-compliant units of length and volume should not be allowed to persist. Moreover, since all national highways are measured in kilometers, the mile-based odometers are inconvenient for drivers. The adoption of the metric system should be gradually implemented to facilitate uniformity in national standards. The Ministry also drafted a set of measures for the implementation of the adoption of the metric system for automobile odometers and fuel gauges, along with a conversion table for automobile distance and fuel measurements between the metric and imperial systems. With the approval of the National Economic Council, it was recently passed by the Executive Yuan and promulgated for implementation. The original text of the implementation measures is as follows: ㊀ Automobile odometers shall measure distance in kilometers, and fuel gauges shall measure volume in liters. Six months after the promulgation of these measures, highway traffic authorities shall refuse to register any new automobiles whose odometers or fuel gauges still use the imperial system. ㊂ All signs indicating automobile speed limits in each province and city shall uniformly use kilometer markings. ㊂ Oil and fuel used in automobiles, whether packaged in barrels or cans, shall uniformly indicate the number of liters. ㊃ All fuel transactions and fuel dispensers at gas stations shall uniformly measure volume in liters. ㊄ Each province and city shall uniformly use the metric system for the registration of automobile distance and fuel volume. ㊅ When registering an automobile, a copy of these measures and a conversion table for distance and fuel measurements between the metric and imperial systems shall be provided, one for the car owner and one for the driver. ㊅ These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Trans-Pacific Airship Plan

— Xing

Since the successful trans-Pacific clipper airplane flight between China and the United States, and the opening of regular air routes, American government and private sectors are keenly planning a trans-Pacific airship. According to the Shanghai Times of this month's 2nd, the American Zepplin Transport Company plans to build two large airships for regular trans-Pacific flights. The company has requested subsidies from the US Congress and will use American-produced helium instead of hydrogen. A Zepplin airship from San Francisco to Hong Kong would take only four days, shortening the Pacific Clipper flight time by two days. Each airship can carry seventy passengers each time. According to officials in the US Department of Commerce, this plan could be realized in two years at the latest.

The active American involvement in aviation development in the Pacific has great significance commercially, politically, and even militarily. Commercially speaking, in today's world of business competition, whoever controls the most important international air routes can control the largest international markets. In the sixteenth century, powers fought for sea routes to India. In the twentieth century, powers are competing for air routes to the vast markets of the Far East. China is a treasure trove coveted by all countries, with four hundred million people and vast underground resources. Its economic prospects are limitless. Aviation is the fastest means of transportation today, surpassing railways and steamships. Therefore, the most advanced capitalist countries, such as Britain, America, and Germany, are using national power and government funds to open up air routes to the East. The American Pan American Company and the British Imperial Airways are prime examples. Recently, Germany planned to build multiple Zepplin airships to connect Berlin with various ports in the Dutch East Indies. Despite the Hindenburg airship disaster in the United States, it did not diminish the ambitions of the German authorities. Airships have higher speed and greater carrying capacity than airplanes. Therefore, although we often hear news of airship accidents, the massive aerial monsters are quickly destroyed and then rebuilt, falling and rising again.

The United States pays special attention to aviation in the Pacific for military reasons. If the United States goes to war in the Far East, its fleet will be far from its base. Geographically, it is far inferior to its ideal enemy. On the one hand, it needs a large number of aerial weapons to bomb the enemy's military, political, and economic centers. On the other hand, it needs rapid transportation to connect fleets and connect the fleets with their bases. Airplanes can bomb the enemy and transmit information, but they cannot bear the responsibility of transportation. Continuous transportation from the rear is necessary for victory. Therefore, although the naval authorities have built a large number of aircraft, they are concerned about the lack of airships. Years ago, the US Navy's two giant airships, the Akron and the Macon, were destroyed one after another. Now, the American Zepplin Company's proposal to build commercial airships naturally interests the Navy Department deeply.

Economic and military reasons naturally lead to political consequences. To maintain its capitalist existence, the United States does not want to allow others to monopolize and divide the Far Eastern market. To protect its own security and its overseas interests, the United States does not want to give up any military advantages. Therefore, its concern for Far Eastern politics is intensifying due to the development of transportation and the increase in commerce. From San Francisco to Hong Kong, the journey has been shortened from twenty days to six days with the use of airplanes. If the airship plan succeeds, the distance across the Pacific will be reduced from six days to four days. Everything in the Far East is brought closer to the United States' eyes through airplanes and airships. It wants to remain aloof from Far Eastern politics and adopt a non-interference attitude, but it is practically impossible. Whoever controls the Pacific advantage will become the leader of the world. The United States is actively striving for the throne of the Pacific. We can see from the American airship plan that the so-called isolationist neutral policy is just a naive argument. If something happens in the Pacific, the United States will be the most important player.

Dr. Kong is the 75th generation descendant of the sage Confucius, and his life's work is to promote China's construction and modernization. The recent reorganization of the Central Bank and the implementation of the legal tender policy are particularly noteworthy. Furthermore, in terms of China's foreign relations, if China wants to establish its prestige and credit abroad, it must ensure that all of China's foreign debts are repaid on time with principal and interest. During his tenure as Minister of Finance, Kong was able to repay all foreign debt principal and interest when due. Therefore, all foreigners are happy to provide China with capital assistance. This is naturally dependent on foreign capital assistance when China's own domestic capital strength is not yet sufficient." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 5th)

### Air Battle During the Burial of Mola

Five Government Aircraft Shot Down, Government Forces Gain Advantage on Land

⊙Hengtai Today, several American-made pursuit planes from the government forces flew to the rebel front in the air to scout at the time when the rebels held a Mass for the late General Mola.

### Deceased Oil Tycoon's Estate Worth 25 Million US Dollars

Income Tax Approximately 19 Million US Dollars

⊙White Plains, USA The method of disposal of the entire estate of the late oil tycoon Rockefeller, worth 25 million US dollars, has been announced today. In the third codicil to his will in October 1943, all the income from the estate will be inherited by his niece, Margaret. According to Margaret, the least known of Rockefeller's clan, is the Marchioness of Guevara of Spain and has two children. Today's announcement of the will is surprising. However, in the codicil, Rockefeller also stated that he had long provided for other descendants. The estate is now managed by the trustee, and the income is received by Margaret or her descendants or the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. If the total value of the estate is indeed 25 million US dollars, the federal government will receive more than 15 million US dollars in inheritance tax, and the New York state government will receive more than 4 million US dollars. The trustee will be able to manage only more than 5.5 million US dollars. (National News Agency dispatch on the 5th)

### Germany and Italy's Reply to England on the Spanish Question

Oppose Prior Consultation Among the Four Countries, Still Cooperate to Ensure Safety

[Berlin] According to well-informed sources, the German government sent a reply to the British government today regarding the security of surveillance ships. The content can be divided into the following points: ㊀ Germany unreservedly supports the establishment of a safe zone. ㊁ Germany acknowledges that the safety of surveillance ships should be guaranteed by both sides of the Spanish Civil War. The British government can request the Spanish Nationalist government to guarantee not to attack warships of various countries engaged in surveillance work, but Germany cannot fully trust the guarantee provided by the "Valencia Red Committee." ㊂ If a surveillance ship is attacked, Germany believes that the existing system where the commanders of the naval fleets of England, France, Germany, and Italy stationed in Spanish waters must conduct consultations is insufficient, and this consultation process is inevitably too slow. Therefore, Germany advocates that if any participating surveillance warship is attacked for violating international law, it should be allowed to take legitimate self-defense measures on its own. The fleet commanders of each country may take retaliatory measures on their own. In addition, the German reply repeatedly stated that Germany hopes to resume the surveillance work of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and resolve the bombing incident of the Deutschland. It is reported that before Germany issued this note, it had obtained the consent of the Italian government in advance. Political figures believe that Germany's opinion is nothing more than to establish a relationship of joint consistency among the countries participating in surveillance, and hope that the British government can fully understand this. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 5th)

[Berlin] The content of the German reply on the British proposal is quite optimistic. The British side seems to be studying the reply and then conducting negotiations. However, the Soviet Union's opposition has a significant influence on France, and there still seems to be obstacles in the future. (National Seafarer's Telegram on the 6th)

[Rome] Foreign Minister Count Ciano met with the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, this morning, and stated the views on guaranteeing the safety of warships participating in surveillance in Spanish waters. This statement is the Italian government's reply. According to well-informed sources, the content of the Italian reply is completely consistent with the reply sent by the German government yesterday. According to responsible persons, Ciano told Drummond that Italy was very pleased to hear that England suggested limiting participation in naval surveillance to England, France, Germany, and Italy. This should be put on record. However, Italy opposes the British suggestion that the fleet commanders of the participating surveillance countries should consult each other before taking retaliatory action in the event of an incident. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 5th) ⊙Valencia, Spain Since receiving the request from the Non-Intervention Committee to uphold humanitarian principles in the civil war, the Minister of the Army sent a reply to the committee today, implying that the Spanish government has the right to retaliate. The reply stated, "Regarding the horrors of aerial warfare, the only way to follow is to deal with the enemy with equal or more severe methods. This is a method of fighting poison with poison and terror with terror." (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 6th)

Will Meet with Hitler

[Vienna] According to official announcements, the German Ambassador to Austria, Franz von Papen, has departed for Regensburg, Germany, to attend a concert in the city, in order to take the opportunity to meet with German leader Hitler. It is reported that Hitler and Papen will discuss the recent war of words in the German and Austrian newspapers and the speech delivered yesterday by the Archbishop of Vienna, Theodor Innitzer. Archbishop Innitzer's speech stated that the anti-religious movement promoted by Germany is detrimental to the reputation of the German nation.

Men Serve on the Battlefield; Women Manage the Rear

[Berlin] The German Air Defense Association held its fourth anniversary meeting in an open-air theater today. Prussian Prime Minister and Aviation Minister General Hermann Göring said in his speech that where blood has been shed, it cannot be corrected with ink; therefore, only bloodshed can deal with bloodshed. If others consider Germany to be contemptible, the recent facts show that Germany can still stand out. (National News Agency, 5th)

Millions of gas masks for general civilian use have been manufactured and are being sold on the market. Staff members of the Air Defense Association conduct regular drills on the use of gas masks. Göring continued by mentioning the bombing of the German cruiser "Deutschland," saying, "In the past, Germany could be intimidated and succumb, but now that is not the case. Germany can now be in charge of its own affairs. If Germans are subjected to bloodshed, it cannot be compensated with ink, but should be repaid with cannons." In addition, Göring also said that if a war breaks out, men should serve on the battlefield, and women should be responsible for air defense in the rear. "Our German ancestors, thousands of years ago, defended the homeland and resisted Rome, and were known for their heroism throughout the world. Today, we should also emulate the spirit of our ancestors. After the men sacrifice themselves, the women should continue to fight. Not only should German men not act like weak women, but women should also have the spirit of courageously killing the enemy." (Central News Agency, Havas, 5th)

### National Defense Funds (10)

—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shu Di

(5) Mr. Yan Xishan Answers Three Questions: The defensive war of resistance in Suiyuan last year was an epoch-making battle in the history of the Chinese nation's revival. This has become a universally accepted assessment. At that time, in the rear, there was a vast national populace as the backing; at the top, there were various central authorities as the focus; and on the line, the actual heroic fighters were the tens of thousands of armed compatriots and the generals responsible for command whom our entire nation respects. Shortly after this war, I came to Shanxi. Naturally, I held Mr. Yan Xishan, the highest authority of Jin-Sui who strongly advocated "defending the territory and resisting the enemy" and sacrificed his family to relieve the nation's difficulties, in the highest esteem. This was my first intention in meeting Mr. Yan in Taiyuan this time: to express my respect.

However, since the Suiyuan war came to a close at the end of last year, followed by the Xi'an Incident, the front lines have been relatively quiet for the past few months. The focus of the national attention on the national defense front lines has also shifted: from military action to national defense preparation. Therefore, regarding Shanxi, which has the most solid foundation and the most active preparations, I believe that everyone's attention must be focused on these three questions: (1) What is the highest guiding principle for national defense? (2) What is the state of the popular organization and training as a preparatory stage for general mobilization? (3) To what extent has the preparation of material resources reached? Detailed reports on these various facilities are very necessary for the people of the whole country, but what is especially necessary is to listen to the sentiments and ambitions of the highest authorities in charge of all this in these areas. This was my second intention in meeting Mr. Yan.

However, in order to make it easier for readers to understand the meaning of the terms used in Mr. Yan's conversation with me, I will first briefly explain that the highest guiding principle of the Shanxi authorities for the first point mentioned above is the so-called "breaking through the regular scope and accelerating self-strengthening," and the method is to "increase the budget." Under what social conditions can the goal be achieved? Therefore, there are two proposals: "distribution according to labor" and "property securities." These are consistent and systematic theories. For the second and third points, what attracts the most attention of the people of the whole country are: the former is the organizations such as the "Advocating Justice Corps" and the "Sacrifice to Save the Nation Alliance," and the various popular movements advocated by the authorities; the latter is the various industrial and commercial constructions in recent years.

The time was around 10 a.m. on April 5 of this year, and the location was the reception room of the Director of the Pacification Headquarters in Taiyuan. Mr. Yan Xishan, the highest authority of Jin-Sui, met with me. A friend of mine was also present.

I first expressed my respect to Mr. Yan. Then, Mr. Yan mentioned the enthusiasm of the people in the press at the "Suiyuan War of Resistance Martyrs Commemoration Conference" held not long ago and expressed his praise and gratitude. Then, I presented the following three questions one by one and asked for answers. He answered each of them in detail with a very kind and sincere attitude. I did not take notes on the words and sentences at the time, and I have not had the opportunity to ask Mr. Yan to review the records here; therefore, what is recorded below is from my post-event notes. I believe that the general meaning is not greatly different. In order to focus the impressions of the readers, I will still record it in a question-and-answer format below. The arrangement of the words and sentences is entirely from me. This should be stated first.

I asked: "I have already read Mr. Yan's plan to 'break through the regular scope and accelerate self-strengthening,' the method of 'increasing the budget,' and the proposals of 'distribution according to labor' and 'property securities.' Everywhere there is a scientific and practical basis, and I am truly impressed! However, it seems that, judging from the current situation, it may be quite difficult to implement it on a national scale. It is rumored outside that your province has already planned to try it out first. Then, according to Mr. Yan's intention, are you prepared and is it possible to try it out first in your province?"

"No!" Mr. Yan answered decisively. "The 'distribution according to labor' and 'property securities' that you mentioned are just my personal proposals. Whether these two proposals can be implemented depends on the research of everyone in the country. Why did I propose these two proposals? The main purpose is still to enrich the country and strengthen the army. Because our China has suffered from the malpractice of being careless and irresponsible for nearly two thousand years. Compared with the great powers, the national strength is far behind. Now, to save the country from danger, the most important thing is to catch up with others. However, while we are catching up, the speed of others' progress is much faster than ours. Therefore, if we use regular methods, I am afraid that we will always be left behind. That is why I proposed the slogan of 'breaking through the regular scope and accelerating self-strengthening.' How can this goal be achieved? Therefore, I proposed the method of 'increasing the budget.' At the same time, according to my research, all the great powers in the world today have only two economic systems: one is the capitalist society represented by the United States, Japan, and other countries; the other is the socialist society represented by the Soviet Union. For the former, the possible limit for increasing the national budget is at most four times in ten years. For example, the budget of the United States in 1926 was 35 billion US dollars, and in 1936, it increased to 76 billion US dollars; for Japan, the budget in 1926 was 15 billion Japanese yen, and this year, it is about 30 billion Japanese yen. One increased by more than two times in ten years; the other increased by less than one time in ten years. However, for socialist countries, the possible limit for increasing the budget in ten years can reach seventeen times. For example, the Soviet Union, in 1926, its budget was 5.1 billion rubles, and in 1936, it reached 78 billion rubles, and in 1937, it can reach 98 billion rubles, an increase of seventeen times in ten years. These are completely in line with my research and estimates. If our country takes the path of capitalist countries, it will be difficult to catch up with the United States, Japan, and other great powers; even if we take the path of socialism, it will be difficult to catch up with the Soviet Union. Therefore, I have researched another way to catch up with the great powers, which is the 'distribution according to labor' and 'property securities' that you just mentioned. Under these two systems, the national budget can be increased by more than 55 times in ten years. I think that without doing so, it is difficult to elevate the country to the ranks of wealth and strength. Recently, most people in the country are talking about ways to catch up, and these are just my proposals. Also, there is one more point, that is, recently people have been researching the wealth and strength of the country, often only paying attention to the United States, Japan, and other countries, while neglecting the Soviet Union. ×× is our current great enemy, but thinking about the future, we should also pay attention to the Soviet Union.

### Yang Yongtai Assassination Case: Court Holds Collegial Panel Hearing

Minister Jiang was shot at last year. Prosecutor investigates as an ancillary matter. The case has concluded its debates and will be pronounced after deliberations.

Hankou Aviation News. The Criminal Division of the Wuchang District Court held a collegial panel hearing at 9:00 AM on the 4th to publicly try the Yang Yongtai assassination case. Military police were stationed inside and outside the court as before. From 7:00 AM, those requesting to attend the hearing arrived in droves. Many additional seats were temporarily added to the audience area. At 9:05 AM, Criminal Division Chief Liu Xianji, alongside judges Wang Zhaoji and Yue Shutang, prosecutor Zhu Chengzan, and clerk Shi Gujing, took their seats in the first courtroom. All representatives of the plaintiff, the Yang Yongtai family, their private attorney Xie Shengkan, the defense attorneys selected by the defendant Liu Luyin, Wang Zhaoxiang, Zhang Guoen, and Gong Bozhou, the defense attorney selected by Yang Qixin, Zhou Qiyou, the defense attorney selected by Wen Maoguan, Geng Yigong, the defense attorneys selected by Nie Jingquan, Chen Bangben and Yin Shaoliang, and the court-appointed attorney for Cheng Xiechao, Hu Sijiang, and the attorneys for Cao Bingrong and Li Qunjian, Xiao Buyun, also arrived on time and took their seats in the attorneys' area. At 9:15 AM, Judge Liu Xianji ordered the defendants Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, Yang Qixin, Cao Bingrong, Li Qunjian, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan to be brought to the court and seated in the defendant's area. Liu Luyin was still wearing his old flannel suit and appeared sickly due to the oppressive and hot weather. Cheng Xiechao was still wearing his grass-green military uniform with shackles on his feet. After someone ordered him to remove his military uniform, he also sat in the defendant's area. Judge Liu then questioned Liu Luyin and the other eight defendants about their names, ages, native places, addresses, family situations, education levels, and property amounts. He then asked prosecutor Zhu Chengzan to explain the gist of the indictment, briefly explaining the criminal acts of the defendants Liu Luyin and the other eight, and stated that he was now ordered by the High Prosecutor's Office to also conduct an ancillary investigation into the shooting of Minister Jiang's car in Beijing on October 10th of last year. Judge Liu then held a public trial. According to Liu Luyin's statement, he had not only not committed the crime of inciting murder in the Yang Yongtai case, but he had never even dreamed of such a thing. He said that he had followed the Premier in the revolution for many years, and his work had always been in the field of writing and had never held actual political responsibility. He had always been indifferent to fame and fortune, which is why he was willing to sacrifice his positions as Minister of Propaganda and Vice President of the Examination Yuan to travel south and work for the unity of the Party and the country. Since he was indifferent to fame and fortune, there was no question of him competing with others for power and profit. He had been in the Party for more than 20 years, and although he had not achieved anything, he had always loved the Kuomintang and believed in the Central Government, especially in Chairman Jiang, whom he loved and believed in even more. After the Xi'an Incident last year, he was very worried about Chairman Jiang's safety. He did not advocate military conquest and published a speech in the Hong Kong newspapers. As for his friendship with Yang Yongtai, if Yang's family had financial difficulties, he could find ways to help them out of personal friendship, but he was not legally obligated to do so. From the above, he proved that he had nothing to do with the Yang Yongtai assassination case and that his love for Chairman Jiang was genuine because Chairman Jiang was a follower of the Premier and an important person responsible for the Central Government, proving that he had never participated in the work of investigating Chairman Jiang's whereabouts. At this point, Liu Luyin declared to the court that he would ask attorneys Wang Zhaoxiang and Zhang Guoen to defend him on legal matters because he was a little sick and would leave the court first.

Next, according to Cheng Xiechao's confession, he joined the assassination organization in April of last year. When he assassinated Yang Yongtai on October 25th, he fired two shots. Gong Bozhou was also present at the time of the assassination and also took a gun and fired. He also met Cao Bingrong in front of the People's Office and nodded slightly, but he did not know whether Cao Bingrong participated. The court took out the pistol used in the assassination from the stolen goods warehouse and asked Cheng Xiechao, "Is this the gun you used in the assassination?" Cheng replied, "Yes, it is."

Next, according to Gong Bozhou's confession, he did not know about the assassination organization. He only came to Hankou to ask Yang Xiaoming for money. He did not buy a pistol in Nanjing. Yang Xiaoming gave him 70 yuan in Shanghai, of which 10 yuan was used to buy a "Dong Piao" ticket. He took the money and returned to Nanjing to recuperate. In May of last year, he went to Xingzi County with Yang Qixin to see a friend, but he did not go to Lushan to investigate Chairman Jiang's whereabouts because he caught a cold on the road and became ill when he arrived in Xingzi County. He did go to Wutaishan Village Park in Nanjing. He refused to admit to the assassination of Yang Yongtai. Yang Xiaoming showed him a photo of Yang Yongtai in a room in the Nanjing Hotel with Fan Qishu and Liang Jiubao. If Cheng Xiechao's statement about assassinating Yang Yongtai was true and he was present and fired a gun, how could no one have seen it at the time? He also did not know about the shooting of Minister Jiang's car in Beijing on October 10th of last year. When Gong Bozhou confessed, he spoke hesitantly and unclearly, and he repeatedly quibbled with his previous confessions, which caused the judges a great deal of trouble.

Next, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Li Qunjian, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan were questioned, and their confessions were the same as those given to the investigation court. They all stated that they did not know about the shooting of Minister Jiang's car in Beijing on October 10th of last year. However, after Li Qunjian finished his confession, he burst into tears and submitted a written defense to the court. After finishing his confession, he also claimed to be ill and requested to leave the court, leaving his attorney to defend him.

At this point, the attorneys for each defendant were ordered to stand up and defend their clients in turn. ⑴ Wang Zhaoxiang, the attorney selected by Liu Luyin, stated that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the defendant Liu Luyin had committed a crime. The purpose of the special agent plan approved by Liu was to eliminate traitors and had nothing to do with the Yang case. The doctrine referred to in the plan was of course the Three Principles of the People. The doctrine of training members was to train members in the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, loyalty, righteousness, harmony, and peace, and there was absolutely no implication of assassination. Furthermore, the words "Approve two thousand yuan per month to be remitted by Ru Yun" had no implication of inciting murder. At that time, Liu Luyin was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the People's Sports Association. Liu did not affix his seal or signature after the approval, nor did he indicate the date, which shows that the approval was based on someone else's dictation. Moreover, five or six days later, he went to Shanghai to work with Mr. Wang Liangchou on Party unity. The eleven words in the approval cannot be used as evidence of the crime of inciting murder. Secondly, Neng Lu's written confession was not made just once, and each time the written confession contained the statement that he was dispatched by someone to discuss the matter, which shows that his will was not free. Since Xiao Ruoxu had no suspicion of participating in the assassination, the prosecutor had already given a disposition of non-prosecution. Even if there was an assassination group, Xiao Ruoxu did not participate, so how could he know that there was an assassination organization? Moreover, Xiao Ruoxu had already made a report in the investigation court and repeatedly stated that his written confession was written under duress and in a state of unfreedom due to fear of being tortured. If Liu Luyin was added to the Standing Committee of the People's Sports Association because he was deemed to be disrupting order, then it would be even more arbitrary to say that the organization of the People's Sports Association was in accordance with the Premier's will and intended to awaken the people. The special agent team was directly controlled by the People's Sports Committee and indirectly controlled by the Kuomintang, and it could not be concluded that it was a society whose purpose was to commit crimes. Therefore, this point cannot be established. Furthermore, the crime of preparing to incite murder is the crime of creation. Now, the special agent team was not created by Liu Luyin, but was an inherent organization. Cheng Xiechao's assassination of former Chairman Yang had no relationship with the special agent team at all. Moreover, the other one thousand criminals were not members of the special agent team, and Liu Luyin had absolutely no intention of assassinating Yang, which does not meet the standards of the crime of creation. Therefore, the court should declare Liu Luyin innocent and reject the private prosecution of the family of former Chairman Yang. Secondly, Zhang Guoen, the attorney selected by Liu, also stood up and defended his client, explaining that Liu Luyin had nothing to do with the Yang case. ⑵ Hu Sijiang, the attorney appointed by the court, stood up to defend Cheng Xiechao, saying that Cheng Xiechao's motive and purpose for committing the crime stemmed from a mistaken patriotic idea, and asked the court to reduce the sentence. ⑶ Lin Hengyuan, the attorney selected by Gong Bozhou, stood up and said that Gong Bozhou denied buying a pistol. Gong and Yang Xiaoming were relatives and borrowed money.

Although Gong had been to Xingzi County, he did not go to Lushan to investigate Chairman Jiang's whereabouts. Going to Wutaishan Village Park in Nanjing was also a purely recreational activity. Gong did not assassinate at the same time as Cheng Xiechao because Cheng Xiechao fired two shots, and former Chairman Yang only suffered two gunshot wounds. There is no other evidence to prove that Gong took Cheng Xiechao to Wuchang to assassinate former Chairman Yang twice, but according to Cheng Xiechao's confession, Gong Bozhou was late and missed the opportunity, which shows that Gong did not participate in the assassination. ⑷ Xiao Buyun, the attorney appointed by the court, defended Cao Bingrong and Li Qunjian. Cao Bingrong's act of marking Cheng Xiechao was not admitted by Cheng Xiechao. Since Cheng and others had been in Wuhan for a long time and were familiar with the terrain, there was actually no need for Cao Bingrong to mark the target or act as a lookout. Resisting the enemy and eliminating traitors is one thing, and whether there is an assassination organization is another. The investigation should not be carried out in detail. As for Li Qunjian, he was delivering letters for Yang Xiaoming as a private matter, and he was young and ignorant. Since there is no evidence to prove that there is an assassination organization, how can he be charged with a crime? ⑸ Zhou Qiyou, the attorney selected by Yang Qixin, said that Yang Qixin's behavior before August of last year was a mechanical act of writing letters for Gong Bozhou under environmental pressure. He joined the revolutionary corps as a member, but did not complete the formal procedures and should be declared innocent. ⑹ Chen Bangben, Yin Shaoxian Wen Maoguan, and Geng Yigong, the previous attorney of Nie Jingquan, defended Nie and others. Buying a gun was not an intentional act. The principals were all soldiers and had passports for self-defense purposes. Fan Qishu requested to be released on bail.

Finally, Xie Shengkan, the private attorney for the family of former Chairman Yang, stood up and demanded that Liu Luyin and others be held liable for compensation for the Yang family's maintenance and condolence money, and hoped that all the criminals would be punished to the full extent of the law. The debate ended at 2:00 PM and the court was adjourned. The court held a deliberation meeting to discuss the case yesterday afternoon, and the verdict will be pronounced today.

### Japan's Quasi-Wartime Industrial Development in Northeast Advances Rapidly

Plant oil production exceeds one million catties per day. Large factory established in Fuxin to manufacture petroleum.

Tokyo Newsletter. Conflicts between Japanese political parties and parliament have garnered significant attention from the press here, and people in our country are also closely following the development of this issue. In reality, this is merely a superficial problem. Regardless of who forms the cabinet in Japan, while their policies towards China may tend to change in method, the ultimate goal remains to advance along the original, consistent policy. People in our country must first recognize this to gain insight into Japanese politics. The most important undertaking for Japan at present is the "quasi-wartime issue," which is even more crucial than Japanese political turmoil. A certain Japanese individual has thoroughly investigated the "Manchurian" quasi-wartime industry and submitted a report to relevant parties in Tokyo. The contents are excerpted below:

Chemical Industrial Products

There are very few specialized factories for pharmaceutical products in "Manchuria." Only sulfuric acid and nitric acid are manufactured by the "Manchuria" Industrial Company, with the former producing 6,500 tons and the latter 1,000 tons. Hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfide are manufactured by the Sankyo Company and the Kanmo Industrial Factory. The equipment of the Sankyo Company can produce three and a half tons of hydrochloric acid per day. The manufacturing facilities include the Kanmo Shoten Dalian Branch Pharmaceutical Factory, the Sankyo Company, the "Manchuria" Pharmaceutical Company, the Kanmo Industrial Factory, and the Fengtian Acid Manufacturing Company, the Fushun Coal Mine Sulfuric Acid Factory, etc. The remainder are byproducts of other industries. The main products are sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium sulfide, ammonium nitrate, oxygen, etc. The current sulfuric acid manufacturers include the Showa Steel Works, the "Manchuria" Chemical Industrial Company, the Fushun Coal Mine Sulfuric Acid Factory, and the Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company, etc. The capacity of these factories is 873 tons per day. With factories currently being expanded, the daily output could reach 930 tons once completed, demonstrating the Japanese dedication to developing the "Manchurian" chemical industry. The production volume of each factory since Showa 6 (the September 18th Incident) is recorded below:

Sodium hydroxide production is two and a half tons per day. The Kanmo Industrial Factory produces 45,000 bottles of hydrochloric acid per month and 70,050 bottles of sodium sulfide. Oxygen is manufactured by the Dalian Oil and Fat Industrial Company, the Dalian Machinery Manufacturing Plant, and the Fengtian Oxygen Manufacturing Company, etc. In terms of factory equipment, the Dalian Oil and Fat Industry produces 560,000 koku per year, the Dalian Machinery Manufacturing Plant 380,000 koku, and the Fengtian Oxygen Manufacturing Company 600,000 koku at its Fengtian factory and approximately 86,000 koku at its Harbin factory.

Plant Oil Production Volume

The most significant plant oil is soybean oil. There are 319 oil press factories in Southern Manchuria and 48 in Northern Manchuria, totaling 367. The daily soybean oil production capacity is 1,779,970 catties. However, many have been shut down recently due to poor management. In Showa 10, the production of soybean cake was 3,906,333 koku, with soybean oil totaling approximately 19,816,500 catties. The next largest is perilla oil, which is manufactured by the Nisshin Oil Company and the Santai Oil Mill. Production volume has increased recently. In Showa 5, it was only 5,320 tons, but it increased to 15,124 tons the following year. Recently, the Datong Pharmaceutical Industrial Company has also begun manufacturing perilla oil and peppermint oil, etc.

Mineral Oil Manufacturing Methods

The main mineral oil is cottonseed oil. The "Manchuria" Petroleum Company refines gasoline, kerosene, light oil, and machine oil, etc., with an annual output of 120,000 tons. The Fushun Coal Mine Oil Plant produces 66,000 tons of heavy oil, 20,000 tons of crude wax, and 24,000 tons of gasoline annually. Since last year, there have been plans to increase production by extracting 300,000 tons of crude oil, producing 20,000 tons of crude wax, 14,000 tons of kerosene, 15,000 tons of cracked gasoline, and 5,000 tons of straight-run gasoline. Regarding coal liquefaction, the "Manchuria" Oil and Chemical Industry Company was established last year with a capital of 2.5 million yuan. The company is located in Sipingjie and employs the oilification method invented by Mr. Kuroi Chiyokichi, a Japanese steel technician. The first production plan is to manufacture 10,000 tons of gasoline from 100,000 tons of raw coal per year. The coal liquefaction research being conducted by South Manchuria Railway requires an investment of 1.6 million in capital to establish a new factory in Fushun. Powerful Japanese capitalists centered around the "Manchuria" Coal Mine have joined together to establish a large factory in Fuxin, with plans to produce 200,000 tons of petroleum per year, demonstrating the Japanese dedication to developing national defense chemical industry.

### Suzhou

Establishing a Tap Water Company

County Magistrate Deng Xianghai, in order to improve the drinking water of citizens and emphasize public health, has joined with local figures such as Zhang Yipeng to establish a tap water company. They have negotiated with relevant parties several times and have made progress. The funds will be advanced by the Shanghai Construction Bank, and the machinery and water pipes will be supplied by the Siemens foreign firm. County Magistrate Deng specifically went to Shanghai yesterday to negotiate with the Construction Bank again. After the methods are determined, a preparatory office will be established to carry out all preparations.

Deadline for Eliminating Opium Addiction

Wu County is working very hard on opium prohibition, aiming to eliminate it entirely by the end of July next year. The county government has set a deadline of the 15th of this month for the arrest of opium addicts and private opium dealers. Those who exceed the deadline will be severely punished.

### Wuxi

Lixin Cloth Factory Strike

The Lixin Textile Dyeing Factory in this city earned more than 2 million yuan last year, and the workers should have received 160,000 yuan in bonuses, including 48,000 yuan for the workers. However, the bonuses have not been paid, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. More than 7,000 workers went on strike and demonstrated on the evening of the 5th, assaulting police officers and destroying the accounting office and staff dormitories. The factory director, Long Fei, persuaded the workers and promised to negotiate the workers' demands with the capitalists on behalf of the Party and government, so the case may be resolved satisfactorily.

### Xiaoshan

Refugees Rob Farmers

A large number of refugees arrived in Sheqian, Xiaoshan, on the first day and forcibly demanded silver and rice from the farmers. At that time, more than 100 yuan in banknotes were forcibly taken in Yulin Pass. On the second day, they went to Wenyan, where the police station sent police officer Zhang Zaixiang to suppress them and force them out of the territory. Unexpectedly, the refugees committed further robberies in Yinjiashan, losing more than 200 yuan in total. On the third day, they robbed civilian homes again in Jinxi Bridge, stealing dozens of yuan worth of rapeseed. They were then expelled from Xiaoshan by the local police.

### Dinghai

筹组渔业合作社

Shenjiamen, in Dinghai, is the fishing center of eastern Zhejiang. The total value of various fish products produced annually exceeds 10 million yuan. However, there is a lack of cooperative spirit, leading to plummeting fish prices and a decline in the fishing industry. Recently, intellectuals in the fishing industry, for the sake of control and revival, plan to unite fishermen, fish merchants, and ice merchants to organize a production and sales cooperative. After applying for registration, preparations will be made for its establishment.

### Nantong

Leveling Salt Evaporation Ponds on the Coast

Along the coast of Tong County, the Xiaoyanggang Huaidong Village area has many salt evaporation ponds like a honeycomb. Villagers privately produce salt, which hinders official sales. The Huainan Tax Police Bureau sent personnel to lead police to destroy all the salt evaporation ponds and sent a tax police team to patrol Haifeng to prevent the private scraping of salty soil for salt production.

Water Police Seize Opium Trafficker

The First District Water Police Investigation Team seized a large quantity of smuggled opium on the Baofeng transport ship. The trafficker, Shen Xiaomao, was arrested on the spot with 257 taels of opium. The opium was hidden inside more than 20 cedar planks that had been hollowed out in the middle and tied together with rope at both ends to look seamless. The suspect and the evidence have been handed over to the district security command for interrogation.

### Fengxian

Robbers Brutally Torture Elderly Woman

Sun Hanxiong, a farmer in Jinyajiang Township, Fifth District, had some savings in his home, which attracted the covetousness of robbers. On the night before last, dozens of robbers suddenly arrived with guns and broke into his house, scaring the family into silence and firing shots as a warning. The Hanxiong family was completely tied up. The robbers stripped Hanxiong's elderly mother naked, hung her from the beam, tied her feet tightly with ropes, and then used cotton wool soaked in kerosene to burn between her legs to force her to hand over silver dollars. They also ransacked the house, taking all valuables. The Hanxiong family and the hanged elderly mother were only able to escape after the robbers left. After investigation, the losses were estimated to be worth more than 1,000 yuan. Hanxiong's mother, due to her old age and frailty, and because both her front and back genitalia were burned, is now unable to pass stool or urine, and her condition is quite critical.

### The Third Session of Civic Training Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday Morning

Simultaneously Held the Coaching Institute's Inauguration Ceremony; Reviewing Officers Were Commander Yang and Acting Mayor Yu; Representatives from Various Agencies Gave Sincere Words of Encouragement

The inauguration ceremony of the Cadre Coaching Institute of the Municipal Civic Training Office, and the graduation ceremony of the third session of the civic training of the Training Corps, were held yesterday morning (the 6th, at 8:00 AM) at Longhua Airport. Over ten thousand people attended, including senior officials from various agencies, representatives from various groups, trainees, and graduating team members. Details are recorded below:

Reviewing Officers

The ceremony was presided over by Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun. On both sides of the chairman's platform, there was a couplet: the first line was "Embodying soldiers in agriculture, industry, and commerce, the spirit of three generations promotes our martial prowess," and the second line was "Enlightening the people with wisdom, benevolence, and courage, ten years of education have the teachers of the past." On the viewing stands to the left and right of the chairman's platform, there was a horizontal banner on each side: the left one read "Good citizens are the foundation of good soldiers," and the right one read "Good soldiers are the model of good citizens." The arrangements were simple and the atmosphere was solemn. After the flag-raising ceremony, a military review and parade were held. The general commander was Tao Yishan, the commander of the Training Corps of the office, and the deputy commanders were Zhao Zhuzhong and Tang Huicha. The reviewing officers were Acting Mayor Yu and Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison. Accompanying them were Qiu Yangwu and Zhang Shaochen, representatives of the Training Supervision Department; Cai Jinjun, a representative of the Ministry of the Interior; Qian Dajun and Zhang Zhizhong, former education directors of the Central Military Academy, represented by Xing Zhennan; Wang Xiaoji, Speaker of the Municipal Council; Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Municipal Local Association; and Ji Tingan, Jiang Huaisu, Zhou Yongneng, Wu Guangu, and Li Xiangqi, Director of the office, and Wang Shaoqi, Deputy Director; and Ji Jian, General Commander of the Municipal Security General Corps, Wen Huazhou, General Commander of the Corps, Yue Tuanzhang, Commander of the First Corps, Jiang Tuanzhang, Commander of the First Corps, and Zhu Xia, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, as judges. The trainees and team members were all full of energy and proficient in their drills. The achievements they made in such a short period of training were truly commendable and earned thunderous applause from the audience.

Realistic Performance

Following this, the trainees were divided into eastern and western armies to conduct a combat exercise. At the sound of a bugle, the sounds of gunfire echoed, smoke filled the air, and soldiers fell forward one after another, as if facing a real enemy. Smoke bombs were released, and the vast airport was transformed into a battlefield filled with the smell of gunpowder. More than thirty female students from Guanghua High School's rescue team also performed a rescue drill. The stretcher-bearing, bandaging, and escorting were rapid and accurate, and extremely realistic. The team then performed bayonet drills, broadsword exercises, boxing defense, sword stick techniques, and the "Arhat-Subduing Demons" formation, all of which were very energetic. At around 10:00 AM, the ceremony began. The entire audience performed the rituals, and under the leadership of the Director and Deputy Director of the Civic Training Office, all team members took an oath. Mayor Yu then presented certificates.
Mayor Yu said, "Brothers, I feel very comforted and excited. In the past year or so, civic training has followed the direction indicated by our supreme leader, and with the concerted efforts of officials at all levels and everyone, although only five, six, seven, or eight thousand people are trained each session, this number is not large in proportion to Shanghai's population of more than 3.7 million. However, if we are determined to continue training for one, two, three, or even ten or twenty years, it will not be difficult to have all Shanghai citizens trained. An ancient saying goes, 'The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is solid, the state is secure,' and another saying goes, 'The people are the most important, the gods of the soil and grain are next, and the ruler is the least important.' These are words from an autocratic era, but they are meaningful because the strength of a nation lies in its people. Therefore, the first of the Three Principles of the People of the Premier is nationalism. The two phrases 'Good iron is not used to make nails' and 'Good men do not become soldiers' have misled China for more than two thousand years. Now the government has seen this and has made a great determination to change the previous erroneous views of the people and to work hard through civic training. While the quantity of civic training is important, the quality is especially important. I hope that all graduating team members today will maintain the spirit instilled by the leaders at all levels while in the team and will absolutely adhere to the tenets of the New Life Movement advocated by our supreme leader: know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; take responsibility; and observe discipline. You are citizens who have received military training, and it is especially important to know shame. As an ancient saying goes, 'Knowing shame is close to courage.' I believe that if every Chinese person knew shame, there would never be so many traitors in the three northeastern provinces and eastern Hebei. If China had no traitors, it would never be destroyed." The mayor then inspected the ranks and gave his speech. Commander Yang and representatives from various military and political officials also gave speeches. The office's Director Li gave a reply, followed by the shouting of slogans, a photo session, and adjournment.

Mayor Yu's Speech

In brief, he said, "Today is the graduation of the third session of the Shanghai Civic Training Corps, and also the inauguration ceremony of the Cadre Coaching Institute. Seeing everyone full of spirit and their movements neat and orderly, I am deeply moved. The rise and fall of a nation does not depend on the size of the army, but on whether the nation's strength is substantial. China has 400 million people, which is not few, so why are we still being bullied? The reason is that in the past, we lacked organization. No matter how many unorganized people there are, they are useless. Why are Chinese people unorganized? It is because they have been poisoned by autocratic monarchs since the Qin Dynasty, which has led to the erroneous concept that the people are often soldiers, that is, as the saying goes, 'Good iron is not used to make nails, good men do not become soldiers.' I not only hope that everyone will maintain the spirit they had while training but also hope that you will vigorously promote it to society so that all compatriots recognize their responsibility to save the country and strive to become stronger, eliminating the bad habits of being decadent, perfunctory, lazy, and complacent. Only then can they become sound citizens. Also, I hope that the students of the Cadre Coaching Institute will study hard in the short period and be able to truly undertake the work of civic training cadres in the future, laying the foundation for civic training. Finally, I hope that everyone will remember not to disappoint the government and our supreme leader."

Commander Yang's Speech

In brief, he said, "Looking at your spirit, I can tell that all the officers are very responsible and all the team members are working hard. I deeply admire civic training, which is very important for the future of the country. The future of the country depends on the strength of our people. Your responsibility is even greater after graduation. You should always keep your responsibilities in mind and not forget the hard work and teachings of Director Li and officers at all levels. At the same time, I hope that the students of the Cadre Coaching Institute will first train themselves and then train others. I also hope that you will strive for success," and so on.

Speech from the General Supervision Department

In brief, he said, "I heard in Nanjing that civic training in Shanghai is very good. Today, after seeing it in Shanghai, it is indeed well-deserved. I am very excited. Civic training can be said to be an open-air school for all our people. The principal is Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek unified China after serving as the principal of Whampoa Military Academy. Now that he is also the principal of an open-air school, he will definitely be able to complete the task of revitalizing the Chinese nation. Everyone is now a student of Chairman Chiang. Receiving certificates and medals today is a comfort for now. Supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in revitalizing the Chinese nation is a comfort for the future. I hope that after leaving the team, you will still not forget production and, on the other hand, not forget to practice," and so on.

Speech from the Ministry of the Interior

In brief, he said, "Just now, the mayor talked about the New Life Movement and said that the most important thing is that everyone must encourage each other to know shame. Those who do not know shame will become traitors and slaves to the country. What the mayor said is extremely important. To save the country, we must know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; take responsibility; and observe discipline. Foreigners say that we are an unorganized country. Why are we unorganized? It can be said that the biggest reason is the lack of discipline. An unorganized country is a country without true citizens. We must wash away this shame and start with discipline training. If our country is organized, we will not be afraid of being bullied. Constant training can achieve the goal of internal pacification and external resistance. We not only hope that everyone receives military training but also hope that everyone will strive to create a nation of people's police," and so on.

Speech from the Education Director

In brief, he said, "The slogan of any country today is the armed people because an armed people can protect their own lives on the one hand and protect the country and nation on the other. Those who study must hold a gun in one hand and a book in the other. Those who work in agriculture, industry, and commerce must also hold a gun in one hand and a hoe, tool, or abacus in the other. If such a country and nation are created, under the leadership of our leader, the work of revitalizing the nation will definitely be successful immediately," and so on.

Speaker Wang's Speech

In brief, he said, "Seeing everyone's spirit today, I deeply admire you. People say that Shanghai is a place of enjoyment, but enjoying happiness will lead to the destruction of the country. We must work hard to save the country. Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. I hope that everyone will take good care of their bodies, not be afraid of storms and rain, and not be afraid of the sun, so that they can save and defend the country," and so on.

Director Li's Reply

In brief, he said, "Today is the graduation ceremony of the third session of civic training and the inauguration ceremony of the Cadre Coaching Institute. I am grateful to Mayor, Commander, all representatives, all officials, all gentlemen, and all guests for taking the time to personally attend and give us many important instructions. We are very grateful. I, Li Xiangqi, on behalf of all the officials, students, and team members, express our acceptance and gratitude, and on behalf of all the performers and team members, I have two points to report. First, we all know that civic training is truly the only way for our Chinese nation to be self-aware, self-reliant, self-confident, self-strengthening, self-saving, and self-preserving. We are willing to permanently maintain the spirit of training and be soldiers in the revitalization of the Chinese nation. Second, we know that since the beginning of training, all team members and students have been fully empowered in terms of spirit, material, education, and academics by the instructions of the Mayor, Commander, all officials, and all gentlemen, and have been encouraged, cared for, and supported by all sectors of Shanghai, which is why we have achieved today's results. We are willing, from now on, to continue to be encouraged, instructed, cared for, and supported by everyone so that we can improve every day. In addition, I, Li Xiangqi, also have two sentences to tell all the students and team members. The first sentence is that I hope everyone will not forget the great and solemn impression of today's graduation and inauguration ceremony and will maintain the spirit of "newness, love, precision, and sincerity" as a whole, always remembering their responsibility to the country and the nation. The second sentence is that I hope everyone will bring today's spirit back to their homes, to society, and to their workplaces, giving others a good impression and a good example. They must not have any feelings of pride, exaggeration, or selfishness. In short, we must constantly exercise our bodies, strive for our studies, cultivate our morals, and always maintain our spirit to fight and sacrifice for society, the country, and the nation under the leadership of our only leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek."

### Liu Xiang Expresses Absolute Support for the Central Government

Telegram Reply to the Sichuan Fellow Countrymen Association Yesterday

The Sichuan Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai previously sent a telegram to Liu Xiang, Chairman of Sichuan Province, urging him to come to Nanjing as soon as possible to report on his duties in order to dispel doubts, as there were rumors that Liu Xiang's attitude was different, causing concerns in all quarters. It is now learned that the association received a reply from Liu yesterday, expressing absolute support for the central government and stating that he would go to Nanjing to report to the central government as soon as his health improves. The original telegram read, "To the Sichuan Fellow Countrymen Association on Jiujiang Road, Greetings. Received the telegram from Jianri. I am sincerely grateful for the care and love of the fellow countrymen. I have always been determined to assist the central government in completing the unification. I will do everything possible to avoid anything that may cause misunderstandings.

I have also been accepting and implementing various instructions from the central government. Regarding the matter of going to Nanjing to report on my duties, it is my sincere wish. However, I have just recovered from a long illness and am weak and unused to long flights. As soon as I am a little stronger, I will still go to Nanjing to report everything in person and take the opportunity to learn from you. Thank you for your concern. I am sending a telegram to reply and express my gratitude. Liu Xiang kowtows, Dong Shengmi."

### Magnificent Architecture and Perfect Facilities; Qiujiang Pier to Open on the 10th

Grand Ceremony Awaits President Kong's Return to Host; Changxing's Japanese Empress to Make Maiden Voyage; Business Management and Transportation Facilities Planned and Ready

The Qiujiang Pier, built by the Central Bank, is the most modern cargo transfer facility in the East. Construction began in June of last year and the first phase of the project has now been completed after a year. It is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month. The official opening ceremony will be held after President Kong returns to the country. Details are as follows:

Construction Background

Pier business is closely related to international trade. Countries with developed commerce all build complete piers in their commercial centers to facilitate the loading and unloading of import and export goods. Shanghai is China's trade center, but it lacks this new construction. Therefore, the Central Bank purchased land at the mouth of the Qiujiang River in the Yinjiang District to invest in the construction of the Qiujiang Pier. The shoreline of the river mouth is long and straight, and the river water is deep and wide, making it more convenient for ships to travel back and forth than other river basins. Song Ziliang, Chen Jian'an, Ye Zhuochang, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Keting, Zhang Gongquan, and Chadley were hired as pier construction committee members. The committee designed the building, and President Kong personally presided over the groundbreaking ceremony on June 20, 1936, and construction began immediately. It has now been a year, and the first phase of the project has been completely completed.

Perfect Equipment

The pier is located at the mouth of the Qiujiang River, north of the Huangpu River, and is approximately 1,500 feet long. Since construction began, the entire first-phase plan has been completed, including two piers, each 590 feet long, with a small port in the middle for berthing barges, and two warehouses, each 220 feet long and 130 feet wide, with two floors. There are four cranes, two inclined rollers, one one-ton and one six-ton elevator, and one hundred and fifty sliding cars. There is a large two-story office building, with the pier office on the upper floor and the customs inspection office and passenger reception room on the lower floor. There are also two temporary iron-roofed flat warehouses for short-term storage of goods, each 220 feet long and 80 feet wide. There are also three beams that run directly to the pier deck. The total warehouse capacity is approximately 15,000 tons of cargo, which is loaded and unloaded by cranes directly to any floor of the warehouse. The equipment is very perfect.

Opening Business

After the completion of the pier project, Ling Xianyang, manager of the Qiujiang Pier Business Management Office, and Chen Zikang, assistant manager, actively prepared and arranged the interior, which is now ready. It is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month. The grand opening ceremony will be held after President Kong returns to the country to preside over it, in order to show solemnity. Regarding the development of the pier business, it has also been decided that: ㊀ workers on the pier will be hired and trained through the workers' management committee; ㊁ the cost of trucks and barges for loading and unloading goods can be subsidized by the pier; two cars will be prepared to drive five or six times a day to pick up and drop off customers who want to see the goods for free; ㊂ passenger transportation and luggage matters will be entrusted to China Travel Service to handle, with a charge of 30 cents per piece for pickup and 40 cents per piece for delivery, and delivery can be made within one hour at the latest; and it has been agreed that Silver Taxi will pick up and drop off passengers for only one yuan per trip. At the same time, it has been agreed with China Bus Company and Shanghai Ferry Company to pick up and drop off passengers in advance whenever a ship arrives.

Maiden Voyage

Qiujiang Pier is the most modern pier in the East with perfect equipment. While the project was in progress, various shipping companies approached the pier's business office to arrange berthing procedures. It has now been decided that the first ship to make a maiden voyage to the pier will be the Japanese Empress of British Changxing Company. At that time, people from all walks of life will be invited to visit. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the Philippines on the 13th of this month and stay for one day before sailing to Vancouver, USA, the following morning. The second ship will be the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso, which will arrive in Shanghai from Europe on the 21st of the same month. Both of these ships are large international liners and have agreed with the pier to berth there on a long-term basis. Other shipping companies such as Dale, Java, and Mosti have also contacted the pier one after another to discuss berthing in order to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation.

Convenient Transportation

There are three transportation routes to the pier: ㊀ from Wuquan Road to Jungong Road to Yangshupu Road; ㊁ from Wuquan Road through the city center to Qimei Road to Diswei Road; ㊂ from Wule Road through the city center to Jiangwan Road to North Sichuan Road. Cars can travel directly on all of these routes in less than twenty minutes. China Bus Company will change the route of Route 6 from the 10th of this month to run through the city government to the pier. The fare for the entire route, which connects with Special Zone Route 9 Bus and Routes 4 and 5 of the company, is 41 cents. When foreign ships berth, special buses will be dispatched from the Baoshan Road intersection at a cost of 10 cents per person. Transportation can be described as convenient.

### Shanghai Dharma Treasure Museum Holds Tea Party

Li Qiqing and Guan Jiongzhi Enthusiastically Donate; Great Compassion Dharma Master Delivers Important Remarks

The Shanghai Dharma Treasure Museum held a tea party the other day at the Buddhist Jingye Society's Xiangguang Hall to raise funds and solicit arrays of goods. Invitations, appointment letters, donation books, and regulations were sent out in advance. Details are as follows:

Appointment of Committee Members

㊀ Respected Sir, In recent years, Buddhist undertakings have become increasingly prosperous, but there is no dedicated institution for the collection and exhibition of sutras and Dharma objects. In order to meet the needs and fulfill our responsibilities, we have built a Dharma Treasure Museum within the Buddhist Jingye Society in Shanghai Jueyuan. Although the building has been completed, the internal construction and maintenance require a great deal of funding. We are continuing our efforts to seek the compassion and sympathy of those who share our aspirations. We have long admired your pure vows and enthusiasm for benefiting all, and we hope that you will grant your blessings to our museum's establishment and growth. The first board meeting of our museum has publicly elected you as a member of the fundraising committee. We hereby send you a special letter of appointment and respectfully request that you accept the appointment, creating auspicious causes and eternally completing the pure karma. The fundraising methods are detailed in the enclosed booklet, which we hope you will review.

㊁ Respected Sir, In recent years, Buddhist undertakings have become increasingly prosperous, but there is no dedicated institution for the collection and exhibition of sutras and Dharma objects. In order to meet the needs and fulfill our responsibilities, we have built a Dharma Treasure Museum within the Shanghai Jueyuan Buddhist Jingye Society. Although the building has been completed, there are many classic images and all kinds of Dharma objects that have been scattered for decades and over tens of thousands of miles, and we urgently need to find ways to collect them. We are afraid that our strength is insufficient, and the first board meeting of our museum has ordered fifteen rules for collecting exhibits, and publicly elected you as a member of the exhibit collection committee. We have long admired your pure vows and enthusiasm for benefiting all, and we hope that you will grant your blessings to this undertaking of our museum. We hereby send you a letter of appointment and respectfully request that you accept the appointment, creating immeasurable merit.

Meeting Situation

Dozens of directors and committee members attended the meeting that day, including Ye Yufu, Guan Jiongzhi, Li Qiqing, Ding Guiqiao, Jian Yujie, Ding Guicen, Dong Hanzhi, Li Fuhou, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Qu Wenliu, Fei Fanjiu, Ding Zhonghu, He Shaoyu, Zhao Pucha, Great Compassion Dharma Master, and Yuan Ao Dharma Master. Director Ye Yufu presided over the meeting, and the museum's secretary, Qian Zhongzhi, took notes. First, the chairman reported on the museum's initiation and construction process, as well as the procedures and key points for future progress. Next, the fundraising and exhibit collection methods were discussed.

It was then resolved that:

Each committee member should raise funds within June of this year. It is estimated that the manufacture of cabinets and other items will require 10,000 yuan, and the fund will require more than 20,000 yuan. At that time, Li Qiqing pledged to donate the entire year's expenses, totaling 1,200 yuan. Guan Jiongzhi and Huang Hanzhi of Jingye Society pledged to donate eight display cabinets, totaling 1,700 yuan. In addition, He Shaoyu, Ding Zhonghu, and others also pledged to donate successively. Great Compassion Dharma Master of Liuyun Temple also delivered,

Important Remarks

Believing that the establishment of the Dharma Treasure Museum is truly an innovation in Chinese Buddhism, the vastness of China's land, the long history of Buddhism, and the dispersion and destruction of classics and Dharma objects are bound to be many, which is very painful. From now on, there will be a well-equipped and well-managed Dharma Treasure Museum to collect and preserve them, which is very fortunate. At the same time, it can also encourage various temples to pay attention. It was immediately decided that the Chinese Buddhist Association would send a letter to all temples across the country, informing them of the significance and role of the establishment of the Dharma Treasure Museum, and requesting donations of money, sutras, images, and Dharma objects.

### Yangtze River Shipping Competition

Companies Salvage Hunan Line, Fares to Sichuan Decreased in Stages

This year's shipping trend has shifted from the Yangtze River to coastal routes, so Nanyang [Southeast Asia] business has recently become very prosperous. There are more goods than ships, a lack of tonnage, and Shanghai's ship tonnage prices have soared again, increasing to 10 shillings per ton, equivalent to about 8.5 yuan in various currencies. At this time last year, the rental price per ton was only 2.5 yuan. Compared with the past, it has increased by about three times. Therefore, the five major shipping companies, Taikoo, Nissin, Jardine Matheson, etc., convened a meeting yesterday to discuss further increasing fares. In addition to the 10% increase on May 1st and June 1st, it has now been decided to increase another 10% on July 1st. The locations where the price increase will be implemented are Shanghai to Fuzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Yantai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Tianjin and other ports. On the Yangtze River, however, competition from independent [lit. "wild flag"] ships has emerged, reducing fares and causing a major blow to the six companies, which are now trying to salvage the situation and defeat this powerful competitor. This matter has a significant impact on the shipping industry, as described below:

Resisting Competition on the Shanghai-Hunan Route

Last year, Hunan's farmland had a bumper harvest, and grain was shipped to various places, greatly increasing the purchasing power of farmers. The amount of goods shipped from Shanghai to Hunan increased six to seven times compared to previous years. As a result, the shipping business along the Shanghai-Changsha route was exceptionally prosperous. The six companies competed to dispatch dedicated Jianglun [river steamer] ships to transport goods back and forth. Initially, due to the dry season in the Xiang River, making navigation difficult, freight rates increased to 110%. Until now, with the Xiang River's water level rising and the Shanghai-Hunan route clear, the accumulated goods being loaded were substantial. The six companies jointly agreed that the miscellaneous freight rate would be 15 yuan per ton. Unexpectedly, Yongtai Company suddenly chartered the Yong'an and Shenfu ships to operate routes from Shanghai to Hankou and Changsha, competing with the six companies on the Shanghai-Hunan route. Because they were not bound by the public allocation of costs, they reduced the freight rate to only 7.5 yuan per ton, only half of the six companies' rate. After the start of operations, the six companies were greatly impacted. Currently, after repeated discussions among the six companies, a decision has been made to resist. First, the Yong'an ship, chartered by Yongtai, was leased by the China Merchants Bureau in name from the shipowner, Da Zhen Shipping Company, for a monthly rental of more than 6,000 yuan, which has been successfully done. The second ship, Shenfu, is also being leased by the six companies, preventing Yongtai from operating any ships, thus eliminating this competition invisibly. It is heard that the Yong'an lease agreement has been verified by the China Merchants Bureau. This ship will likely be assigned to the Hunan route. The leasing method for Shenfu is currently being negotiated with the ship owner, Ewo [Yee Lung] Trading Company. From now on, independent ships will not be allowed to gain a foothold on the Yangtze River, whether upstream or downstream.

Sharp Decline in Sichuan Shipping

In the past three years, the Sichuan River shipping industry can be said to have reached its peak, creating the newest record since 1917. The Minsheng Company, which specializes in this route, had annual profits of more than one million yuan in these three years, while Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and others also had annual profits of tens of thousands of yuan each. The largest category of goods going from Shanghai on this route is cotton yarn. A year ago, when freight rates were at their lowest, cotton yarn was charged only three yuan per piece, or only twelve yuan per ton. Now, each piece has risen to 26 yuan, or 104 yuan per ton. Two months ago, when the Sichuan River was shallow and navigation was done in three sections, each freight charge reached more than 40 yuan. Other goods also rose to hundreds of yuan. Steel machinery even rose to more than 200 yuan per ton. During this period of extreme prosperity, a major drought occurred in Sichuan, covering dozens of counties. The purchasing power of the Sichuan people plummeted. Now, at a time when the water level is rising and the route is clear, which is normally the peak period for goods being shipped, all goods are being stopped due to the impact of the drought. There is no outbound traffic at all. Shanghai's Sichuan businesses have already stopped handling people and goods together. The business of the ships traveling on the Sichuan River has also declined sharply. Due to the shortage of outbound goods, income has been greatly reduced. The Minsheng Company has already transferred most of its ships to Yichang to transport materials accumulated on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway into Sichuan for adjustment. In recent days, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Minsheng, Nissin, Sanbei, and other six companies have held multiple meetings and decided to decrease Shanghai freight rates to Sichuan in stages. In the first stage, the price of cotton yarn will drop by eight yuan per ton, and miscellaneous goods will also drop by ten yuan. This measure has already been implemented yesterday, but some companies have privately released discounts and lowered the cotton yarn freight rate to 24 yuan per ton. However, even though freight rates have fallen, there are still no goods to load. There is a trend for further declines in the third stage.

### China Association for the Deaf and Mute Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

Chairman Hopes to Promote Deaf and Mute Education; Elected Li Dingqing, Hong Guiming, etc. as Directors and Supervisors

The China Association for the Deaf and Mute held its inaugural meeting at the Deaf and Mute School in Xiaonanmen at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than one hundred members from the Central Department of Civic Training and the City Party Committee, represented by Huang Tiren, the Social Bureau, represented by Xu Manxin, and Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places were present. Wang Xun, Sun Zuhui, and Dai Shishi were elected as the presidium. After deliberation, various proposals to promote deaf and mute careers were passed, and directors and supervisors were elected. The details are recorded as follows:

Chairman's Report

After the ceremony, Chairman Dai Shishi gave a report, stating that the association was officially established today, and he was honored to have representatives from party and government agencies and guests from all walks of life participate and provide guidance. He himself was neither deaf nor mute, and being elected as chairman was a case of "filling a position without ability." He had been engaged in deaf and mute education for more than ten years and had a considerable understanding of the psychology of the deaf and mute. At the same time, the deaf and mute had a very sincere attitude towards him in all aspects. The world thinks that the blind are pitiful, but although the blind cannot see, they can still gain a considerable understanding. The deaf and mute, due to physiological abnormalities, find it difficult to acquire knowledge, so their suffering is indeed greater than that of the blind. History shows that Zuo Qiuming in the Spring and Autumn period and the Russian poet Eroshchenko were all famous blind people, but there were almost no famous deaf and mute people. It can be seen that the deaf and mute are the most unfortunate among human beings. The number of deaf and mute people in our country is extremely large, and their symptoms can be divided into congenital and acquired, with acquired being the majority. According to a worldwide survey, deaf and mute people account for one in every thousand people. China has fewer requests for sanitation, so the number of people suffering from deafness and muteness accounts for about 450,000. The number of deaf and mute schools in the country, including the three northeastern provinces, is only about twenty, and there are even more deaf and mute people who have not received education and relief. As a result, there is very little contact between the deaf and mute. This association was founded for the sake of the happiness of the deaf and mute. Fortunately, it has been smoothly carried out with the enthusiastic support of the party and government authorities and social leaders, which is deeply gratifying. It is hoped that the government will widely establish public deaf and mute schools, popularize deaf and mute education, and recruit deaf and mute employees in state-owned factories as much as possible to save the unemployed deaf and mute. This is especially desired.

Party and Government Instructions

Then Huang Tiren, representative of the Central Department of Civic Training and the City Party Committee, gave instructions, which Dai Shishi conveyed through gestures, stating that he was deeply honored to attend the inaugural meeting of the China Association for the Deaf and Mute. He had just heard the chairman's report and knew that there were as many as 450,000 deaf and mute people in China, and that only a few of them were educated. The establishment of this association today is the prelude to seeking the happiness of the deaf and mute. He hoped that the association would uphold the spirit of mutual assistance, seek self-reliance, alleviate the suffering of the same disease, and awaken the deaf and mute compatriots across the country to unite and save themselves. Then, Xu Manxin, representative of the Social Bureau, gave a speech, stating that he was attending the Inaugural meeting of the association today, seeing that everyone could not speak and had to rely on gestures to convey their meaning, he felt very pitiful. However, due to the establishment of the association, the deaf and mute people across the country would help and unite with each other, which made him feel gratified. Facts have proved that the intelligence of the deaf and mute is not lower than that of ordinary people. In the future, with their own unity and the common support of the people of the country, they will be able to develop the cause of the deaf and mute and increase the welfare of the deaf and mute.

### Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Cables Sichuan to Reduce Land Tax

Victims Unable to Rest, Annual Collection Should Be Changed

The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association cabled Chairman Liu of Sichuan Province yesterday, saying, "Chairman Liu of Chengdu, Fu Chengxunjian, Sichuan Province has been followed by natural disasters after man-made disasters, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and everything has been exhausted. To alleviate the people's strength, we must first reduce the burden. It is heard that your budget for land tax is still set at four collections per year, plus various local surcharges, which are already more than 80%. At this time of prolonged drought, sowing is delayed, Eastern works have not been repaired, and Western harvests are hopeless. The only thing that the people rely on to pay food taxes is to sell agricultural products, but now there is nothing to sell. How can we raise money? I am afraid that the trouble of chasing and arresting in the future will be even worse than today's drought. I despise the remnants who do not die from disasters but die from taxes. Looking at the future, I can't help but feel cold. It is a common practice to collect taxes once a year. All provinces are the same, but Sichuan is uniquely different. Under the central government, it should not be uniquely different. When the Sichuan incident was just settled and the Sichuan finances were not managed, it can still be excused as a temporary period of difficulty and having to endure it. It has been three years since then, with two rounds of troop reductions and financial stability. In the midst of the inability to save the dying, we still do not hesitate to follow this huge evil system. When can we hope to abolish it? Even if the military and political expenses are related, it seems appropriate to strictly review the fraudulent expenses and reduce expenses. If it is not enough, the central government should make overall plans and act concurrently, and cannot only increase land tax as a way to make up for the budget. This is the only way that the dying victims can get a little rest. Therefore, to relieve the Sichuan disaster, no matter whether it is a temporary or fundamental solution, it is the first important strategy to stipulate that land tax will be collected once a year from the 26th year. The directors are concerned about the people's suffering and care deeply about the Sichuan disaster. The people admire them. I hope that this relief strategy will be adopted and implemented, and I dare to report it by cable. I hope that you will supervise it. The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association bows,

### Iron Lung Man Slater Left Shanghai for the United States Last Night

Left Lester Chinese Hospital at Noon, with Crowds Watching; Stopped Breathing for Two Minutes While Changing New Iron Lung

American boy patient Slater, who was treated with an iron lung for paralysis, arrived in Shanghai at 2:01 AM on the 4th of this month. After entering Lester Chinese Hospital, he left the hospital at 12:05 PM yesterday and boarded the President Coolidge to return to his country. When crossing the Huangpu River and boarding the ship at 2:00 PM, he stopped breathing for two minutes while changing to a new iron lung. He then safely entered his reserved room. At 6:15 PM, the ship weighed anchor and returned to the United States. It is expected to arrive in San Francisco on the 18th.

Stayed in Shanghai for Two and a Half Days

The iron lung man arrived in Shanghai early in the morning on the 4th and entered Lester Chinese Hospital on North Suzhou Road at 6:00 AM on the same day. He lived as usual during these two days without any abnormalities. At 12:00 PM yesterday, he left the hospital and took a truck numbered 13402 in the Shanghai Municipal Council and 16610 in the French Concession to board the Coolidge. When he came out of the hospital, there were more than 1,000 onlookers inside and outside the hospital. Slater left the room on the fifth floor at 12:05 PM and boarded the truck on a pre-arranged escalator. The motor was still moving slowly, and the speed of the car was three miles per hour.

Arrived at the New Customs at 12:30 PM

If calculated from the time he left Lester Chinese Hospital, he only stayed in Shanghai for two and a half days. The car he took was the same as when he arrived in Beijing. The colored iron lung was placed in the car, and the car was also equipped with a motor. It was reported that when he arrived at the New Customs Wharf, the Public Concession Police Department would send personnel to maintain order and prevent idlers from approaching to prevent infection. However, the workers of the Shanghai Transportation Company and the Mautai Foreign Company still did not wear masks and helped the iron lung man up and down.

Stopped Breathing When Boarding the Ship

Mr. Slater arrived at the wharf at 1:00 PM and was changed to a new iron lung by doctors and others, which was installed on the Coolidge. When Slater boarded the ship, he stopped breathing for about two minutes after leaving the old iron lung. After boarding the ship, he fell asleep in the new iron lung. At 6:15 PM, he safely set sail for the United States.

Two Doctors Talk About Ordinary Life

In addition to his parents, there were also about 20 American doctors, six Chinese nurses, and engineers on this trip. Chinese doctors Zhu Shuzhang and Cong Zhenguo from Peking Union Medical College decided to take the early express train back to Beijing this morning. According to Zhu and Cong, Slater's ordinary life is no different from ordinary people, except that he eats less. The blood in his body, apart from the paralysis, is also the same as ordinary people. After returning to the United States, there may be hope of recovery. The old iron lung will be returned to Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

### The Number of Rickshaw Thefts in the City Has Increased Daily

Eleven Vehicles Stolen in Six Days

There are 22,000 rickshaws operating in the city's Nanzha, Beite, and Huxi districts. Since the Taiping Insurance Company underwrote theft insurance from the first of this month, the gangsters who relied on stealing rickshaws and extorting money have been greatly panicked. The main leaders in this regard are Zhou Bugen, Xiao Dexi, and Xiao Changsheng in Zhabei, and Wu Er Meizi, Li Guoer, Deng Zhaozhi, Chen Xihua, and Xiao Sosan in Nanshi. They once discussed and implemented drastic measures to steal a number of rickshaws in the shortest possible time, so that the insurance company would stop insurance work and restore the previous state of stealing and redeeming. In the past five or six days, three municipal rickshaws were stolen before and after Xinmin Road and Wuzhen Road Bridge on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, and four rickshaws were stolen around the Sixteenth Bund in Nanshi. There were also many rickshaws stolen at night at four depots. Among them, most of the rubber inner and outer tires were stripped off and discarded in remote alleys, and were taken in by the local police station. The association prepared a letter to collect them on behalf of the owners and compensated according to the insurance regulations. The losses of the rickshaw pullers are very limited, but the insurance company is temporarily bearing a heavy burden. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will seriously investigate and arrest these people and send them to the vagrant work-study center to eliminate harm to the rickshaw pullers, so as not to lose the effort.

### Railway Police Falsely Report Robbery to Cover Up Shooting and Injury of Pedestrian

Falsely Reported Facts of Robbery of Gun; Weapon Has Been Certified by Pedestrian and Police Station

On the evening of the 4th of this month at around 9:00 PM, eight bandits occurred at the Talu Road Traffic Road Railway crossing in Zhabei, snatching the firearms of the railway police officer stationed there, causing the police to open fire and accidentally hit a pedestrian, Yang Yongfa, in the right leg. It was reported in the newspapers that the injured person was immediately sent to the hospital. It is now learned that at 9:00 PM that evening, when the Beijing-Shanghai Line express train arrived in Beijing, it was necessary to block pedestrians with a gate to prevent danger. When the gate had not yet been closed, several pedestrians wanted to cross the railway. The traffic police officer named Lin Mutai did not allow it, causing a conflict. In order to protect himself, the police officer fired a shot, unexpectedly hitting a pedestrian, Yang Yongfa, in the right leg. The injured person was immediately sent to the Tongren Hospital in the concession for treatment by the railway authorities. Fortunately, the injury was not fatal and there was no danger to life. At the time of this unfortunate incident, Zhao Guanying, the police officer at Post 38 of the Taiyang Temple Police Station of the Xinzha Branch Bureau, witnessed the incident at the gate on the north side of the railway and assisted in detaining two pedestrians, Zhou Hongji, i.e., Zhou Hongji, who confessed after interrogation that he was a 38-year-old Hunanese who lived at No. 3 Jiu'anli (i.e., the west side of the Taiyang Temple Police Station) on Jiaotong Road and made a living selling toothbrushes. It was verified by the patrol officer Pang Guiling that Zhou had a wife and two daughters. Zhou Hongji claimed that he was eager to return home for dinner, so he wanted to cross the railway and claimed that he was slapped in the face by the railway police officer and hit in the right thigh with the butt of a rifle, and showed bruises as evidence. However, the railway police officer knew that he had caused trouble and wanted to shirk responsibility, so he falsely reported that bandits had snatched the firearms and pointed to Zhou Hongji as a bandit, trying to bring Zhou to the railway bureau for interrogation, but the police station refused. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Xinzha Branch Bureau and then to the Police Headquarters.

### Ning Shao Steamer Innovation Benefits Gulangyu Tourists

Arriving in Xunyang Can Go Up the Mountain That Day

The old Ning Shao Express Steamer of the Ning Shao Company is a special train running on the Yangtze River.

### The Third Branch of the High Court Builds Office Buildings

Land Lease Contract Signed

The Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in the Second Special Zone of this city, i.e., the French Concession, since Mr. Yang Peng took over as president, in view of the fact that the courtrooms of the High Court III and Special Court II are self-owned properties, the offices of the two courts have been renting private houses, which has cost a lot of rent for six years. Therefore, after President Yang took office, he planned to raise funds to build new specialties and planned to build a five-story building for the office use of the High Court III and Special Court II. He reported to the Ministry of Justice for approval and planned to lease a piece of land owned by the French Public Works Bureau next to the east of the Special Court II for the construction of a new house.

### Japanese Merchants in Hongkou Oppose the Establishment of Osaka Department Store

According to the Japanese-language "Mainichi Shimbun," the famous Osaka Daimaru Department Store, in order to develop in this city, has acquired the Bigo-ya foreign firm at No. 201, Peng Road, and is scheduled to start business on July 1. Japanese merchants in this city believe that Daimaru has huge capital. If it enters this city, small retailers in Hongkou will be greatly threatened. They are currently gathering merchants to oppose the construction. However, Daimaru has already sent Manager Yoshimura and Business Director Katayama to Shanghai to prepare for the opening. According to Trade Director Hoshijima, Daimaru's establishment in Shanghai is not mainly for retail, but focuses on exports to Nanyang and Africa. The initial investment is only 300,000 yuan, with future plans for development. However, the Japanese community believes that even without a store in Shanghai, Daimaru can directly trade with Nanyang and Africa. Instead of establishing a large company on Nanjing Road to compete with foreign department stores, it is establishing a store in the Japanese-populated area of Hongkou, which hinders the business of Japanese merchants. Therefore, small stores will jointly send representatives to Osaka to oppose the establishment.

In the steerage cabin, they encountered a middle-aged woman with bound feet, holding a four or five-year-old boy. Suspecting their behavior, they questioned them separately.

His parents were alive and his father repaired rickshaws, but he could not say his home address. He also said that the floral cloth shirt and running shoes he was wearing were given to him by the woman.

### Life Saving Bureau Retrieves Nameless Male Corpse

Total of Two Cases

The Nanshi Life Saving Bureau, for nameless floating corpses retrieved from various places in the Huangpu River, typically does not need to report for inspection unless there are visible injuries. They are routinely prepared and placed in coffins for burial. The day before yesterday, the Water Police Station retrieved a male corpse from the Huangpu River. He was wearing a checkered flannel long gown, a quilted woolen jacket, white cloth trousers, and coffee-colored socks. He had no shoes, a round head, and had a silver ring, ten copper coins, twenty one-cent coins, one one-jiao bill, a key, and a membership card from the Wuxi Opera Actors Skills Research Association with a photo of Wei Fengkui, 34 years old, from Changzhou.

### Formulation and Implementation of International Labor Conventions (Continued)

— Cheng Haifeng

After a member state ratifies a convention, it must be effectively implemented. If it fails to enact laws or regulations or use other methods to make the convention effective, the country's labor unions or employers' organizations can complain to the International Labor Office. The Governing Body may notify the accused government of the complaint and request it to submit a defense. If the government fails to submit a defense within a reasonable period or if the defense is insufficient, the Governing Body may publish the complaint and the defense, subjecting it to the criticism of world opinion. Any member state that believes that another member state has not effectively implemented the conventions ratified by each other has the right to file a complaint with the International Labor Office. All such complaints shall be handled by the Review Committee.

The drafting of convention proposals is the central task of the International Labor Organization, but we cannot say that the International Labor Organization is merely an agency for formulating international labor legislation. The current major economic and social problems require the attention and resolution of the International Labor Organization. In this era of transition, various economic forces must be adjusted. What countries feel they need now is how to establish a new economic equilibrium system to reduce the current crisis and depression and bring the world to peace and prosperity. However, this problem is very broad and includes international trade, fair competition, trade of goods and labor, and international adjustment of financial values. Therefore, the establishment of a new economic equilibrium system is the biggest international problem and cannot be achieved solely by the individual efforts of countries. International cooperation with sincerity is sufficient to restore the world's economic order. This task cannot be completed in the short term, because there is no shortcut to international economic recovery. In recent years, the world situation has shown signs of recovery, the number of unemployed workers has gradually decreased, and the lives of workers have improved slightly, but there are still many reforms that need to be implemented to reach the period of prosperity. The realization of this kind of enterprise can only be completed according to the method of democracy, through free discussion and free thought or open agreements caused by conflicts of interest. This democratic method is used by the International Labor Organization to assist in the construction of a new economic and social order. The draft conventions and recommendations formulated in the past are based on objective needs and are made in a democratic way. Its implementation will permanently and universally improve the labor conditions of all countries in the world. Only after the improvement of workers' lives can world peace and prosperity be maintained. Therefore, the efforts of the International Labor Organization to protect labor legislation are not limited to improving the status of workers, but are based on social justice and aim to build universal international peace.

### After Liang Tongfang's Suicide Attempt, He Expresses Efforts to Strive

And Acknowledges the Suicide Attempt Was a Mistake

After the patriotic Liang Tongfang attempted suicide by taking poison and was rescued, all parties were concerned and went to comfort him. Mr. Liang specifically explained the error of his suicide yesterday, saying, "My suicide has aroused criticism from all parties. Among the many criticisms, there are sincere concerns, severe condemnations, and sincere comfort. I have no room for hesitation other than absolutely accepting and thanking them with all my heart. However, for the sake of many friends and advanced people from all walks of life, I am very ashamed to reveal everything today after surviving the disaster. I admit that I am a person who lacks understanding, and emotions are more important than reason in all aspects. This suicide attempt was certainly the result of a lack of reason. In my initial intention, when internal contradictions and conflicts were unsolvable, only suicide might fundamentally cut off my painful tongue. Pain that cannot express the stigmatized heart of being slandered, however, the facts tell me that this suicide is wrong, only aggravating my sins, now I am clear from now on, I will never commit suicide again, I realize that suicide is not the only way I will do my best after the disaster I will do a good job of actively saving people's lives, I know my abilities are subtle and weak, but I am now determined to live, I sincerely swear, I will live, I will reject negative ideas in the future, and decide to work hard in the field of domestic products, for the future of the Chinese nation, to do my part as a member of the Chinese nation. I hope that advanced people from all walks of life, and enthusiastic friends, forgive my past, although my pure heart has been torn by the claws of the devil, I know that in this dark blow, I must be brave and restore my original appearance, I sincerely hope here that advanced people and friends from all walks of life will give me severe supervision, I am willing to piously accept all criticisms and instructions, and at the same time, I bow with a ashamed heart to express my infinite thanks, to all the advanced people and friends who care about me."

### Silk Cocoon Business

— Lu Ping

"The Dafeng Fresh Cocoon Business is approved to open its doors on June 1."

Money has obviously been lively these days, even the tea houses and dim sum shops are much more lively than usual.

"The cocoon business has opened!"

"Oh, the cocoon business has opened, the families with cocoons to sell are so happy!"

"The silkworm season this year is not good, the price of cocoons will probably be more expensive!"

"The price of mulberry leaves is too expensive. If the cocoons don't sell for 50 yuan, it will be a loss."

Recently, on the streets, in the alleys, no matter men, women, old or young, as long as they meet, everyone will talk to each other about that issue. However, those with cocoons to sell are happy, while those without cocoons to sell are sighing. Some women are even crying because they lost money raising silkworms, and half a year's life has been in vain.

That row of white walls on the market has already been whitewashed and repaired. The four large characters "Dafeng Cocoon Business" are particularly spirited. The wooden fence door has been opened. In addition to the original shed in front of the door, a reed mat shed of about 20 feet has been temporarily built, extending all the way to the small river. The cocoon rooms inside have already been cleaned up, and the drying stoves in the cocoon drying room have also been arranged neatly. Those "local squires" are also busy there, going in and out.

On the outside pillars, like couplets in a temple, are pasted old-fashioned sayings such as "official silk cocoons and thin cocoon skin are not accepted."

On the morning of June 1st, the front of the Dafeng Cocoon Business was already crowded with cocoons in baskets. There were also many small boats loaded with cocoons in the river.

It's past eight o'clock, and the opening hasn't started yet. Looking in through the wooden fence door, it's quiet inside. Only a few coolies are arranging the carrying baskets and everything else needed.

"It's still not open yet, what a cocoon business master!"

At nine o'clock, two weighers came out and sat on the high stools. Everyone immediately rushed to send the cocoon baskets up. The coolies took them and poured them into the specially made large carrying basket. The "card watcher" first turned the cocoons over from top to bottom, then picked up a few with two fingers to pinch and see, before letting the coolie hang them on the scale hook. The weighers squinted their eyes at the balance beam, their hands blocking the weight, mechanically reporting the catties, taels, and price.

"Thirty catties, twelve yuan."

"Sir, twelve yuan is not enough."

"How much, this is not bargaining!"

"Add a little more!"

"Oh! Twelve yuan and two jiao..."

"Not selling, at least fifteen yuan!"

"Pour it back, pour it back!"

So, the weigher went to weigh another carrying basket. The villager had to drag the carrying basket over, pour the flattened cocoons back into his own basket! Discouraged, he picked it up, muttering, and walked out of the cocoon business door.

"Lying ghosts, fifty yuan a dan (hundred catties), thirty catties of good and firm

## Page 18

The cocoon can not even sell for fourteen yuan, these big

Old bugs only know how to exploit the villagers, people don't need to buy mulberry leaves for money

Bought. Alas, I won't sell unless it's fifty yuan, I'd rather go back

Draw silk".

But when a cocoon-selling woman squeezed out of the crowd

Out of time, I don’t know who is whispering there

:

"Hey! After all, it's about friendship, A Bao's wife

Twenty-five catties of thin clothing head cocoon are also worth fifteen ocean yuan!"

"Who said you didn't go to worship a cocoon business weigher

A dry son!"

The outside is still crowded with people, cocoon baskets are busy

The empty baskets and coupons are handed in from the railing

Delivered, the cocoons were carried by the porters into the cocoon room,

The coupon was exchanged for legal tender at the small window, so the villagers

Looking at the legal tender and thinking: pay debts, redeem items, the remaining money

Can be used as a seed money for farming. The cocoon business owner also looked at the cocoons in

Thinking: Today's situation can steadily earn ten yuan per hundred catties of dry cocoons

, If the goods are as crowded in the afternoon,

It can also reduce five yuan per dan, assuming that this city can

Receive two thousand dans, then twelve thousand yuan cannot be blown by the wind

, and can't be beaten away by rain.

At twelve o'clock, the inside shouted: "Stop weighing

, come again in the afternoon"! The wooden fence door was then closed

go up.

However, in the afternoon, the price of cocoons dropped by five yuan per hundred catties

### Fishing Boats

— Guo Bian

The setting sun, adorned with rosy clouds, hid behind Wanshi Mountain. The accumulated snow on the mountain peaks emitted a crystalline light, as if struggling to resist the sun's violent rays. The sea had already spread into the desolate woods, and the bare branches swayed restlessly. The village was filled with noise, livestock were calling, the shrill sound of "jiaoma che" (a type of cart) rang out, children were crying and clamoring. Everything was unsettled, like this every day! Only the pair of tall, silver-topped flagpole at the front of the "Guandi Temple" stood silently, reaching into the sky. People worked incessantly, twisting straw ropes, mending fishing nets, weaving mats, and knotting the straw rope nets in preparation for catching sea cucumbers in the early autumn. Even the children were not allowed to play idly. Adults gave them some dried fish or dried "shrimp meat" to sort, separating the good from the bad.

Before the sun had even set, they ate dinner, and the fishermen went out to sea to fish. Numerous boats moved across the boundless sea like moths. The "lighthouse" between the mountain capes began to emit light. The sails were filled by the wind, like the belly of a pregnant woman. They shouted, not out of fear of the turbulent waves, but because of their accustomed way of life. They always shouted while working, just as workers driving piles must sing.

By the time they reached their destination, the night had already engulfed the sea. They discovered mechanized fishing boats, and the sound of the machines clearly entered their eardrums. Everyone was surprised. There had never been mechanized fishing boats in the "Sangdao" area. Qingdao and Weihai had mechanized fishing boats, but "Sangdao" would not have them.

Net after net, cast after cast, came up empty. Where had all the fish gone? The mechanized fishing boat in the distance was approaching, running fiercely east and west, scaring all the fish away. In the darkness, one could not see the mechanized fishing boat with only the faint light of fishing lamps. Helpless, they left and headed for a more distant location.

As they began to work, the hateful fishing boat chased after them again. It was probably deliberately trying to cause trouble. The fishermen were furious, and their fishing boats moved forward together to surround the fishing boat.

"Whose fishing boat is this?" one fisherman asked angrily.

There was no response from the fishing boat. The person managing the machinery paid them no attention.

"We're telling you to leave! Mechanized fishing boats are not allowed to fish in the Sangdao waters, do you hear? Leave immediately!"

The response from the fishing boat was:

"We are the fishing boat of ××! Who dares to tell us to leave?"

After a burst of laughter, followed a rude remark.

The fishermen were dejected and left the fishing boat, steering their own boats elsewhere. It was better to avoid them!

"Treading on our heads, bullying us too much!" Just as the fishermen began to work, the fishing boat came again, running around and preventing the fish from entering their nets. But their own fishing boat caught net after net of fish. It was truly unbearable to endure this humiliation! Suddenly, one fisherman took out a "rifle" from the rear cabin. They usually carried rifles to defend against pirates! With a gunshot, the other fishermen also took up their rifles and fired at the fishing boat!

Victory! The fishing boat fled as fast as it could! The fishermen worked happily until dawn.

The next day, on the "Sangdao" sea, more ××'s mechanized fishing boats were discovered, one, two, three… seven or eight with sun symbols. As soon as they saw the Chinese fishermen's boats, they opened fire with guns and cannons. The "Sangdao" sea immediately became a battlefield! The fishermen retreated! They were heading to new places to open up new fishing areas!

Every day, a large number of ××'s mechanized fishing boats fished in the Sangdao sea. No one dared to offend them. The fishermen were angry but dared not speak. Talk.

Talk.

### Storing Strength Movement

— Zhao Menglan

The Youth Association has recently launched a "Storing Strength Movement." According to a staff member of the Youth Association, "This is just a promotion; whether or not to implement it is up to the public to decide." The strength to be stored is divided into four categories: self-confidence and self-esteem, doing one's best to assist the country's construction undertakings (mental strength); exercising for 15 minutes daily (physical strength); having a skill (intellectual strength); and saving at least one cent per day (material strength). Regarding the "Storing Strength Movement," the Youth Association stipulates that there is a lot of work to be done regularly in the future. As a beginning, the "Storing Strength Movement Exhibition," which serves as a promotion for the promotion, has already held its opening ceremony on the fourth.

That "strength" needs to be "stored" shows that we have wasted "strength" in the past. That "storing strength" needs to be "promoted" and even become a "movement" shows even more how we have been wasting "strength" in the past, or, simply, destroying the growth of strength. The chairman's speech at the opening ceremony of the Storing Strength Exhibition stated: "Therefore, the size of a country's land and the number of its people should be directly proportional to the strength of its national power. If they are sometimes not directly proportional, but instead inversely proportional, it is roughly due to two reasons: ㊀ failure to concentrate the entire power of the country; ㊁ for example, the self-destruction of warlords in the past, which unnecessarily consumed the entire power of the country." This is well said. And our past has been exactly these "two reasons," especially the latter, which has caused so many "man-made disasters" and man-made "natural disasters"!

And when there are natural disasters and man-made disasters, one is too busy fleeing for their lives, so where would there be time to store strength? Mayor Yu said in "Storing Strength and National Rejuvenation": "No nation has ever constantly engaged in the destruction of its own strength and been able to avoid destruction and demise. A tree is not broken by a storm but destroyed by蛀蝕(zhu shi: woodworm or internal decay), the reason for which can be deeply considered"! This is truly something to "deeply consider."

But besides this, there are other things to "deeply consider."

I can't remember which gentleman said, "Useful talents are mostly in prison." If this sentence is to be interpreted, then it is the first reason of the "roughly two reasons": "failure to concentrate the entire power of the country." The basis for "failure to concentrate the entire power of the country" has already been said by someone at the opening of the Storing Strength Movement Exhibition: "The entire power of the country lies dormant in every member of the public. If used well, this dormant power can be expressed and developed; if not used well, this dormant power can also be wasted and destroyed for no reason." And "storing" "talents" (that is, excellent strength) in prison is precisely wasting and destroying dormant power for no reason.

Therefore, "we should not be complacent that the country is unified and national power is concentrated, thinking that any difficulties can be dealt with in the future. We should also pay attention to whether the dormant power in each person can be expressed? Can it be developed?" "If their good strength is not buried and wasted, then making the strength of 450 million people the entire strength of the country will naturally allow us to compete with the great powers of the world."
