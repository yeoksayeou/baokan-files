### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Encounters Difficulties, Our Representative Briefly Expresses Intention to Withdraw

Chairman's Proposed Draft Reply to Japan Deemed Inappropriate and Not Passed; Only Principles Agreed Upon in Two Meetings Yesterday, Further Discussion Today

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was held in a closed session at 10:40 AM. The meeting began with a speech by the Mexican representative, Fabila, who strongly advocated for the necessity of fulfilling international obligations. Following him, Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief Chinese representative, stated that if China's presence at the conference hindered the discussion of the reply to Japan, the Chinese delegation was prepared to temporarily withdraw from the meeting, while fully reserving its position on all decisions made by the conference. At this point, the Chairman, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, persuaded the Chinese delegation to remain in attendance, and the Chinese representative agreed. Spaak then read out the draft of the reply to the Japanese government. After the reading, the Soviet representative, Litvinov, stated that the draft reply should first be distributed to the delegations for study before being discussed. The meeting was then adjourned at 11:30 AM to allow each delegation to review the document, with a resumption scheduled for 12:00 PM. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

Brussels – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference, after adjourning at 11:30 AM, resumed its closed session at noon and concluded at 1:15 PM. It was decided to continue the meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow. According to informed sources, the delegations submitted amendments to the draft reply to Japan to the secretariat of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The appointment of a smaller committee to negotiate with Japan will be decided after receiving the Japanese reply. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference also issued a statement stating, "Full sessions were held on the 4th and 5th of this month, during which the conference discussed a reply from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to the Japanese government's response to Belgium's invitation. The principles of the reply have been agreed upon by the conference, but the wording of the reply is currently being exchanged between the delegations." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

Brussels – At this morning's Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, immediately presented his draft reply to the Japanese government, which contained three points: ❶ Japan, in its reply to the invitation to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, acknowledges that the Nine-Power Treaty remains valid. Article One of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates the integrity and political independence of China, therefore Japan should not take an opposing stance toward the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which is consistent with the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. ❷ The convocation of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, although after the resolution passed by the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese problem, is an independent entity and it is necessary to convene it in order to deal with the Far Eastern situation. Even without the resolution of the Advisory Committee, it should still be convened. Moreover, the fact that the United States, a non-member of the League of Nations, and the Soviet Union, a non-signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, are both attending the conference further proves the independent existence of the conference. ❸ If Japan accepts participation in the negotiations, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference intends to appoint a committee with only a small number of countries involved in the Far East to participate in the discussion, in order to satisfy Japan's wishes. The hope is that Japan will give favorable consideration to the conclusions, in order to determine whether it can contact China and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference under the above circumstances. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

Brussels – The draft reply to the Japanese government, drafted by Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, begins by stating, "In its reply to the Belgian government, the Japanese government stated that it has no territorial ambitions in China. On the contrary, the Japanese government sincerely hopes to find ways to assist the material and spiritual development of the Chinese nation, enhance cultural and economic cooperation between China and foreign countries, and respect the rights and interests of foreign countries in China. The above points are all fundamental principles stipulated in the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of February 6, 1922. The representatives of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty should take note of Japan's willingness to respect these principles. Furthermore, the Japanese reply denies violating the Nine-Power Treaty, arguing that since 1922, China has undergone significant changes due to the intrusion of communist forces and changes in the domestic situation. It also deeply criticizes China for implementing an anti-foreign policy, hindering Japanese economic activities, and endangering the lives of Japanese residents. The Nine-Power Treaty has already made provisions regarding this situation. Therefore, Article Seven of the treaty states that in the event of such a situation, the signatory countries may raise the issue and consult with each other. The current meeting in Brussels is convened based on the provisions of this article." In addition, the Japanese reply expresses objections, stating that the countries attending the Brussels Conference will be bound by the resolution of the League of Nations. Regarding this point, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference reply specifically responds, stating that "the representatives of the countries attending the Brussels Conference are exchanging opinions purely based on the Nine-Power Treaty." In its reply, Japan also raises objections to the fact that most of the countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have little connection to the Far East. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference reply points out that all signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty have the right to use the rights stipulated in the treaty. "However, the representatives of the countries attending the Brussels Conference believe that it is worthwhile to consider the Japanese government's desire to conduct discussions. This exchange of opinions can be conducted within the framework of the Nine-Power Treaty, and its main purpose is to clarify the above three key points and facilitate the resolution of the conflict between China and Japan." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

Brussels – After Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, read out the reply, Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief Chinese representative, stated that if the representatives believed that the Chinese delegation should withdraw in order for them to proceed with the discussion, he was willing to temporarily withdraw. Representative Koo also stated that the Chinese delegation did not wish to abandon its rights or evade its responsibility to participate in the conference. Italian representative Aloisi and Chairman Spaak both requested that he not withdraw, and the Chinese delegation remained at the meeting. If the Japanese reply is still good, then the negotiations between China and Japan and the subcommittee responsible for mediation will be lengthy and arduous. If the Japanese reply is rejected, the conference will have to return to square one and seek other methods of achieving a truce. According to an official spokesman, the result of today's meeting is extremely encouraging and the general discussion was beneficial. Based on the current situation, the reply to Japan will be redrafted. The draft will be submitted to the plenary session for approval next Monday. According to a statement issued by the Secretariat, certain documents had apparently been leaked to the newspapers. It also stated that any documents not officially published should not be considered accurate. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Brussels – Regarding the draft reply to the Japanese government drafted by Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, some at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today advocated for the establishment of a drafting committee for a thorough discussion. Representatives from several countries suggested that the drafting committee should include only representatives from Britain, the United States, and Belgium. However, French Foreign Minister Delbos argued that France's interests in the Far East were extremely important and that France should not be excluded from any actions related to the Far East, thus requesting that France also participate in the drafting committee. As the various parties failed to reach a consensus on the composition of the drafting committee, it was finally decided that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference would revise the draft proposed by the Chairman. It was also decided that the delegations should submit any objections to the draft in writing to the secretariat of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today, which would then compile and organize them into a more satisfactory new draft. This new draft would then be submitted to the plenary session tomorrow for decision. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Italian Representative Proposes Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations, Overruled by Representatives of the United States, Britain, and France

Statement That All Countries Have the Right to Intervene in Far Eastern Issues; Decision to Establish Subcommittee to Undertake Mediation

Brussels – Under the leadership of the British, American, and French representatives, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today decided in a two-hour secret session to organize a subcommittee to guide Japan to participate in reconciliation efforts. It is also heard that Germany will be invited to participate in the mediation efforts. When Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak made this proposal, Italian representative Aloisi immediately objected, arguing that the Sino-Japanese dispute should be resolved directly through negotiations between the two countries. American representative Davis then questioned Aloisi, "Does Italy mean that the participating countries have no right to intervene in the Sino-Japanese dispute?" British representative Eden and French representative Delbos unanimously supported Davis's question, and Aloisi's objection was thus dismissed. (April National Telegram)

Brussels – When the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and Soviet Russia held a meeting yesterday, U.S. Chief Delegate Davis, after forcefully refuting the suggestion of Italian Chief Delegate Count Aloisi, the assembly passed in principle the organization of a subcommittee, with the following tasks: ❶ To draft a reply to the Japanese response to the original invitation and memorandum from the Belgian government; ❷ To study the possibility of Japanese cooperation; ❸ Finally, to mediate the Sino-Japanese war. The Italian suggestion, which Davis sternly refuted, was that the subcommittee could suggest that China and Japan should begin direct negotiations. The U.S. representative then suddenly stood up and questioned Aloisi whether this meant that other countries had nothing to do with the Sino-Japanese dispute. Furthermore, the proposal to organize the subcommittee was put forward by U.S. Representative Davis after Chairman Spaak circulated the Japanese reply. Its purpose was to obtain Japan's cooperation. Spaak pointed out that the Japanese note acknowledged the existence of the Nine-Power Treaty, but raised several points that could be properly discussed. The British and French chief delegates, Eden and Delbos, immediately approved Davis’s proposal, and expressed that the subcommittee should mediate a Sino-Japanese truce. However, Davis also stated that even if Japan refused to attend, the conference should continue. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM, and King Leopold of Belgium hosted a tea party for the representatives of the various countries. It was originally intended to reconvene at 6 PM to discuss the number and organization of the subcommittee, but this was changed to reconvene at 10:30 AM this morning. It is heard that for the organization of the subcommittee, the representatives of Britain, the United States, and Belgium are all ex-officio members, but it is widely believed that if France joins the committee, Italy will inevitably rise up to fight for a seat. Today’s meeting therefore decided to postpone, so that the representatives of the various countries could thoroughly consult each other overnight. The next general assembly of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be convened in about a week or ten days. It is generally expected that Japan will still refuse to participate in the conference, but some quarters believe that if the countries can acknowledge the various changes that have occurred in the Far East since the Washington Conference, such as the conquest of Manchuria, Japan may agree to cooperate. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Beijing – The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a closed session at 2:30 PM this afternoon and adjourned at 4:15 PM. According to responsible sources, the representatives of the various countries, after discussing the matter, unanimously agreed to send a letter of application to the Japanese government, as proposed by the US representative, to respond to that country's note refusing to participate in the conference, and declared their willingness to serve as mediators between China and Japan. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to continue its meeting at 10:30 AM tomorrow and will issue a communique at noon tomorrow, explaining the results of the meeting. The proceedings of today's meeting are recorded as follows: At the opening of today's meeting, Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, first stated that Japan had not declared the Nine-Power Treaty abolished, which shows that there is still room for compromise. US Representative Davis then spoke, advocating that a letter of application be issued to the Japanese government again, urging it to take a compromising attitude. British Foreign Secretary Eden immediately endorsed it. French Foreign Minister Delbos, in addition to expressing his agreement, also proposed the establishment of a subcommittee to draft the letter of application and suggested that mediation be carried out between China and Japan. Regarding this, the representatives of the various countries had no objection. Only Italian representative Count Aloisi objected to granting the subcommittee broad powers, believing that negotiations should be conducted directly between China and Japan. French Foreign Minister Delbos then refuted this, stating that ❶ the countries concerned have an obligation to protect the interests they possess in the Far East; ❷ if those countries interfere in the Far Eastern disputes, this is in accordance with the provisions of Articles Seven and Eight of the Nine-Power Treaty. As a result, Italian Representative Aloisi did not insist and accepted granting the subcommittee broad powers. At this point, the representatives of the various countries proceeded to discuss the issue of the organization of the subcommittee. According to well-informed sources, there were two proposals at the time: ❶ The subcommittee should be composed of the seven countries: Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands. ❷ It should be composed of only the three countries: Britain, the United States, and Belgium. However, since France and Italy both possess significant interests in the Far East, they are bound to demand participation in the subcommittee. Therefore, the first method is more likely to be adopted. As for the proposal that only Britain and the United States should separately contact China and Japan, US Representative Davis has already rejected it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 4th)

### British and French Foreign Ministers Return Home Briefly

Brussels – French Foreign Minister Delbos hastily returned to Paris at 9:40 this morning to meet with King George II of Greece. At today's Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the country's Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Taittinger, will attend as a representative. British Foreign Secretary Eden also needs to return to London briefly for personal matters and is scheduled to depart this afternoon on a British military aircraft.

### Germany Reportedly Intends to Mediate Sino-Japanese War

Both China and Japan Deny; Strange Atmosphere in Tokyo

[Berlin] It was learned today that German leader Hitler has convened a meeting of several key party, government, and military figures to discuss the feasibility of Germany directly mediating the Sino-Japanese war. Those attending the meeting are said to be Defense Minister Blomberg, Foreign Minister Neurath, Aviation Minister Göring, and Navy Minister Raeder. However, the Chinese and Japanese embassies have strongly denied the claim of German mediation. (National Telegram, 5th)

[Paris] The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is currently being commented on by various newspapers, which unanimously say that reconciliation should be attempted. According to a telegram from a Daily News correspondent in Berlin, diplomatic circles here are rife with rumors that the German government is preparing to mediate. German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop will immediately negotiate with representatives from China and Japan to determine the intentions of each country. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

Brussels – Regarding the rumors of Germany mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute, the spokesman for the Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference recently stated that the country's chief representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, has no knowledge of it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

[Berlin] Responsible persons here have recently solemnly denied external rumors that the German government is preparing to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is heard that these rumors originated because General Blomberg, the Minister of Defense, met with General Chiang Pai-li, a member of the Chinese National Defense Council, yesterday. Japanese figures here also made statements to a Havas News Agency reporter, stating that it is practically impossible for Germany to mediate. 'The current dispute is purely a matter between China and Japan. Interference from a third country, even if it is from a friend of Japan, is opposed.' In addition, Chinese figures here also stated that although there have been rumors of German mediation, China has no intention of accepting it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

[Berlin] General Chiang Pai-li, a member of the Chinese National Defense Council, accompanied by Mr. Cheng Tien-fong, the country's ambassador to Germany, left for Brussels, Belgium today to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in the capacity of an observer. Chinese sources here have confirmed that General Chiang Pai-li will be received by Führer Hitler when he returns to Germany at a later date. The date is expected to be after the 9th of this month, the anniversary of the Nazi uprising. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)

[Tokyo] Japanese government officials today vigorously denied that Japan is moving towards peace, but it is also widely rumored outside that Japan is very willing to end the fighting in Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to discuss the possibility of mediation and avoided the question of whether Japan's goals are territorial or ideological. Informed sources have also said that Japan feels that Hitler is easier to accept than Roosevelt as a mediator in the Far Eastern war. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Establishment of Japanese General Headquarters

Military and Political Opinions United; Can Be Realized This Month

[Tokyo] The opinions within the Army Ministry regarding the plan to establish a General Headquarters in Japan to cope with the progress and end of the war have become consistent. On the government side, Prime Minister Konoe and other leaders are also understanding and have no objections. Furthermore, the Navy also agreed on the 4th. Therefore, on the issue of establishing the General Headquarters, the views of all parties concerned have now become consistent. The General Headquarters is organized according to military orders, and its content fully complies with the regulations of the wartime General Headquarters. It is clearly a purely command organization. The constituent members, such as the Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff, as well as senior subordinates in the staff and various agencies, are strictly limited to military personnel. Therefore, administrative officials such as the Prime Minister, various ministers, and the President of the Privy Council cannot serve as members of the General Headquarters. The Army and Navy Ministers will be responsible for liaison between the command and administrative departments. However, according to the precedents of the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, the Imperial Council meetings at the General Headquarters were attended by the Prime Minister, the President of the Privy Council, the Ministers of State, etc., who were specially appointed by imperial decree to participate in the planning. Therefore, there is a precedent to follow, so it is not impossible that the Imperial Council meetings this time may be handled in this way as well. In short, the General Headquarters is a purely command organization, and it has absolutely no relationship with the administrative organs. (Domei News Agency, 5th)

[Tokyo] The Hochi Shimbun stated today that the whole of Japan is now gradually approving the idea of Japan declaring war on China. Members of the Navy are also demanding a declaration of war, but the Army is actively opposing this, as it could easily provoke international disputes. After the Naval Ministry ceased its opposition, the establishment of the General Headquarters can be completed on November 10. Under this organization, the administrative powers of the government and the military will be merged into one, with the heads of the Army and Navy and their staff assisting the Emperor and the Grand Marshal in commanding everything. The two services will be the liaison personnel with the cabinet. Cabinet members and members of the Privy Council can only attend meetings of the General Headquarters under the special orders of the Emperor. The Asahi Shimbun recently published an article saying that if the Army and Navy consider the General Headquarters necessary for a long-term war against China, then the government should have no reason to oppose this organization. However, the Prime Minister should carefully handle the resulting reorganization of the cabinet. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Former Belgian Foreign Minister Ordered to Form Cabinet

Brussels – After former Minister of Agriculture and Catholic Party Senator Pierlot failed to form a cabinet, King Leopold III entrusted former Foreign Minister Spaak with the task of forming a new cabinet. Spaak, who is currently the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, is one of the leading figures of the Belgian Socialist Youth and enjoys a high reputation. His political views are more moderate than those of party leader Vandervelde. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 4th)

### German Consulate General Issues Statement Denouncing False Rumors by Japanese Domei News Agency

According to a solemn statement by German official sources in China, the Domei News Agency message of November 1st, claiming that the renowned German economist and former Chancellor Dr. Luther made the following declaration during a meeting with journalists at the German Consulate General in Tianjin: "Germany will cooperate closely with Japan to realize the plan to develop the economy of North China," is completely untrue. The above message is entirely a rumor fabricated by the Japanese to confuse public opinion. (Haitong News Agency) To the Editor of the Shen Bao: The article entitled "Germany, Italy, and the Far East Incident" published in your esteemed newspaper on the 3rd of this month contains the following statement: "The German financier Luther has arrived in Tianjin and made a statement to the Japanese Domei News Agency, advocating cooperation between Japan and Germany to develop North China. We hope that the news promoted by the Japanese side is completely fabricated…" Upon investigation, the item in question was indeed a free invention of Domei News Agency. The German Haitong News Agency issued a correction this morning. We are writing to you accordingly, hoping that you will refer to the correction issued by Haitong News Agency this morning to clarify the truth of the matter. With best regards, Acting Consul General Reinhardt, November 5, 1937.

### Full Text of Litvinov's Speech

[Moscow] Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov delivered a speech at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing. The text is as follows: I am here to attend the conference at the invitation of the signatory countries of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations. I am deeply impressed by the grand arguments of the inviting parties, especially the American representative, regarding the Far Eastern incident. I do not find it necessary to issue a special statement here, especially since the issue currently before this conference is the same issue that was discussed in Geneva. Geneva is the source of this conference, and everything that should be said about the current situation has already been said in Geneva. As for the Soviet Union, whether regarding the general issue of opposing aggression as an international phenomenon, or the individual events that are active manifestations of such aggression, it has repeatedly stated its own views, and the opinions it has expressed have all stemmed from its concept of peace. This concept should also be the common starting point for most governments to establish a common stance, with the exception of a very few. The differences between countries only arise in the transition from a common concept to how to adopt the most effective measures to safeguard peace or to restore peace where it has been broken. In any case, if any measures are to be taken, the unavoidable first step must be joint discussions in international conferences or other organizations.

The convening of a conference to jointly discuss certain events is in itself an action with positive moral value. For this reason, I, on behalf of my government, congratulate this conference and express my deep gratitude to the Belgian government and its Foreign Minister, especially for their hard work in preparing for this conference and their warm hospitality to the delegations.

In recent years, international life has gained a valuable experience, which forces us to pay attention to the dangerous pitfalls and ruts that pervade the future of all international conferences. This experience tells us that international conferences, committees, and other organizations, although they have definite goals when they are convened, sometimes even forget their direct objectives and incidental tasks, and instead follow their own interests and exist for themselves, especially when their existence is prolonged. In such circumstances, such meetings often take maintaining their own existence, pursuing the moral satisfaction of their initiators and organizers, and pursuing their own superficial success as their main objectives. This superficial success does not always coincide with the success of the original purpose of convening the meeting. Sometimes these different interests even conflict. Sometimes, even conferences or committees convened for the purpose of eliminating and overcoming aggression openly become tools of the aggressors, and are used by them as smokescreens and aids for carrying out aggressive actions. This happens when these international organizations attempt to persuade the aggressors to change their attitude while also engaging with them.

In the process of repeatedly making concessions to aggressors through negotiations, people who originally had very noble intentions inevitably exceed the limits from time to time, unconsciously fall into the same views as the aggressors, and actually support and encourage their actions. If the issue concerns one country invading another, and this aggression has achieved some success, international organizations are very likely to say to the aggressors, for the sake of their own success, 'Take the loot you seized by force and be quiet from now on,' and to the victims of aggression, 'Do not resist evil, but be reconciled with your aggressor without discord.'

This may be the superficial success of the conference, but it is by no means a victory for peace, let alone a victory for peaceful nations. This kind of success only provokes new acts of aggression, creating the need to convene new conferences, and from then on, it will be an eternal cycle until the end of time.

When these international organizations deviate from the right path, they can create an environment that allows aggression to be further condoned and expanded. Because if international conferences are in this situation, friction will inevitably occur among peaceful nations, leading to division and conflict, which can be exploited by the aggressors. At a time when aggressors are increasingly colluding and jointly creating threats to most countries, it is especially necessary for peaceful nations to unite.

Any conference under current conditions is prone to such dangers, which I have specifically elaborated on. I only hope that this Beijing Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and the proposals that we will hear from the inviting countries, can be successful. I am convinced that the purpose of this conference will avoid the above-mentioned dangers, and that all proposals will not only restore peace in the Far East, but also restore a just peace, a peace that does not condone aggression but restrains it, a peace that extends far into the future and is universal to the world. (TASS dispatch on the 4th)

### Fierce Bloody Battle on the Entire South Bank of the Suzhou Creek

Our troops in the western section are holding Zhujia Bang. The enemy reinforces and breaks through, attacking fiercely. The enemy landed yesterday at Jinshanwei and other places.

The center of the battle on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek is still in the western section of the Suzhou Creek, in the semicircular position west of Beixinjing to Shenjibang Estuary, and north of Piazzi Road, with Yaojia Zhai as the apex. After six days and nights of bloody battles and multiple secret crossings, the enemy has finally gained a foothold of about one square kilometer in this semicircular position on the south bank. The enemy and our troops are currently confronting each other across Zhujia Bang, and an extremely fierce bloody battle is still continuing. In order to prevent the enemy's forces from spreading, our army concentrated its firepower last night and charged fiercely towards the enemy in the rain. The enemy's foothold was unstable, and countless enemies were annihilated. The enemy has strongly occupied the villages of Wujia Ku, Tingtou, Caijia Zhai, Zhangjia Zhai, etc., and is currently busy deploying positions north of Zhujia Bang. In the eastern section of the Suzhou Creek, a small number of remnants of the enemy are entrenched near Liujia Zhai. Yesterday, the enemy took advantage of the cloudy and foggy weather and released smoke screens to cover up their secret crossing, sending in a large number of reinforcements and fiercely attacking our army's positions in Chichuan Xuejia She and other places. They advanced and retreated in turns, engaging in bloody battles all day long. Our army is currently holding the south bank of Xiaobang, confronting the enemy. Yesterday, a large number of enemy troops also attacked Jiangqiao Town and the Zhuyuan area, and fierce battles ensued. The enemy troops have been repelled head-on, and our army's positions have not changed at all. The enemy harassed everywhere. Yesterday at dawn, enemy ships gathered on the sea off Jinshanwei and densely bombarded the coast to cover their landing troops and invade our coastal area of Hangzhou Bay. The landing sites were at Caojing Town, Quan Gong Ting, and Jinshanwei, and the number of troops was not large. Our army has surrounded and severely suppressed them separately. Our artillery also sank one enemy ship.

### Main Force Battle Will Unfold

A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army reported at 12:10 pm on the 5th that the battle for strongholds in the semicircular position in the western section of the Suzhou Creek, with Yaojia Zhai as its apex, has come to an end, and a main force battle will soon unfold. A part of our army that was surrounded between Tingtou and Zhang Zhai broke through the encirclement after a fierce battle last night and made contact with our main force. At the same time, our army in Tiandu Zhai, in coordination with a part of the army that was surrounded in Yaojia Zhai, attacked the enemy forces in the direction of Yujidun from inside and outside and broke through the enemy's positions, retreating to Tiandu Zhai as a whole, forming a solid line of defense and strictly preventing the enemy from expanding westward. As for the enemy forces surrounded by our army in Jiangjia Zhai, after repeated attacks by our army, many were annihilated, and half of the area has been recovered. The remaining forces will not be difficult to deal with.

### Enemy Twice Attacked Baziqiao, Repelled

A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army reported at 8:40 pm on the 5th that after the enemy forces strongly occupied the strongholds of Wujia Ku, Tingtou, and Caijia Zhai at the protruding point in the western section of the Suzhou Creek, they deployed positions on the north bank of Zhujia Bang. This morning and in the evening, two attacks on our Baziqiao point were repelled. Our army inflicted a heavy blow on the enemy when they attempted to cross the river secretly, annihilating many enemies. Defensive fortifications have been strengthened to deal with the enemy. If the enemy attacks again, they will be severely hit.

### Secret Crossing at Chenjiadu Still Repelled

A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 12:15 pm on the 5th that the enemy forces in the Chenjiadu area released smoke screens four times at 10 pm last night, 1 am, 2:30 am, and 4 am this morning, secretly crossing the river to reinforce the remnants of the enemy forces in Liujia Zhai on the south bank. However, our army was heavily guarded, and each time the enemy's foothold was unstable, they were attacked and repelled. The enemy had three pontoon bridges erected in that area, two of which were destroyed by our artillery fire. As for the remaining enemy forces hiding in Western-style buildings, more than 40 were annihilated by our forces yesterday.

### Our Troops Confront the Enemy Across Zhujia Bang

A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 12:10 pm on the 5th that the enemy forces who attacked our Baziqiao last night were repelled after our brave resistance and several hand-to-hand combats until midnight. The enemy forces then constructed fortifications in Caijia Zhai and an unnamed small village to its west, confronting us across Zhujia Bang. After six days of bloody battles and multiple secret crossings, the enemy has finally gained a foothold of about one square kilometer on the south bank. Today, the enemy's artillery fire was concentrated on the area west of Beixinjing to Qujiaqiao for bombardment. In order to prevent the enemy's forces from spreading, our army also concentrated its firepower for a counterattack, setting a deadline to eliminate the enemy.

### Enemy Reinforcements in Liujia Zhai Fiercely Attack Chichuan Xuejia She

The battle in the eastern section of the Suzhou Creek is gradually intensifying. Our army is now firmly holding the south bank of Xiaobang.

A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 8:40 pm on the 5th that in the area along the coast of Liujia Zhai, west of Hopeland Road on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, there are many scattered Western-style buildings. After the enemy forces crossed the river a few days ago and occupied them, they have built defensive fortifications. Although our army has continuously attacked and annihilated many enemies, it is a pity that they have not been completely eliminated. Today, the weather was cloudy and foggy, and the enemy forces used smoke screens again to cover up their secret crossing. Our army had already discovered it, but the firepower could not reach due to being blocked by the houses along the coast. As a result, two large battalions of them crossed the river one after another.

### Fierce Battle at Chichuan Xuejia She

After the enemy forces crossed the river, they dispersed to the left and right, first attacking Chichuan along the coast of Xiaobang, west of Liujia Zhai. Although our army fought bravely to resist, they were eventually broken through by the enemy due to their fierce artillery fire. At about 9 o'clock, our army launched a counterattack with reinforcements, launching a fierce assault. The enemy's foothold was unstable and they were driven back by us. After suffering this blow, the enemy changed their strategy again and attacked our Xuejia She point. The enemy set up small cannons in the Western-style buildings along the coast and bombarded us fiercely. The soldiers of our defending company were determined to coexist with the position and fought the enemy in close combat. In the end, they were almost all killed or wounded, and the enemy broke in, and a row of civilian houses at the eastern end of Xuejia She was lost.

### Fierce Battle All Day, the Enemy Failed

At nearly 11 am, fresh troops arrived and immediately launched a counterattack. Our army disregarded life and death, advanced in a bloody battle, broke through the enemy's positions, and recovered the area, surrounding a part of the enemy forces between Chichuan and Xuejia She. The enemy forces were panicked and fled in confusion, causing us to lose contact between the two places, and fell into a mixed battle. The position in Chichuan was lost again, but our army made persistent efforts, repeatedly attacking, and at about 2 pm, Chichuan was recovered again, and the fierce battle continued. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. By dusk, heavy rain poured down. Since the enemy had made no progress, they retreated to the area along the coast of Liujia Zhai to regroup. The battle then became silent. The enemy suffered a heavy blow and will certainly not be reconciled. Therefore, our army has deployed a large force in that area, and it is expected that the enemy will also send in a large number of reinforcements, and a more fierce battle will unfold.

### Our Army Firmly Holds the South Bank of Xiaobang

A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 10:45 pm on the 5th that after the enemy forces reinforced the Liujia Zhai area, they built fortifications north of Xiaobang. At 2 pm, they divided their troops into two groups and attacked our positions in Beigongjia Zhai and Chen Geng, but they were all repelled by our army. We are now holding the south bank of Xiaobang, confronting the enemy.

### Two Regiments of Enemy Troops Attack Jiangqiao Town, Repelled

Our army pursues and attacks Quan Chi fiercely. The enemy troops in Xin Muqiao suffered heavy casualties. Fierce fighting broke out on the Zhuyuan front line.

A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 12:15 pm on the 5th that at 3 am this morning, about two regiments of enemy troops attacked our forward guard positions in Jiangqiao Town from Gejia Xiang. Their left wing attacked our Jishen An, and their right wing occupied Quan Chi and attacked our Lijia Xiang. Our army responded calmly, taking both defensive and offensive measures. We dispatched a part of our forces to launch a counterattack along the Xiaobang from Lijia Xiang, carrying out a central breakthrough and cutting off the enemy's communication lines. The enemy's right-wing troops were threatened by us and retreated backward. Our army pursued and attacked Quan Chi fiercely. As of the time of the report, fierce fighting was still going on.

The Central News Agency said that the army learned that our army north of Guangfu had launched a successful assault on the enemy in Xin Muqiao, capturing many rifles and a mortar. A diary was also found on the bodies of the captured enemy soldiers. According to the diary, the enemy troops in the Xin Muqiao area belonged to the 58th Regiment of the 2nd Division, which had just been transferred from Nagoya to take over the defense. Their veteran soldiers had suffered heavy casualties, so the future of the team would be difficult to maintain for long.

A reporter from the Central News Agency reported at 10:45 pm on the 5th that our army had a superior position on the Zhuyuan front line southeast of Jiangqiao Town. The enemy was guarding against our counterattack and concentrated many tanks on Zhennan Road. At 2 pm yesterday, they started a dense artillery battle, bombarding each other for a long time. The troops on both sides got closer and closer, and a fierce battle broke out. However, by 8 pm, there had been no changes in our position. Then, the sound of gunfire became sparse, and the battle stopped.

### Japan's Destruction of Our Educational Institutions

Cai Yuanpei and Others Issue a Statement of Facts, Urging the World to Impose Sanctions

[Nanjing] Since the Lugouqiao Incident, for three months, Japanese troops in various parts of China have used airplanes and artillery to destroy our educational institutions at all levels, which are too numerous to mention. This is truly the most heinous atrocity committed by the Japanese and the greatest stain on the history of world civilization. Recently, prominent figures in China's education circles, such as Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, Hu Shi, Professor of Peking University, Li Yuying, President of the Peiping Research Institute, Weng Zhirong, President of Tongji University, Zou Lu, President of Zhongshan University, Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, Luo Jialun, President of National Central University, Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, and Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University, along with 102 others, jointly issued a lengthy statement of facts in English, exhaustively narrating Japan's destruction of our educational institutions. The first section is an introduction, and the second section describes the widespread destruction by the Japanese. It briefly states that from Peiping in the north to Guangzhou in the south, and from Shanghai in the east to Jiangxi in the west, 23 universities and specialized schools, and countless middle and primary schools have been destroyed by the Japanese. Taking universities as an example, the material losses, according to the 1935 estimates, amounted to more than 67 million yuan. The cultural losses, however, are incalculable. It is truly a case of China's thirty years of construction being insufficient to compensate for Japan's one day of destruction. The statement further describes that the Japanese actions were planned and systematic. For example, National Central University was designated as a bombing target by the Japanese air force and was subsequently bombed four times. Nankai University was not only bombed, but also burned down, leaving it completely scorched. The Japanese have often used military necessity as an excuse for these actions, but it is well known that these educational institutions are located in various places, often far from military areas, and have absolutely nothing to do with military affairs. The Japanese are intentionally destroying them precisely because they are educational institutions, and destroying them so that they cannot be rebuilt. All other explanations are mere excuses. Finally, they solemnly appeal to the people of the world, believing that the Japanese actions are a great threat to civilization and that enlightened people around the world should join with China in condemning them. If this threat cannot be stopped, there will be no progress or peace in the world. Moreover, hesitation is tantamount to encouraging the aggressor. Only by a global determination to implement effective sanctions can civilization be protected in the simplest and fastest way. The entire text is very long and describes the situation in detail. It is said that it will soon be printed into a book for widespread dissemination. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)

### Plenary Session of the Non-Intervention Committee on Spain

Resolution Proposed by Subcommittee Passed, Preparations to Send Personnel to Investigate Withdrawal of Volunteers

[London] The Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session at 4:00 PM, which concluded at 5:50 PM. The resolution proposed by the subcommittee was unanimously passed, and the chairman, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, was entrusted to draft a note on the issue of sending an international investigation team to Spain to prepare for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers. The note will be submitted by British Foreign Secretary Eden to both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War. Once both parties have submitted their answers, the subcommittee will convene a meeting to discuss them. In addition, the Adjustment Committee decided to entrust the subcommittee to continue studying the following issues: ① the restoration of surveillance measures; ② the withdrawal of foreign volunteers; ③ the recognition of belligerent status. Negotiations on these issues will be conducted diplomatically between the countries concerned. At today's meeting, Chairman Lord Plymouth first presented the resolution passed by the subcommittee and the compromise plan proposed by the United Kingdom on July 14 for discussion. Italian representative Grandi immediately stated that ① regarding the issue of sending an international investigation team, Italy agreed that Britain should contact both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War; ② regarding the British compromise plan, Italy proposed a reservation, saying, "The points contained in the British plan are all interconnected. All countries except the Soviet Union have accepted it. In addition, the Soviet Union has also decided to waive its right to vote on the issue of recognizing belligerent status. All of these factors have a significant impact. Regarding the former, if the Soviet Union does not change its attitude, and regarding the latter, if the countries cannot agree on various countermeasures, then the Adjustment Committee will have no way to implement the British compromise plan." He also said that if the Soviet Union refuses to recognize the Spanish National Army as a belligerent party, the Adjustment Committee should provide the National Army with compensatory measures, but Grandi did not specify the nature of these measures. German representative Walman and the representatives of Austria-Hungary, Portugal, and Albania spoke successively, and their views were largely the same as those of the Italian representative. At this point, French representative Corbin declared that the parties to the Spanish Civil War could only be recognized as having certain belligerent rights after the implementation of measures to withdraw foreign volunteers. Regarding the issue of surveillance measures, France is prepared to restore surveillance measures in the Pyrenees Mountains, but only on the condition that surveillance measures are also restored on other land borders in Spain. Conversely, if any other country violates the non-intervention agreement, especially if the British compromise plan, especially the measures for the withdrawal of volunteers, cannot be implemented within a reasonable time limit, then the surveillance measures in the Pyrenees Mountains should not be maintained. Soviet representative Maisky said that if foreign volunteers can be withdrawn in large numbers, and if there are no further deployments to Spain in the future, then the Soviet Union may agree to discuss the issue of recognizing belligerent status. "I have received instructions from the government to accept the subcommittee's resolution, but with a reservation, namely, waiving the right to vote on the issue of recognizing belligerent status." It is hoped that the Soviet Union's position can enable the work of withdrawing volunteers to continue and be completed successfully. The Adjustment Committee then adjourned. It is generally believed that no difficulties will arise regarding the dispatch of an international investigation team to Spain, because the members of the investigation team who are of German or Italian nationality will not be accepted by both sides if they are sent to the territory controlled by the Republican government, and those of Soviet nationality will not be accepted if they are sent to the territory controlled by the National Army. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch)

[London] Regarding the British government's plan to send officials to Salamanca, Spain, to protect British nationals and commercial interests, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government would hold talks with the Spanish National Army authorities to discuss the mutual dispatch of officials, but these officials would not have diplomatic representative status. The British government has not changed its attitude towards the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, but the government is concerned about the protection of British nationals and commercial interests in the territory controlled by the Spanish National Army, and the progress of the negotiations on this matter has been communicated to France at any time. Opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee asked whether this move was tantamount to de facto recognition of the National Army government. The Prime Minister replied, "No." Labour MP Alexander asked whether it was true that the government intended to appoint Sir Hogeson, the former British Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, as the official in Salamanca. The Prime Minister replied that the selection of candidates had not yet been decided. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch from the 4th)

### US President's Expectations for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

A Test of Whether Britain, France, and the United States Can Cooperate, Quezon Plans to Open a Free Port in Manila

Brussels: Representatives of various countries here today deeply believe that US President Roosevelt will use the Nine-Power Treaty Conference as a touchstone for whether he can obtain the cooperation of Britain and France in opposing the fascist bloc. Because President Roosevelt stated in his Chicago speech that the United States is prepared to isolate aggressor countries and cooperate with various countries to maintain world peace, it is generally speculated that the current attitude of the United States is actually to test whether Britain and France are prepared to cooperate with the United States to seek a solution to this major world peace issue, and at the same time to test the reaction of American public opinion. Therefore, representatives of various countries believe that the outcome of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not only shift US foreign policy but also be of great significance to world security. Judging from the fact that the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Russia unanimously spoke at the meeting in support of the proposals of US representative Davis, it can be seen that this test has already yielded considerable results. (National Telegraph dispatch from the 5th)

[Washington] Philippine President Quezon, in view of the prolonged Shanghai War affecting the commerce of various countries in Shanghai, has proposed opening Manila as a free port in the East and expressed his willingness to cooperate fully with merchants from various countries in transferring the major commercial centers in Shanghai to Manila. Officials and business people here today are very excited about Quezon's proposal and very happy to accept it. American business people believe that Quezon's proposal is sufficient to solve the problem of American commercial development in the East, even if the Japanese continue their military operations in Shanghai indefinitely, American commerce will not be affected. According to general observation, if Manila is opened as a free trade port, it will not be able to compete with Hong Kong, because in fact, Hong Kong's shipping is far above Manila's. But in any case, Manila can earn a batch of commerce from Shanghai, China, especially with faster transportation, enough to overcome all geographical obstacles. The International Trade Conference in Cleveland is paying special attention to this issue and will specifically discuss the commercial and business prospects of the Philippines. It is reported that many large American merchants are actively participating in this conference. New York has also expressed excitement about the proposal to open Manila as a commercial port in the East to replace Shanghai and is currently estimating the benefits and prospects after this transfer.

### International Women's League for Peace and Freedom

Requests a Conference to Stop the War

[Geneva] The International Women's League for Peace and Freedom today sent a letter to the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, requesting that the governments of the participating countries stop the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible, and when necessary, immediately take systematic measures in the spiritual, economic, and financial aspects to deal with the aggressor government. However, the measures adopted by various countries to stop the war should be in accordance with the principles of China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and should not allow the aggressor country to benefit instead. In other words, Japan should not be allowed to annex the land it has occupied. The areas occupied by the Japanese army since the Lugouqiao Incident in China on July 7 this year should be withdrawn. In addition, if a fair and just solution to the Sino-Japanese problem is to be achieved, China's sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces cannot but be restored.

### British House of Commons Discusses Shanghai Shipping

Conservative MP Asks About Difficulties

[London] Conservative MP Molem mentioned the difficulties currently experienced by British shipping in Shanghai in the House of Commons today and asked the Board of Trade whether it was aware of the serious impact on British merchants in Shanghai due to the high cost of war risk insurance for ships going to Shanghai. Wallace, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, replied that he had heard that insurance companies were willing to underwrite war risk and cargo insurance for ships heading to Shanghai and their non-military cargo, limited to the time the cargo was on board. However, he had heard that insurance companies were currently considering relaxing the time limit to help shipping companies. Molem also asked whether the Board of Trade could inform British shipping companies that if they delayed sending ships to Wusong, British trade would suffer greatly. The Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Shanghai had recently issued a notice designating safe locations and times for British ships to dock, and there was a barge service between Shanghai and Wusong, so shipping companies should not feel any difficulties. All of these points could be brought to the attention of shipping companies. Wallace replied that whether or not to send ships to Wusong was a matter to be decided by the shipping companies. When making this decision, shipping companies would of course consider factors such as the safety of ships and cargo and the amount of business. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

### US's Two Major Labor Unions Reconcile and Make Peace

### Japan Fears "Boycott"

American Bird Tottley Writes, Special Translation of Anglo-American Economic Weapons Can Stop Wars

World figures are now suggesting "boycott" as a technique to curb Japan's aggression in China. This "boycott" is indeed effective, because Japan has more vulnerable economic weaknesses than even Italy. Furthermore, Italy engaged in the conquest of Abyssinia after more than a decade of tranquility, nurturing its strength. What about Japan? It is already exhausted from suppressing 30 million people in Manchuria and consolidating its puppet state to guard against the Soviet Union. Then it attempts to conquer China. How easy is that? The difference between conquering Abyssinia and conquering China, where the whole country is united and determined to resist at any cost, is like heaven and earth.

In the first half of 1937, Japan's excess of imports over exports was greater than the total for the year of the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1924, almost reaching the total for the entire year of 1936. Even before the outbreak of war, exports were only two-thirds of imports. Because Japan lacks foreign investment, it has no way to make up for the trade deficit, so it can only ship out its already insufficient gold reserves to make ends meet.

The reason for Japan's huge trade deficit in 1936 and 1937 is not only the large quantities of metals and machinery needed for military procurement programs, but also the reduction in profits gained during the era of cheap raw materials since 1932, when labor costs were extremely low. In the last two years, the prices of cotton and wool worldwide have soared, and the cost of goods has risen accordingly. Therefore, last year, the quantity and value of Japanese textiles exported began to decrease and were becoming increasingly difficult to compete with and win.

The British Empire currently absorbs 18 percent of Japan's exports and supplies 31 percent of Japan's imports. The United States (excluding the Philippines) absorbs 22 percent and supplies 32 percent. Therefore, the British Empire and the United States together absorb half of Japan's exports and supply 63 percent of Japan's needs. Furthermore, the United States alone purchases 85 percent of Japan's exported raw silk. Raw silk is Japan's only export that does not rely on imported raw materials. In practical terms, Japan's entire social structure depends on the American silk market.

Japan's indispensable imports are oil from the United States and the Dutch East Indies, and iron and scrap iron from India, Malaya, and Australia. Although the Japanese Empire imports iron sand from abroad, its pig iron production, including Manchuria, reached a maximum of only 2.9 million tons in 1936. In that year, Britain produced 8 million tons, and Germany reached as high as 15 million tons. In 1936, Japan's steel production, including Manchuria, was only 5.5 million tons, while Britain had 11.8 million tons, and Germany had 6.2 million tons more than Britain. Japan's coal consumption is only one-fifth of Britain's. Japan's heavy industry is not as developed as its light industry. Japan cannot even manufacture cars itself, and many kinds of machinery must be supplied by Western countries.

Japan's main weakness in war is that its farmland is still cultivated using primitive methods, relying on animal power, and agricultural machinery is almost unknown. Therefore, although the yield per acre is high, the yield per person is extremely low. The hard work of a farming family throughout the year, even in peacetime, can only support their own family and two other families. Therefore, after transferring huge numbers of men from the agricultural areas into the army and women into factories manufacturing munitions, agricultural production will plummet. On the one hand, hundreds of thousands of troops stationed abroad must be continuously supplied with food, which will consume much more than when they were farming.

Japan has always relied on financial assistance from Western countries in every real war with foreign countries. Today, Japan's financial position is much worse than in any previous era of adversity. At the end of last year, it had to gradually lean towards currency inflation as a temporary measure. In April of this year, the prices of various goods sold at retail were almost double what they were before the abandonment of the gold standard in December 1931, although wages have fallen. Metal prices have risen by 76 percent since 1936, and textiles and fuels have also risen by 25 percent, while retail prices have risen by 30 percent. As a result, in the first four months of this year, strikes broke out everywhere due to difficult living conditions, reaching a record high. The large difference between the increase in retail and wholesale prices clearly indicates the difficult situation of small business owners and artisans.

The cost of living in Japan, even before this war, was increasing rapidly, largely due to the fact that Japan's budget proposals over the years have been in deficit. Since the Manchurian Incident, the deficit in the budget proposal has always been made up by raising debt, and the deficit has increased year by year. According to official estimates, this year's national expenditure will reach 2.872 trillion (each trillion is a million) yen, while regular income is only slightly more than 1.5 trillion yen. New debt supplies 965 trillion yen, and taxes supply 1.313 trillion yen, while the new expenses for the war against China are almost 5.5 trillion yen. It is estimated that income from taxes and national monopolies is currently less than one-third of expenditure. Another thing to note is that military spending is estimated based on a short-term war. It is estimated that the national income of the whole country in 1936 (according to the Mitsui Economic Research Institute) was only 13 trillion yen. National debt reached 11 trillion yen at the end of last year, while national expenditure was as high as 5.5 trillion yen. The significance of that is imaginable. The average annual income of each Japanese citizen is less than 200 yen, and the state now wants to take 40 percent of it. The instability of Japan's social system is the same as its economy. About half of the people are engaged in agriculture. (To be continued)

### General Plan for Establishing a Refugee Zone in Nanshi Drawn Up

Based on the Principle of Not Involving Political Negotiations, Police Authority and Order Are the Responsibility of Our Side

Regarding the issue of establishing a refugee zone in Nanshi, according to information obtained by this reporter from relevant parties, the relevant parties in Britain, the United States, and France are continuing to negotiate this matter, and it is expected that it will be realized in the near future. The motivation for this matter is entirely due to the fact that since the August 13th War of Resistance, the refugee areas in the concession area of this city have been filled with refugees who have no way to be accommodated. Therefore, the diplomatic authorities of the three countries in Shanghai, Britain, the United States, and France, and charitable organizations, specifically suggested to our municipal government that a portion of Nanshi be designated to accommodate as many war zone refugees as possible to maintain humanity. However, this matter will not harm our side's territorial sovereignty in the slightest. It is purely a refugee relief nature between countries. That is, after this matter matures, the security of the entire area will still be the responsibility of the police dispatched by our side, and no agreement will be signed. As for the location of the land and the matters of presiding over relief, it will be decided after detailed consultation.

Furthermore, the matter of establishing a refugee zone in Nanshi is now being actively promoted and will be established within a week. A reporter from the National Society visited a Westerner who initiated this matter yesterday to inquire about the progress of this matter. He was received and spoke in great detail about the development process and progress of this matter. He said that after the Shanghai War broke out, the war zone refugees were displaced and homeless, which was eye-catching. The concession area could not accommodate them, and most Westerners in this city were heartbroken to witness this. They discussed establishing a refugee zone outside the concession area to accommodate them. After many contacts, it has gradually become concrete, but this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished by the power of a few people. Therefore, it was decided that the consuls of various countries and enthusiastic Chinese and foreign people would jointly organize an international relief committee (not the International Relief Association) to take full responsibility for relief and other matters. The police authority in the area will still be the responsibility of the police dispatched by China. Once the war is over, it will be cancelled immediately. The progress of this matter is quite smooth. Once it is contacted with a certain party again, it can be formally established, and the date is about within a week.

### The Entire City of Zhabei Is Almost Reduced to a Scorched Earth

The Enemy Set Fire to It, a Miserable Sight, Few Undestroyed Houses

From the west of the Wuzhen Road Bridge to the Xinza Bridge, only the Tongkang Heng Nanhua Store has not been destroyed, because that place is a rice wharf, and all the rice shops have been completely burned down. The rice shops at the Pingba Ferry Crossing west of Xinguang Bridge (i.e., Huasheng Road), such as Dachang, Yuyuan, Changan Road intersection, Nanchuan Official Salt Zhabei Branch, Qingsheng, Rentai, Defeng, Yuanfeng, various rice shops, Minyi Rice Mill, Yuda, Juxing, Yongshun, Tong Shen, Hongchang, Tongxing Yong, and Gongda Rice Shop, Yixing Sack Shop, Fuxin First Flour Mill, Hengkang Rice Mill, and Taichang Rice Shop are all preserved.

The entire city of Guanbei is almost reduced to a scorched earth. Furthermore, near the Wuzhen Road Vegetable Market and the southern end of Hengfeng Road, the fire rekindled twice in succession from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The current fires are all self-ignited and self-extinguished.

### German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact

—宜

The German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact will be formally signed in Rome today. According to foreign電所transmitted by外電所. However, it is aimed at exchanging information on the activities of the Comintern and has no meaning of a military alliance. However, when world peace countries are deeply concerned about the wars in China and Spain. The announcement of the agreement between the three countries is also enough to reflect the common military intentions of Germany, Italy, and Japan.

It has long been clear that Germany, Italy, and Japan, due to their lack of self-國 resources, want to launch a war to redistribute the world. They raised the banner of "anti-communism" to use it as a smokescreen for war behavior. Litvinov said that the term "anti-communism" has the meaning of geology mineralogy涵涵涵. This seems to be a bit sarcastic. In fact, it is very appropriate. Can't we already see from the bloody reality. Are the coal mines, iron mines, cotton fields, and salt fields in northern China and the copper mines and zinc mines in Spain all related to "anti-communism"?

Of course. In the view of the authorities of the three countries. The pleasant term "anti-communism" can win the sympathy of other capitalist countries to some extent. However, the terrible actions that follow this term have not only made this sympathy impossible, but have also made other countries very disgusted with this kind of ideological movement. Because other countries are天at accelerating domestic unity to protect themselves. The anti-communist movement only causes domestic disasters.

Now, Minister Kong has allocated one million yuan and telegraphed the embassies of various countries to solicit donations from abroad, with a target of at least ten million yuan, with at least half of that amount to be raised first. This should be achievable. Today, all the committee members are very enthusiastic about providing relief to the refugees, and I am very grateful.

### All Sectors Enthusiastically Encourage the Subscription of Public Bonds

National Postal Workers Encourage the Subscription of Public Bonds

Since the government issued national salvation public bonds, the National Postal Workers' General Union immediately resolved that postal workers nationwide would subscribe to public bonds according to their salary rates, totaling approximately three million yuan. Recently, to actively promote the sale of public bonds, the union issued a circular to postmen nationwide, urging them to mobilize and encourage subscriptions. The text of the circular is as follows: "Since the government issued national salvation public bonds, the national populace has subscribed enthusiastically. However, the subscriptions are still far from the set amount. Our postmen comrades are numerous and their footprints are all over the country. Moreover, they have close relationships with people from all walks of life and good rapport. If postmen are tasked with encouraging subscriptions, the results will surely be considerable. According to a report from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, its postmen members have sold more than 200,000 yuan in national salvation public bonds in a mere ten days. The method involves the authorities distributing national salvation public bonds to the postmen, 50 yuan to each person at a time. After daily reporting and selling, they continue to receive supplements based on the amount sold. For example, if 30 yuan of public bonds are sold, in addition to submitting the 30 yuan in cash, they continue to receive 30 yuan of public bonds to make up the amount of 50 yuan. This method is simple, easy to implement, and highly effective. Therefore, we hereby instruct the unions in all localities to contact and handle this with the local subscription promotion agencies, and to further instruct the postmen members to mobilize and work hard to encourage subscriptions. This matter concerns the vital plan to save the nation. You must comply and report the handling situation at any time."

First and Second Special Districts Use Rent to Purchase Bonds

The First Special District Team of the National Salvation Public Bonds Citizen Subscription Promotion Corps held its third plenary meeting of directors and team leaders yesterday. The resolutions were as follows: ① Actively continue to encourage subscriptions to national salvation public bonds and national salvation savings; ② Promote the purchase of public bonds with rent: A. Recommend that the general association clearly stipulate methods for purchasing public bonds with rent to actively promote this; B. Send letters to the trust departments of various banks and the real estate industry association to investigate the actual situation of real estate in the district; C. Issue a letter to tenants, enthusiastically implementing the rent-for-public-bonds movement; ③ Team leaders of each team should maintain close contact with the deputy team leaders and detachment leaders of their team to increase the effectiveness of subscription promotion. Finally, the attending directors and team leaders reported and submitted their subscription promotion results separately.

The Sixth and Eighth District branches of the Citizens' United Association of the Second Special District of this city sent letters to the landlords in their districts yesterday regarding the purchase of public bonds with rent, requesting them to implement it voluntarily. The original letter is excerpted below: "Sir/Madam, Since the government issued national salvation public bonds, all sectors of this city have organized subscription promotion teams and worked hard to encourage subscriptions. At this time of full-scale resistance, striving for national independence and the survival of the nation, it is time to sacrifice one's family to relieve the nation's difficulties. Therefore, the subscription results of each team have been considerable in a short period of time. According to recent reports, your trade association has resolved to use one month's rent to purchase public bonds, entrusting the tenants to pay through the collecting bank and exchange the receipt for a rent ticket. This shows your patriotic enthusiasm, and we deeply admire your good intentions and beautiful methods. It is heard that the landlords of Hua'e Fang have long-term rent payments to purchase public bonds until the end of the war. Their patriotic sincerity is a model for landlords throughout the city. Other neighborhoods have also automatically implemented it on many occasions. Our association has now received inquiries from tenants in various neighborhoods in the district regarding the implementation methods, and requests that the owners be contacted to assist in the process. This matter concerns national salvation and survival, and should be assisted. In addition to printing and distributing the purchase methods to be promoted by the tenants, we have always admired your patriotism and you are never lagging behind. We hereby write to you to check, approve assistance, and hope to reply to facilitate the process."

### Several Important Issues in the North China War Situation

— Jin Zhonghua

In recent days, the development of the North China war situation has reached a new and serious stage. In northern Shanxi, the enemy forces were blocked by us in the Xinkou mountain area for three weeks. Now, the enemy forces have suddenly broken through our defenses and advanced to Xinxian. Our troops have retreated to Shilingguan. In eastern Shanxi, the enemy forces have again captured Yangquan and are pressing on Shouyang. The progress of the enemy forces on these two fronts has placed Taiyuan in a very urgent situation. The battle situation in eastern Shanxi is closely related to the military situation on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines. If our troops were to advance north along these two lines to launch a counterattack, the enemy forces attacking west along the Zhengtai Railway would certainly feel the danger to their rear and would have to halt their advance. However, although there have been repeated reports in recent days of a counterattack by our troops on these two fronts, in reality, the battle lines along both sides of the Zhanghe River and the Tuohai River have not changed much. Not only that, but the enemy forces on the Pinghan Railway have also captured Zhangde on the south bank of the Zhanghe River, which has also increased the seriousness of the situation in northern Henan. We believe that this development in the western and northern theaters of war is infinitely more serious than the movement of a small part of the battle line in the eastern theater of war, and we must not take it lightly in the slightest.

North China is the arena where we and the enemy will fight to the death, and Shanxi in particular is a key strategic location, as everyone knows. Therefore, many people have long pointed out that holding Shanxi and launching counterattacks on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines are two key steps to save the North China war situation. In the past few weeks, the enemy forces were mostly blocked at Xinkou, and the enemy transportation lines near Yanmenguan and Pingxingguan were cut off by our guerrillas. On the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, there have been repeated reports of counterattack progress, indicating that our strategy on these two fronts is unfolding step by step. But in this sudden change, why have such unfavorable situations been created in northern Shanxi, eastern Shanxi, and the Pinghan line? And what impact will this development have on the future prospects of the North China war situation? If the impact is quite serious, how will we further remedy it? These important issues must now be carefully examined.

We believe that the current reversal of the Shanxi war situation is not due to any strategic errors in the western theater, but is mainly affected by the northern theater. The fall of Shijiazhuang allowed the enemy to attack Niangziguan, threatening eastern Shanxi. Now that the enemy forces on the Zhengtai Railway are attacking fiercely to the west, northern Shanxi is naturally also affected. However, from the perspective of military development, the operations of our army on the Pinghan line are definitely not lacking in courage. The failure in this area is still due to two other reasons: one is that in this area, although our main forces can hold the front line and fight to the death, the flanks lack the coordination of mobile guerrillas and cannot contain the enemy's flanks and rear. Therefore, the fall of Shijiazhuang was due to the enemy crossing the Tuotuo River in Yecheng and attacking our rear. The abandonment of Niangziguan was due to the enemy breaking through Gu Guan, forcing us to retreat quickly. Another reason is that there is still a lack of coordination on several fronts in North China. For example, when the enemy concentrated its forces to attack eastern Shanxi, the enemy's reinforcements on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines were empty, but we failed to counterattack in time. This is especially obvious on the Jinpu line. In the past few days, the enemy forces have transferred a portion west to the Pinghan line and eastern Shanxi, and a portion north to Shanhaiguan to defend Manchuria. The enemy forces in front of the Jinpu line are only 2,000 people, and the rest are mostly puppet troops. At this time, we did not counterattack Cangxian and Dezhou from northern Shandong, but instead watched as the enemy forces in eastern Shanxi launched a full-scale attack. This is truly a major strategic oversight. This situation may be due to the fact that the several railways in North China have become unconnected vertical lines, so each line has become an independent combat unit. Perhaps there are other reasons as well. But we see that the enemy has used the advantages of the northern theater to make up for the failure of the western theater, and has used the lack of strong resistance on the Jinpu line to help break through our defenses on the Pinghan line. It can be seen that the enemy's operations on several fronts are mutually coordinated. The temporary setbacks of our army can be said to be due to this strategic oversight.

However, we believe that this temporary reversal of the situation will not cause a major adverse impact on the entire North China war situation. This can be seen from the fact that our army's courage to resist is only stronger than before. At the same time, in the speeches of our highest military and political authorities, it has been repeatedly pointed out that even if we retreat to the Yellow River line, we can still resolutely resist. It can be seen that the movement of these one or two defense lines will absolutely not affect our plan to resist to the end. In particular, we know that at present, if the enemy wants to attack Taiyuan, it must still cross the Shilingguan in the north and the mountainous area around Shouyang in the east. To the southwest of Taiyuan, there is still half of Shanxi. In the overlapping mountains, many defense lines can be deployed to prevent the enemy's advance.

However, at the moment, after a reversal of the situation, it is also very important that we do our best to remedy it militarily. This, of course, is already being considered and quickly arranged by our military and political authorities. If we want to put forward a few special points of attention, then strengthening the unified command of the military in North China, so that the development of several battle lines can be coordinated, is the most important thing. Furthermore, a broader coordination of main force warfare and guerrilla warfare, so that it is not limited to northern Shanxi, is also very necessary. In addition, we should politically guarantee the rights of the ethnic minorities in our northwestern border, so that they will not be instigated and used by the enemy. This is also worth noting. We must know that if the enemy is able to reach the Yellow River and control the situation in Shanxi, their aggression will never stop, but will continue to advance westward and continue to expand their boundless ambitions. The Chinese proverb 'After acquiring Long, one desires Shu' coincides with the enemy's invasion plan. Therefore, in any case, we must give the enemy the most violent blow in every advance. In particular, we must use the lessons of failure to quickly remedy the shortcomings of the past military, strengthen the strength of the operation, and sweep the enemy out.

### General Liao Talks About the War of Resistance

Heroic Sacrifices Demonstrate Vigorous Morale, Charge Forward to Strive for Final Victory

Central News Agency reports: After struggling through muddy mountain trails in the desolate autumn scenery, and walking for about two or three hours, we finally arrived safely at our destination. There, we met General Liao, who led tens of thousands of brave soldiers on a long journey to participate in the war in the eastern theater. He has a burly physique, a tall stature, and even more so, a resolute and courageous spirit, and a kind and approachable attitude, fully revealing his noble and great personality. After the reporter shook hands with him to express his respect, we talked about their journey to Shanghai to participate in the war. Now, I will give a faithful report of his conversation. He said, 'Resisting Japan is the only way for the Chinese nation to seek liberation and survival. The Japanese imperialists are oppressing and infringing upon us more and more every day. They will not give us a moment's or a place's peace until they have completely destroyed our entire nation. Therefore, we only have to hold on to the determination to sacrifice, the determination to sacrifice to the end, and fight the enemy, so that the enemy realizes that we cannot be subdued by force.

After the launch of the full-scale war of resistance, the anti-Japanese sentiment in our entire province reached a boiling point. Armed comrades scrambled to request to go out to kill the enemy. The military authorities were almost unable to cope, and it was later decided to use a lottery method to select × division to come to participate in the war. When we stepped onto the front line, the enemy was beginning its sixth general offensive. The enemy first used its abundant munitions to destroy our defenses. The bombs dropped numbered in the hundreds every day, and the shells fired by enemy artillery numbered in the thousands every day. But we are not afraid at all, and we are willing to give our lives. In particular, the lower-level officers took the lead, charging into battle, regarding death as home. Even under the fierce artillery fire of the enemy, not only did they not retreat, but they charged forward one after another. Therefore, the losses we have suffered this time are very heavy. But such heroic sacrifices are proving our vigorous morale and determination to resist the war, so that the enemy cannot easily gain an inch of progress. But the enemy has not yet been wiped out, and we must hold on to the determination to sacrifice to the end, step onto the road of resistance and liberation washed by the blood of the martyrs, and charge forward to strive for final victory.' General Liao repeated this with a firm and affirmative tone, which gave the reporter a very deep impression. When I was writing this, his resolute and courageous attitude was still deeply imprinted in my mind.

### Korean Restoration Movement

Concentrate Anti-Japanese Forces and Organize United Groups to Restore the Territory of the Three Hans and Fight for Freedom in East Asia

Guomin News Agency reports: At this time when the enemy is pressing closer, invading our territory, killing our compatriots, and their ambitions are burning ever more brightly, the Korean revolutionary forces are rising day by day. It is learned that the various revolutionary and national salvation organizations of that country, in order to concentrate their strength and resist the oppression of the enemy, have specially organized the 'Joint Propaganda Committee of Korean Restoration Movement Organizations' and issued a declaration to promote independence. The details of this declaration are recorded below: "The issue of Korean independence, at the meeting of the Sino-Japanese War, with the trend of epoch-making, is increasingly prominent in the diplomatic arena. All eyes are on us. People say that the Korean revolutionary force is both China's greatest ally and Japan's greatest enemy. This is what those with a modern perspective have in common. How can the Korean nation, which is at the forefront of the conflict, not be aware of this? In order to advocate the independence of our motherland and uphold the interests of our friendly nations, we have launched attacks on Japan for decades with our experiences and struggles, without interruption. We have never relaxed our connection with friendly nations, and we have exhausted our pens and tongues to encourage cooperation and plan for unity. Fortunately, we have received the support of our friendly parties at home and abroad, and the support of comrades from all walks of life in China. In the past few months, we have actively planned and cooperated, and gathered the talents and plans of comrades from nine groups, including the Korean Overseas Associations of the Far East and North and South America, the National Association, the Korean Patriotic Corps, the Korean Women's Relief Association, the Korean Revolutionary Party, the Korean Nationalist Party, and the Korean Independence Party. We have divided the work and cooperated, vowing to reduce the enemy. We have already issued a declaration, and in order to conduct joint propaganda, we have specially organized a joint agency, named the Joint Propaganda Committee of Korean Restoration Movement Organizations. Various publications will be issued soon (omitted). We hope to provide our friendly nations and revolutionary comrades of small and weak nations, arouse international public opinion, punish the violent Japan, vow to avenge the shame of both countries, and restore our lost land. This is the immediate task that our association bears. We hope that our comrades on the same battle line and friendly government officials, civilians, farmers, businessmen, students, and soldiers who protect the country and resist the Japanese will work together, respond in unison, eliminate the greedy wild boars and long snakes, restore the territory of our motherland, fight for freedom in East Asia, and create justice for mankind. This is our declaration. November, Great Korean Republic, year 19, year 4270."

### Huiqun Girls' School Cares for Affected Former Students

Receiving Half or Free Tuition

After the Huiqun Girls' Middle School was completely destroyed, the school authorities, out of concern for the schooling of affected students, rented school buildings at No. 36 Xibaile Village, Maho Road, Aiduya Road, and gathered former students to start school. However, the students in the Tilanqiao area were more severely affected by the disaster, and most of them were unable to study. The school authorities believed that the students had suffered losses due to the war and their studies were about to be abandoned. Therefore, for former students, their families can write to the school stating the disaster situation and that they cannot afford the tuition fees, and request half or free tuition. The school authorities will approve it based on their circumstances to ensure that all former students can continue their studies and that their families are not affected financially. However, school has been in session for a long time, and if it is delayed any longer, it will affect the ministry's orders and admissions will be stopped.

### Robbers Frequently Harassing Huining Road, Nanshi

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, most of the residents of Nanshi have returned to their hometowns or taken refuge in safe areas, resulting in nine out of ten houses being empty, or only one or two people left to guard the house. Therefore, thefts occur from time to time. Recently, hooligans have been blatantly extorting and robbing. During the day, such as in Kuangan Lane, West Huining Road, they tied up the gatekeeper, confined him to a room, and robbed all the machinery and goods of the Hexing Knitting Factory in the lane. In addition, the remaining coal and equipment of the Dongsheng, Honghua Dyeing Factory, and Tianfu Silk Edge Factory on the road were also moved away. Residents in areas such as Huai Ren Lane and Wulin Lane have also experienced similar incidents.

### Enemy Troops on the South Bank of the Suzhou Creek Attempted Several Breakouts Last Night, All in Vain

Enemy at Liujiazhai Still Surrounded on Three Sides by Our Forces.  Fierce Fighting at Zhujiahang Until Dawn, Enemy Suffering Heavy Casualties.  Enemy Troops Advancing Southeast of Xiaonancang Were Repelled

This newspaper received a frontline battle report this afternoon stating that the focus of the battle is still on the right flank and the central front, especially the Suzhou Creek South, where the battle is most intense. Since last night until this morning, the enemy troops have repeatedly attempted to break through to the south, but were all intercepted by our forces. At the time of the report, the battle was still developing fiercely. The battle situation is as follows: ㊀ After sneaking in reinforcements, the enemy at Liujiazhai is stronger than before, so they attempted to break out to the south several times last night. They were severely blocked on three sides by our forces and are still confined between Liujiazhai and Beigongjiazhai. ㊁ The enemy troops in the Yaojiazhai to Wujiaku area are still holding the area north of Zhujiahang. Last night, they also launched several attacks on our army's position at Bazibridge south of the river, but were all met with fierce fighting by our army. The fierce fighting continued until dawn this morning, when the enemy, suffering heavy casualties, collapsed and retreated. Our army is still holding the line along Zhujiahang to Bazibridge, northwest to Tianduzhai. ㊂ From yesterday afternoon to zero o'clock this morning, the enemy artillery unit on the north bank continuously shelled the Luobiegen Road area, but most of the shells landed in the fields, so our losses were minimal. ㊃ The enemy troops southeast of Xiaonancang launched a strong attack on Zhongguitang and Haolou yesterday evening, attempting to cut off our connection between Jiangqiao Town and Xiaonancang. They were all repelled by our army. There was only minor contact on the Guangfu to Shixianggong Temple line. There were no changes in the enemy's and our army's positions.

Enemy Single-Winged Giant Seaplane Reconnoitering Nanshi

At around 8:00 AM this morning, two enemy planes circled and reconnoitered in the Yangjing Town, Lanidu, and Yangjiadu areas of Pudong, dropping more than a dozen bombs.

### Brussels Conference to Discuss Draft of Reply to Japan This Morning

Central News Agency, Brussels, 6th: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a meeting on the morning of the 5th to discuss the reply to Japan. A compromise on the draft of the reply has not yet been reached. Spak, Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, spent the afternoon of the 5th preparing a new draft. Important representatives from various countries exchanged views on the draft that evening. If the representatives can reach a compromise, the conference will discuss it on the morning of the 6th. Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of our country attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, remained silent at the morning meeting on the 5th because he had clearly stated our country's position at the meeting on the 3rd. Gu felt that it was unnecessary to hinder the progress of the conference until Japan clearly clarified its attitude and that the general attitude expressed by the representatives of various countries at the morning meeting on the 5th was fair. However, the press here believes that the future of the conference does not seem optimistic. Some newspapers commented on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in a satirical tone, calling it the "Brussels Non-Intervention Committee."

### Rumor That Italy Has Expressed Neutrality to Our Government Regarding the Sino-Japanese War

Germany, Italy, and Japan Sign Anti-Comintern Pact and Italian-Japanese Trade Agreement Today

Central News Agency, Rome, 6th, Reuters: Regarding the signing of the anti-communist pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Italian government is said to have expressed to the Chinese government that Italy will not aid Japan in the current Sino-Japanese conflict and will maintain complete neutrality. Although Italian newspapers have expressed sympathy for Japan, recognizing Japan's actions in China as anti-communist in nature, the government said that Italy is willing to maintain friendship with both sides. The German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact will be signed at 11:00 AM this morning at the Venice Palace, the residence of Prime Minister Mussolini. German Ambassador to the UK Ribbentrop has arrived in Rome and will sign on behalf of the German government. The Italian side will be signed by Mussolini himself, and the Japanese representative is the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Horita. Upon the arrival of the German representative, news was released here calling him a special envoy of the German leader. It is also said that negotiations on the Italian-Japanese trade agreement have been going on for several months and will now be signed at the same time. The clauses include Japan buying cotton from Abyssinia in exchange for Japanese manufactured goods. Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th, Reuters: A special plenary meeting of the Privy Council will be held at 10:00 AM this morning in the Imperial Palace to formally review the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. Afterward, the cabinet will convene a special meeting to pass the necessary procedures, and then submit it to the Emperor for approval before telegraphing the Japanese Ambassador in Rome to sign the order. The original text of the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact can be announced around 10:00 PM tonight.

### Our Delegation Denies German Mediation

National Maritime News Agency, Brussels, 6th: The news released by the American News Agency that parties from both China and Japan have requested the German leader Hitler to mediate has caused great surprise among those attending the conference here. The truth of this news cannot be confirmed. The spokesman for the Chinese delegation declared late last night that the above news is completely unfounded, a blatant fabrication, and a distortion of the truth. Central News Agency, Brussels, 5th, Havas: The diplomatic circles here were quite shocked to hear about the German government mediating the dispute between China and Japan. Well-informed sources recalled that when Germany previously refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it stated, "Whenever several indispensable preconditions are met, Germany will be prepared to cooperate in order to peacefully resolve the dispute between China and Japan." Therefore, everyone is asking whether Germany is waiting for a favorable opportunity to conduct arbitration work alone, so that collective action will be dwarfed. However, since the beginning of the dispute between China and Japan, although Germany has not expressed any ill will towards China, the German diplomatic authorities also hope to act alone and achieve success, so that collective action will be dwarfed. However, since Germany and Japan have already established an anti-communist agreement, Germany is no longer qualified to be an arbitrator in the dispute between China and Japan. In addition, Germany is afraid that it does not want to directly initiate anything, causing it to confront the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the proposal for mediation may not become a reality. On the Chinese delegation's side, there is no news of mediation. The diplomatic circles in this city also believe that China trusts collective action to confront Japan and will not accept the proposal for mediation, which would run counter to the United Kingdom and the United States.

### Jiang and Cheng Arrive in Brussels

They then flew to Jiyang and dropped four bombs, injuring three civilians and destroying more than twenty civilian houses. At 1:30 PM, an enemy plane flew over Linyi, Jiyang, Qingcheng, Zouping, Zhoucun, and other places to reconnoiter and dropped six bombs in Jiyang, destroying three civilian boats and injuring two people.

### Brief Commentary

— Face

According to general observation, the current situation is divided into two major camps: one is pacifist, and the other is anti-pacifist. The two camps are quite solid, especially the new "Anti-Comintern" pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, which is scheduled to be signed today, further proving that this statement is not false.

Whether the pacifist front is solid or not is not discussed here. Only the anti-pacifist front is discussed. Under certain circumstances, it is possible or necessary for Japan, Germany, and Italy to unite. However, this kind of combination is outwardly consistent but inwardly conflicted and by no means consistent.

The international landscape of alliances is constantly changing at all times. Now Japan wants to implement its continental policy, so it does not hesitate to be obsequious and unite with Germany and Italy. On the one hand, it restrains the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Russia. On the other hand, it can achieve its long-cherished goals. Germany and Italy are "making wedding clothes for others," and the result is not only nothing gained but also harms the friendly feelings of the third party, which is not worth it.

Moreover, international credibility is unreliable. During the European War, Germany should have recognized Japan's face. When the assassination of the Austrian heir occurred, Italy deployed troops in the northern border and recognized Italy's true intentions. From the previous history, infer future changes. Now that Germany and Italy are being used by Japan, and when Germany and Italy want to use Japan in the future, what attitude will Japan take?

With the Germans' sharp eyes, how can they not know the Japanese conspiracy, tricks, and fickleness? Therefore, Germany did not want to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference this time to avoid our country's misunderstanding. Did it already see through the enemy's intentions?

### Enemy Propaganda Threatens Peace-Loving Countries by Announcing War Against Us

Coercing the Brussels Conference to Go Through the Motions in Order to Achieve Its Goal of Direct Negotiations

[Nanjing] In recent days, the enemy has spread the news of declaring war on us and organizing a wartime headquarters, creating a great momentum and causing a stir. According to an observer, this kind of action by the enemy, regardless of whether it will become a reality in the future, is at least a smokescreen at the moment. The enemy is well aware of the international disputes caused by a formal declaration of war and the various disadvantages to itself. However, it must be after the United Kingdom and the United States express thorough cooperation on the Far East issue and the opening of this capital conference that the news of a formal declaration of war is spread. The purpose is nothing more than to show: ㊀ The dispute is becoming more complicated, and the scope of the war will expand, in order to threaten peace-loving countries. ㊁ Coerce this capital conference to abandon the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty, or even if the meeting is held, it will go through the motions, so that China and Japan can negotiate directly outside the meeting. In addition to the consistent propaganda expressing that the Sino-Japanese dispute will never be interfered with by a third party, in the meeting, it will ask its friendly countries to strongly advocate direct negotiations. The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun once published an article from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticizing the Brussels Conference, predicting that "a small committee will be organized to go through the motions and quietly observe the changes in the situation, and then come out when there is an appropriate opportunity." Therefore, it is doing everything possible to prevent the arrival of "appropriate opportunities." This is why the atmosphere of declaring war on us and organizing a headquarters has become increasingly strong recently. As for our country, which has been invaded by the enemy, and whose diplomatic relations have not been severed, has long suffered the pain of destruction. Whether to declare war or not makes no difference. In addition to defending the territory of the country and resisting aggression and tyranny for the sake of human justice, we sincerely hope that peace-loving countries will not be misled by the enemy's propaganda, and we hope that the Brussels Conference will follow the spirit of the Washington Conference and not let the Nine-Power Treaty become a useless historical precedent.

### On the Way to the Front Line

— Central News Agency War Correspondent Communication, Shi Heng

—From Nanjing to Jinan—

Since the enemy planes have肆 recklessly bombed, the feelings among compatriots have become more and more intimate. We often miss the people living in other places with great concern, just as if they were our relatives and friends. The threat of enemy planes has turned into a kind of affinity in the mutual feelings of compatriots.

The reporter's brief record of the situation in a few places on the way to the front line will probably also be welcomed by readers.

First of all, I would like to say to the countless people in various places who care about Nanjing, our mother's capital is safe and sound, and it will always be so. Some people compare it to the second Madrid, which is inappropriate. However, the people who can still happily live in the capital's embrace now, please cherish yourselves and do not fail the compatriots who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines.

On the afternoon of October 21, before leaving from Pukou, there was an enemy plane bombing, which was regarded as a farewell to the reporter.

The passengers in the car were always on guard against air raids, and they could not sleep all night in the anxiety of being nervous. But thank God, except that the car was running slower than usual, it did not experience any unexpected events. The next morning, when it was getting light, it arrived in Xuzhou safely.

It was originally planned to stay in Xuzhou for a day or two, where there is Chen Lingya, the correspondent of this newspaper stationed in Xuzhou. Everything was taken care of by him, and there was no trouble of feeling unfamiliar.

When you walk out of Xuzhou Station, you can see the remains of the enemy plane's violent bombing. On the west side of Jinpu Station, several shops on the most prosperous main road in Xuzhou have remnants of being bombed.

On the east side of the station is Zifang Mountain, which was probably a scenic spot in peaceful times. However, because of the special visit of enemy planes on August 30, it has now become a field of rubble. Visiting this site seems to be the first thing that should be done in Xuzhou. So I made an appointment with Chen Jun to go together. It just so happened that Chen Jun had agreed to the American news reporter the day before to take a few photos for the purpose of exposing the cruelty of the enemy army to the international community.

Zifang Mountain is named after the Zifang Temple on the mountain. It is said that during the Chu-Han Contention, Zhang Liang played the flute to break the Chu soldiers. There are now more than 2,000 households on the mountain, probably accounting for one-tenth of the total population of Xuzhou. As soon as we approached the foot of the mountain, we could望 see the broken walls and ruins above, which could not help but make people feel desolate. Almost nine out of ten houses on the mountain are empty, and there is no sign of people.

It is said that August 30 was the first bombing of Xuzhou, and it was completely unexpected. At about dusk, twelve planes flew in formation from the northwest, but there was no air raid alarm. At that time, troops were stationed in the Zifang Temple, and soldiers and civilians were all taking shelter in a pavilion in front of the Zifang Temple. Because there was no alarm, everyone believed that it must be our country's planes. We can easily imagine how happy the military and civilians in the inland were when they saw their own planes, but when they flew over their heads, the planes suddenly changed their faces, bombs and machine gun strafing followed down, and sixty or seventy houses were destroyed in this bombing, and the number of casualties was always over 150.

The tragic state at that time is difficult to describe for those who have not been there. A family of more than ten people who were engineers on the Jinpu Railway were all crushed under the collapsed brick walls and roofs. Another five- or six-year-old girl who was hiding in the house poked her head out of the house after hearing the first wave of explosions, but at this time she was hit by fragments of a newly dropped bomb, and her intestines were blown out. The soldiers and civilians who were taking shelter in the pavilion in front of the Zifang Temple escaped the bombs, but did not escape the machine gun strafing.

The Zifang Temple was rebuilt in the early Qing Dynasty and still preserves the inscriptions written by Emperor Qianlong when he went to the south. Although this ancient temple was the target of the bombing, it only suffered minor damage. The majestic statue of Zifang in the main hall is still intact, perhaps because of his divine protection. The statues of the land god and Maitreya Buddha in the side hall are not considered spiritual. In particular, the Maitreya Buddha with a big belly that says "hehe haha," his belly has been split into two sections.

The most tragic families that were bombed were next to the Zifang Temple. We chose a relatively complete one and walked in, but we could not see anything. Only an empty house shell remained. What is most touching is that there are still a few pigeons that people used to raise in this empty house. Pigeons, the symbol of peace, are you also scared out of your wits? Why do you fly away in such a panic when you hear people's footsteps? In an empty house, we also found a two-foot-long, still intact portrait of an old woman. Dear old woman, are you sitting there alone because you are reluctant to leave your old home, or者 are you really so stubborn that you are waiting for the enemy planes to come again, ready to die with the enemy?

The air defense equipment in Xuzhou is certainly not as good as that in the capital, so enemy planes can fly very low without fear. Therefore, many legends about enemy planes flying low have spread among the villagers in the vicinity. Of course, these are not very reliable, and some are even impossible. But from these legends, we can see how bold the enemy planes are in general villages and towns, compared to their cowardly sneaking into the high altitude of Nanjing, hiding in the clouds, and fleeing in a panic when they hear the sound of anti-aircraft guns. The way they look is really heaven and earth.

In various rural areas, there are earthen buildings built to defend against bandits, which at most are as high as ordinary three-story buildings in the city. Now, they are used as shelters, with branches or leaves placed on top. Who knows that this shelter is really redundant. When the enemy planes fly past, they often sweep away those shelters completely, and even the removed branches are hung on the fuselage. A villager lying on his back in the field can望 see the enemy plane's pilot, and he is sure that he saw the pilot's beard on his face. Under the cruel and shameless bombing of the enemy planes, the people cannot just be imprisoned in terror. It is true and half-fabricated to create some legends that are terrifying and a bit funny, which are intended to be used as a basis for jokes when they are relatively free, as a mutual comfort, right? Xuzhou is the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai railways and is an important place for transportation and military affairs. It is natural for enemy planes to visit often. The alarm goes off at least two or three times a day. Enemy planes often pass by and do not drop bombs here. In fact, apart from the station, which is the target of its bombing, there is nothing else to bomb.

On this day when the reporter was in Xuzhou, he also encountered a small bombing. When the alarm was issued, Chen Jun and I were walking near the station, so we had to temporarily take shelter in an air raid shelter built by the road workers next to the station. Two loud noises followed the sound of the planes, which shook our ears and made us feel as if the bombs had fallen nearby. After the investigation, we found out that there was still a considerable distance. One bomb fell in front of the Army Hospital, and one bomb fell in the courtyard of the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company. They were all very small bombs, leaving two small caves and collapsing a few houses. One piece of bomb fragment penetrated five inches deep into the tree trunk. Although it was said to be a very small bomb, the sound and destructive power were quite impressive. (To be continued)

### New Hong Kong Governor's Statement on the Sino-Japanese War

Hoping for an Early End to the China Crisis

Hong Kong Correspondence: The newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffry Northcote, commissioned by the British government, arrived in Hong Kong on the 28th at 9:00 AM aboard the British ship "Ranchi" with his wife. The Hong Kong government prepared an official ceremony to welcome them ashore. At 10:00 AM, the new Governor disembarked at Queen's Pier amidst cheers and shook hands with officials and gentry. A military parade was held, and then he proceeded by car to the Government House. At 11:15 AM, he was formally sworn in as Governor at the Legislative Council. At noon, he attended a public welcome reception at the Entertainment Theatre. At the reception, the new Governor made a statement regarding the war between the two major Far Eastern nations. While he did not criticize right or wrong, he hoped that the League of Nations could find a way to resolve the dispute and that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference would achieve positive results. At the end of his speech, he advocated for working together with neighboring countries. An excerpt of the new Governor's speech follows: "Having just listened to the public's welcome address, I will begin with the concluding remarks, which stated that people from all sectors in Hong Kong will sincerely cooperate with me in the future. I believe this is the fundamental issue for us. As I take up the position of Governor of Hong Kong under the Emperor's command, I am confident that I will be able to gain the full cooperation of the people of Hong Kong to solve various difficult problems. I am deeply moved by your warm reception, as cooperation between the government and the people is the key to success. Therefore, my belief in this is even stronger. Hong Kong's hard work and progress over the past few years are admired by the British at home and abroad. Hong Kong has opened its doors wide to welcome refugees, and I express my sympathy and would like to take this opportunity to extend my condolences to the refugees staying in Hong Kong. In these turbulent times, with two major countries engaged in war, I do not wish to comment on the rights and wrongs of this incident. However, the Far East Advisory Committee of the League of Nations is making its utmost effort to find a solution to this massacre and destruction of humanity, which you are all well aware of. I, along with you, earnestly hope that the Brussels Conference will proceed smoothly so that the crisis in China's development today can be extinguished. Of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty, none is making more effort towards this goal than the British Empire. Hong Kong can certainly contribute to this, and let us do our best to follow through. I am fortunate to be able to continue the legacy of my predecessor, Sir Andrew Caldecott. Sir Caldecott's character and policies have gained the trust and cooperation of the people of Hong Kong, as far as I know. From what I see today, there is no more important principle in governance than continuing the policies of the past. It would be undesirable for a new governor to overturn the policies that the previous governor had worked on for years. Therefore, I will administer Hong Kong's affairs along the lines I have mentioned above, and I believe we will all agree.

Regarding the specific policies and plans adopted by Hong Kong, it is not appropriate to announce them at this grand gathering. However, I will closely examine the points just mentioned in the welcome address and the final words of advice that Sir Caldecott gave in the Legislative Council. I would especially like to highlight the most important point that Sir Caldecott made, which is friendship with our neighbors. I would like to take this opportunity to express my determination to continue in Sir Caldecott's footsteps with my utmost effort. I have just said that I am deeply grateful for the willingness of all sectors to cooperate fully. I now express my sincere gratitude to you all and wish to work with you to live up to the expectations of His Majesty the King. Hong Kong is an important British overseas territory and is of great importance to world commerce. Therefore, I am determined to do my best to achieve genuine prosperity and fulfill my responsibilities. I am confident that with God's blessing, in a few years, we will place our hopes on flourishing prosperity."

### Enemy Planes Ravage Changshu

Air Raid Alerts Sounded Over Twenty Times in One Day - A Monk Falsely Reports Multiple Bombs Hitting Xiaolang Temple

Changshu Correspondence: After the enemy troops occupied Zhabei and Zhenru, the enemy planes bombed the rear areas and non-combatant counties even more severely than before. On the afternoon of November 28th, this area had already been ravaged five times. The people of the city, mindful of the enemy planes' atrocities in the Songjiang area in recent days, were on high alert and flocked to the countryside for temporary shelter. The city was desolate, with few pedestrians on the streets, creating a very bleak scene. On the 29th, enemy planes continued to fly over the city, and the air defense authorities sounded air raid alerts more than twenty times throughout the day. However, the enemy planes seemed to be scouting and did not drop any bombs. Only at around 10:00 AM, when passing over the Yanqing Bridge outside Xiaodongmen, several farmers happened to be working in the fields. The enemy planes immediately strafed them with machine guns, but the farmers managed to take cover and were unharmed. On the 31st, it was cloudy and rainy all day, and no enemy planes were seen, providing a day of peace. The next morning, the weather cleared, and from 11:15 AM to 2:30 PM, air raid alerts were sounded seven times. Most of the enemy planes flew directly over from north to south. In Xinzhuang Village in the southern countryside, there were many stacks of rice, large and small, of varying heights. The enemy planes, suspecting they were some kind of equipment, strafed them with machine guns for a long time before continuing south. The most hateful thing was that at Xiaolang Temple, located at the junction of Changshu, Suzhou, and Wuxi, the monk of the temple had engaged in immoral behavior, and the local people expelled him and appointed another abbot. The monk, harboring resentment, falsely reported to the enemy that the temple contained certain military equipment. The enemy believed him and sent planes to bomb the temple, resulting in multiple hits. This kind of ridiculous act is truly laughable. It was previously rumored that Dang Kou was bombed, but this was a misreport of this incident.

### The Current Pressing Tasks of the War of Resistance

— Liu Yucai

The aggression against China by the world's robber, Japanese imperialism, has been a decades-long ambition and a matter of fact, which cannot be denied. Since the September 18th Incident, they have successively occupied our four northeastern provinces. Recently, the Lugouqiao Incident led to the capture of Peiping and Tianjin, revealing their deliberate intention to occupy the entire North China and then coerce Central and South China. The outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13th even more strikingly exposed the enemy's insatiable greed and attempt to take an inch after getting a foot. This is merely a sharpening of the enemy's delusion to realize their continental policy. Conversely, it is enough to accelerate the collapse and gradual elimination of their power in China! In other words, this is precisely the period for China and the enemy to settle blood debts, thereby breaking free from decades of trampling and oppression and finally gaining the opportunity for final victory!

Our nation's soldiers and civilians, facing the enemy's invasion and fierce fighting, must first recognize that the enemy's military force is not to be feared. Under the leadership of the government, we must work together with one heart and one mind, each doing our best, to fully unleash our people's self-defense power to fight to the death against the enemy! Then victory will surely belong to us. It is not enough for everyone to go to the front lines to be considered resisting the war. We must each do our part to participate in various war resistance and national salvation efforts. The wartime services of people's organizations that everyone can see now can be said to be only a very small part. The war of resistance in Shanghai has been going on for more than two months. Shanghai has more than three million citizens. Apart from foreign nationals, the elderly, women, and children, there are at least more than two million people. If such a number is organized, trained, and joined in wartime work, I dare say that the strength of the people in the rear in resisting the war will exceed the current results by tens or hundreds of times. It is a pity that this immense force has not yet been concretely mobilized and planned. Secondly, regarding the war resistance services of the people in the rear areas, we still feel that they are very thin and insufficient. Although high-ranking and capable personnel in various fields are initiating them there, they are still not effectively and fully manifested. From this point of view, the current remedial measures should actively promote the following tasks, which are urgent and cannot be delayed:

First: Taking Shanghai as a starting point, the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association should issue a general order to the propaganda teams of various legal wartime national salvation organizations to be separately organized into mobile propaganda teams to actively exert their propaganda power in various places.

Second: The personnel currently responsible for promoting wartime work in various places must intensify their work, quickly organize and train a large number of people in the rear, and guide their various service guidelines to increase the efficiency of war resistance.

Third: Under the leadership of the government, organize armed groups of people in various provinces, cities, counties, and villages, actively implement military training, and if necessary, strengthen the military power of the front lines. At the very least, they can eliminate traitors in the rear, which indirectly weakens the enemy's power of aggression.

Fourth: Under the auspices of local administrative agencies, launch a permanent economic boycott against Japan to strangle the enemy's foreign trade, which indirectly causes economic panic in the enemy's country and deals a major blow to the warmongers.

The above-mentioned items are all urgent war resistance tasks that need to be worked on, and none of them are positive steps to save the nation and ensure its survival. The national crisis has reached this point, and it is time for our compatriots to destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis and sacrifice themselves to save the country. It is not permissible to stand idly by and seek temporary comfort. Only by having the national militia practically participate in the war of resistance can we win national survival and freedom, and only a national revolutionary war of resistance can achieve final victory!
