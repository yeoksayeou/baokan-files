[Tokyo] Since the return of Ambassador Kawagoe from China, Foreign Minister Sato has held meetings with representatives from the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs ministries. Based on Ambassador Kawagoe's report, preparations are being made to adjust diplomatic relations with China. Other cabinet members also wish to hear Kawagoe's report on the situation in China. Therefore, after Army Minister Sugiyama and Finance Minister Yūki return to Tokyo, Ambassador Kawagoe will attend a cabinet meeting to report in detail on the current state of China and the attitude of the Chinese government. The Japanese government, in light of last year's Sino-Japanese negotiations, is preparing for negotiations this time with a cautious attitude, aiming to avoid any regrets. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is studying its policy towards China based on Ambassador Kawagoe's report, to ensure thoroughness, they will hold another meeting of the three ministries after Councilor Morishima returns to Japan on the 25th to consider his report. They will review a policy towards China centered on reciprocity and equality, and formally decide on instructions to be personally delivered by Foreign Minister Sato to Ambassador Kawagoe. Kawagoe will depart from Tokyo on the 5th of next month to return to his post, and will begin negotiations with the Chinese authorities to adjust diplomatic relations in accordance with the Foreign Minister's instructions.

### Special Envoy Kong's Speech on Central Bank Reorganization

Welcoming International Assistance in Developing Resources; British Trade Secretary Praises China's Completion of New Currency System

[London] Today, the China Association and the Federation of British Industries hosted a banquet for the Chinese special envoy Kong Xiangxi and Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi, among others. During the banquet, Kong delivered a speech requesting that all countries cooperate with China to develop its resources for the sake of mutual benefit and world peace. He stated that British merchants have a vast "garden" in China, not only because China has a large population but also because China has abundant raw materials. However, what China needs is capital and scientific knowledge, which Britain has provided to China in the past. Some of China's national income has now increased severalfold, and tariff surpluses are also considerable. If the country develops further, China's tariffs could be five times greater in ten years. China is rich in resources but lacks development, so the Chinese government and people welcome British merchants. Then, British Secretary for Trade Inskip responded, saying that what Britain admired most about China was its ability to adhere to sound monetary principles. He continued, "You have been able to complete the reform of a unified currency system in a short period of one and a half years. Your country's commerce has shown rapid progress in the past year, and the future possibilities are truly great." (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

[London] The China Association hosted a banquet this evening for the members of the Chinese delegation attending the coronation ceremony of the British King. The event was chaired by the association's chairman, Earl Winterton. Guests included the Chinese special envoy and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, British Secretary for Trade Inskip, Lord Lee of Fareham, Chinese Deputy Envoy and Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi, Lord Ponsonby, Chinese Deputy Envoy and Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, Secretary-General of the Chinese Delegation Weng Wenhao, Councilors Guo Bingwen and Zhang Fuyun, British Minister without Portfolio Runcieman, Chinese Military Attachés Gui Yongqing, Wen Yingxing, and Lin Xianxin, former British Ambassador to China Cadogan, Vice Admiral Dreyer, Under-Secretary for Overseas Trade Wallace, Government Financial Advisor Sir Otto Niemeyer, Councilor of the Chinese Delegation Zhu Changnian, Chairman of the Board of the Carlowitz Company Wut Luo Tian, Chairman of the Chinese Purchasing Commission Wang Jingchun, Manager of the London Branch of the Bank of China Li De Yu, staff member of the Chinese Delegation Guo Tai Zhen, and Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the UK Liu Jun. During the banquet, Chairman Earl Winterton proposed that everyone raise their glasses to toast Chinese special envoy Kong Xiangxi and delivered a speech. He first stated the purpose of the China Association, then said, "The entire British Empire and the Republic of China should coexist and prosper together in a spirit of mutual respect and friendship." Referring to rumors that the British government intended to negotiate with a certain country in a way that would harm Chinese interests, Winterton stated, "Regarding this matter, Foreign Secretary Eden has already denied it. I hope this denial will be accepted by the general public. As a member of the House of Commons, I dare to guarantee that any measures agreed upon by Britain and any other country that are of an unfriendly nature to China will definitely not be accepted by the House of Commons. Furthermore, your country is a great nation, and the legacy of culture, art, and morality from five thousand years is no less beneficial to the civilized world than that of Greece and Rome. We should now express our sincere respect to your country." At this point, Chinese government special envoy Kong Xiangxi delivered a lengthy speech, first giving a general overview of China's economic construction and recent progress, and then stating, "The main achievement of the National Government of China is the consolidation of central authority and the completion of national unification. Today's China is not the same as the China of the warlord era, fragmented and chaotic. In short, if you were to travel the world, you would see signs of disturbance everywhere. Therefore, compared to other continental countries, how can you say that China is not a country of peace and order?" In addition, special envoy Kong repeatedly emphasized the achievements of China's financial recovery, stating, "Our country's new legal tender policy has laid a solid foundation and will continue to be improved without any changes. We are now preparing to reorganize the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank, the purpose of which is to provide a strong pillar for the legal tender system. After this plan is implemented, the Central Bank will become independent and become the bank of banks." He then described the results obtained from China's construction of railways and development of highways, and said that China is now devoting its full national strength to engaging in a large-scale economic construction movement. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 21st)

[London] The Financial Times today published an editorial on the hopes for British export trade in the Far East, stating that the outlook for trade with China has recently become much brighter. Although the time for long-term loans is not yet ripe, the scope for expansion through medium-term loans is vast, as evidenced by the activities of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. British merchants in the Chinese market now clearly have room to increase their efforts and manage everything. However, certain conditions still need to be adjusted. If Japan does not allow Chinese customs officers to resume their duties in eastern Hebei, fair competition will inevitably suffer. This is also one of the things that should be adjusted. If Japan can engage in this kind of remedy, its efforts to seek friendship with neighboring countries will be more effective. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Southern Fujian Plague Uncontrolled

[Fuzhou] Since around March of this year, plague has broken out in southern Fujian. Currently, the number of those afflicted has reached three to four hundred. The provincial government has specially invited Dr. Yang Yongnian, director of the Nanjing Hygiene Testing Laboratory, and Liu Ruiheng, director of the Hygiene Administration, to come to Shanghai to jointly engage in preventative work.

A large quantity of injection fluid has been transported from Taiwan, enough for approximately three thousand people. The first round of general preventative injections was held on the 18th.

### From "Xiao Jin" to the Language Problem in Frontier Education

— Bai Shouyi

"Xiao Jin" is a script used among Chinese Muslims who have received religious education. The history of this script must be at least four to five hundred years. But the origin of the name is unverifiable. The meaning of the name is also unclear. Some say that "Xiao Jin" should be written as "Xiao Jing," meaning that it is something that imitates classical texts. Some say that "Xiao Jin" should be written as "Xiao Er Jing," meaning that it is something for children to read. Others say that "Xiao Jin" should be written as "Xiao Jiang," because this script was initially used for making classical commentaries. These three explanations are probably all based on speculation and are not credible. Fortunately, we are not investigating the history of this script now, so this point can be left aside.

The most important feature of "Xiao Jin" is that it uses Arabic letters to spell Chinese. In the fourteen basic classics commonly used in Chinese Islamic seminary education, almost every classic is accompanied by this script. Sometimes it is written in the blank spaces on the left and right of the original text (i.e., on the edges of the page), sometimes it is written near a single word, and sometimes it is written after a paragraph of the original text is completed. The first two types of writing are mostly used to explain words and sentences; the third type of writing is used to explain the meaning of the entire paragraph of the original text. Using the third type of writing, a paragraph of text is written very long. In addition to being generally written in Chinese, it also mixes many Arabic and Persian words. Muslims who study these kinds of classics but do not know Chinese characters usually use this script to write letters, keep accounts, and record events. People who do not understand this situation often think that Muslims have few writings and that there are too few literate people. In fact, it is not that Muslims have no writings or that there are few literate people, but that there are too few people who write in Chinese characters and recognize Chinese characters.

Recently, my friend Pang Shiqian Aheng often talked to me about this script, which made me feel that this script should not only have a very important position in the history of Chinese phonetic scripts, but also be a very important and should be fully utilized educational tool in the current widespread promotion of Muslim education. My most important reasons and methods are roughly two:

First: According to the incomplete statistical material we have seen, making the lowest estimate, there must be at least 10,000 mosques in the country. If each mosque only educated 20 students every three years, then at least more than two million people have been trained in the last thirty years who can use this script. Among these more than two million people, some are old, some are struggling to make a living, and in general, very few probably have the opportunity to learn Chinese characters. Now, if we use this script to run a newspaper or magazine, and distribute it free of charge to mosques in various places on a regular basis, then this huge group of more than two million people can have the opportunity to relieve their thirst for knowledge, can slowly improve their abilities, improve their lives, and enhance their national sentiment. More than two million people is not a small number, and thirty years of training is not a short period of time. We are watching such an existing broad achievement and do not know how to use it to make further development. What else should we use?

Second: On our frontiers, the northwest, such as Shaanxi and Gansu, and the southwest, such as Yunnan, are the places where the most Muslims live (the native Muslims of Xinjiang have their own languages ​​and scripts, so they are not listed here). And in these places, due to the manipulation of the Aisin Gioro policy, the relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims is the least satisfactory. The Muslims in these places regard Chinese characters as "Han characters" (this meaning is not the same as what is generally called Chinese characters), and regard reading books in Han characters as the beginning of Hanification and as apostasy. The reason why school education in the northwest and southwest has not been supported by local Muslims throughout history is that schools take square characters as the only tool for teaching, which is a very important reason. Now, if we do not quibble over the false pretense of linguistic unity, but take a transitional approach that avoids the name and seeks the reality, in addition to setting up ordinary schools that teach in square characters, we should also set up short-term Muslim primary schools. The courses in the primary classes are completely taught in "Xiao Jin," and formal Arabic can be added when necessary. The advanced classes can slowly add square characters annotated with "Xiao Jin." Although "Xiao Jin" should also be said to be a kind of Chinese script, because it uses Arabic letters, in the eyes of most Muslim compatriots, it is always a script with a strong religious color. This change in script can greatly affect the perceptions of Muslim compatriots on the frontier; border education conducted in this script can not only reduce much resistance, but also gain much support. We feel that script is false, and the meaning expressed by script is true. There is no need to worry that compatriots on the frontier do not temporarily understand the so-called "national language": what is truly worrying is that we have no way to let them unite with the country in sincerity.

Among these two items, the first item is easier to implement. As long as there is a fixed amount of money and a small number of talents, it can be organized after a short period of research. The second item, because it requires overall planning, teacher training, and textbook compilation, requires a longer period of preparation. Naturally, neither of these two items can be achieved by private individuals and requires government promotion.

Regarding the second item, I feel that it is not only for Muslim compatriots in Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and other places, but also for compatriots in Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, and other places, as well as compatriots of the Miao, Yi, Baiyi, and other ethnic groups that a similar method is needed; if we want to run an education for them, we must also use their common formal script. Each has its own history, and each has its own language. Chinese square characters not only have no deep relationship with their history, but also have nothing to do with their language. Using square characters to conduct education among them is simply a castle in the air, more difficult and ineffective than letting Muslim compatriots in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places read "books in Han characters." Moreover, Chinese square characters are an independent monosyllabic script, which is very different in the ease of learning from Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Baiyi scripts, which are composed of letters. The square character is also a major obstacle to promotion in this respect. For the sake of true education, we have no reason to abandon the easy and pursue the difficult.

I often feel that the general public in the interior often equates the so-called "Han culture" with the overall Chinese culture. "Han culture" may be the most important part of Chinese culture, but the content of Chinese culture is by no means limited to "Han culture." I hope that we can correct this view with facts, and hope that public and private education authorities can give appropriate status to various special scripts in the country in various special educations. I further hope that from the development of the application of various special scripts, we can promote the development of various special cultures in the country, and move from individual development to mutual absorption and integration, to create a truly unified new Chinese culture.

### Soviet Aviation Exploration Team Lands Near North Pole

Will Stay on Ice Floe for a Year of Scientific Research - Moscow-San Francisco Air Route Hopeful

[Moscow] The Soviet Aviation Exploration Team, led by Schmidt, flew over the North Pole at 11:10 AM on the 21st of this month and safely landed on an ice floe 20 kilometers west of the meridian of Rudolf Island at 11:35 AM.

[Moscow] Aircraft USSRN-170, piloted by Soviet hero Vodopyanov, departed from Rudolf Island at 5 AM on the 21st and landed near the North Pole at 11:35 AM. In addition to Schmidt and several crew members, the aircraft carried Papenin, the head of the winter camp, Krenkel, the radioman, Shirshov, the aquatic biologist, and Fedorov, the magnetologist, who will reside on the ice floe for a year to conduct scientific research. When the aircraft reached the North Pole and sent a report, the on-board wireless suddenly broke down. The news was not released until a new radio station was established on the ice floe in the evening. (22nd, TASS Telegram)

[Moscow] After the successful Arctic flight of the Soviet Aviation Exploration Team, the Moscow-San Francisco air route is even closer to success. This air route is centered on the North Pole and is the most ambitious strategy of the Soviet Union's Third Five-Year Plan. The success of this flight is the third time in history that the Arctic has been crossed. If the calculations are successful, the Moscow-San Francisco air route is expected to be established in 1939. The aircraft was piloted by Vodopyanov. After the aircraft landed, the team members immediately erected a red silk flag with a portrait of Stalin painted on it. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters Telegram)

### Organization of the Exploration Team

[Moscow] The exploration team departed from Moscow on February 23, traveling on five Soviet-made aircraft, including four ANT-6 four-engine aircraft and one ANT-7 twin-engine aircraft. In addition to leader Schmidt, there were 42 people, including Soviet hero aviators Vodopyanov and Molokov, famous Arctic aviators Golovin, Babushkin, Alexeyev, Mazuruk, Krutskiy, as well as mechanics, experienced Arctic wireless operators, and journalists. The exploration team departed from Moscow, passing through Kokhomogory, Narelmar, Matochkin Strait, and arriving at Rudolf Island. The journey was interrupted several times due to bad weather. They arrived at Rudolf Island on April 19. The team waited for the weather to improve and began observations. Four members of the team will reside on the Arctic ice floe for a year. The aircraft carried food, fuel, clothing, a collapsible house, and all scientific equipment. The food and supplies are sufficient for the four people for a year and a half. After the first people arrive at the ice floe and prepare a landing site, other aircraft will deliver large quantities of goods or drop them by parachute. According to Academician Schmidt's report, the ice floe that has now arrived will be used as a scientific research station and to establish an aircraft field.

### Talk by the Head of the Exploration Team

Exploration team leader Schmidt said en route, "This Soviet Arctic exploration is the highest stage of the extensive work and research that Soviet Arctic explorers, scientists, sailors, and aviators have overcome in the far north for many years. We do not aim to establish Arctic records. The purpose of our activities is to make the far north beneficial to our country and all mankind. We are rushing to the Arctic to carry out important practical scientific work. This Soviet Arctic station will constantly observe the climate and report to the Central Meteorological Bureau. If long-term climate forecasts can be made, we will also conduct magnetic observations, study the direction and speed of ice flow, and explore the depth of the Arctic Ocean. This Arctic Ocean station is particularly meaningful as a wireless communication center in the Arctic region. In the future, aircraft coming and going to this place, or even flying over the Arctic directly to the Americas, can receive wireless instructions and directions at this station, and can receive weather reports in advance. We are determined to include the Arctic region in our regular activity zone. Of course, this task is not easy, but only in our country have all the conditions for completing such a bold task been created. This Arctic Ocean station cannot stay in the Arctic forever, because it can only be built on a floating ice floe and drift in all directions with it, but it will probably drift towards the Americas, which is a favorable condition, because this observation can cover a larger area." (22nd, TASS Telegram)

### Preparation of the Exploration

[Moscow] According to a communication, Arctic explorer Papenin told a TASS reporter, "Preparations for this exploration began in February 1936. Preparations must be thorough in order to spend the winter on drifting ice floes. At the same time, a reliable base must be established on Rudolf Island in the Soviet Arctic. Last year, the icebreaker Rusanov transported the heavy goods, food, fuel, and some scientific instruments used in this trip to the island. The scientific instruments are specially made to be lightweight and durable. The total weight of the entire team's equipment, including people, must not exceed nine tons. They are carrying food, clothing, and fuel for 18 months. A small, lightweight, and powerful radio station is being prepared. In addition, Kakov designer Palri has also built a lightweight wind-powered generator to provide electricity for the radio and the winter camp.

The food has been prepared by experts. Canned food is too heavy and is not being carried. Only items that are not usually available in the Arctic supply depot are being carried, such as Laiyang essence, bean soup essence, corn flour, fruit methods, and frozen preserves made from essence, meat slices, etc. 300 kilograms of chicken powder is extracted from 5,000 chickens, and there is also egg powder, milk powder, and 180 kilograms of specially made Tocran sausage. There are a total of 48 kinds of food, which are delicious, diverse, and rich in nutrients, so that people will not get scurvy. All kinds of food have been tested in a freezer at minus 60 degrees. For breakfast, you can drink tea and eat English eggs, or caviar, steak, cheese, fat meat, dry sausage, and special bread made from homemade flour and meat. Lunch and dinner are cooked. 22 kilograms of brandy are carried and can be mixed with tea in cold weather. There is also fire wine for rubbing the body.

The clothes are very good. The quilt cover is made of high-quality wolf skin. The socks, leather pants, and shirts are made of selected reindeer skin. The underwear is made of the best wool. There are felt boots in winter and leather boots in summer, all of which are specially made.

Four people in the team will spend the winter in the Arctic, namely myself, hydrologist and aquatic zoologist Shirshov, magnetologist and astronomer Fedorov, and famous radioman Krenkel. When necessary, they can replace each other's work. Shirshov also serves as a doctor. The medicines are all in powder form and can be dissolved in alcohol. Someone is on duty day and night in order to find a way to deal with the situation on the spot when the ice floes squeeze. Those on duty take meteorological observations every hour. The Arctic is not easy, but this must be done in order to obtain complete scientific records of the center of the Arctic Ocean. Supplies and food are placed in several places, each 200 to 300 meters apart. When the ice floes squeeze and become dangerous, they can be moved to another safe ice floe.

Although the winter camp is in the middle of the ocean, snow must still be melted for water. Seven buckets of snow can be melted into one bucket of water. Krenkel and I both smoke, so we also bring tobacco. On special holidays, we can also smoke high-quality cigars. We will bring a true friend of the Arctic Ocean from Rudolf Island, which is a small dog. When polar bears come at night, it can warn us to avoid being damaged by the bears' food and tents."

### Icing Science Work

The Arctic Ocean has been called the "Kitchen of Climate." Its dishes are always surprising. It is necessary to understand their causes to make long-term climate predictions. This expedition is to carry out this kind of work. It will constantly make meteorological observations. Floating meteorological stations and all necessary instruments are installed on small cabinets. The team members must also undertake other tasks. For example, the conditions of the Arctic seabed in the center of the Arctic Ocean are still unknown. Some say it is as deep as four thousand or five thousand meters. Whether this is the case must be proven by exploration. Forty-four years ago, when Nansen sailed the "Fram" to the Arctic Ocean, he discovered a strong ocean current from the Atlantic Ocean at a depth of 200 to 700 meters below the ocean's surface, which was different from the Arctic Ocean water. Because it was warmer and contained more salt, the people who overwintered on the ice floes will measure the Arctic sea current, where it flows to the center of the Arctic Ocean, and at what depth. Its gravity must also be studied. The gravity of the earth is never equal everywhere, as everyone knows. They must also conduct extensive magnetic surveys to create an accurate magnetic map at high northern latitudes. This map is extremely useful for northern aviators and navigators. The direction pointed to by the Arctic Ocean compass differs greatly from the true meridian. The expedition team is also preparing to conduct a large-scale investigation of the flora and fauna in the central Arctic Ocean. It is necessary to draw seawater from all depths to study the microorganisms in the Arctic Ocean. The only purpose of astronomical observation is to determine the exact location of the drifting winter camp, which will ensure that the coordinates are not more than 500 meters off. In winter, many star regions can be determined within 200 meters. The instruments used are all made by the All-Union Arctic Research Institute, durable, and most suitable for the application there. It is extremely difficult to determine in which direction the ice floes on which they reside will drift. Schmidt believes that they probably flow towards America. Hydrological biologist Shuleikin believes that the ice floes may rotate with the central Arctic Ocean circulation. A radio station will be established to communicate with Rudolf Island and report the work and life situation at any time. The radio station on the island will pay attention to incoming messages day and night.

### Housing on Ice Floes

Those who overwinter in the Arctic will live in foldable houses. This looks like a small airplane shed, 37 meters long, 27 meters wide, and 2 meters high. The top is round, and the outside of the house is painted black, so it can be seen from a distance. At the same time, black can absorb sunlight during the day and make the house warmer. This is very important because the team members have very little fuel and can only use one and a half liters per day for cooking. The frame of the house is made of lead steel pipes, covered with rubber cloth, and the cloth is covered with large inflated rubber pads. The pads are covered with canvas and deerskin, and the skin is covered with silver-layered silk eiderdown quilts. The outermost layer is covered with chemically treated thick canvas, which will not rot. The floor of the house is first covered with canvas, and then a 15 cm thick inflated rubber pad. The windows of the house will be made of soft, thick, unbreakable transparent glass, a new Soviet product. The house is extremely light, weighing only 160 kilograms. When the ice floe under the house breaks, four people can lift it and move it to another place. One corner of the house is a kitchen, equipped with a kerosene stove. The kerosene is stored in sixty rubber bags, instead of barrels or iron cans. Each bag can hold forty-eight liters of oil.

### Special Aircraft Equipment

The members of this Arctic Ocean expedition, pilots, mechanics, and radio operators, are all experienced in Arctic Ocean flight. They include Soviet heroes Vodopyanov and Molokov, famous Arctic pilots Golovin, Babushkin, Bassein, Alekseev, Krutsky, and Mazuruk, and radio operator Ivanov, who participated in the Chelyuskin incident, and Krenkel. The leader of the entire team is Schmidt, and the deputy leader is Gekker, director of the Aviation Department of the Arctic Ocean Route Administration. The aircraft used include one R-5 biplane, flown by Golovin, as a "scout," and four ANT-6 four-engine all-metal aircraft, flown by pilots Vodopyanov, Molokov, Alekseev, and Mazuruk. Each aircraft is a civil aviation aircraft that has been specially arranged for this expedition. The aircraft are equipped with AM-34-R 500-horsepower engines, designed by engineer Mikulin. The engines are equipped with special equipment that can be started quickly at any temperature. During the test, all the engines of a certain aircraft were pre-set at minus 30 degrees Celsius for 24 hours, and all were fully started within 18 minutes. This is extremely important for Arctic flight. The engine radiator is not filled with water, but with a special antifreeze liquid. The aircraft is also equipped with a so-called "Arctic Ocean Aviation Lamp," which can generate extremely high heat and, in a few minutes, raise the temperature of the liquid inside the engine, which has been in the severe cold for several days, to 70 degrees Celsius. To prevent accidents, the aircraft is also equipped with a specially made water tank, which can use the "Arctic Ocean Lamp" to melt snow into water. When the aircraft is stopped, the tank can also be used as a hot water bucket. Each aircraft is equipped with new blind flying and wireless piloting equipment, as well as instruments for determining direction based on astronomical indications. Vodopyanov's flagship is also equipped with an autopilot. Each aircraft is also equipped with several types of radio stations to maintain communication between the ground and the aircraft and to communicate with Moscow at any time. The climate in the north is extremely variable, especially in the Arctic Ocean. The first leg of this journey was originally scheduled to be Moscow, Arkhangelsk, Naryan-Mar, Cape Chelyuskin, Tiksi Bay, and Rudolf Island, but it had to be slightly changed. The first stop was not Arkhangelsk, but Kholmogory. The entire team stayed here for six days before continuing to fly on March 28, when the weather improved. They waited in Naryan-Mar until the 15th and arrived at Matochkin Strait on April 12. They encountered a storm there and stayed for three days. At 7:50 PM on April 18, the aircraft took off again and arrived at Rudolf Island at 2:00 AM. Golovin took another route and also arrived there on the same day. Rudolf Island is located at 82 degrees north latitude, with an area of 220 square kilometers, and is 900 kilometers from the North Pole. It has the world's northernmost Arctic Ocean station. Last year, a small scientific town was built on the island, with two well-equipped large houses that can accommodate 24 people. Next to the houses is a warehouse and a garage for all-terrain vehicles and tractors. The island will serve as a base for expeditions and will communicate with scientists residing on ice floes at any time. (TASS)

[London] Former German State Prime Minister Białoruński has now accepted an invitation from Oxford University in England to serve as a special lecturer in the university's Department of Political Science. Mr. Białoruński will go to Oxford to take up his post immediately after completing his lectures at Harvard University. (National Maritime News Agency Dispatch, 21st)

### The Spanish Armistice Movement Now Has a Concrete Trend

The Non-Intervention Committee drafts a plan. Rebel envoys lament to Mussolini.

[London] The Technical Subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War met early this morning at 8:30 AM to consider a temporary ceasefire in Spain to allow the withdrawal of foreign volunteers. After much discussion, it is said that a report has been drafted, which will be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee on Monday next week. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

[London] It is heard that this plan is completely unrelated to the British proposal for a ceasefire between the two sides of the Spanish Civil War. Even if the ceasefire proposal cannot become a reality, this plan to withdraw volunteers can still be implemented. According to well-informed sources, the plan stipulates that all foreign volunteers currently fighting in Spain should first be concentrated in designated locations, and then sent to Spanish ports separately to board ships back to their countries. All withdrawal matters will be handled by international monitoring agencies. According to this plan, when it was drafted by the expert committee this morning, it aroused some objections from some parties. It is heard that the Soviet representative argued that the Moroccan soldiers fighting in Spain should be regarded as foreign volunteers, but the expert committee believed that this plan could also be applied in Spanish Morocco. Therefore, Moroccans should naturally be considered as their own people, so the Soviet proposal was not accepted. However, most experts are still deeply skeptical about whether there will be difficulties in implementing this plan. The withdrawal of foreign volunteers fighting on the front lines to the assembly points will inevitably require the armies of both sides of the Spanish Civil War to temporarily withdraw from the front-line strategic locations to the rear. However, even a few hours of withdrawal may not be easily accepted by both sides. As for the ceasefire method proposed by the United Kingdom, according to the opinions of well-informed sources, it must first be mediated by major countries before it can be realized. But can Germany, Italy, and the two sides of the Spanish Civil War accept this British plan? Germany and Italy have already expressed their ability to accept it. According to general predictions, regardless of whether a ceasefire can be established, the expert committee should still submit the plan to withdraw volunteers to the subcommittee for discussion. In addition, the expert committee has also drafted an application to be sent to both sides of the Spanish Civil War, requesting both sides to take into account humanitarianism in their operations. The full text of this application will also be submitted to the subcommittee for discussion on Monday next week. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

Gibraltar It is said that Spanish rebel commander Franco has sent a secret envoy to Italy to express to Mussolini that if Italy withdraws its volunteers, Franco is prepared to resign. (National News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)

[London] The Spanish Civil War will reach eleven months on May 17. At this time, a peace movement has emerged in Europe. French Foreign Minister Delbos, who spoke with Belgian Prime Minister Janson in Beijing a few days ago, declared today that France and Belgium have agreed to mediate the Spanish Civil War. If peace conditions can be accepted by the warring parties, the war should be expected to end soon. British ambassadors to certain countries have been ordered to inquire with the governments of their host countries whether it is possible to temporarily cease the Spanish war, so that foreign volunteers may have the opportunity to withdraw. Experts and technical personnel of the Non-Intervention Committee convened another meeting in London today to discuss the same issue. However, all parties acknowledge that this work is extremely difficult. In addition, some Spanish nobles have gone to Italy, which has caused a lot of speculation. Among these nobles is the tobacco tycoon March, who is the strongest supporter of the National Army leader Franco. It is said that the purpose of these nobles going to Italy is to request Mussolini to refuse to withdraw Italian volunteers. It is rumored that the families of Italian volunteers have elected representatives to meet with Mussolini to request the release of soldiers. As for the situation in Rome, as Reuters reporters know, the Italian government is extremely skeptical about the peace movement and the possibility of withdrawing volunteers, believing that such peace may not be established. In any case, the Italian government is very unwilling to promote this matter under the guidance of the League of Nations, because the Italian government still insists on not cooperating with the League of Nations. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)

[London] Responsible parties have recently stated that Italy and Germany will submit replies, stating that the Spanish National Army is currently taking the offensive. Once a ceasefire agreement is established, it will facilitate the Republican government militarily, which is tantamount to interfering in the Spanish civil war to the benefit of the Republican government. Therefore, the two countries cannot endorse it. Regarding the issue of withdrawing volunteers, Italy and Germany will probably advocate gradual withdrawal, as the subcommittee of the London Adjustment Committee should recommend. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)

Valencia According to reports from Gibraltar, it is rumored that the Spanish government forces will conduct negotiations with the rebels in the near future, hoping to establish a ceasefire agreement. The Spanish Council of State held a meeting yesterday and immediately decided to issue a declaration denying this and formally declaring that there is absolutely no room for reconciliation until the national enemies are completely annihilated. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

### France and Belgium Reached a Consensus in Talks

Hoping for an agreement between Britain, France, and Belgium before the League of Nations meeting

Beijing French Foreign Minister Delbos held a final discussion with Prime Minister Janson and Foreign Minister Spaak this afternoon. Afterwards, a communiqué was issued stating that Delbos had discussed various issues related to both parties with the Belgian authorities, especially the progress of the investigation entrusted to Belgian Prime Minister Janson, which was very pleasant and sufficient to prove that the two countries hold completely consistent views. Delbos has already departed for Paris at 8:00 PM. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)

Beijing Regarding the talks conducted by French Foreign Minister Delbos with the Belgian authorities, responsible parties have recently stated that the talks focused on political issues. As for economic issues, only the investigation undertaken by Belgian Prime Minister Janson was discussed. This investigation will only be announced when traveling to the United States next month. The political agreements reached between the authorities of the two countries include the following two points: ㊀ Regarding the British proposal to establish a ceasefire agreement between the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, France and Belgium will endorse it. ㊁ Regarding the future Western European Convention, after Italy and Germany submitted a memorandum to the United Kingdom on March 13 this year, France and Belgium will soon reply to it. Regarding the first point, the authorities of France and Belgium both believe that the withdrawal of foreign volunteers can only be implemented after the Spanish Civil War has ceased. Once the civil war has ceased, it can be prevented from continuing. Therefore, they will strive to make the British proposal a success. Even if this proposal ultimately fails, international efforts should continue to end the civil war in that country as soon as possible. Regarding the second point, France and Belgium will explain their common views in the reply. Britain, Belgium, and France will establish a complete agreement before the Council and General Assembly of the League of Nations meet. It has also been agreed that the Rhine River issue should be resolved comprehensively and that relations with Italy and Germany should be improved.

### The Spanish Armistice Movement

Another Explanation of the Behind-the-Scenes Activities

[Paris] According to a Beijing correspondent for the Paris Evening Post, when the French Foreign Minister was discussing with British politicians in London, both sides believed that the first step to withdrawing foreign volunteers from Spain was to call for a ceasefire. Therefore, the British government has been working hard to solicit the opinions of various countries. Some people believe that this work will be promoted by the Non-Intervention Committee. At the same time, Belgium volunteered to act as a mediator. In short, Europe is now working hard to seek a ceasefire in Spain. (National Maritime News Agency Dispatch, 21st)

[Rome] Local newspapers strongly stated that Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak is the initiator of stopping the Spanish Civil War. Spaak first put forward this proposal to the British government, and then discussed it with the French Foreign Minister Delbos when he visited Belgium. (National Maritime News Agency Dispatch, 21st)

### Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Prepares to Form a Fascist Party

Secret talks with Takekawa and Kobayashi yesterday. Noble lords request the government to resign.

[Tokyo] After the Showa Society announced its automatic dissolution, Prime Minister Hayashi took the first step to publicly organize a Fascist party. Today, Prime Minister Hayashi invited Takekawa Mijitsugu and Kobayashi Seizaburo to the official residence for half an hour of official talks. Both are generally regarded as leaders of the right-wing nationalist movement. It is heard that in the talks, Prime Minister Hayashi expressed his firm determination to move forward along the established route and continue to maintain power, so as to implement various reform policies, and requested the two to advocate the organization of a new political party to support the government. In their replies, Takekawa and Kobayashi focused on the following four points: ㊀ No matter how strong the pressure of the existing political parties' movement to overthrow the cabinet, the current cabinet should not expose its own weaknesses and resign. ㊁ The new political party must be a national political party, and its organization must be promoted in parallel with the implementation of changes to the electoral law. ㊂ When the new political party gains an advantage, the government should not hesitate to dissolve the parliament according to needs, even if it is done dozens of times. ㊃ The two are willing to dedicate themselves to organizing this new political party, but the government should provide the greatest assistance in terms of financial and political convenience. It is heard that the two also proposed concrete changes to the electoral law, focusing on the following two points: thoroughly carrying out official-run elections, and changing the current universal suffrage system to a noble election system. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)

[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Takekawa met with Prime Minister Hayashi today and issued a statement saying: "Today's visit to Prime Minister Hayashi was neither at the invitation of the Prime Minister nor by my appointment. In tactical terms, it was a so-called 'encounter battle.' The content of the meeting was only to express each other's beliefs and exchange opinions. I once encouraged the Prime Minister, in view of the serious internal and external situation, to boldly move forward towards what he believes in. The Prime Minister also said that he would never resign due to rumors in the world and would move forward along the established direction." Lieutenant General Kobayashi Seizaburo also issued a statement saying: "Today's meeting with Prime Minister Hayashi was because the current situation, both internally and externally, is extremely serious. As a citizen, I cannot remain silent. Mr. Takekawa and I have the same expectations, so we went to the Prime Minister to offer extremely frank advice. The Prime Minister has also told us that he will move forward with a firm determination to overcome the difficulties of the times. We also feel satisfied. The content of today's meeting is confidential because it was only a conversation between three people. Also, I cannot say much about how the concrete results of today's meeting will be expressed in the future." (Kyodo News Dispatch, 22nd)

[Tokyo] According to today's Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, the dissolution of the sole government party Showa Society will give the new party movement an opportunity to develop. However, both the Seiyukai and the Minseito regard the dissolution of the Showa Society as the prelude to the collapse of the Hayashi Cabinet. It is also reported that the House of Peers is advocating the resignation of the government. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

### Bandit Chief Liu Guitang Attempts to Disturb Yanqing from Rehe West

Someone Instructs Bandit Liu to Reconnoiter Nankou. Puppet leaders repeatedly hold meetings in Jiabu Temple.

Wanquan Correspondence According to people from Duolun, bandit chief Liu Guitang is indeed in the large commercial town in Rehe, claiming to be supervising his bandits to concentrate in Chahar North from Fengning and the Jidong war zone. He has changed the original concentration point of Nanhaogou to Daqinggou, and has set up an office in Dahushan. About two to three hundred people have arrived. The fact that Liu Guitang is lingering in Rehe West is under the instructions of someone else and has other ambitions. On the 17th and 18th of this month, he harassed Liubao, Yanqing County (in Chahar), which belongs to the northeast, and there is a rumor that he will attack the old county town. His purpose is to enter Yanqing and occupy the Nankou natural barrier. The old county town is more than forty li northeast of Yanqing, forming an acute triangle with Shuiningbao, Liubinbao, and Luolie, guarding Yanqing. Liubinbao is located at the tip of the triangle, so Liu's bandits have repeatedly harassed it and should not be ignored. Local garrison troops have increased their defenses.

Regarding the recent situation of the puppet organization, on the 17th of this month, De Wang and Li Shouxin held a meeting with a group of rebels in Jiabu Temple to discuss the issue of attacking westward. The meeting lasted for four hours before it dispersed. It was decided that they would take active action on the westward attack.

On the 18th and 19th, meetings were also held repeatedly. Bao Yueqing, Wu Heling, and other Mongolian puppet dignitaries are now gathered in Jiabu Temple. Judging from their expressions, they seem to be slightly more nervous than before. However, traitor Zhuo Shihai is still in the Chahar League Commissioner's Office in Zhangbei and has not been seen taking any action. The club fees collected by the bandit puppet troops in various counties in Chahar North have now been increased again. Part of the income is used to organize so-called rural loans, and loans have now been started in various counties. The funds released are all banknotes from the Central Bank of the puppet "Manchukuo". On the one hand, they are carrying out economic aggression, and on the other hand, they are squeezing the fat of the people. Under their oppression and bondage, many poor compatriots are quenching their thirst with poison. (20th)

### Rampant Spread of Plague in Southern Fujian

Thousands Have Already Died in Hui'an; Now Spreading to Various Counties in Western Fujian

Xiamen Dispatch: The plague in Southern Fujian is most severe in Hui'an County. Since its discovery in early March, up to September 3rd, statistics show over 580 deaths in northern Hui'an, 200 in southern Hui'an, and over 30 in Liangchuan, totaling over 800 deaths. After April 11th, Lu Dihuan, head of the Health Section of the Civil Affairs Department, and Cao Shouli, head of the Epidemic Prevention Division, led medical teams to Hui'an for treatment. However, after more than a month, the epidemic has not subsided. From May 4th to 12th, over 80 more people died in Qianying and Fengwei in northern Hui'an, and over 10 in southern Hui'an, totaling over 90. After the 13th, in the past week, the spread has widened daily. Fifteen more people died in Fengwei, over 20 in Guocuo, four in the Zhuang Wensheng family in Zhainei Village, two in Hongcuo, over 10 in Zhaoge Lianbao, over 20 in Xiangcuo, four in Liucuo, over 10 in the Tuceng Liang Lianbao of Sanchuan, and eight or nine in Liangxing. In the past week, deaths have reached over 110, bringing the total deaths to over 1,000. The people of Hui'an are superstitious, believing that a plague god is passing through, and the dead are being taken away by the "Wang Ye Boat." Incantations are ineffective, and both Chinese and Western medicine have failed. They are increasingly fearful. In the epidemic area of northern Hui'an, there are no pedestrians near dusk, for fear of being taken away by the "Wang Ye Boat." At the same time, incense is suddenly booming at various village temples, as everyone fervently prays not to be taken away by the Wang Ye. In addition, the plague in Fuqing is also severe. Gao Touzhen alone has been experiencing over ten deaths daily. In Quanzhou City, after the plague re-emerged on April 19th, over 50 people have died in a month. Moreover, it has spread from Quanzhou to Zhangzhou, with over 400 deaths in Anxi, over 50 in Zhangpu, and over 20 in the southern part of Longxi. Recently, it has also spread to western Fujian, with over ten deaths in Fushi, Yongding County, in mid-May. In Tieshiyang, Longyan, two people died in two days, on the 16th and 17th.

Yang Yongnian, the epidemic prevention specialist sent by the Central Health Administration, inspected southern Fujian at the beginning of May. After returning to the province, he drafted a comprehensive epidemic prevention plan. (1) Establish the Southern Fujian Epidemic Prevention Institute in Quanzhou, moving over 50 staff members working in the province to Quanzhou to work. The location of the institute will be inside the Hui Shi Hospital. (2) The annual recurrent epidemic prevention expenses for the entire province this year are 150,000 yuan, with 50,000 yuan allocated by the central government. The remaining amount will be raised by the provincial government and distributed to the three epidemic prevention institutes: Southern Fujian (Quanzhou), Northern Fujian (Jian'ou), and Western Fujian (Longyan). The Southern Fujian Epidemic Prevention Institute is newly established, with start-up costs of 20,000 yuan and annual recurrent expenses of 55,000 yuan. The Western Fujian Epidemic Prevention Institute was established the year before last, and its funding has been increased by 10,000 yuan. The Northern Fujian Epidemic Prevention Institute has also been increased to 30,000 yuan. (3) The Health Administration has decided to carry out epidemic prevention in northern, southern, and western Fujian for five years to eradicate the plague. Branch institutes will be established in Hui'an and Fuqing, the more seriously affected areas in southern Fujian. Epidemic prevention teams will be established in Putian and Xianyou. These expenses will be allocated separately by the provincial government. In addition, Liu Ruiheng, the director of the Health Administration, flew to Fuzhou on the 18th and is scheduled to go south with Yang Yongnian on the 22nd to inspect the epidemic areas. Dr. Landuya, a health consultant for the Economic Committee, is also staying in Quanzhou to assist with epidemic prevention. (May 21st)

### Zhenjiang

Measures to Ban Opium Resolved

The Civil Affairs Department convened a meeting of opium suppression section chiefs from various counties. After the opening ceremony the day before yesterday, proposals were reviewed, and discussions began yesterday. The meeting has now successfully concluded. It is understood that the discussed proposals are divided into four categories: investigation and arrest, investigation and adjudication, personnel, and others. The important ones include requesting neighboring provinces to allow cross-border investigations and arrests, scheduling general inspections to eliminate opium, exempting public security committee members and autonomous personnel who have arrested opium offenders from summons and interrogation, and establishing training centers for drug rehabilitation. These cases will be submitted by the Civil Affairs Department to the provincial government for approval and then implemented separately.

Crackdown on Opium Trafficking Agency

The work of opium suppression here is extremely intense, and opium has been completely eliminated in the experimental district. Opium has also been banned early in other districts. However, the Gaozidi District Branch of the county along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway suddenly received a secret report yesterday that a Wen Changcai came from Qiaotou Town to Gao to buy illicit opium. The branch immediately sent staff to follow the informant and intercepted Wen Changcai in front of the branch, finding a package of illicit opium on his person. Upon interrogation, he confessed that he had purchased it from a Yang in this town. Staff were then dispatched to the address and arrested Yang Zhenzhong, seizing sixteen packages of illicit opium. He was immediately sent to the county government for interrogation, and suspected fugitives were arrested.

### Overview of the Japanese Labor Movement

— Zhu Xuefan

Evolution of the Labor Movement

Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, the capitalist system has emerged, and modern enterprise organizations have gradually become popular. However, the Sino-Japanese War was the impetus for the rapid development of Japanese capitalism and marked a new era. The result of the Sino-Japanese War actively promoted the Japanese industrial revolution, and the social state rapidly became capitalist. As a result, a labor class was formed, and the labor problems and labor movements that it produced also made great progress. Since then, the Japanese labor movement has rapidly emerged against the background of rapidly developing capitalism, with the intellectual class as its vanguard. Although prosperity and decline are impermanent, it can be said that the labor movement started in 1883 under the leadership of the Liberal Party. During this period, there were various labor activities such as the Printing Workers' Union, the Iron Workers' Organization, the Workers' Righteousness Association, the Trade Union Promotion Association, the Correctional Association, and the Zhicheng Association. Until September 1, 1911, the general workers felt the necessity of having contact and mutual assistance within the same class, so a small number of workers in the same industry organized a "Friendship Group." Soon, the "Friendship Group" underwent fundamental reforms due to rapid changes in ideology and organization. It was renamed the Trade Union Organization, changing its original purpose to the exclusive pursuit of worker welfare, revealing a confrontational color. However, the organization was disorganized, and the leaders lacked knowledge and experience. Differences of opinion between leaders frequently caused disputes, so the workers benefited little. By 1915, adult men had the right to vote, and the direction of the labor movement suddenly changed, from economic action to political action. At that time, many intellectuals and students participated in the labor movement. Some unions belonged to the Communist Party, some to the Japanese Populist Party, and some to the Democratic Party. The various unions were subordinate to or merged with these three political parties, changing endlessly, but they all had very little political status. In 1935, the newly emerging Socialist People's Party of Japan used various forces and the awareness of leaders in the labor community, believing that the strength of the entire labor force could not be exerted without unity. Therefore, in January of last year, cooperation and unity were produced.

Current Status of the Labor Movement

There are approximately 5.9 million workers in Japan, with 408,662 organized (including 23,927 female workers), divided into 205 occupational unions and 317 industrial unions. Initially, they were led by the two major labor unions: the Japan Federation of Labor and the Japan National Confederation of Trade Unions. Later, the leaders of the two confederations, in order to seek unity and participate in the House of Representatives elections, simultaneously obtained the secret mediation of the Socialist People's Party, and merged last year to form the Japan National Federation of Labor, which was led by the Socialist People's Party. When it was established, a declaration was issued advocating (1) raising the personality of workers, (2) strengthening organizations to jointly seek worker welfare, (3) striving to improve the capitalist system, (4) suggesting the implementation of unemployment insurance, and (5) promoting workers' political activities. Since the establishment of this association, it has been the largest labor group in Japan, and has gained considerable political status. With a vigorous and completely new look, it has attracted the attention of the general public. In particular, the military is deeply afraid of its expanding power and taking the opportunity to coerce. As a precaution, on September 10 last year, the Ministry of the Army ordered the ordnance workers (approximately 100,000) to leave the organization system of the association and organized the Ordnance Workers Service Committee to lead them, specializing in ordnance workers to handle economic mutual assistance, welfare undertakings, and cooperative movements. As for the Socialist People's Party, it was formed in July 1932 by the merger of the Democratic Party and the Japanese Populist Party. Its propositions can be summarized as: (1) major industries are operated by the state, (2) reforming national taxes to reduce the burden on the people, (3) promulgating the Trade Union Organization Law and the Farmers' Land Lease Law, (4) stabilizing the people's livelihood, and (5) workers and farmers have the right to legally organize. A few points are the basic principles. Its target audience is general workers, farmers, small businessmen, and small staff of salaried classes. The party only occupied a seat in the last House of Representatives election. However, the results of the vote on February 21 and 22 of this year showed that it suddenly gained eighteen seats. Its sudden leap in political status can be seen here. However, although the apparent reason for the party's acquisition of the eighteenth seat seems to be due to its tendency to the masses, in reality, Japanese politics is always under the iron fist of the military. At the very least, it is a mixture of the military, bureaucrats, and political parties, and it is by no means a purely political party. Even from the remarks made by Aso Hisashi, the secretary-general of the Socialist People's Party, in support of the "National Defense and its Strengthening" pamphlet published by the military in October 1934, the fundamental attitude towards the Socialist People's Party is very clear. Therefore, the fact that the party was able to occupy eighteen seats in the House of Representatives this time implies the relationship with the military.

Working Hours and Wages

Working hours for Japanese workers vary by industry, generally ranging from eight to ten hours. Wages are not very high. On average, working eight hours a day yields 96 sen in Japanese currency. Among various workers, machine workers have the highest wages, earning 1.60 yuan per day, while textile workers have the lowest, earning only 72 sen per day.

Educational Level of Workers

Japan is a country that enforces compulsory national education. In general, workers have at least graduated from elementary school. Moreover, labor organizations run labor vocational schools. In the vocational schools, there are opportunities to study various specialized technologies and general political economy, international situation, and social sciences. There are also attached libraries, lecture meetings, and the distribution of original materials to supplement education. Therefore, Japanese labor education can be regarded as being above the standard.

Labor Unemployment and Relief

Since the development of Japanese military industry, labor unemployment has gradually decreased. In 1932, there were 489,168 unemployed workers, but the number decreased every year, gradually decreasing to 359,202 in 1935. The relief methods are either subsidized by the state or by public organizations. There are also many employment agencies that introduce unemployed workers to jobs at any time.

Labor Insurance

Japan only has one type of labor insurance: health insurance, which has been implemented for ten years. The operating institutions are divided into state-run and cooperative institutions supervised by the government. The results are very good and the benefits are significant. Workers in various industries, shop assistants, domestic servants, etc., are very enthusiastic about insurance. As of 1934, there were 1,294,929 insured in state-run institutions, with annual premiums of 32,447,164 Japanese yen. There were 706,555 insured in cooperative institutions supervised by the government, with annual premiums of 16,781,398 Japanese yen.

In short, regarding the benefits of those insured, if the insured suffers accidental injury or illness, they can be compensated for 80% of their medical expenses by the insurance institution for a period of one year. Childbirth (female workers) receives a subsidy of 30 Japanese yen per day. In the event of death, the family can receive one month's salary of the deceased as funeral expenses. (To be continued)

### Zhejiang-Shanghai Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression Hosts Representatives from All Walks of Life to Report on Opium Suppression Policies

Unanimous Resolution to Eradicate Opium During the Meeting

Chen Lingyun, the Zhejiang-Shanghai Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression, recently came to Shanghai from Hangzhou to preside over the establishment of a Shanghai Office. He also visited various authorities to discuss the implementation of opium suppression plans, the details of which have been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that Mr. Chen hosted a banquet at the Hua An Building on Jing'an Temple Road at noon yesterday (the 22nd) to entertain the Shanghai authorities and leaders from all walks of life to discuss future opium suppression matters. The details are as follows:

Important People Present

Those present included Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, Commander Yang Xiaotian, and Yu Qiaqing, Yu Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Boqi, Qian Xinzhi, Yan Fuqing, Yu Zuoting, Lu Bohong, Cai Jingjun, Ji Ting'an, Pan Gongzhan, Qu Wenliu, Shen Yi, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Yu Nangcheng, Lu Jingshi, Jiang Huaisu, Lin Meiyan, He Dekui, Wang Yunwu, Shou Jingwei, Zhou Yu, Zhou Yongneng, Huang Jiahui, Huang Zaoiong, Xu Guowei, Zhang Tianze, Dai Lizhen, Xu Xingchu, Gui Yuxing, Geng Jiayi, Zhang Yousan, and more than sixty others.

Speech by the Special Commissioner

Special Commissioner Chen said in his speech, "Today, I have the honor of inviting all of you gentlemen to gather here, and I am very honored that you have all graced us with your presence. This time, Lingyun has been entrusted with the task of opium suppression in Zhejiang and Shanghai. I ask myself that my knowledge and abilities are very shallow, and I am deeply worried that I will not be able to shoulder this important task. However, because the work of opium suppression is related to the important future of national rejuvenation, all citizens have a natural duty to work hard in this regard. I have also received strict instructions from General Director Chiang, and I should do my best to follow the leaders of Zhejiang and Shanghai and the social leaders, bury myself in hard work, and strive to repay the country in any way possible. As everyone knows, General Director Chiang has repeatedly instructed us that foreign insults are external aggression and oppression, while opium is self-degradation and suicide. Therefore, the danger of opium is actually greater than that of foreign insults. We must recognize that opium suppression is more important than all political construction work. If opium suppression cannot be effective, all other political construction work, no matter how hard we try, will not be effective." This shows the government's great determination to suppress opium. We should uphold the intention of the General Director, follow the promulgated plan, and earnestly implement it. Regarding opium suppression in Zhejiang Province, Lingyun will take this opportunity to briefly report that Zhejiang Province was originally designated as an absolutely opium-free province, and opium seedlings have almost been eliminated. The detailed planning for banning opium smoking is being carefully prepared, and a proper plan will be announced and implemented soon. Other work, such as the investigation and prohibition of opium planting, general inspections, and the anti-drug movement throughout Zhejiang Province, has also been jointly organized by our office, the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, and the provincial anti-drug association, and other work is being promoted and can be gradually implemented. As for Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners live together, the situation is more complicated. However, based on the recent situation, since General Director Chiang decided to eradicate opium, the local authorities have worked harder than before to implement opium suppression. The municipal government has taken the lead and implemented supervision and guidance, and the Opium Suppression Committee has worked hard to supervise and urge the police bureau to strictly investigate and arrest manufacturers, sellers, and smokers. Many opium cases have been cracked one after another. The Songhu Garrison Command has cooperated in the search and arrest, the Health Bureau has handled opium addiction treatment and opium suppression, and the Supervisory Office has engaged in supervision. In addition, Standing Committee Member Du Yuesheng has also set up a well-organized opium addiction treatment hospital in Pudong to accommodate opium addicts. The opium suppression facilities are all in place and have achieved remarkable results. This is something that Lingyun has always known. However, from a global perspective, the achievements made are still far from the original plans of the authorities here and the wishes of the central government. Why is this? The reason is that the concession authorities have not yet acted in unison with the outside world, so that opium addicts and drug dealers from various provinces use this special situation, gather together, and survive for a while, until the national opium suppression is affected. Mayor Yu, in view of this, has recently hosted Feixindun, the director of the Public and the International Settlement, Baodes, the French Consul General, and Faber, the chief of the French Concession Police, to discuss matters such as opium addicts' registration in the concessions, purchase of opium with permits, and strict suppression of smuggling. Mr. Fei and others have also expressed their goodwill. The details have been seen in the newspapers. If the Chinese and foreign authorities can cooperate sincerely in the future, it will be the dawn of opium suppression in Shanghai. The achievements that have been hoped for by China and foreign countries for more than ninety years can be achieved in one day. Is this not a great fortune? For this point, Standing Committee Member Du Yuesheng of the Opium Suppression Committee and the committee members have already resolved to work together to promote it, and Deputy Director Yu of the Supervisory Office has also expressed his willingness to assist in the progress. This is extremely admirable. Lingyun firmly believes that if the national officials and people can resolutely implement the opium suppression policy, the concession authorities will be moved and will eventually assist in the progress. The core of the problem lies in how our implementation plan is formulated. The government's orders should be absolutely enforced, and the special environment of the local area cannot be ignored. It should not be too slow or too urgent. It is necessary to plan carefully and implement step by step, starting with the registration of opium addicts, the purchase of opium with permits, and the strict suppression of smuggling. Then, we will widely establish opium addiction treatment hospitals and plan for rehabilitation measures such as opium addict factories. All of the above are of great importance, and we should strictly abide by our orders and work together with the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Opium Suppression Committee, and other relevant parties to achieve success. Today, all of you present are either heads of authorities, colleagues in opium suppression, elders and celebrities, or social leaders. I hope that you will give me supervision and guidance for my future work, so that I can use it as a compass. Lingyun will base the rise and fall of his courage to work on the amount of supervision and assistance given by you. Today, the reception is inadequate and there are many shortcomings. I hope you will forgive me and be honored by your presence and guidance, and I feel infinite gratitude. I would like to offer a toast and wish you all good health."

Speeches by Yang and Yu

After the speech by Special Commissioner Chen, Commander Yang Xiaotian of the Garrison gave a speech, stating that the opium suppression issue is related to the country's status and the nation's future. Shanghai is China's primary commercial port, and the implementation of opium suppression cannot be delayed. Fortunately, Special Commissioner Chen has been sent to Shanghai to preside over this matter, and the future results will definitely be considerable. I am honored to be in charge of the Songhu Garrison, and I should assist in opium suppression. I hope that in the future, we will work together to strive for the purpose of eradicating opium. Later, Acting Mayor Feng Jun of the Municipal Government gave a speech, stating that the importance of opium suppression in Shanghai is well known, and the central government attaches great importance to this. Therefore, Special Commissioner Chen has been sent to preside over opium suppression in Zhejiang and Shanghai. In the future, opium suppression can be guided. However, since General Director Chiang promulgated the opium suppression policy in Shanghai, all responsible authorities have worked hard to implement it. Although the situation here is special, as Special Commissioner Chen just said, various difficulties have occurred. However, the municipal government, with the assistance and supervision of the Garrison Command and the Opium Suppression Committee and other institutions, has worked hard and cannot be without achievements. For example, the police bureau has established a special department to handle investigation and arrest matters, and the Health Bureau has handled opium addiction treatment. Although it has not been able to develop as much as possible due to lack of funding, it has also achieved considerable results. This is something that I can be proud of. In short, the municipal government is working hard to promote opium suppression. It is actively carrying out what can be done, and is constantly looking for a way out for what cannot be done at the moment. We will strive to follow the central government's intention to suppress opium and the teachings of local people. As for the issue of promoting opium suppression in the concessions, such as opium addicts' registration and license smuggling, a consensus has been reached with the concession authorities on the principle, and there is some progress. Today, I hope that Special Commissioner Chen can provide various guidance and cooperation for opium suppression in Shanghai in the future. We should cooperate in the progress. Not only will the central government be disappointed in opium suppression in Shanghai. Finally, Wang Xiaofan, the Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Municipal Industry Committee, gave a speech, stating that the greatest disaster in China is opium. I have always been enthusiastic about anti-drug work and have also slightly sponsored the local opium industry. It is said that opium seedlings and drugs in Zhejiang Province have been eradicated. This is all thanks to the efforts of the authorities and Special Commissioner Chen. However, Shanghai still needs Special Commissioner Chen to work hard to supervise and guide in order to achieve the goal of completing opium suppression. However, the environments in Zhejiang and Shanghai are different, so it is hoped that the Shanghai people will take the initiative to make a decision to eliminate the opium disaster and give the government significant assistance, which will not only eradicate it but also wash away the shame. The Shanghai Opium Suppression Committee is promoting opium suppression under the guidance of the municipal government. Now, fortunately, Special Commissioner Chen has given guidance, and the future work will be more smooth. The atmosphere of opium suppression was very strong throughout the entire venue. Finally, Mr. Chen distributed the "Social Relief in Modern Countries," which he wrote after inspecting social relief undertakings in various European and American countries the year before last. The guests and hosts parted happily.

They discussed principles based on the resolution of the special meeting held by the three Japanese ministries of foreign affairs, navy, and army on the 10th of this month.

### Chinese Overseas Safeguard National Shipping Line as "Hai Heng" Vessel Sails Xiamen-Philippines Route

Overseas Compatriots Gladly Travel on Each Voyage; Business Revenue Gradually Increases

Since the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched the "Hai Heng" vessel to sail the Xiamen-Philippines route, it has been greatly welcomed by local overseas compatriots. The vessel has already sailed four times. Except for the first voyage from Xiamen to the Philippines, where the number of passengers was slightly less, the return trip from the Philippines to Xiamen reached 456 people. The second voyage from Xiamen carried 239 people, and the return trip from the Philippines carried 476 people. The third voyage from Xiamen carried 405 people, and the return trip from the Philippines carried 330 people. The fourth voyage from Xiamen carried 355 people, and the return trip from the Philippines carried 342 people. It is also heard that the Anqing vessel of the Taikoo Company, which sails between Xiamen and the Philippines, had 56 passengers arriving in Xiamen from the Philippines on April 26th and 78 passengers departing from Xiamen to the Philippines on April 27th. On May 4th, it had 13 passengers arriving in Xiamen from the Philippines, and on May 5th, it had 13 passengers departing from Xiamen to the Philippines. The comparison of passengers between the two vessels shows a significant difference. Generally, overseas Chinese have a strong patriotic spirit, so apart from a few people who are unable to catch the national vessel due to urgent business, almost everyone is eager to travel on the national vessel. Therefore, the first voyage of the national vessel overseas has achieved such good results. It is also found that in the past, more Chinese people traveled on national vessels on the Nanyang route (Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shanghai), followed by the Yangtze River route, and the Beiyang route was the rarest. However, the Yangtze River route is entirely for middle and upper-class passengers, and there are not many first-class passengers. The reason why first-class passengers are happy to travel on foreign vessels is that, apart from a few who are thrifty and have no patriotic concept, the rest are due to the past poor facilities and management of national vessels, which has created this perception. Recently, national vessels have gradually improved, surpassing foreign vessels in comparison. Anyone who has recently traveled on national vessels can attest to this. Chinese people may as well try traveling on national vessels at any time to fulfill their national duty to safeguard national shipping. It is also found that foreign nationals from countries such as Britain, Japan, Germany, and Italy residing in China all travel on merchant vessels of their own countries as a principle, rarely traveling on vessels from other countries or Chinese vessels. This is also driven by patriotism, similar to the mentality of overseas Chinese traveling on Chinese vessels. Speaking of overseas Chinese, their years of support for the revolution with manpower and financial resources to repay the motherland are truly admirable. This time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatching vessels to sail the Xiamen-Philippines route is merely a move by the government to facilitate overseas compatriots, while the overseas Chinese have expressed enthusiastic support. The outstanding members of the Chinese population in the country enjoy more convenience from the government and society than overseas Chinese, and their love for national vessels is indeed worthy of emulation. The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company announced that the total freight and passenger transportation revenue for March of this year was 1,110,006.10 yuan, an increase of 58% compared to the 700,102.09 yuan in March of the 25th year. It is found that March of last year was the second month after the company's reorganization. Compared with February of the 24th year before the reorganization (the revenue for March of the 24th year was approximately 600,000 yuan), it had already increased by approximately 100,000 yuan. Now, it has continued to increase, which is not easy to see.

### Two Vessels Cause Accidents

Mingxing Collides with Three Lighters

The Mingxing, a Yangtze River vessel of the Sanbei Steamship Company, departed from Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd, carrying cargo and passengers to Hankou. When it reached the Gonghexiang Wharf, the Gonghe vessel of Jardine Matheson was berthed outside, with several cargo lighters loaded with cargo preparing to transfer to the vessel. When the Mingxing vessel arrived there, to avoid a vessel at the wharf, it collided with three cargo lighters docked outside the Gonghe vessel. As a result of the collision, the hulls of the three lighters were damaged, and some of the cargo inside fell into the river, causing temporary chaos. The Wenming vessel quickly turned away and did not collide with the Gonghe vessel, but the three lighters were damaged and suffered heavy losses. After the accident, the Mingxing vessel continued to leave the port. The sailors of the three lighters reported the incident to the water police and prepared to negotiate with the Sanbei Company.

Changde Collides with Lighter Negotiation

The Changde vessel of the Liyuan Steamship Company departed from the Hongsheng Wharf at 7:50 PM on the 20th, heading to Qingdao to load coal. It was sailing slowly in the Huangpu River. When it reached the front of the NYK Wharf, two junks suddenly blocked the river. To avoid colliding with and sinking the two junks, the captain of the Changde vessel immediately dropped anchor. Unexpectedly, at this time, a large iron lighter No. 176 of the Shanghai Transportation Association, with a capacity of 400 tons and loaded with cargo, was docked on the river at the Xinhuishan Wharf. When the Changde vessel dropped anchor, the wind and waves in the river were extremely strong, causing the hull to collide with the iron lighter. Fortunately, it did not crack and flood, damaging the cargo in the lighter. Yesterday, the merchants requested the Liyuan Steamship Company to compensate for all the damages. Liyuan has reported to the China Ship Insurance Joint Association and sent a naval architect to the Xinhuishan Wharf to inspect the extent of the damage to the lighter and then decide on a solution.

### After the Haiyuan Vessel Runs Aground, the Head Office Sends Personnel to Hong Kong by Plane for Rescue

Can Be Rescued in Five Days; Cargo in the First and Second Holds Damaged; Total Value Over 800,000 Yuan

The Haiyuan vessel of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ran aground at the Jishui Gate lighthouse in Hong Kong, and the passengers were rescued, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the first and second holds of the vessel are stuck on the reef, and the hull cannot move. The cargo loaded in the first hold has now been identified as more than 9,000 bags of white rice worth 100,000 yuan shipped from Shanghai to Guangzhou, all of which have been submerged in water. In the second hold, there are more than 2,600 pieces of textiles and cotton yarn worth over 700,000 yuan, as well as miscellaneous goods, all of which have been damaged by water and are deteriorating. Most of these damaged passengers and cargo are insured. Yesterday, the bureau received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that after inspection by the technicians of Taikoo Dockyard, the Haiyuan can be rescued. The only problem now is unloading the cargo inside the vessel. Yesterday, barges were dispatched to the side of the vessel to unload the cargo, which is expected to be completed within five days. At that time, the hull can use the force of reduced draft to float to the surface of the reef, and then proceed to patch with cement and then pump water. However, it will be at least next Wednesday or Thursday to repair the hole. The bureau received this telegram and ordered Li Yunqu, the head of the assessment section, to take a plane to Hong Kong at 6:00 AM yesterday to take charge of the rescue. The duties of the head of the assessment section in the bureau have been reassigned to Captain Chen Yukun of the Jiangyu vessel so that Li Yunqu can concentrate on handling the rescue of the Haiyuan. According to the person in charge of the bureau, two small vessels have now been dispatched to operate exclusively between Jishui Gate and Hong Kong to ferry passengers' luggage and other items from the Haiyuan vessel to Hong Kong for passengers to claim. As for the passengers who have already arrived in Hong Kong, all food, accommodation, and other expenses will be borne by the bureau, and the bureau will purchase ship tickets for each person to transfer to other vessels to Guangdong. According to a telegram from Hong Kong, after the Haiyuan vessel ran aground, it was pushed by wind and rain on the night of the 21st, and the hull tilted, only inches from the water surface, which was quite dangerous. Passengers' luggage was transported to Hong Kong by bureau personnel for distribution. Each passenger will transfer to the Haili vessel to the province. According to a Central News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 22nd, the Hong Kong branch of China Merchants originally scheduled to hire a small vessel at 11:30 AM on the 22nd to carry passengers of the Haiyuan vessel to claim their luggage, but the plan was temporarily suspended due to heavy rain and high tide, and the Haiyuan hull tilted deeply, fearing danger. At 2:30 PM, staff were dispatched again to take a small vessel to the Haiyuan vessel to unload luggage and return to Hong Kong to notify passengers to retrieve it. The Haili vessel is scheduled to transfer all passengers to the province after arriving in Hong Kong on the morning of the 23rd. Li Yunqu was dispatched to Hong Kong by the head office of China Merchants to investigate the truth about the grounding. Li arrived at 2:00 PM on the 23rd and immediately went to the Haiyuan vessel for inspection.

### Truth About French Police Crossing Boundary and Injuring People

Hou Yishan and Hou Guisheng's Injuries Are Not Serious; Police Bureau Investigates the Incident and Reports to the Municipal Government

At about 4:00 AM on the 21st of this month, in the Houjiazhai area of western Shanghai, an incident occurred in which Annamese police officers from the French Concession crossed into the Chinese territory and robbed and injured villagers Hou Yishan and Hou Guisheng. Since the newspapers reported on this yesterday, all circles have been shocked and indignant. The Municipal Police Bureau attaches great importance to this case, as it is within its jurisdiction. In addition to dispatching Ye Gongding, the chief of the Xujiahui Police Station, to investigate the scene after the incident, yesterday, Wang Dasui, the director of the Supervisory Department, was also dispatched to investigate the incident in detail. After obtaining clear statements from the witness Hou Jianshan and the communicator, the case has become clear. The bureau immediately reported to the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting negotiations. The truth about this case has been obtained from the bureau as follows:

Cause of the Incident

Houjiazhai is located within the Chinese boundary to the west of Route Haig, a road built by the French Concession beyond its boundary. Hou Tongshan, a resident of the area, has a sick son and is accustomed to superstition. Therefore, at about 2:30 AM on the 21st, Hou Jianshan, Hou Yishan, Hou Guisheng, and Xu Pinshan carried paper ingots and funeral objects to the entrance of Houjia Lane on the east side of Route Haig to burn them. At that time, Annamese police officers No. 831 and No. 424 from the French Concession were patrolling there and wanted to stop them. Hou Yishan and others were ignorant villagers who were afraid of being detained and fined, so they fled west into the Chinese territory. The police officers then drew their guns and chased them, opening fire. This is the cause of the incident.

Incident Process

When the gun was fired, Hou Jianshan was still guarding the burning funeral objects. Three gunshots were suddenly fired. Without waiting for the funeral objects to burn out, he rushed back and saw that Hou Yishan and Hou Guisheng had been shot in the feet and legs near No. 628 Lane on Route Haig. Hou Jianshan used a flashlight to illuminate the area and saw a police officer with number 424. When asked who fired the gun, he admitted that he did. Then, a Chinese police officer was found with number 831. By the time Hou Jianshan returned home, the two injured people had already been carried back. Hou immediately telegraphed the police station and other units to report the incident and accompanied people to send the injured people to the Red Cross Hospital for bandaging. Because there were no wards, they were transferred to Zhongshan Hospital. Subsequently, the French Police Station in Lujiawan sent a Frenchman and three Chinese people to the hospital, claiming that they wanted to send the two injured people to Guangci Hospital. While they were arguing, Zhongshan Hospital also advised them to take them home for treatment because the wards were full. So, they hired a car to leave the hospital. Unexpectedly, the people from the police station followed them to the vicinity of Avenue Petain, blocked their way, and ordered the injured to be sent to Guangci Hospital. Hou and others were subdued under duress. Then, the people from the police station took Hou Jianshan and others to the scene of the incident to investigate and took Hou Jianshan and Hou Siquan to the police station on Avenue Petain to take statements and beat them. Finally, they were transferred to Lujiawan Police Station, where they were questioned again as before. Then, Xu Pinshan, who witnessed the incident at the time, was summoned and questioned as usual. At about 5:00 AM, Hou, Xu, and others were released.

Handling Measures

The injured Hou Yishan and Hou Guisheng are currently staying in the second-floor ward of Guangci Hospital. Although their injuries are not serious, the police officers from the French Police Station arbitrarily broke into the boundary and opened fire at will, which is a disregard for the law and damages sovereignty. The authorities will certainly argue on the basis of reason. Hou Siquan and others later picked up three shell casings and one bullet. After verification, they all belong to the French Concession police. The Municipal Police Bureau is now continuing to monitor Hou and others' injuries and is also increasing strict protection in the area. It has decided to report the current situation to the Municipal Government.

Ms. Gao Yuzhu, the representative of the Yi and Miao chieftains of Southwest China, came to Peking with Mr. Yu Jiecai, the representative of the Yi people, to petition and promote the current situation of the Yi and Miao peoples, which has gained sympathy and support from all parties.

According to reporters from the Shenshi News Agency, Gao Yuzhu and others were originally scheduled to go to Hunan this week to return to their posts. In order to promote the formal establishment of the association and to raise funds for the development of the border region so as to avoid coming to Shanghai again in the future, which would be time-consuming, they have decided to postpone their departure and stay in Shanghai for about a month to achieve something in their work. They have already telegraphed the central government and Chairman He of Hunan Province, explaining the situation so that they can concentrate on their work.

Rules and regulations have been formulated and notices have been published to start collecting exhibits. In recent days, manufacturers have been going to the Preparatory Committee's office (located in the First Section of the Social Affairs Bureau) to obtain forms for application, and the response has been very enthusiastic. The deadline for collecting exhibits has been set for the 25th of this month, in order to allocate space in advance. Furthermore, due to the urgent timeframe of the exhibition, all matters are being expedited. A second preparatory meeting was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce a few days ago. The attendees included Cheng Shouchong, Xu Jianruo, Hu Xiyuan, Wang Jiangqiang, Zhu Luohuan, Lu Xingzhuang, Wang Xingyao, Fang Zhicheng, Gao Shiheng, Shao Yuxiang, Yang Zhuqi, Mi Jifang, and Wu Huan, a total of nine people. Those present as observers included Zhou Zanming, Liu Peiqian, Chen Zeyi, Jiang Zhiyong, Shen Sheng, and Fang Maosong, heads of various departments of the committee, totaling six people. Pan Gongzhan chaired the meeting, with Wu Huan acting as the chairman. First, a report was given on the construction progress of the exhibition venue and the collection of exhibits. Then, discussions began, and the important resolutions included: ㊀ Publishing a special issue of the conference magazine, which will contain all the rules and news related to the industrial exhibition, introduce the products of various factories, introduce the history of various factories, and publish advertisements for various factories. The source of funding will be advertising revenue and subsidies from the conference. ㊁ Adding an outdoor performance area. ㊂ If time permits, a circular small train will be added between the venues, and visitors can ride for free. ㊃ This time, various exhibitions are being held simultaneously, creating a great appeal. This industrial exhibition will break away from the past commercial display format and strive to be industrialized, so as to enhance citizens' understanding of domestic products. As a result, the five units originally planned are not enough, and manufacturers are requesting additional space. The conference has complied with the requests of various manufacturers and is doing its best to expand the space. In addition, in order to make the industrial exhibition more vivid, the conference will invite participating manufacturers to automatically provide electricity, telephone installations, and electric lighting to promote industrial publicity to the fullest extent. It is reported that Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Yabu'er Electric Appliance Factory, and others will provide a large number of electric fans and light bulbs to meet the needs of the conference.

### Chen Shen'an Revisits Pan Water and Solicits Essays

Chen Tao of Jinshan Township, Huang Chengen, Jin Zhongying, Pan Yuzhen, Gao Huang, Gu Liu, and more than eighty others, are soliciting essays for Mr. Chen Shen'an's revisit to Pan Water. The solicitation announcement is as follows: We believe that touring the school and entering the Pan is a term from the imperial examination era. However, judging from the name, we know that the beginning of a scholar's journey must be to take the sage as a reliance. The purpose lies in the fact that proper governance and the prosperity of the people are not unique to the imperial examination era. Furthermore, revisiting Pan Water has always been regarded as a good story in Confucian circles. In the past, those who were called good stories respected the elderly and paid tribute to those with virtue. Today, the importance of the relationship is more than that. Since the imperial examination was changed to schools, for thirty years, the sound and light between the schools have disappeared. Because there is no entering the Pan, there is no sage. Because there is no sage, there is no purpose. When people are restless, heresy is rampant, and chaos abounds, the country is in danger. Those who do not know look at the palace walls and sigh with emotion, saying that the abolition of the imperial examination is to blame, but is this really a sound argument? The imperial university bells and drums, the circular bridge, and the jade water are all tools for creating people in prosperous times and a place for bathing and transforming heroes. There is no so-called imperial examination. The rise of the imperial examination certainly has its good intentions, but the drawbacks of the later generations are that they only pursue profits and lack true cultivation. Therefore, the imperial examination should be abolished, but the ceremony of entering the Pan must not be abolished. Today, there are schools all over the country, and students in schools all have graduation. Graduation all has examinations, and the quality of the examinations all has grades. If we were to select outstanding students to hold the ceremony of entering the Pan, show them the purpose, and promote them to glorious positions, who would not want to enter the sage's door and become a national treasure? It is strange that the officials in charge of the country advocate offering sacrifices to Confucius and restoring the old morality, but books and newspapers that destroy customs and habits still fill the market. The essence of righteousness and enlightenment, the Six Classics and the Four Books, are still regarded as tattered shoes. There are those who advocate it, but no one agrees with it. Is it true that the theory of schools cannot cultivate talents? It is also because there is a desire to cultivate, but the body and use are not discussed. The fundamental and initial things of moral principles and teachings are ignored. Today, our Chen Shenlao of our town revisits Pan Water to start this trend, and the scholars of the past who must take the sage as a reliance will be clearly understood in the minds of everyone. Auspicious clouds and Shao music, watching and listening are new, children cheer, and the elders support their canes. From this, the purpose is clear, and the guiding principle is established. Those who teach know where to start, and scholars know where to follow. The civilization and prosperity of our country for thousands of years can be seen in today's schools, and the sound of the trees is admired by all. Isn't it beautiful? Shenlao's original name was Guozhen, and he changed his name to Yifen. He was promoted to the capital early in his career and achieved great success. Examining the year he entered the Pan, it was in the Dingchou year of the Qing Guangxu era, exactly sixty years ago. On May 21st of the national calendar (the 14th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar), he will perform the ceremony of worshiping the sage. Colleagues admire the local sage and are fortunate to encounter this grand ceremony. On the day of Shenlao's worship of the sage, a gathering will be held at the Zhujing Business and People's Paradise, hoping to have the legacy of the ancient rural drinking ceremony. We only hope that the rich and talented will write with a powerful pen, regardless of poetry, prose, lyrics, calligraphy, or painting, and send them in an endless stream. We welcome them infinitely. Shenlao has always been fond of writing and hopes to use this auspicious occasion to form a bond of ink, which will be praised by all gentlemen.

### Patrol Chief and Others Obstructing Freedom, Court Investigation Clear

Public Prosecution Has Been Filed, Hearing Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled for the 26th

Zhang Yunian, the patrol chief of the Lujiabang Sanguantang Police Station in Nanshi, thirty-six years old, from Zhejiang, and police officers Feng Shouju, twenty-seven years old, from Anhui, and Ge Zhen, twenty-two years old, from Suqian, intimidated the party concerned, Zhong Guofan, and coerced Zhong's innocent mother, Ms. Wang, to the police station, obstructing her freedom. Zhong sued the local court, and prosecutor Huang Meiqing investigated and clearly prosecuted the defendants after releasing them on bail. The original text of the indictment is excerpted as follows: The facts of the crime are that Zhong Guofan injured Xia Chengwen on April 12th. The defendant Feng Shouju took him to the Sanguantang Police Station and took the opportunity to hang him on a tree for a while and beat him, causing injury. He also extorted twelve yuan for medical expenses without success. He was sent to the Ximen Branch Bureau, and Zhong Guofan paid Xia Chengwen two yuan for medical expenses. Later, the defendant and the defendants Zhang Yun and Ge Zhen were accused by Zhong Guofan of fraud and other crimes. The defendants, out of dissatisfaction, used the name to collect medical expenses. On the 17th, they discussed with the defendants Feng Shouju and Ge Zhen to carry guns and invite Xia Chengwen and Liu Zhongguo to the home of Fan Jiazhai, Zhong Guofan. The defendants used guns to force his mother, Ms. Wu, to go to the police station, where the defendant Zhang Yun interrogated her and ordered her to hand over Zhong Guofan. Zhong Guofan has successively told the court about the evidence and the articles of law violated. After investigation, the informant Zhong Guofan has repeatedly testified that the defendant Feng Shouju beat Xia Chengwen for injuring Zhong Guofan, extorted medical expenses, and hung him on a tree for a while. The defendant does not deny the fact that he took Zhong Guofan home to collect medical expenses. Xia Chengwen only admitted that he wanted Zhong Guofan to treat his injuries and did not ask him for compensation. Liu Rujun testified that the inspector of No. 3999 (i.e., Feng Shouju) hung Zhong Guofan on a tree for two minutes and punched him in the chest. It is clear that the defendant wanted to extort money, obstruct the freedom of others, and injure their bodies. The evidence is solid. He has committed the crimes of Article 339, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 3, Article 302, Paragraph 1, and Article 277, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Due to the relationship between the method and the result, he should be punished according to Article 55 of the same law. Furthermore, Xia Chengwen was injured by Zhong Guofan, and the Ximen Branch Bureau has reconciled the matter. Zhong Guofan paid two yuan for medical expenses, as evidenced by Xia Chengwen's testimony. After the defendants Zhang Yun, Feng Shouju, and Ge Zhen were accused of fraud by Zhong Guofan, they forced his mother to the police station for interrogation. Although the defendants claimed that Xia Chengwen asked for medical expenses, they refused to reveal the truth. However, it was found that the defendants went to invite Xia Chengwen to Zhong Guofan's house, and Xia Chengwen had no intention of asking for medical expenses or making another complaint. Xia Chengwen also testified clearly. The victims admitted that they had taken Zhong Guofan's mother, Ms. Wang, to the police station for interrogation. Therefore, Zhong Guofan's complaint that the defendants forced his mother to the police station is also obvious. The defendants have jointly committed the crime of Article 302, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Furthermore, the defendants are police officers and are civil servants. They should be sentenced with increased punishment according to the first half of Article 134 of the same law. The defendant Feng Shouju is prosecuted separately, and the obstruction of freedom is combined according to Article 51 of the same law. Therefore, the prosecution is filed according to Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Yesterday, Judge Li Xuedeng opened a court hearing and summoned both parties and witnesses to provide testimony as described above. The defendants hired lawyer Fang Junjie to defend them. After the court debate, the sentencing is scheduled for the 26th.

### He Shirong Smuggles Copper and Iron

Intercepted by Patrol Officer

He Shirong, an old goods dealer, and his brother, Shitie, often store scrap materials such as old copper and old iron collected from the city in houses at No. 2 and No. 17 Zhangjiazhai, Chezhan Road, Nanshi. Once a sufficient amount is collected, it is transported to a certain iron factory in Hongkou for sale in order to make a profit. The day before yesterday, He Shirong hired a car to transport about four or five hundred catties of old copper and iron scrap materials. While driving near Chenjiaqiao, it was discovered by the on-duty police officer and taken to the station for interrogation. It was learned that there were still more than two thousand catties of goods stored that had not been transported out. While they were trying to seize it, He Shitie had already learned the news. Fearing that there would be unfavorable consequences, he hired three rickshaws in the evening and secretly loaded all the goods in the house and moved them elsewhere. He invited his fellow townsman He Zhonglou and a woman named Cui Zhou to escort the car. When the car arrived at Guohuo Road, it was seen by household registration patrol officer Hu Yinong, who immediately stopped it for questioning. The speech was evasive. They were taken to the Ximen Branch Bureau together. Then, several police officers were sent to the two houses to seize about one thousand catties of old iron and other scrap materials and brought them back. Yesterday, the case was reported to the General Bureau along with the evidence for investigation.

### Apprentice Conflict Gouges Out Eyeball

Ling Yangbai's Injuries are Dangerous, Arrest Postpones Prosecution

Ye Changfu (17 years old) and Ling Yangbai (16 years old), apprentices at the Minle Barber Shop at No. 279 Guangdong Road, Yangzhou, had an argument for some trivial reason at 8:15 p.m. the day before yesterday. Ye then struck Ling's head with the iron hook used to rake ashes in the stove. When he retracted the hook, the tip of the hook accidentally touched Ling's eye, causing the eyeball to be gouged out, causing serious injury. Hua Constable No. 398 heard the police report and arrested Ye. Ling was taken to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Ye was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court. The arrest room lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the case, saying that the extent of Ling Yangbai's injuries was still unpredictable. Therefore, the prosecution of this case is currently postponed, and only a temporary detention is requested. After Judge Feng Shide's investigation, he ruled that the hearing be postponed.

I respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you. Zhang Daopan ㊁ I have heard that your association has been established. From now on, you will lead the film industry to shine brightly.

### Fugitive in Robbery and Murder Case Awaiting Sentencing

Tang Jiuyuan and Others Escorted to the Local Court

At 1:10 a.m. on April 4th of this year, a number of robbers broke into a timber warehouse at No. 463 Tokyo Road. An employee in charge of the warehouse, Yu Yongchun, shouted "Robbers!" and was shot and killed by the robbers. The group, seeing the great disaster they had caused, fled in different directions and could not be arrested. At about 4:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month, Huishan Police Station Detective Zhou Guisheng, Detective Xu Bingnan, and Ma Wenda learned that the gang of robbers from Qinzhou, Tang Jiuyuan, Liu Xiaokouzi, and Du Liangdong, and Tang's brother Jiusong were hiding in a bungalow at Sun Temple, Zhabei, and at No. 111 Jinling Road. They cooperated with Western detectives and rushed to the scene. They asked the police station in charge to arrest the three names including Tang Jiuyuan and others at the address. Tang Jiusong took the opportunity to escape through the roof. A Mauser pistol was found in the search, along with the suspects Shen Jinbiao and a woman named Liu Zhang, and were sent to the First Special District Court. Shen Jinbiao and Liu Zhang were found to be innocent and were released first. The rest were returned to custody. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Qing visited the Criminal Division Three to review the case. The police lawyer Zhang Dayin stated that after Yu Yongchun, the watchman of the timber warehouse on Tokyo Road, was shot and killed by robbers, the Chinese and Western detectives of the police station found a shell casing and a bullet at the scene, which were found to have been fired from the Mauser pistol seized. Tang Jiusong was scheduled to be captured, but he could not be detained. The defendant Du Liangdong admitted in the police station that Jiang Miaolin, Tang Jiusong, Xu Afu, and Wang Amao went to the entrance of the timber warehouse on Tokyo Road, pried open the door, and he and Wang Amao were outside guarding the perimeter. The defendants Tang Jiuyuan and Liu Xiaokouzi claimed to be unrelated to the case, privately hiding firearms and living in the Chinese district. The police station in charge requested to be brought back to the court for disposal. Tang Jiuyuan and Liu Xiaokouzi firmly claimed that the seized pistol belonged to Jiusong and that they were not aware of the rest. Du Liangdong's statement was the same as Zhang's lawyer's statement. Zhong Judge ordered Du Liangdong to be returned to custody pending sentencing. Tang Jiuyuan and Liu Xiaokouzi were transferred to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office.

### Judgment in the Case of Abandonment Filed by Li Huijun

Zhang Huisun Acquitted in Court, Civil Suit Attached to Immigration Court for Trial

Zhang Huisun, a 36-year-old man from Zhenhai residing at No. 5 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, had a relationship with a woman from Ningbo, Li Huijun, and rented a house to live together. During the cohabitation period, Zhang wrote a note stating that if he fell in love with someone else in the future, he would be willing to pay Li one thousand yuan in national currency. Last winter, Zhang suddenly abandoned Li, so Li filed a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Zhang of violating Article 229 of the Criminal Law and Article 293 of the same law, harming public morals and abandonment, and attached a civil suit, demanding payment of one thousand yuan in national currency. This case has been summoned twice by the First Special Court, but because the defendant did not arrive, the case was ordered to be adjourned for further questioning. All the details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon, the case was continued by Judge Xiao Xiefei in Criminal Division Two. Zhang Huisun also surrendered to the court with a lawyer. Li Huijun was also represented by lawyer Yan Yinwu. According to lawyer Yan, the lawsuit in this case was not written by this lawyer. The facts alleged by the plaintiff and the articles of law in the indictment may not be consistent. Therefore, the court is requested to make a judgment based on the plaintiff's testimony. As for the civil part, it is requested to be transferred to the Civil Court. When questioned, Zhang Huisun actually pointed out that the plaintiff was a dancing girl and a prostitute, saying that this point could be investigated at the Xin Xin, Zhongnan, Dadong, and other hotels. The first time I met her was in a Korean village at Ningxingfang. Afterwards, although I often went to the house rented by the plaintiff to play, I only paid the corresponding price and acted as a guest. There was no other relationship. Later, because I was repeatedly threatened, I stopped going there. Li Huijun, upon hearing this, immediately claimed that I was originally a woman from a good family, and my uncle was also a doctor. Now that the defendant has changed his mind and used false words to insult me, it is very painful. The court, seeing that the facts were clear, ordered the debate to begin. After the lawyers of both parties debated with each other, Judge Xiao immediately announced the judgment in court, acquitting Zhang Huisun. The plaintiff's attached civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.

### Conclusion of Ancient Book Lawsuit

Sentencing Scheduled for the 28th

Xu Jiaheng, a wealthy merchant from Songjiang, 29 years old, residing in the central market of Songjiang, had his sister married to Wang Liting, a wealthy merchant from Tinglin, Songjiang, 37 years old. Xu's family owned a collection of 1,130 books, which suddenly disappeared and were later discovered at Wang's Shanghai residence. The matter was reported to the police, and Wang and the books were taken into custody and sent to the inland court. The Shanghai District Court heard the case. In the first trial, Judge Tan Zhuohong sentenced Wang Liting to imprisonment. However, before the sentencing, Tan allegedly solicited bribes from lawyer Yang Shaopeng, which failed. As a result, he was reported by the defense lawyer, leading to Tan and Yang being sued in the High Court. This case is one of them. Now, after being sent back for retrial by the Third Instance Court, Wang Liting has been heard. Yesterday afternoon, the court, presided over by Judge Cai Dingcheng, with Judges Wang Shanxiang and Yu Lude, held the final debate. Xu Jiaheng stated, "These books were inherited from my ancestors, and they all bear my grandfather's signature and seal. They were donated to the ancestral hall, but it hasn't been built yet, so they were still in my possession." Wang Liting, 37 years old, stated, "Twenty-four years ago, I was sick at the Guangci Hospital, and my wife was about to give birth, so we moved to 559 Route Lafayette temporarily. These books were given to me by my mother-in-law many years ago, and I wasn't stealing them to run away." Witness Li Liubao, a porter, testified, "The books were loaded by someone from Songjiang onto a boat and transported to the residence of Mr. Wang (Wang Liting) on Route Lafayette. Wang issued a receipt at the time, which I brought back to the person on the boat." Witness Xu Guanfu, 50 years old, a Shanghai native residing at Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, testified, "In late April or early May of the year before last, I transported a total of twelve packages of books from Songjiang. I asked Li Liubao to deliver them to the residence of Mr. Wang on Route Lafayette. Wang Liting asked me to load these books from Xitan, Songjiang." At this point, the lawyers for both parties each presented their arguments for their clients. The court adjourned the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the 28th.

### Animal Protection Society Requests Elimination of Animal Sacrifices in Internal Rituals

Requests a Nationwide Order for Compliance, Replacing Animal Sacrifices with Flower Offerings or Incense Burning

The Chinese Animal Protection Society submitted a petition to the Ministry of Interior yesterday, requesting a nationwide order to abolish the practice of animal sacrifice in all kinds of rituals. The original petition stated: "This society respectfully requests that a nationwide order be issued to prohibit the use of sacrificial animals in the Dingji ceremonies to demonstrate frugality and protect life. This case was approved by the Ministry. (Omitted) The methods for commemorating the birthday of Confucius and the order of memorial meetings were amended and approved by the 128th Central Standing Committee meeting and communicated to the National Government for compliance. The aforementioned commemoration methods do not include any provisions for animal sacrifice. It is hoped that this approval will be noted. (Omitted) It is hoped that the Ministry will strive to improve customs. It is believed that rituals are meant to show respect. In the past, the use of sacrificial animals was based on the superstitious belief in blood sacrifice. Therefore, whenever prayers for blessings or vows of gratitude were made, animals were slaughtered as sacrifices to solicit retribution and manifest abundance. In reality, this kind of behavior goes against the spirit of science. Even if it is done to show respect, killing animals implicitly teaches people to be unkind, which is morally inappropriate. Now that the methods for commemorating the birthday of Confucius do not include any provisions for animal sacrifice, but in fact, all localities still follow the habit of slaughtering animals for sacrifices, it is evident that deeply ingrained customs need to be corrected to comply with the law. Furthermore, if we extend this to all public and private rituals, the practice of killing animals is still considered necessary, and there is no awareness of reform, which has a significant impact on the people's thoughts and beliefs. It is believed that at this time of promoting a new way of life and correcting old habits, this world-unique custom of animal sacrifice should be banned immediately. The government should stipulate that all rituals should replace animal sacrifices with flower offerings or incense burning, which not only conforms to the ancient meaning of fragrant offerings but also serves as a demonstration of sincerity, respect, and propriety. However, changing customs requires the promotion and dissemination of government orders to be effective. Therefore, a special petition is submitted to the Ministry, requesting that animal sacrifice be abolished in all kinds of rituals and replaced with flower offerings or incense burning. This will not only shift customs but also save a considerable amount of waste nationwide each year. It is hoped that this request will be reviewed and implemented, as it would be a virtuous act. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Interior."

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (25)

Q: I previously remitted 100 yuan to a friend in Hankou from the Nanjing Post Office, enclosing the money order in a registered letter and obtaining a registration receipt. However, shortly after mailing the letter, I received a letter from my friend stating that he had gone to Zhongxian, Sichuan, due to certain matters. For the sake of convenience, I enclosed the registration receipt from the Nanjing Post Office and directly wrote to the Hankou Post Office, requesting that the registered letter be redirected to Zhongxian, Sichuan, and stated that it contained a money order. Later, my friend wrote from Zhongxian, stating that the registered letter redirected from Hankou had been received, but the Zhongxian Post Office refused to cash the money order, stating that the remitter must apply to the original issuing post office for redirection. Upon hearing this, I felt very confused. The registered letter containing the money order was redirected from Hankou to Zhongxian. Why can't the money order be cashed at the Zhongxian Post Office? What procedures need to be followed? Please advise.

A: To redirect a money order from one payment location to another, the remitter must submit the money order and the remittance receipt in writing to the original issuing post office. Your letter to the Hankou Post Office requesting redirection only applied to the registered letter containing the money order. It naturally does not apply to the money order itself. The Zhongxian Post Office cannot cash the money order before the redirection procedures have been completed. The redirection procedures are summarized below:

Postal money orders are in two parts. The first part (the money order itself) is given to the remitter to enclose in a registered letter and mail. The second part is the stub (called the verification slip by the post office), which the issuing post office sends directly to the paying post office for verification. Therefore, when a money order is redirected from payment location A to payment location B, the remitter must submit the money order and its receipt, along with a redirection fee of one dime in national currency, in writing to the issuing post office. The post office will then correct the name of the original paying post office on the money order and receipt and return them to the remitter for remailing. At the same time, the post office will fill out a special redirection notice and send it to the original paying post office, directing the money order stub to be sent to the newly designated paying post office so that the remitter can cash the money order at that post office after it arrives at the newly designated location. Also, the remittance rates vary in different locations. If the remittance fee at the newly designated location is higher than at the original paying location, the remitter must pay the difference. If the remitter does not wish to pay at the time of application, the new paying post office can deduct the amount from the remittance when paying out. For example, if the remittance fee from Nanjing to Hankou for 100 yuan is two dimes, and the remittance rate from Nanjing to Zhongxian, Sichuan, is one cent per yuan, then 100 yuan requires one yuan. After deducting the two dimes already paid, eight dimes must be made up when applying for redirection. If you do not wish to pay at that time, the Zhongxian Post Office can deduct it when paying out to your friend, which means paying out 99 yuan and two dimes. Also, regarding the situation you described, since your friend's letter leaving Hankou arrived on the same day as the remittance, it was not necessary to write to the Hankou Post Office to request redirection. You only needed to inquire at the Nanjing Post Office. If the registered letter you mailed had not yet been sent out, you could withdraw the original letter according to the prescribed procedures and correct the money order at the same time, which would save you unnecessary trouble.

### Resolution of Labor Dispute at Yuantai and Other Silk Factories

Party and Government Determined on Amicable Settlement

The labor dispute at the Yuantai Silk Weaving Factory on Chang'an Road, Zhabei, which was triggered by a fight involving the foreman in the middle of this month, resulting in a strike by all workers, has lasted for a week without resolution. The nearby Tongcheng and Chongyang factories also went on strike in solidarity. Recognizing that this situation violated the principles of resolving labor disputes and promoting labor-management coordination, the municipal party department, represented by Dai Youheng Shouyun, and the social affairs bureau, represented by Wang Xianqing and Zhang Chuqiang, together with Lu Pei, the head of the Hengfeng Road police station, convened a meeting of both labor and management yesterday afternoon to earnestly mediate. As a result, a resolution agreement was reached, consisting of thirteen articles. Workers at all three factories were permitted to resume work at 6:00 AM on the 24th.

### Public Works Department Encourages the Use of Rubber-Tired Handcarts

Handcarts with iron wheels are extremely damaging to the road surface. Leading cities at home and abroad do not allow them to run on public roads. In the Shanghai International Settlement alone, road maintenance expenses in 1936 totaled 1,254,968 yuan, mostly used to repair road surfaces damaged by iron-wheeled handcarts. However, the fees collected for handcart licenses only amounted to 205,903 yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council recently introduced new measures, stipulating that the license fees for handcarts equipped with rubber tires can be reduced by half of the original fee for iron-wheeled vehicles as an incentive. According to a recent publication by the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Shanxi Highway Bureau purchased 100 sets of rubber wheels and tires from Dunlop Rubber Company for use on donkey carts, enabling them to travel on the province's motor roads. Although the cost per vehicle is higher than iron wheels, old-fashioned vehicles with iron wheels can only carry 1,200 to 1,500 pounds and require two donkeys to pull them. Now, rubber-tired wheels with ball bearings can carry 4,000 to 4,400 pounds and only require one donkey to pull them, without damaging the road surface. Therefore, although the initial installation cost is higher, the time saved, labor saved, and increased load capacity make it the most economical and beneficial new equipment for municipal administration.

Using Rubber Wheels Requires Only Two People While Increasing Load and Causing No Damage to the Road Surface

### Poor Spring Cocoon Harvest This Year

Mulberry Prices Rise, Silkworm Farmers Unable to Afford Purchases; Poor Weather Causes Inferior Silkworm Development

This year's spring silkworms are now at the stage of spinning cocoons. According to消息 from the silk industry in Shanghai, the spring silkworms have been greatly affected, and the harvest has been greatly reduced. The reasons for the poor harvest are twofold: first, the poor weather has hindered development; second, the price of mulberry leaves is too high, and silkworm farmers cannot afford to buy them, with many abandoning their silkworms. Therefore, the price of cocoons has risen sharply this year, exceeding the standard price of Chao Mountain.

### Suzhou Native Place Association Held Board Meeting Yesterday

The Suzhou Native Place Association of Shanghai, located on Xinjiang Road and Datong Road in Shanghai, held a board meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday.

Those interested in joining the association can obtain membership forms from the association's directors.

### Municipal United Branch Associations Request Curbing the Demolition of Mezzanine Floors

Demolition Will Lead to Homelessness, Compassion Should be Shown to Impoverished Citizens

The district branch associations of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association, including the 7th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 27th, and 42nd districts, sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Municipal United General Association yesterday, stating: "We are writing to express our great astonishment upon reading recent reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement is planning to demolish mezzanine floors on the grounds that they are unhygienic. In fact, residents build mezzanine floors because rent is high and property taxes are heavy. Tenants in three-room houses cannot afford to rent, so landlords have no choice but to divide and build mezzanine floors to make it easier to rent out and avoid losses. Now, there are over 80,000 mezzanine floors in the First Special District. Once demolished, it will not only cause residents to lose more than 300,000 yuan in construction costs, but also cause 240,000 people to lose their homes and become homeless, considering that an average of three people live in each mezzanine floor. The seriousness of the situation cannot be ignored. Everyone desires comfort and to live in tall buildings, but they are forced to live in mezzanine floors due to economic hardship. The municipal authorities, whose service goal is to improve public welfare, should show compassion to these impoverished citizens and help them make a living. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement not only fails to do this but also wants to deprive citizens of their minimum housing rights. This policy of excluding the poor is unprecedented in any city in the world. We have always admired your association's unremitting efforts to protect the welfare of citizens. We urge you to uphold justice and quickly devise effective countermeasures to stop this erroneous act, so that impoverished citizens can live in peace. We eagerly await your response."

### Shanghai Cocoon Merchants Complete Cocoon Purchases, Factories Prepare to Start Production

Spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been put on the market one after another. However, due to unfavorable weather conditions and uneven rainfall, the cocoons have been significantly affected. It is estimated that Zhejiang Province will harvest about 300,000 dan of improved varieties and about 200,000 dan of local varieties. Jiangsu Province, on the other hand, will have a smaller quantity, and most of the spring cocoons have been purchased by silk factories in Wuxi. Currently, about 40 silk factories in Shanghai have gone to Zhejiang and Jiangsu to purchase cocoons. Fortunately, the Zhejiang Silk Industry Control Association has abandoned bulk purchases, so silk merchants can still purchase as much as possible. Now, cocoon brokers in Zhejiang Province will generally stop weighing at the end of this month, and silk factories in Shanghai are scheduled to start production early next month. They are currently sorting out the workshops. It is estimated that about 40 factories will start production this time.

### The Mystery of the Floating Corpses

– Jian Ping

Similar to the same period last year, floating corpses have been found in the Hai River in Tianjin in April and May this year. Moreover, it seems to be a constant source, with three or four bodies discovered every day. Thus, this unsolved case from last year must be handled routinely again this year. Initially, with a loud bang, it was announced that the source of the floating corpses had been identified, and several criminals who had abandoned the bodies had been arrested. However, unfortunately, the so-called criminals who abandoned the bodies were merely petty Chinese traitors hired for a living. Furthermore, since the term "floating corpses" refers to drug addicts abandoned by foreign firms specializing in the sale of white powder, a discount must be applied to the grandstanding of "rewarding strict investigation," and only the announcement that the floating corpses were drug offenders will suffice.

However, in this way, everyone already had a clue about the source of the "floating corpses," but they could not help but have considerable doubts because of this announcement. At the same time, in addition to doubts, the sources of the so-called "floating corpses" were successively discovered to be multi-faceted, and some of them coincided with ordinary people's speculations. Therefore, in order to avoid trouble, a concealment must naturally be carried out once; recently, the concealment has even been explicitly ordered: A Tianjin telegram on the 19th stated, "The Tianjin News Inspection Office notified all newspapers last night that, in the future, news reports about floating corpses discovered in the Hai River must uniformly refer to them as corpses of drug beggars, and there must be no other sources mentioned, to avoid causing diplomatic disputes."

Although there have been new discoveries, the "floating corpses" still cannot help but remain a "mystery," which truly makes people feel deeply moved.

However, the mystery of the floating corpses will eventually be revealed one day without needing to be unveiled, and the Tianjin correspondence published by this newspaper on the 21st contains the following records: The sources of the floating corpses in the Hai River in Tianjin are roughly three-fold. First, "they are addicted to white powder, reside in the Japanese concession's 新德洋行, and now have no money to indulge. The foreign firm then hires people to carry them to the riverbank." Second, "laborers going abroad, anyone who is found to be ill or refuses to go after being driven out" are abandoned into the river and drowned by the "Japanese concession's 大東公司," which specializes in registering laborers going through the pass and "entry permits." Third, those who manage the retrieval and burial of the bodies, because there are too many exposed corpses, no one is willing to donate coffins, and they are too busy to cope, so for the sake of convenience, they abandon the corpses in the river. Currently, these three sources have been discovered, and that does not include those beyond these three that have not been discovered.

Now, just based on these three sources, easily attributing "floating corpses" to "drug beggars" seems to be either an intentional slander or a perfunctory treatment of people's lives. If the "floating corpse" case is ignored in order to "avoid causing diplomatic disputes," then people's lives will have no protection, and the state's obligation to the people will be lost. Having a country is equivalent to having no country, which is intolerable to anyone with enthusiasm. At a time when the central government is righteously and clearly ordering the protection of the public's legitimate public opinion, the Tianjin News Inspection Office is even illegally suppressing legitimate news reports. This should not be the case in today's unified political order. Moreover, according to the third source of this newspaper's Tianjin correspondence, which belongs to domestic administration, could it be that the Hebei-Chahar authorities cannot even punish the "managers of retrieval and burial," and if there are secrets that cannot be resolved, then the News Inspection Office must even prohibit the publication of this news, and uniformly and arbitrarily determine that "floating corpses" are "drug beggars"?

The lack of accurate news reporting is very likely to give villains the opportunity to create rumors and even disrupt social tranquility. May the government thoroughly implement the order to protect accurate news reporting!

### Various Activities for Youth Leisure in Different Countries (Continued from Yesterday)

— Special

Next, Mrs. Barnes Skellett gave a lecture on the situation of youth health work in Germany and Italy in recent years. According to Mrs. Skellett, Germany and Italy are currently pursuing the same approach in managing everything. As a result of the World Leisure and Recreation Congress held in Hamburg last year, an "International Bureau of Happiness and Work" was established. The Italian Dopolavoro organization and the German K.D.E. organization (meaning strength through joy) are two government agencies that adhere to the same principle: art, culture, travel, sports, and everything else that makes life worth living are national rights, not the privileges of a few small groups. These two organizations are now striving to make these things accessible to everyone. All kinds of workers in Italy must join the Dopolavoro organization, which is responsible for providing members with medical care and other assistance. Members receive discounts on tickets to theaters, concerts, cinemas, and all public entertainment venues, and train tickets can also be reduced by a certain percentage. The organization also has a farmers' department that specializes in providing farmers with culture and education. The most important part of this Italian organization is the Ministry of Culture and Education, which includes drama, music, singing, story writing competitions, and various other activities. The German organization was established after the Italian one, but its scope is broader than that of Italy. It was established a year after Hitler took the position of head of state. All employed people in Germany are members of the organization, and the total number of members has now reached more than 22 million. The organization has cultural groups, educational groups, and pays special attention to travel, ice skating, and all entertainment during vacations. Because Germany's travel facilities are exceptionally well-prepared, even the poorest Germans can satisfy their desire to travel, either visiting various scenic spots in the country or taking longer trips abroad. The organization is considerate to workers in every possible way and has launched special travel savings schemes so that workers can save small amounts of money at any time on weekdays, so that they can use the saved money to cover their travel expenses for a certain period each year. The organization's effectiveness is obvious. Its activities are not limited to one thing. The goal is to lead people from all walks of life into the happy atmosphere of the K.D.F. organization. This is the secret of its success.

Next, Mrs. Edward gave a lecture on youth sports in other countries in Central Europe. Mrs. Edward said: Europe can be divided into two parts. One part is Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. All youth activities in these three countries are organized by the government. In other countries, this kind of work is mostly done by private individuals. Although the general methods are roughly the same, their activities vary depending on the national character and the situation of climate and economy. The three countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula (Sweden, Norway, and Denmark) pay special attention to various sports for schoolchildren, calling on them to swim in summer and ice skate, ski, and climb mountains in winter. In addition to summer and winter vacations, each school also

## Page 16

has extra sports vacations, during which they engage in various outdoor sports. Children who are poor and unable to purchase sports equipment are provided free of charge by children's clubs, etc. Poor children who cannot travel in summer are taken care of by wealthy families. Children who go to theaters and various entertainment venues in the early afternoon receive discounts on admission tickets. Children who value spiritual entertainment also have the opportunity to satisfy their desires, because drama, speech, music, song and dance, and debate clubs are set up everywhere. People who have jobs also have various entertainment groups that they can join at will. In other countries, Hungary pays special attention to music and art. Although the French government does not have any large-scale organizations, it also pays attention to the physical and mental well-being of young people. Poland has not yet implemented a co-educational system, but older children have special opportunities to participate in social activities. Austria emphasizes both sports gymnastics and art and literature. In addition to children's happiness, Sweden also focuses on the labor force. The government even designates land in some places where workers can build cottages for summer rest. In short, all countries provide comprehensive facilities for workers and schoolchildren, allowing them to engage in legitimate entertainment during their leisure time. (To be continued)

### Deceiving Oneself and Deceiving Others

— Shizhu

The fox can't reach the grapes, so he has to say they are sour. This fable is truly insightful. The tricks of self-deception among human beings are simply a universal phenomenon. Let's leave foreign countries aside for the moment and just look at our majestic China—the four-character syllables are sonorous and sensational—from the emperor and president down to the common people and slaves, it has been "like this since ancient times." Even when they are slaughtered to pieces, they insist on raising their voices and saying, "Heaven has abandoned me, it is not the fault of war." When they can't get a high-ranking official by flattering and bootlicking, they generously say, "Wealth and honor are like floating clouds to me." They flee east and west, and the beautiful land is occupied by others, but they are happy to hear the flattering words "The Han family's troubles lasted for ten generations, only Emperor Guangwu revived it; among the nine sons of Duke Xian, only Chong'er still exists." This atmosphere of "self-consolation" is "even more intense now." The national crisis is becoming more and more serious, and it seems that they cannot help but blush, but they turn around and shamelessly say, "Many difficulties can revive the country." Everything is not as good as others, and there is no way to deal with it, so they ignore it and say that we are "a vast land with abundant resources," "an ancient country with 5,000 years of culture," and "have 400 million compatriots." They are lazy to the extent of a toad, but they make grand vows: "Everything will be like a new beginning tomorrow." They are so poor that they can see their buttocks, but they touch their scalps and say, "There are only three measures of rice in my destiny, and I will never get more than a liter even if I travel all over the world." These skills of Ah Q's "son beating his father," the ability of stones falling into a latrine—stinky and hard—are deeply rooted in the hearts of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor and are bearing fruit! What "sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall," "lying in wait for dawn with weapons as pillows," "strong diplomacy," "economic revival," "promoting domestic goods," and "going to the people" are all big lies used to comfort the emptiness of the stomach when there is no other way to resolve embarrassment. Okay, saying big words is like eating a meal, and they muddle along carelessly. "How much of life is there? Just a spring dream." So they don't want to save the country, don't want to be human, and just compete to see who has the toughest mouth. But what will happen in the end? Bullshit! These germs become a kind of popular "philosophy of laziness" disease. Before, they may not have been infected with this germ, but when they encounter obstacles, they lack courage and determination. The germ takes advantage of the weakness and attacks, and as a result, the laziness disease flares up. Then, they send themselves to the coffin. Of course, there are also those who have contracted this disease themselves, "have not smelled its stench for a long time," and spread it to others, causing you to suffer like them. However, these people are pitiful. On the contrary, "deceiving others" is extremely interesting. This is deceiving others without deceiving oneself: Sages and emperors (emperor meaning ruler) say, "You must be loyal, filial, and virtuous!" He wants you to become a piece of wood so that he can use you as firewood. Our "friendly nations" kick you with their feet on one hand and reach out their hands to say, "Let's be friendly." When you reach out your hand, they throw you down and then kick you to death. These are all brilliant magic weapons for "deceiving others." However, "deceiving others" is not easy. If people see through your tricks and don't listen to your nonsense, you will fail. But there is still one last magic weapon. Simply fly into a rage out of shame and say, "You must listen to my deception." Those who create a policy of fooling the people will launch literary inquisitions on a large scale. Those who implement a continental policy will come and kill you by the thousands. Okay, everyone is obedient, and the way of deceiving others is a complete success!

That is the difference between "deceiving oneself" and "deceiving others."

### In the Valley

— Shifang

The sky in May is gently emitting blue light, a wisp of cloud floats in the sky, half drifting, half dissipating. Swallows murmur and skim over the wheat stalks. Wild doves fly away silently, horses neigh or chew, dogs do not bark, just stand gracefully, wagging their tails. The flowers of the locust trees are already hanging full of branches, and the breeze sends a fragrant breath. The avenue is completely covered with red-stemmed fine grass, and the tender leaves sparkle as if they have been washed—that is what goats like to eat most.

A tired old horse is slowly moving forward, pulling a cart with peeling paint. The short coachman is wearing a large straw hat and cracking his whip. The unclear sound is swallowed by the sound of the loose glass on the car window shaking.

The sound of hooves pulls this old cart into a deep and sloping valley. Along its sides are rows of willows, their branches rustling. Many large cracks have opened in the lower part of the tree trunks. A small stream flows along the valley. The pebbles at the bottom of the stream ripple slightly in the clear vortex. In the distance, purplish-blue mountain peaks are faintly arranged, as if separating the boundary between heaven and earth. Along the valley, on one side is a pile of yellow mud houses, their doors tightly closed. On the other side, there are also five or six thatched sheds, built under several old pine trees.

At the edge of the valley, there are piles of cut grass. The farmers scatter wheat straw in front of the huts. The hot sun makes it extra dry. Children sleep in the shade behind the piles of grass. Red-crested roosters explore flies and small beetles in the wheat straw. A small white dog is also rolling around there.

The young men wear fish-white coarse cloth shirts, roll up their sleeves, revealing bronze-colored arms, tie wide, stiff waistbands, and lean against wooden carts that have not yet been harnessed to livestock, teasing each other fiercely, opening their mouths and revealing large, flat teeth. A young girl uses her strong arms to draw a large, dripping bucket from the well. When the bucket shakes, the sparkling drops of water fall.

Next to the farmhouse stands an old woman. A kind smile appears on her wrinkled face. She is about sixty or seventy years old, and she bends her withered hands, grabs a piece of cornmeal cake, and chews it little by little, as if saying:

"Traveler, won't you take a break?"

A rooster suddenly crows, flapping its wings in alarm, echoing the chirping of the mountain finches in the distance.

"Ah, these wheat ears are really long!" the coachman murmured to himself.

Fertile, the boundless fields shining with golden light, the azure sky, a wisp of white cloud is dissipating there.

The tired old horse drags the old cart, clattering, slowly out of the valley.
