### Anhui Yarn Industry Strives to Reduce Tax Rates

Business tax is particularly heavy compared to other provinces, which is only benefiting foreign merchants at the expense of domestic yarn businesses.

Wuhu Correspondence: The business tax rate in Anhui Province is stipulated to be 5 per mille for cotton yarn, which is higher than any other province. The Yarn Industry Guild of this province believes that yarn merchants have small profits and large capital and cannot afford the burden, and has repeatedly petitioned the authorities to reduce it, but has not been approved. Recently, with the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee about to be held, all yarn merchants gathered in Wuhu to discuss the matter and decided to send a letter to the Shanghai National Chinese Cotton Mill Joint Association, stating the reasons why the cotton yarn tax rate must be reduced, and requesting them to propose it for vigorous advocacy. The reasons they are fighting for are excerpted below: ① Cotton yarn that has already paid the consolidated tax is also subject to business tax at the place of sale. In principle, the tax rate should be the same in all provinces, regardless of whether it is light or heavy, in order to be fair. Now the Anhui Provincial Government is using a separate law as an excuse and setting the cotton yarn tax rate at 5 per mille, regardless of wholesale or retail, and taxing it at this rate. Cotton yarn has the lowest profit and the greatest risk. Now it is specially subjected to heavy taxes, and merchants cannot make ends meet and cannot afford the burden. ② The tax rate in neighboring provinces is only 2 per mille for cotton yarn, and the wholesale industry is taxed at half that rate, which has been implemented for a long time and there is a record to prove it. Anhui yarn merchants have repeatedly requested a reduction, citing the precedents of neighboring provinces, but have been rejected by the Anhui Provincial Government, which is acting willfully and ignoring the difficulties of merchants, leaving yarn merchants with no way to appeal and subject to slaughter. What treatment could be more unfair than this? ③ Wuhu yarn merchants have always focused on promoting domestic goods. Now, due to the heavy burden of business tax, the cost of yarn has increased, making it impossible to sell as much as possible. Moreover, in the same location, there are also foreign merchants selling foreign yarn, which is even more difficult to resist. Because our government has no jurisdiction over them, they do not bear any taxes and can sell as they please without any scruples. It can be seen that the impact of business tax on domestic yarn is by no means superficial. The tangible harm directly belongs to yarn merchants, indirectly to yarn mills, and the intangible harm is that foreign merchants sell one more piece of foreign currency, and the government loses one tax revenue. Why drive away the fish for the sake of the pond and implement this suicidal policy? ④ The Anhui Provincial Government encourages sericulture and reduces the tax rate on silk to 2 per mille, while cotton yarn is the raw material for ordinary cloth and is a universal need for ordinary people. However, its tax rate is higher than that of silk, which is a reversal of importance. We really don't know what the intention is. (2nd)

### A National of a Certain Country Discovered Mining Tungsten Ore Illegally Near Xiamen

Colluding with traitors to organize cooperatives; those involved have now been arrested and placed under guard.

Xiamen Correspondence: A case of illegally mining military ore has recently been discovered here, involving national sovereignty and prohibited military materials, with profound implications that are attracting attention from all parties. The details of its beginning and end are recorded as follows:

Mineral Area Sketch

The verified mining area is located at Jizi Mountain in Heshang Lake, Xiamen, about twenty miles from the city. The illegally mined pit is located at the center of the mountain, with several acres of farmland on the left and the sea of Wutong connected to the right. Behind the mountain is Haotou Village. The diameter of the pit is about one and a half zhang straight, about one zhang wide, and more than seven zhang deep. There is a triangular wooden frame with a wooden bridge running across it, and a pulley is installed on the frame with a long rope hanging down, presumably to lift and unload minerals. There is a bamboo ladder at the bottom of the pit, and two zhang are excavated deep to the left, with several copper gas lamps and tools such as hoes, shovels, and baskets. As for what the ore is, there are different opinions. Some say it is tungsten, some say it is steel, and some say it is manganese. It has now been sent to the Department of Construction for testing. According to the observation of the ore blocks by the general public, the color is grayish-black, which is more believable as tungsten. Tungsten is one of the metallic chemical elements, with a luster like steel. It can be drawn into silk and is very hard. When fused with carbon, it becomes even harder. When used to make objects, it can cut high-heat objects that ordinary steel cannot cut. The casting of military machinery and guns must be mixed with eight or nine percent of pure steel in order to expand and contract freely without exploding. All countries rely on it in industry, especially in military industry. Our country is the country with the largest production in the world market, and its reserves are also the best in the world. The Americas are second, Europe is next, and Japan has the least. It is said that the ore reserves in the mountain are also extremely rich, and if a thousand people mine it, it can supply it for at least twenty years.

Mining Process

According to the confession of Lu Zanheng, one of those arrested in the case, ‘Seeing the rising peak of Zhukeng Lake Mountain, I knew there were mineral resources, so in September of last year, I introduced Lin Nengyin, Huang Maqi, Yang Gangshi, and one unknown person through my uncle Li Yingkui to form the Jianxingyuan Mining Cooperative, and Yingkui introduced Li Wenying as a mining engineer. Because it has not been formally mined yet, it has not been reported to the government.’ It is found that Lu is the manager of the mining cooperative. According to Yang Fubin, the general representative of the Zhukeng Lake Yang Clan who signed the contract, ‘The mountain is owned by the clan. The mining was introduced by Yang Gangshi. Because his father is old, I represented him in contacting them. The contract was signed on December 23rd or 24th, agreeing that if mining is developed, the clan will receive 17 percent of the profits. It had been open for fifteen or sixteen days before the contract was signed. I don't know what mine they are mining afterwards. Li Wenying from Anxi is in charge of mining and lives in Gulangyu.’ According to Lu, ‘He does not know the origin of technician Li Wenying. He only knows that he often works in Taiwan. Li is now a technician at Anxi Zhongxing Mining Company. He does not know whether he is in Anxi or Gulangyu.’ Private individuals are not allowed to dig mines without government permission. The government has long issued a notice, and the origin of the technician Li Wenying is unknown. The confessions of Lu and Yang are also ambiguous. The implication requires exploration. The mining contract signed by Lu and Yang is copied below:

Mining Contract

“The contract is made by Jianxingyuan Mining Cooperative and Yang Fubin, the general representative of the Zhukeng Lake Yang Clan. Now, Jianxingyuan Cooperative hires a mining engineer to explore for minerals for mining. In the past month, it was discovered that there is a mineral in Saizai Mountain in front of Zhukeng Lake Village in Xiamen Heshan. It has not been carefully examined and dare not say what it is. Therefore, the managers of the village have discussed and agreed that the person in charge of the Jianxingyuan Cooperative will pay for the exploration. All expenses for applying to the official government for registration shall be paid by the Jianxingyuan Cooperative and shall not be related to the managers of the village. In the future, if there are no results, both parties will cancel this contract and invalidate it. If results are found, the managers of the village can obtain 17 percent of the priority rights of this cooperative.” One person is assigned as the representative of the managers of the village, and two people participate in the disaster relief. The managers of the village are willing to have the Jianxingyuan Cooperative collect the minerals from the mountain. The height and curvature of the mountain shall not be restricted. All transportation roads shall be convenient for the cooperative. If it is a private field or garden, it shall be paid by the cooperative. The managers of the village shall not make excuses to create trouble. This is the willingness of both parties. Each paper is held as proof. Then Lu and Yang and the witnesses, the village chief and the chief, signed and stamped. This secret drama of mining was directed and completed.

Discovery

The discovery of this case was due to repeated confidential reports from the Xingguang Daily, stating ① that several months ago, people from ‘friendly countries’ and so-called ‘special people’ in Heshang Lake Village often went to the village in teams to roam or under the name of hunting or fishing, but the truth is unknown; ② minerals have been discovered in Heshang Lake Village, and their quality is very good and it's a major raw material for military industry, and its capacity is very rich; ③ someone has organized Daxingyuan Company to carry out exploration, but without government approval, the exploration work is extremely secret; ④ the minerals have been continuously shipped out, transported from Huguo and Haotou Villages to the seashore, and then shipped by large ships to Aotou and then out to sea. Therefore, the newspaper sent staff to investigate at 1:00 PM on the 19th. On the way, they met Liu, the director of the Jiangtou Police Station, etc. They had also received reports and were planning to go to investigate, so they arrived at the mining area together, took out a mineral, and at the same time, Liu, the director, took Lu Zanheng and Yang Fubin, the important people involved in the case, back. Therefore, this mining theft case became more apparent to the world.

Subsequent Handling

Since the exposure of this case, party and government officials, such as Special Commissioner Chen Lianfen, Mayor Li Shilin, and Chief of the Provincial Water Police Corps Li Guodian, have successively gone to investigate. The handling methods, in addition to guarding the arrested people involved, Lu and Yang, and strictly investigating other important criminals such as Li Wenying, in order to bring them to justice, and to prevent the already excavated mining pits from being continuously stolen, the police branch has sent people to guard them strictly. At the same time, Liu, the director, telegraphed the provincial government to report to Chen Bao.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Chuan Zuoyi's Report on the War of Resistance

— All

Chuan Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan, gave a heartfelt report at the memorial week meeting the other day. Mr. Chuan bears the heavy responsibility of border defense and is at the forefront of national salvation. His words and demeanor are the focus of attention of the whole country. Especially today, when the flames of war are urgent and alarms are frequently sounded, when families are wandering and people's hearts are unsettled, his resolute and impassioned expression is enough to encourage the frontline subordinates. Even from afar, it is inspiring to read. In addition to following and feeling, we feel that we cannot help but say something. We will discuss it based on the wording and meaning.

The most important point in Mr. Chuan's report is that 'We should thoroughly realize that we must no longer give the enemy an opportunity to invade.' He also said, 'The enemy invades us because we first created opportunities for the enemy. It is not entirely relying on his strength.' Mr. Chuan believes that the activity of bandits and puppets in the front is caused by domestic unrest. This has been clearly proven in the captured bandit and puppet documents. Especially the recent Xi'an Incident was seen as an opportunity for development. The pain of the matter is unbearable. Therefore, he repeatedly clarified it to make his subordinates vigilant. In fact, the goal of consistent external resistance has long been recognized by the whole country. It is difficult to coexist and defend against insults. Rotting objects breed worms. This is a natural trend. Who does not understand the meaning of these simple consciousnesses? Yelling loudly does not always have a slight effect. Now, the leader of the frontline resistance, based on the documents he captured, gave a passionate speech to urge attention from the rear. The impact he gives should be enough to make the stubborn and establish the cowardly. Try to ask, what are the dangers encountered in the ice and snow, under the charge and hand-to-hand combat? What about the sacrificed flesh and blood? Who is not a compatriot? If the people of Fang can't even be patient and dedicate themselves to the country, insist on the idea of consistent external resistance, and give the enemy an opportunity to develop and invade, and give the frontline generals an even more difficult barrier to resist, they should not be like this unless they are crazy. Mr. Chuan said with tears, which is what we should listen to carefully.

Secondly, Mr. Chuan believes that 'Chinese people today should make up their minds not to decide our actions based on interests, but to win the final victory with a spirit of sacrifice.' This statement is especially a medicine for the disease today. Most people in the country have the mentality of taking interests as the premise of measurement, and when estimating and preparing, they always take material things as the first comparison. After consideration, they often feel that they cannot control the chances of winning. Therefore, they are circumventing and accommodating and yielding step by step. They have not sold their remaining courage, and their middle energy has withered first. Although it is said that the situation has made it so, it is also due to overcalculation and precision. In fact, in today's dangerous and pressing situation, there is no interest to be calculated. The art of war says that those who are placed in a dead place will live afterwards. This is the step we should take at present. With the determination to sink the boat, we can speak of war. Only by cutting off the idea of complete tile preservation can we save the country. Mr. Chuan mentioned the battle of Honggetuer. We used two companies of cavalry to resist the fierce attack of six or seven thousand bandits and puppets with rifles to resist the bombing of enemy planes and artillery, and were able to win the final victory. Isn't it true that the power of one drum makes it possible to mediate? We only hope that the whole country, up and down, can all follow Mr. Chuan's words, and use people's hearts and spirits to overcome everything, dispel the concept of fear, abandon the psychology of temporary security, make the determination to sacrifice, and strive to save the country. The revival of the country is here.

### French Minister of the Army Announces Active Strengthening of Defense

The Maginot Line extends to the Swiss border; two major arms factories are nationalized; the military budget is passed by the Chamber of Deputies.

[Paris] French Minister of the Army Daladier declared in the Chamber of Deputies today that the famous Maginot Line along the German border will be extended northward to the town of Dunkirk and will be increased in depth. The defense line along the Swiss Jura to the Alpine border will also be similarly extended. According to Mr. Da, he announced in the Chamber of Deputies on November 4 of the previous year that the Maginot Line would extend from the English Channel to Geneva on the Swiss border. Mr. Da declared today that this new plan will extend the length of the defense line from 250 miles to 500 miles. The French-Swiss border from Basel to Geneva, which is 120 miles long, has not been fortified, but it will now be protected. According to Mr. Da, this is for the purpose of defending against any foreign invasion of Swiss neutrality. Mr. Da also said that the large ammunition factory in Le Havre and a part of the Creusot factory will be nationalized before March. According to the Senate-amended draft law on the nationalization of the ordnance industry, it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies on August 11 of the previous year.

Mr. Da also told the Chamber of Deputies that he had submitted the following plans to the cabinet: ① compulsory youth training, ② strict training of reserve officers, ③ wartime industrial mobilization, ④ acceleration of mechanization, and ⑤ construction of major border highways. He then said, 'We firmly believe that the wars of Europe in the future will become a kind of civil war. We are now doing everything we can to avoid it, but it is our duty to make our country's borders impregnable. Germany currently has an army of one million men, and there are still strong reserve forces. Its air force and navy are the latest of the era and has a fixed industrial mobilization plan. Now, neighboring countries are actively preparing for war. France must not remain still and become a piece of meat on other people's cutting board. The recent labor strikes have delayed the progress of military preparations, but it is gratifying that production is now normal.' After Mr. Da's speech, the Chamber of Deputies passed the national defense expenditure bill by a vote of 405 to 186, with an amount equivalent to £140 million, to be raised in three years.

### French Government Determined to Maintain the Republic

Preventing Communist activities; domestic security is not a concern.

[Paris] At the Senate meeting today, Goldroux, a left-wing Republican senator, questioned the so-called 'Communist violation of the French-Russian non-aggression treaty and conspiracy to endanger national security.' It is said that he obtained a secret Communist notice, which contained the party's plan to organize defense agencies in the Paris region. All areas near Paris and the party's concentration points have been designated, and detailed plans are included. All party members, upon hearing a warning, will seize agencies such as the post and telecommunications headquarters. It is said, 'This is a plan to organize a civil war and should be punished by law.' He then mentioned the French-Russian non-aggression treaty signed on November 27, 1932, which stipulated that both signatories agreed not to interfere in each other's internal affairs, but the Soviet Union did not comply with this provision. Regarding the Spanish issue, he said, 'Although the government is implementing a non-interference policy, the Communist Party is doing the opposite. At this time, the Soviet Union is quite willing to establish a revolutionary nest in Spain, and its intention is to prompt Germany to advance towards our country in the Rhineland.' Then, Prime Minister Zalen replied that he also knew about the notice mentioned by Goudlou. The current issue is not about arguing about the realism or authenticity of this document. 'I am the head of the government and have no responsibility to explain it. If so, I am only speaking as a cabinet member who is responsible for domestic security. Is domestic security disrupted at this time? Are the various facilities of the republican system and the people's freedom threatened by the Communist Party's conspiracy? Although the newspapers of a certain country have propagated a lot about the situation in France, the streets in our country are passable as usual and there are no obstacles to block them. In a nutshell, the domestic situation is as normal as ever, and we are discussing in a peaceful atmosphere. So where is the so-called conspiracy? Are you afraid that this conspiracy will continue to be prepared in the dark? I dare to tell you that our duty is to expose and investigate all activities carried out in the dark. We have not failed in our duty in the past, and we will never allow this kind of activity in the future. The warning I am giving is to the public, and Mr. Goudlou's political friends may also wish to take note of it. In short, the current government is the government of the People's Front, supported by the majority, and the Communist Party is also in the majority, and has cooperated with the government in maintaining the political program. The government we have organized may not be what Mr. Goudlou wants, but it is a government that represents the national public opinion.' The Prime Minister concluded that after the February 6th Paris riots in 1934, our instinct to maintain the Republic was unleashed, and the People's Front was born because of this. The Senate then adjourned. (Havas, 2nd)

### Intent to Adjust Relations with Turkey

Foreign Ministers of Both Countries Meet in Milan

Milan, Italy – Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in this city from Rome at approximately 6:00 PM today. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü followed, arriving at 7:10 PM, and was welcomed by Ciano with due ceremony. The two are scheduled to meet twice tomorrow to discuss relations between the two countries. Rüştü will depart this Thursday to return to his country. (Havas, 2nd)

Milan – The foreign ministers of Italy and Turkey held their first talks at 10:30 AM, lasting two hours. The Turkish ambassador to Italy, Râkıp, was also present. A second round of talks is scheduled for 5:00 PM this afternoon, after which a communiqué will be issued explaining the discussions. However, no immediate agreement is planned. Responsible sources have stated that the talks cover three issues: ⑴ The Italian Foreign Minister reiterated Italy's desire to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean; ⑵ The Turkish government recognizes the Italian Empire (Turkey has de facto recognized the Italian Empire since withdrawing its minister from Abyssinia); ⑶ Negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement will proceed. Political circles say that the rapprochement between Italy and Turkey is a direct result of the understanding between Britain and Italy (referring to the Mediterranean Agreement signed by the two countries), but only with Germany's full consent. Italy's future policy towards Eastern European countries will likely be based on the trilateral relationship between Italy, Turkey, and Greece, while also approaching Yugoslavia. When this policy is implemented in the future, Italy will inevitably be associated with the Balkan Entente, i.e., the four countries of Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania. (Havas, 3rd)

[Rome] Regarding the talks between Foreign Minister Ciano and Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü in Milan, the "Italian Daily" commented, "Our country has fulfilled many obligations to Turkey in the past, but Turkey still maintains a cold attitude towards us, almost to the point of hostility. For example, our country's construction of defensive fortifications on the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean is merely an exercise of its inherent sovereignty to protect our country's transportation to Abyssinia. Turkey at that time considered it a threat to their country. After the talks between the two foreign ministers, all kinds of barriers should be eliminated." It is reported that Ciano and Rüştü's talks in Milan will not only discuss Italy's signing of the Montreux Convention, but also involve the issue of Rhodes, Italy's dispatch of missionaries and establishment of schools in Turkey, and free trade between the two countries, etc. (Havas, 2nd)

### British Cabinet Meeting

Discussing Two Current Issues

[London] The Cabinet held a meeting this morning, discussing the following two issues: ⑴ The issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War; ⑵ German leader Hitler's speech on the 30th of last month, especially regarding the demand for the restoration of former colonies. (Havas, 3rd)

[London] Regarding Hitler's recent speech, it was previously reported that the British government intended to seek supplementary explanations from Germany on certain points through diplomatic channels. However, according to diplomatic circles here, the government does not intend to do so. It is generally believed that the British government now intends to adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude for the time being, and take no diplomatic action, at least regarding the relationship between Germany and other European countries. (Vahas, 2nd)

### German Ambassador to Britain Returns to Post with New Instructions

Demanding the Recovery of Former Territories

[Berlin] Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop recently returned to the country to report on his duties and is scheduled to return to his post tonight. It is reported that he carries a memorandum detailing Germany's demands for the recovery of colonies, and has received instructions from the government to study this issue with the British Foreign Office immediately after arriving in London. (Havas, 2nd)

### Chile Organizes Economic Delegation to Japan

Seeking to Develop Trade Between the Two Countries

Santiago, Chile – Senator Iraizola and the Deputy Ministers of Finance and Commerce have organized an economic delegation scheduled to travel to Japan on the 23rd of this month to examine trade relations between Japan and Chile and study ways to develop them. (Havas, 2nd)

### Roosevelt Announces Acceptance of Disaster Relief Goods from Our Country

And Orders Exemption from Import Duties. Floods Continue to Rise. Cairo, Illinois, Precariously Endangered

[Washington] President Roosevelt today ordered that friendly countries' donations for flood relief be accepted, and that the Treasury Department exempt such goods from import duties. Donations from China fall into this category. (National Telegram, 2nd)

[London] King George and Queen Elizabeth today sent a telegram to President Roosevelt expressing their condolences for the floods in the United States. (National Telegram, 2nd)

[New York] The safety of Cairo, Illinois, located at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, will be determined within the next 24 hours. Today, the water level there suddenly rose again after a few hours of stagnation. The highest water level this morning was less than an hour away from the edge of the levee, causing great anxiety among the 6,000 rescue workers stationed there. The Mississippi River had shown no rise or fall yesterday for about seven hours, leading rescue workers to believe that the water level had reached its peak, but unexpectedly it continued to rise today, causing everyone to lose color. If the levee were to break, the entire city could be submerged in 20 feet of floodwater within hours. Patrols have now been increased, and members of the Coast Guard have also led 55 transport vessels to be stationed there. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 3rd)

[Washington] Due to the severity of the disaster in the United States, President Roosevelt has implemented emergency measures, exempting all food, medicine, and other miscellaneous items donated from abroad for the relief of flood victims in the United States from import taxes. Cairo, Illinois, remains a dangerous area within the disaster zone. The river has risen sharply and is already at the edge of the seawall, actually higher than the roofs of the houses in the city. If the dams in the area at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers can withstand the impact of the raging waters, the lives and property of the Mississippi River basin can be considered safe. The Federal Survey Committee has begun inspecting the disaster situation in Memphis, Tennessee. According to the committee's latest report, nearly one million people have been forced to abandon their homes in the disaster area. This figure represents the largest disaster in American history. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 2nd)

The universality of Catholicism can be expressed through this, and missionaries from various countries working in the Far East can be encouraged. We are very pleased to be able to participate in this grand event.' (Havas, 3rd)

### New Japanese Cabinet Seeks Compromise to Avoid Dissolving Parliament

Cabinet Discusses Policy Outline, Aims for Successful Budget Passage

[Tokyo] At the cabinet meeting on the 2nd, the government discussed parliamentary countermeasures such as the adjournment or dissolution of parliament and the budget proposal. An extraordinary cabinet meeting was reopened at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to determine the fundamental direction. In the afternoon of the 2nd, the government invited Secretary-General Taguchi of the House of Representatives to the Prime Minister's official residence and conferred with Agriculture Minister Yamazaki, Chief Secretary Ohashi, and Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Kawagoe on the procedures and countermeasures to be taken in parliament. As a result, the government hopes to proceed with deliberations in cooperation with the political parties, and to avoid implementing strict measures such as dissolution or requesting adjournment within the possible scope. It seems to earnestly seek the understanding of the various factions in parliament to continue the adjournment so that the budget for the next fiscal year can be successfully passed. Therefore, the government's de facto policy is to withdraw the Hirota cabinet's budget from parliament, revise it, and then re-submit it to parliament in order to pass it through parliament. (Domei, 3rd)

[Tokyo] Regarding the issue of dissolving parliament, which has yet to be decided by the new Hayashi cabinet, the general trend within the cabinet is to advocate dissolution at this time. The government side does not need to adopt a proactive decision-making attitude, and must fully observe the attitudes and movements of the military and political parties, as well as other objective circumstances, until the parliament reconvenes, and then seek a good way to deal with it. It is essential to coordinate with the parliament, withdraw the budget proposal and other important bills submitted by the previous cabinet, and re-examine them from the government's side. Revise those that need to be revised, avoid unnecessary friction, and gradually seek a new common administration, which is the fundamental policy. (Domei, 3rd)

[Tokyo] The Hayashi cabinet opened an extraordinary cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd to decide on the political program, policies, and parliamentary countermeasures. Prime Minister Hayashi and all cabinet members attended and deliberated on the following items. After the decisions were made, the meeting adjourned at 12:20 PM, namely:

㊀ 'Parliamentary Adjournment Issue': Requesting the House of Peers and the House of Representatives to voluntarily adjourn until February 10; ㊀ 'Handling of Budget Bills and Laws': All budget bills and laws will be withdrawn first, and those that are necessary will be re-submitted; ㊀ 'Issue of Parliamentary Vice-Ministers': The current parliamentary vice-ministers have all submitted their resignations. Although it has been formally decided to dismiss them, whether the system of parliamentary vice-ministers should be retained or abolished must be carefully considered, so parliamentary vice-ministers will not be appointed for the time being; ㊀ 'Political Program and Policy Issues': The new cabinet's political program and policies must be announced to the public as soon as possible and are being prepared. However, cabinet members must submit their opinions within three days, which will be used as the basis for Chief Secretary Ohashi and Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Kawagoe to draft the original plan, and the outline will be decided in two or three days. (Domei, 3rd)

[Tokyo] The Hayashi Senjuro cabinet decided this morning to withdraw the budget proposal and other bills submitted to parliament by the Hirota cabinet, and to request parliament to voluntarily extend the adjournment period by ten days so that the new cabinet would have enough time to change the budget and other bills. In addition, the new cabinet decided to hold cabinet meetings every day until parliament reconvenes to re-examine the government's policies.

Regarding the parliamentary issue, the cabinet has not yet decided whether to dissolve it, and will clarify the cabinet's attitude after observing the trends of the political parties and the army. However, judging from the cabinet's withdrawal of the budget draft, it seems that it does not intend to dissolve parliament. At the same time, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are extremely cautious. Although no representatives participated in the new cabinet, they recognize the seriousness of the situation and do not want to launch a direct attack on the cabinet. Yesterday, non-partisan members of parliament demanded that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties clearly express their rejection of fascism and support for parliamentary politics, but the Seiyukai and Minseito parties only agreed to consider it. This morning's newspaper editorials all expressed full doubts and deep concerns about the new cabinet. Some people pointed out that the Okada and Hirota cabinets could at least be called national unity cabinets in name, while the Hayashi cabinet has returned to a 'transcendental cabinet'. Whether it can handle politics smoothly is doubtful. It is generally believed that the greatest mission of the Hayashi Senjuro cabinet is only to suppress some aspects of the tax increase plan proposed by former Finance Minister Baba. How to deal with the policy towards China has not yet been discussed. Most of the new cabinet's policies depend on the driving force of the new Finance Minister Yūki Toyotaro.

### Japanese Parliament Extends Adjournment

Political Parties Express Opposition

[Tokyo] After the Hayashi Senjuro cabinet meeting decided to request parliament to extend the adjournment period by ten days to revise the budget and other bills, the various political parties and representatives of various factions in the House of Representatives held a meeting this afternoon and passed a resolution not to accept the cabinet's request, believing that the government's reasons were not legally valid. According to their opinion, parliament has already been forced to voluntarily adjourn for eleven days since the Hirota cabinet resigned. Therefore, parliament should reconvene immediately after the new cabinet holds its appointment ceremony. Otherwise, parliament is tantamount to voluntarily giving up the right to review government bills. If the government believes that parliament needs to be closed, it should request the Emperor to issue an edict to be effective. It is said that the cabinet will request the Emperor to issue an edict to close parliament for ten days, but it is not optimistic that parliament will hold this attitude. (Central News Agency, 3rd)

[Tokyo] The Minseito Party held a general affairs meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd, attended by the president and party leaders. As a result of exchanging views on the attitude to deal with the Hayashi cabinet and cope with the political situation in the future, the following policy was decided:

㊀ Maintain a resolute attitude towards the Hayashi cabinet, adhere to strict right and wrong principles, and maintain the integrity of a public party; ㊁ Determine the party's attitude after the Hayashi cabinet announces its policies and political program; ㊂ Fulfill the party's original mission, question the issues that should be questioned in parliament, conduct examinations, and then decide whether to approve or oppose, and strive to live up to the trust of the people. (Domei, 3rd)

[Tokyo] Yoshihiro Kuboi, Masaaki Haruna, Hajime Mori, and Rōichi Hayashi of the Showa Society have consistently advocated dissolving the Showa Society. Now that Tatsunosuke Yamazaki has left the party to join the cabinet, they are preparing to leave the party together at an appropriate opportunity. (Domei, 3rd)

### Candidates for Foreign Minister

Either Saitō Hiroshi or Satō Naotake Will Be Chosen

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi wants to quickly determine foreign policy. According to reports, he is repeatedly considering the selection of a full-time Foreign Minister. As parliament will soon reconvene, it is likely that a full-time Foreign Minister can be decided in early March. The choice of this person is also important in relation to the content of the foreign policy adopted by the Hayashi cabinet. Therefore, Prime Minister Hayashi has been meeting with former Foreign Minister Arita these past two days to listen to the diplomatic policies of the previous cabinet and their process in order to decide on future foreign policies and the selection of a Foreign Minister. However, although it has not yet reached the stage of specific selection for a full-time Foreign Minister, Prime Minister Hayashi intends to avoid non-government personnel and select from current diplomats of the ambassadorial rank. The candidates are still either Ambassador to the United States Saitō Hiroshi or Ambassador to France Satō Naotake (scheduled to return home on March 2). As for those who hope for a change in diplomacy and a renewal of the department's personnel, the atmosphere of recommending Ambassador Saitō among a part of those close to the Prime Minister is quite strong. The selection of the Foreign Minister will reflect the new diplomatic policy, which is attracting much attention. (Domei, 3rd)

[Washington] Ambassador to the United States Saitō Hiroshi, who is rumored to be appointed Foreign Minister of the Hayashi cabinet, made a statement on the 2nd regarding future developments: "I have been away from the country for a long time, and although I want to return home, Prince Chichibu will be coming to the United States this spring, so I am afraid I will not return home until the fall. There will be no change to this plan at this time." (Domei, 2nd)

[Washington] The Washington Star reported today that the appointment of Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saitō Hiroshi as Japanese Foreign Minister is a good omen for the continued friendship between Japan and the United States. During Saitō's three years in the United States, Japanese-American friendship has become closer. Saitō should be able to explain to his colleagues the fears of Americans caused by the excessive actions of Japanese militarists and anti-imperialists. (National Telegram, 2nd)

### Finance Minister Yūki's Financial Policy

Revising the New Budget Proposal, Raising Prices to Make Up for Shortfalls

[Tokyo] After the cabinet meeting on the 3rd, new Finance Minister Yūki made a statement regarding the handling of the 12th fiscal year budget proposal and tax system reorganization plan: "The 12th fiscal year budget proposal amounts to a huge 3.04 billion yen, which has a considerable adverse impact on the economic world. I cannot help but change it, so I must revise it. However, it is not easy to technically revise it during the short adjournment period, so I intend to devote all my efforts to it. If there are technical difficulties, I intend to submit the budget proposal that was once withdrawn to the reconvened parliament as it is, and the government will express its intention to revise the budget proposal to parliament, and consult with parliament. After the budget is passed by parliament, I will adopt methods of reducing or saving budget expenditures to implement the budget. Parliament seems to intend to revise the budget proposal, and the ministers of each ministry also understand the revision in general terms. I also intend to revise the tax system reorganization plan, so I will submit the withdrawn bills separately if I believe there is no need to review them. As for the revenue shortfall caused by the budget, the shortfall will be temporarily covered by deficit bonds. After the budget is passed by parliament, I will strive to balance it by saving expenditures in the implementation of the budget. Due to a full understanding of the current situation, the national defense budget will not be revised in any way in general terms." (Domei, 3rd)

### Yūki Concurrently Serves as Colonial Affairs Minister

Unrelated to the Issue of Abolishing the Ministry

[Tokyo] After completing the handover with former Colonial Affairs Minister Nagata at 3:00 PM on the 3rd, Yūki, who also serves as Colonial Affairs Minister, heard Nagata strongly assert that the Colonial Affairs Ministry is the general staff headquarters for the Japanese people's overseas development, especially for large-scale immigration to Manchuria, and that there is a practical need to expand the Colonial Affairs Ministry, believing that it should not be abolished. He requested the new Colonial Affairs Minister to consider it. Yūki said that the issue of the Finance Minister concurrently serving as Colonial Affairs Minister is due to the difficulty in selecting personnel and is unrelated to the issue of abolition. All issues will be handled properly after parliament closes. (Domei, 3rd)

### Two Major National Policies

Electricity and Steel, Striving to Realize Them

[Tokyo] The Hayashi cabinet's attitude towards the national electricity management plan has not been clearly expressed because a full-time Minister of Communications has not yet been decided. However, after the appointment ceremony on the 2nd, Yamazaki, who also serves as Minister of Communications, has stated that although no conclusion has been reached on the business form of state-owned or private-owned, he opposes maintaining the status quo and that there is a need for control. Therefore, even if the previous cabinet's electricity-related bills are submitted to parliament, they may be revised, but the principle of strengthening control, which is full of bills, will be followed in principle. Furthermore, Yamazaki, who also serves as Minister of Communications, has clearly indicated the direction of the national electricity policy, saying that although there is no need for consistent control of power generation, transmission, and distribution, there is no room for discussion on the control of power generation and transmission. On the one hand, private operators are not necessarily optimistic about the trend of the electricity plan. However, due to the in-depth public opposition movement of electrical companies and industries, they deeply hope that the new cabinet will make fundamental revisions based on this conviction, but they also admit that a considerable degree of control by the exercise of state power is inevitable. (Domei, 3rd)

[Tokyo] New Minister of Commerce Godo is the president of Showa Steel Works and has a deep understanding of steel policy. After Godo took office as Minister of Commerce, he expressed his intention to devote all his efforts to the steel issue, which has attracted attention from all quarters. The center-ism of the Nippon Steel Corporation by former Minister of Commerce Ogawa has broken down, and some people advocate re-examining the need for the national steel policy. Minister of Commerce Godo, in view of this, intends to first study the entity that is the center of the national steel policy, and examine the issue of revising the Steel Industry Promotion Law and other related issues. Furthermore, he will devote double the effort to the ongoing issue of unifying the pig iron sales organization. Not only in the need and supply issues, but also in technology and capital, he will strive for the satisfactory cooperation between Japan and Manchuria. (Domei, 3rd)

### Reforming the Administrative Organization

Starting by Expanding the Investigation Bureau, Ohashi Temporarily Serves as Director-General

[Tokyo] The government decided at yesterday's cabinet meeting to dismiss Ishiwatari, the acting Director-General of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau, and appoint Chief Secretary Ohashi to concurrently serve in that position. Prime Minister Hayashi believes that the Investigation Bureau is an important organization for implementing national policies. In order to realize the reform of the administrative organization planned by the previous cabinet and to establish the General Affairs Agency, etc., he intends to expand the Investigation Bureau and implement reorganization and strengthen its functions as soon as possible. Therefore, he asked Retsu Kawata to take office as the Director-General of the Investigation Bureau when forming the cabinet, but Kawata declined to take office on the grounds that his health was not good enough. Temporarily, Ohashi was appointed to concurrently serve in that position, and the selection of a full-time Director-General is being carried out at the same time. (Domei, 3rd)

### American Workers Occupying Factory Ordered Illegal by Court

Given 24 Hours to Leave; Auto Workers Prepare to Resist; Army Deployed as if Facing Major Enemy

Flint: Striking workers of the General Motors Corporation who have been occupying factory buildings have not yet withdrawn. The company authorities filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting the expulsion of these workers from the factory. After hearing the case, Judge Gadola has now ruled that the workers' occupation of the factory buildings is an illegal act, and the workers should leave the factory buildings within 24 hours. The picket lines formed by the workers should also be disbanded. At the same time, the state government has dispatched 1,200 troops to monitor the situation outside, preventing workers' families from providing food to the workers inside the factory. (February 2, Havas News Agency)

Flint: The General Motors Corporation requested the court to order the thousand striking workers remaining in the Fisher Body Plant to leave the plant. Today, Judge Gadola of the Circuit Court of Appeals granted the request. Immediately after the judgment was issued, the Genesee County authorities prepared to enforce it. First, County Executive Holger brought the judgment to the factory and read it to the workers. The workers listened silently and said they would discuss it with their leaders before deciding on a course of action. This morning, several units of the Michigan National Guard were deployed to the Chevrolet Plant No. 4, carrying tear gas and other weapons, and arrested six worker picketers, handing them over to the police. At the same time, it is reported that Lewis, the leader of the Industrial Organization Committee directing the strike, left Washington this afternoon, but it is unknown whether he will go to Detroit to confer with Michigan Governor Murphy or come here directly. (February 2, Guomin News Agency)

[Washington] Officials here today have made no comment on the court's decision to evict the striking workers from the General Motors plant in Flint. Lewis, the leader of the Industrial Organization Committee, said before departing for Detroit, "The court will regret this decision." President Roosevelt also declined to comment when speaking to the press. However, it is known that Labor Secretary Perkins reported the latest situation in Flint to the President. Currently, the White House seems to be maintaining a hands-off approach. However, some believe that if Michigan Governor Murphy cannot find a way to bring labor and management together for a meeting, the President may have to intervene. As for Secretary Perkins' request to Congress for authorization for the government to subpoena witnesses in labor disputes, it is unlikely to pass due to opposition from a majority of lawmakers. (February 2, Guomin News Agency)

Flint: The company regards the 1,300 striking workers as already dismissed and their continued occupation of the factory as illegal. It claims that among the 135,000 unemployed workers, nearly 80 percent are willing to return to work. (February 3, Reuters via Central News Agency)

### Pacific Shipping to Resume Soon

Tickets Now on Sale; Ships to Sail Tomorrow or the Day After

[San Francisco] The Pacific Coast maritime strike, which has lasted nearly 100 days, is now expected to end. This good news is a great relief at a time when the auto industry strike is surging. Shipping companies are now busy selling tickets and negotiating freight transport, as they expect to resume sailing on Friday or Saturday. The Maritime Workers' Union has ordered its members to vote on the settlement reached between labor and management. The results of the vote are expected to be announced tomorrow. (February 2, Reuters via Central News Agency)

[San Francisco] It was learned today that two-thirds of the Maritime Workers' Union members have voted, and the majority support ending the strike. (February 2, Guomin News Agency)

[San Francisco] The Dollar Steamship Company notified the government today that it has resumed accepting Pacific mail. The mail ship President Hoover will set sail on Saturday. (February 2, Guomin News Agency)

### Seven-Nation Agreement on Tobacco Prohibition

[Geneva] Great Britain, France, Japan, the Netherlands, India, Siam and other countries, signed the Opium Suppression Agreement in Bangkok, the capital of Siam, on November 27, 1931, stipulating that each signatory country should adopt a gradual approach to banning opium. This agreement had already been ratified by Great Britain, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, India, Siam and other countries. Japan did not ratify it until the 22nd of last month. The legal procedures have now been completed. This agreement will take effect from April 22 (three months after ratification by all signatory countries). (February 2, Havas News Agency)

### Sir Phipps Appointed British Ambassador to France

[London] His Majesty the King has approved the transfer of Sir Eric Phipps, the current Ambassador to Germany, to be the Ambassador to France, succeeding Sir Clerk, who will retire in a few months. (February 2, Reuters via Central News Agency)

### Spanish Rebel Leader Plans Air Base in Philippine Territory

Germany Still Recruiting Volunteers; Espionage Case Discovered in Barcelona

[Paris] Madame Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for the paper L'Oeuvre, recently stated that General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist Army, recently planned to build a large air base in the Spanish-controlled port of Ifni in Africa. It is said that the plan has been completed. This air base is not intended for German airships flying to South America, nor is it related to the Spanish Civil War. In fact, there is probably another plan. The plan is that General Franco is preparing to build several important air bases south of Agadir in French Morocco, that is, in the heart of French-controlled territory in North Africa, and the air base in Ifni is probably the first of these. In addition, the General Confederation of Labor's newspaper, Le Peuple, reported that Germany and Italy are still actively recruiting volunteers to serve in Spain for the Nationalist Army. "According to this, it is possible that volunteers from Germany and Italy will continue to leave for Spain in the coming days." (February 3, Havas News Agency)

Barcelona: Today, the Director of Military Supplies here announced that authorities discovered a major espionage case and subsequently detained many Italian nationals. It is reported that the case is currently under investigation. (February 2, Reuters via Central News Agency)

### Germany Splits Transportation and Postal Services into Two Ministries

Eltz von Rübenach Appointed Minister of Transport; Once Worked as Engineer on Jiaoji Railway

[Berlin] The government has ordered the dismissal of Transportation and Postal Minister Rubenaher, which has been approved. The ministry should be divided into two ministries, Transportation and Postal Services. Eltz von Rübenach, former president of the Deutsche Bank, will be the Minister of Transport, and Ohnesorge will be the Minister of Postal Services. Führer Hitler recently sent a letter to Rubenaher, expressing his gratitude for his various contributions during his four years in office. (February 2, Havas News Agency)

[Berlin] The new Minister of Transport, Eltz von Rübenach, was originally the chief engineer of the Jiaoji Railway in China before the European War. He also presided over the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. After China joined the European War in 1917, he returned to Germany via Siberia. He later served as the General Manager of the Eisen Railway Company, Deputy Director of the German Railway Administration, and Director of the National Highway Administration.

### Song Zheyuan's Mission in Tianjin

Met Twice with Japanese Commander Tashiro; Economic Development Funds Still Nowhere to Be Found; Japanese Residents Building Large-Scale Gas Company

Tianjin Correspondence: Since Song Zheyuan came to Tianjin in mid-last month for diplomatic matters, he met with Japanese Commander Tashiro twice on the 26th and 27th of last month. There is still no prospect of progress on the general issues at hand. Among them, regarding Jia Deyao's succession as Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee, the two sides initially had considerable disputes. The Japanese side even cited the Mei-He Agreement of the 24th year of the Republic as a pretext to interfere with the appointment of personnel by the authorities. The authorities have now stopped discussing this matter. Therefore, before the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee takes office, important negotiations can only be conducted by Song himself. However, due to the lack of room for maneuver, the Japanese side also finds it difficult to take advantage of the situation. This is the reason why there has been no change in Song's diplomacy since he resided in Tianjin. Regarding the issue of economic development, Song and Tashiro also considered it as the core of the negotiations when they met. Although their opinions tend to be consistent, they feel great difficulty when it comes to actual money. Li Sihao came to Tianjin on the 28th at Song's invitation and met with Sakatani, the Minister of Industry of the South Manchuria Railway stationed in Tianjin, and Ikeda, the third section chief of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin, to discuss practical implementation methods. It is vaguely heard that funds cannot be raised for the Tanggu port construction. The joint venture between the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway and the Longyan Iron Mine also suffers from the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of funds in the short term. The Hebei-Chahar authorities estimate that the revival of the Longyan Iron Mine development issue requires a minimum of 14 million yuan. They advocate that the Japanese side can be in a lending position, and China can handle it independently. The Japanese side has the right to purchase steel and iron with priority. There is no need to change it to a Sino-Japanese joint venture. This is because the old shareholders of the mine cannot be cleared, and the foreign debts owed are also difficult to repay in total. If 14 million yuan is raised, it can only be used for repairing mine machinery, purchasing Tangshan steelmaking furnaces, and preparing for resumption of work. It is impossible to clear old debts and return old shares with this amount. The Japanese side does not quite agree, feeling that doing so does not fully meet its purpose of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Li Sihao negotiated in Tianjin for several days and returned to Beiping on the evening of the 31st. He may still come to Tianjin in the short term to renegotiate. As for Song Zheyuan, he still has about two weeks to stay, and he will be able to return to Beiping after spending the Spring Festival. Before leaving Tianjin, he will still inevitably contact the Japanese side on such matters.

Recently, Japanese residents in Tianjin have initiated the construction of a "Tianjin Gas Industry Co., Ltd." in Tianjin. It is hosted by the Japanese Residents' Association. On the 31st, it specially convened a founders' meeting at the Japanese Club, and recommended five Japanese residents, including Akayama and Konchou, as preparatory members. It is stipulated that the construction should be completed within six months, with a capital of 2 million yuan. First, 1.2 million yuan is raised, set as 40,000 shares, each share is 50 yuan. Construction will begin when one-fourth of the shares are fully collected. The company site is located southwest of the Japanese Cemetery in Haiguang Temple in the Japanese Concession. It is divided into three phases of expansion. The first phase is exclusively for the burning of Japanese households in the Japanese Concession, with a supply of 48,000 cubic feet. The second phase will expand to the British and French Concessions, and the third phase will spread to the entire city. The average family of four or five people will charge about 3.4 yuan per month. According to the calculation of 1,800 households in the Japanese Concession, the monthly fee can be 543,600 yuan, and the annual amount can be 6,523,200 yuan. It has now been submitted to the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin for record. The construction is expected to begin in early March. There is also a Daqing Chemical Plant on the opposite side of Nankai Six Mile Taiwan Japanese-Chinese Middle School, which also specializes in the production of toxic gas. In the future, when the new gas company is established, it will be merged into one. Whether the inside story of this construction is only for the burning of ordinary households, no one dares to believe it. (1st)

### Guangdong Business Community Organizes Tax System Research Committee

Collecting Opinions from Various Businesses on the Taxable Standard of Business Tax for Research

Guangzhou Correspondence: The new business tax taxable standard in Guangdong Province is to levy taxes based on turnover, and merchants are vowing to fight to the death. At present, officials and businessmen are still going to extremes. The Department of Finance believes that this case is implemented by the order of the superior, and it is not convenient to change it suddenly. Before the merchants withdraw the new tax rate, they are still mostly waiting to see the declared tax amount. A few days ago, Director Zheng of the Municipal Business Tax Bureau once summoned representatives of various businesses to the bureau to explain the business tax issue, but the representatives of various businesses still insisted on changing the taxable standard. In recent days, chambers of commerce from various counties have been responding with telegrams. In this case, the Guangdong Province business tax issue is not easy to resolve in a short period of time. The Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened another meeting of representatives of various businesses on the 1st of this month to discuss everything, and resolved to organize the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce Tax System Research Committee. The 22 executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are natural committee members, and 19 representatives of various businesses are recommended as committee members to be established on a scheduled basis. The new standard of the business tax taxable standard will be studied in detail. The organizational content of the Tax System Research Committee is recorded as follows: ㊀ Name, named the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce Tax System Research Committee, attached to the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce. ㊁ Purpose, this meeting is closely related to the business community because the government has now issued new chapters of business tax and implemented the income tax method. In order to promote the benefits as much as possible, the opinions of various businesses are collected and dedicated to the government to collect the benefits of wide thinking. In addition to the above two tax systems, those related to the new tax system and the business community can study it. ㊂ The committee members are all the executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as natural committee members, and five people are recommended by the committee members' talks as committee members, and then nine people are recommended from the committee members as standing committee members to handle daily affairs. Each committee member is famous and has a job. ㊃ Staff, this meeting may employ cadres due to the needs of affairs, abide by the committee's intentions, and handle meeting affairs. The number of staff and salaries shall be determined by the committee, and the required funds shall be submitted to the general meeting for retroactive recognition in the future. ㊄ Meetings, the committee of this meeting shall hold a meeting once a month, and the current affairs committee shall hold a meeting once a month. In case of important matters, they shall be convened by letter at any time. ㊅ Work, the research results of this meeting shall be submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee for resolution, and reported to the members' talks. External documents shall be carried out in the name of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. ㊆ Deadline, the tasks of this meeting, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee resolution, are deemed unnecessary to continue to establish, submit to the members' talks for reporting, that is, end. ㊇ Detailed rules, the detailed rules for this meeting shall be determined separately. ㊈ Supplementary rules, this meeting shall be established on a scheduled day after the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee resolution and the members' talks pass. (February 2)

The meeting adjourned after the discussion.

### Nanhui

Police Extorted Large Sums of Money

Cao Binwen, a clerk from the Zhoupu Township Office in the fifth district, along with bailiffs Shi Yanhong and others, holding a transfer order from the county government, went to Sujiaqiao in the west of the town. Under the pretext of secretly investigating private opium use, they threatened and extorted money from the wealthy Zhu Jintang's family. Zhu's nephew, Bofan, came out to explain to them that his uncle was in Shanghai and would talk later. However, Cao and others forcibly wanted Bofan to go to the county. Bofan was terrified and invited Baozhang Lu Zhiren and Jiazhang Zhang Songfu to negotiate with them. Cao and others claimed that they would not handle it without a reward of 600 yuan. Lu Zhang was very suspicious, thinking that the county government should not act in this way when conducting a secret investigation, but the instructions they held seemed to be genuine, so they did not dare to object and allowed the extortion. As a result, Zhu handed Cao and others 300 yuan. The next day, Zhu's nephew went to Shanghai and told Jintang about the matter. Jintang was furious when he heard about it, saying that he held a smoker's license from the Shanghai Special Municipality, so how could he be accused of private opium use and extorted a large sum of money? He immediately returned to his hometown and secretly reported to the district office, requesting a thorough investigation. That night, the district office sent a letter to the public security police station to arrest Cao. He was escorted to the county yesterday for verification.

### Kunshan

Police Officer Kicks Villager to Death Case

Zhou Guangquan, a farmer from Zhouxiang Township in the sixth district of the county, was kicked to death by Xiang Ruifeng, a special police officer from the third branch of the police station, for gambling. The Zhenru forensic examination institute verified that it was true. The case has been heard several times and was pronounced on the 1st. Xiang Ruifeng was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for injuring another person resulting in death under the pretext of his official duties.

### Changshu

Three Highways Completed in Two Months

The county is implementing labor service, drawing labor to implement road construction work, which started successively on the 2nd and 3rd. There are three lines being built: ㊀ From Hanbeimen, passing Lingtang, to Dadongmen Sanlitang Bridge, connecting with the Xihu Highway; ㊁ Starting from outside Hanbeimen, passing Xingfu Sanfeng and reaching Dayi Bridge; ㊂ Starting from Xieqiao, passing Da Xiaoyi Bridge to the port, connecting with the Yangfu Highway. The completion of these three lines will make transportation between Shanghai, Changzhou, and Chengli more convenient. The district office is now drawing labor from various townships along the line, totaling 7,500 people mobilized. It is expected to be completed within two months. Soldiers from the garrisoned troops will also assist along the road.

### Jiading

Refugees Rob Farmers

On the 1st, a large number of refugees from Hunan entered Tingxiang, the third district of the county, from Luodian in Baoshan, and harassed farmer Wang Shenyi's family. The door was broken open, and they looted wantonly. Villagers who went to stop them were detained and not released, and they eventually left after satisfying their desires. Wang returned home from the city to check the losses, which totaled more than 400 yuan in legal tender, as well as other white rice, soybeans, minced meat, green fish, clothes, etc. The case has been reported to the county police bureau, and the police have been dispatched to track down and arrest them.

Deadline Extension of Ten Days for Tax Payment

Those who pay before February 10 will still be exempt from the fine. A notice was posted yesterday to inform the public.

The county ruled that separate residence was allowed, and a one-time payment of 10,000 yuan was ordered. Shen was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Higher Court. On the afternoon of the 3rd, both parties were summoned for trial. Judge Zhou questioned Wu Caiqin's request for 36,000 yuan in maintenance for 30 years, and announced the end of the debate, scheduling a date for sentencing.

### Wuxi

Notorious Bandit Ma Atan Captured

Police Chief Zhang Da recently received a secret report that a notorious bandit named Ma Atan was hiding in Huangdai, near Wangting.

After receiving the report on the 1st, Chief Zhang ordered Wang Hengru, the patrol officer of the water patrol team, to lead the team to arrest him at the address. The bandit was captured on the spot, and two sharp knives and 25 pawn tickets were found on him. He was escorted to the bureau on the morning of the 2nd, and Chief Zhang personally opened the court and interrogated him strictly. Due to the seriousness of the case, he ordered strict custody, waiting for the arrest of the remaining bandits.

### Changzhou

Two Drug Dealers Sentenced to Death

Wu County Government ordered that drug dealers arrested from January 1, 26, would be sentenced to death. It is now known that the first person sentenced to death was Dai Laosan from Mingshan Town. The first branch of the public security police also arrested a drug dealer, Xue Liangxing, at the Xu family's house in Mayuan Lane, Xizuozhen. A large bag of heroin was found in the chopstick joint. After repeated interrogations by the county, it was confirmed that he was involved in drug trafficking, and he was sentenced to death according to law. As soon as the judgment is drafted, it will be submitted to the district commissioner for review.

### Zhenjiang

Banning Extortion Under the Guise of Birthday Celebrations

The Zhenjiang County Government has now heard that the chief of Baojia in various districts and townships often posts posts on the grounds of the birth of a young child or the birthday of his wife. This move is close to extortion and is very inappropriate. Moreover, the chief of Baojia in townships and townships serves the locality, and should especially value reality and dismiss Huahua, and set an example by himself, and should not use useful money for unnecessary consumption. It has recently issued a notice to all districts to earnestly ban this. After this warning, if the aforementioned situation occurs again, it will be immediately transferred to the case for handling according to law.

### Jiaxing

Repercussions of Pottery Control

Residents in the Ganlou area of Jiaxing have lived on pottery for generations, inheriting their clothes and bowls from each other. Recently, the county issued a plan to revive the pottery industry, and is preparing to implement control. In general, pottery merchants are panicked. The transportation and sales of pottery are complex, and they are deeply afraid that a single mistake will put the pottery merchants to death. According to local pottery people, the number of pottery produced in the Ganlou area is scattered, and the categories are as many as a hundred or more. Therefore, the sale and purchase are very trivial, and the market is different in the morning and evening. If the same price is forced, the capital will be greatly affected if it is too small, and the transportation and sales will be stagnant if it is too large. Moreover, the places where they are sold are towns such as Wuzhen Changxing, and the wharves are scattered. If the sale and purchase are entrusted to brokers, it is tantamount to creating an exploitation class. If agencies are set up in each port, the personnel will be frequent, which will only increase the burden on merchants. In summary, it is of great importance to pottery merchants, so they have applied to the county government to withdraw the decree, and in addition to the third-grade bricks, they still ask to give merchants freedom of trade.

### Ningbo

### Huang Bochang to Fight Haben Xin Again

▲Scheduled for 8:30 PM on the 8th ▲Held at the Tianchan Stage

Huang Bochang, an overseas Chinese wrestler from the United States, has repeatedly defeated Filipino and Indian experts since returning to China last year. Another Indian, Haben Xin, challenged him. The two fought last month at the Vienna Ballroom, but the match was evenly matched and there was no clear winner. Recently, Mr. Huang admitted that not defeating Haben Xin was a regret, so he challenged the Indian Leopard again. After much negotiation, an agreement was finally reached. Because Mr. Huang only fought six rounds last time, which did not resolve the outcome, he proposed extending the match to eight rounds for a grand battle. Haben Xin, however, believed that Mr. Huang had sufficient strength, so he only wanted to fight six rounds first. After friendly mediation, it was decided to fight seven rounds, each round lasting ten minutes, scheduled for 8:30 PM on the 8th of this month at the Tianchan Stage. In addition to this major battle, there will also be a match between Filipino Aquinaldo and Indian Miha, for a total of three rounds. Aquinaldo is the current Filipino heavyweight wrestling champion, while Miha is strong and powerful, and also a famous Indian wrestler. There will also be three boxing matches. This event is organized by Mr. Huang himself. (Previous events were hosted by Shanxi Overseas Chinese.) In order to popularize wrestling matches, ticket prices are lower than before, with five types: 60 cents, one yuan, two yuan, three yuan, and four yuan, to facilitate attendance by students from various schools. Reserved seating can be purchased in advance at the Motieli Piano Store on Nanjing Road.

### American All-Star Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow, Shanghai Mixed Team Practices Tonight

Li Zhenzhong and Yin Hongxiang Rush to Help

The Sino-Western mixed team organized by this city to compete against the American All-Star basketball team has already selected its players the day before yesterday. However, among the ten selected players, there are only two guards. In order to increase the team's strength, a long-distance telegram was sent to Nanjing to add Yin Hongxiang, making a total of eleven players. The team is scheduled to practice at Shenyuan at 7:30 PM today. A total of 1,500 tickets are available, priced at one and a half yuan each, and will be sold today at the Physical Education Association, the Dalu Newspaper Office, and the Huadong Sports Equipment Company. Details are as follows:

Practice Tonight

The Sino-Western mixed team of this city is scheduled to hold a practice session at the Shenyuan basketball court at 7:30 PM tonight. All eleven selected players, Carson, Sguia, Rankin, Locke, Cadden, Feng Nianhua, Zhang Liangxiong, Li Zude, Wu Bixian, Li Zhenzhong, and Yin Hongxiang, are required to attend. Li and Yin will leave Beijing this morning to participate in Shanghai. According to the above list, in addition to guards Carson, Yin Hongxiang, and Zhang Liangxiong, and center Li Zhenzhong, Locke (Locke may also play forward), the rest are all forwards.

American All-Stars

As for the American All-Star team members, they are not only American college basketball stars, but also famous athletes. For example, Cobb was once seen as the most promising to break the world record in the high hurdles. In 1932, he set a world intercollegiate high hurdles record of 14.7 seconds in Oklahoma City, and in 1935, he set a university high hurdles record of 14.5 seconds representing the University of Southern California, and once equaled the world record. Captain "Baby Face" Browning has served as captain of the University of Southern California basketball team three times. Bill, Musk, and Howard (6 feet 4 inches tall, known as "Big Kid," who scores every time under the basket) are his classmates. Mackton and Vedesca graduated from Los Angeles Institute. Tang Qimeng was formerly a strongman at Wovhaiwo.

Record in the Philippines

The American team won seven out of eight games in the Philippines. In their second game, they lost by one point to the former All-Philippine champion Saint Peter's team. The Saint team repeatedly used long shots from extremely difficult angles and unexpectedly succeeded. After suffering this defeat, the American team did not dare to underestimate their opponents and successively overcame the current All-Philippine champions and runners-up, Saint Mesmos, etc., greatly enhancing their reputation. The Philippine team, after obtaining fifth place in the Berlin World Basketball Championship, has already taken the lead in the Far East, but the American team's skills are actually above the Philippine team. The American team is good at using a "slow motion" style, cooperating into a mechanized team, often avoiding dribbling and running, which surprised the Philippine team.

### Mr. Jiang Junhui of Our Resident Student Supervision Office in Japan Returns to Report

Reported to the Ministry of Education in Beijing Yesterday on Studying in Japan

Jiang Junhui, Chief of General Affairs of our country's Resident Student Supervision Office in Japan, returned to China from Japan the day before yesterday, and went to Beijing yesterday to report to the authorities of the Ministry of Education on studying in Japan. The reporter interviewed Mr. Jiang at his residence yesterday, and according to the published talks as follows: ㊀ The number of students studying in Japan was close to 10,000 at its peak in the past year, but there were uneven qualities among them. Since Supervisor Chen took office, he adopted a policy of emphasizing quality over quantity. (If all were excellent members, quality and quantity would be equally important. With the surge in Japanese gold, international changes, and various other relationships, the current number of students in Japan is no more than half of the peak. Although these students may not all be excellent in terms of academics and character, they can generally maintain self-respect, work hard, and not forget their purpose of studying abroad. Recently, there has been a new trend, that is, Supervisor Chen's policy of emphasizing quality over quantity, after many compromises, except for one or two commercialized schools, which are only thinking about their own interests and are still outwardly compliant but inwardly opposed, the majority of schools have been able to understand and are willing to cooperate. According to the authorities of a certain school, the position of the Supervision Office is as a guest, and the position of the school is as the host. The guest should not overstep the host. Now that the guest is not afraid of hard work and is responsible for rectification, the host should abandon the attitude of bystanders and give as much assistance as possible. The school has this kind of expression, and the cultural and educational administrative authorities also have this kind of argument. Therefore, I believe that the future of the academic circles studying in Japan is very hopeful. In the future, there will be batches of students studying in Japan with excellent character and academics returning to the motherland to serve.

㊁ The problem of the way out for students after graduation is originally closely related to their personal strength. On the one hand, Supervisor Chen pays attention to the cultivation of students' strength, so that they have the ability to deal with things calmly when serving. On the other hand, he also pays attention to establishing contact with all walks of life and supplying talents as much as possible. Recently, Fujian has been seeking veterinarians, and Guangxi has been seeking dental graduates, wanting the Supervision Office to recommend them from students studying in Japan, and there are still suitable people who can be introduced.

㊂ Japanese police were originally world-renowned, but there are only two police schools. One of them does not accept our students. The one that accepts our students is called the Police Training Institute. Although the name of this school is not as beautiful as a specialized university, the teaching and management equipment are very complete. The admission qualifications stipulate that only police officers above the rank of incumbent police officer are accepted, which is like a military officer university. For some reason, it is planned not to accept our students this year. The Supervision Office is currently negotiating, requesting continued acceptance, but it is unknown whether the goal can be achieved. It is heard that recently, there are quite a few people who want to enter the school and go to the East. It is hoped that before the Supervision Office's negotiations have been completed, do not go abroad rashly, and those who have not served as police officers should not have this ambition.

㊃ When the Xi'an Incident occurred, many students studying abroad were panicked, and they went to the embassy and the Supervision Office to inquire. Their sad and resolute attitude fully demonstrated their deep love for the country and their eagerness to serve the country, which is really worthy of joy and attention.

㊄ Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, students in the disaster area and its vicinity, regardless of whether they are publicly or privately funded, have been cut off from economic assistance, and their lives are in a state of extreme anxiety. The current Supervision Office is in the process of requesting assistance from the Central Government, and Ambassador Xu has always been benevolent and caring, and sees people starving and drowning as if he himself were starving and drowning, and is also trying to find ways to hope that the country will pay special attention to these intellectuals, because once they lose their studies and drift to foreign countries, it is a loss to the country, not just the misfortune of a few of them.

㊅ The problem of the graduation qualification certificate for students who have not received a study abroad certificate is originally of vital interest to the students. They are bound to fight for it. The Supervision Office has repeatedly asked the upper authorities to allow leniency, but the outcome is unknown. The students now trust the Supervision Office to seek benefits for them.

㊆ What the Supervision Office feels most difficult is the issue of funding. Because of this relationship, various planned tasks are still difficult to fully implement. The original funding is really too small, so even the section chiefs and above have to donate their salaries to cover relocation expenses. Usually, in order to facilitate the smooth progress of work, there are many external socializing, and all expenses cannot be handled without additional salary. It is hoped that the budget can be increased in the future. (Central News Agency)

### Ministry of Judicial Administration Rectifies Prison Moral Education

The number of students in each grade will also be expanded as much as possible. In terms of physical education, the school will add extracurricular exercise time in accordance with the Ministry of Education's orders. This semester is the 10th anniversary of the school, and the preparatory committee has already been established to prepare for the achievement exhibition and the compilation of the commemorative publication.

### Several Secondary Education Issues Related to English Teaching (6)

— Wang Shijie

Also quite pressing, this situation is quite common. We cannot completely or mostly blame the students for not working hard. Maybe they are not working hard in the right way, the guiding teachers are not good, or maybe the teaching materials and teaching methods are not suitable. The current English curriculum is part of the secondary school curriculum and has been revised several times. Now, the teaching materials and teaching methods of various schools are generally based on this curriculum standard. If we want to remedy the current situation, it seems that we should seek a fundamental improvement in both teaching materials, teaching methods, and teachers. Only then can the English teaching of secondary schools have a solid foundation. This issue contains many specialized problems, especially the research results in linguistics in recent years, which should be cited to some extent on this issue, so that we can obtain scientific principles on this issue, and then propose a specific plan for reform based on these principles. These all require detailed research by experts, scholars, and teachers to determine. For individual issues such as English teaching materials, teaching methods, and teachers, we need to find solutions based on academic principles. For the entire issue that goes beyond each issue and includes each issue, we need a constructive idea and attitude. Regarding the direction that the study of this issue will take in the future, I personally have a little hope, and I believe that there are definitely many people who express the same feeling about this point of hope. This point of hope is that the improvement of English teaching in secondary schools must conform to the general principles and goals of secondary education. If the above-mentioned principles of secondary education can be established, English teaching in secondary schools should reach the following limits: ㊀ Should be practical. Obviously, for example, if the teaching materials adopt foreign things, it is better to adopt Chinese things for practicality. The teaching method should also conform to the situation of Chinese students. ㊁ Should be rich in cultivating students' ability to study on their own and to conduct research automatically. This is especially necessary to bring up in English teaching because to have this ability, one must learn English to a minimum level in the secondary school era. ㊂ Should take into account the needs of students to continue their studies, and should also take into account the needs of students to enter the society to serve after graduation. On the one hand, enable students who continue their studies to study advanced knowledge, and on the other hand, cultivate a solid foundation for students who enter the society to serve in various businesses as junior cadres. Today, all the gentlemen who attended the conference and the gentlemen of the Chinese Western Language Society must be particularly concerned about this issue and will have many contributions. The work of the Chinese Western Language Society and today's conference has aroused interest and attention from all parties, so I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few points for everyone to consider and wish the conference and the Chinese Western Language Society a successful future.

Millers Engage in Covering, Recent Flour Prices Rise Seven Cents

Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning with prices showing initial stability, followed by a surge in all months. Chicago and Canada's wheat quotations both rose by about thirty to forty cents, while Liverpool fell by one penny. After the opening, wheat quotations varied by five points, and market sentiment was still undecided, only one cent higher than the previous day. However, after the second session, the market gradually rose. This month, due to millers covering and slightly active customer demand, buying activity increased directly. Outside investors continued to absorb March and April contracts, which also became more expensive. In the afternoon session, market sentiment for February, March, and April became increasingly strong. Although this month is not a delivery period, the exchange has closed accounts on the 5th. During this period, each factory's spot goods should be based on the standard market price. Therefore, mills are engaging in covering and have a relationship with spot goods. Because March is close to this month, it also rose sharply by 7.5 cents. Market sentiment for April and July was more stable, rising only three to four cents.

Wheat Futures Driven Up by Flour

Yesterday, wheat futures opened in the morning with prices initially flat, followed by gains. Because wheat quotations fluctuated, the initial market was similar to the previous day. June and July contracts were slightly lower by one cent. Then, as the flour market rebounded, buying activity also increased, and prices rose by three to four cents at the close. In the afternoon session, trading was not active, but the flour market's unexpected rise inevitably drove the sentiment of inside and outside investors, so bids for all months rose by another three to five cents. However, market insiders speculate that with the closing of accounts approaching, the exchange only has one day of trading left. If there is no practical sales strategy after the Spring Festival, the market may not be able to stand firm. Spot goods have not been delivered because factory demand has stopped.

River Rice Sales in This Area Slightly Brisk

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were the same as before, totaling more than 40, with about 8,000 dan of goods. Of these, thin rice accounted for more than 20. Sales in this area were slightly more active than before. The Qingdao and Yantai gangs bought more than 3,000 packages of thin rice, but buying was not loose, so the market situation was stable. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice were all unchanged. Yin Bian Yuan and Lu Jian were both flat.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 21 or 22 ships arrived from various ports down the river. Various transactions in the market were still flat. The price of high-grade white japonica rice was stable, while that of medium and low grades tightened by several points. The price of early thin rice was firm, white Yuan was firm, Yin Yuan was stable, and other goods were largely unchanged.

Indica Rice Buyers Have Mostly Stopped

Yesterday, customers arrived and continued to load from various ports along the Yangtze River. Most merchants have already folded their samples, and most have already rested. The Guangdong gang has yet to clear the shipments it was handling before, and it is feared that there will be no more handling this year. Shantou, Xiamen, and Beiyang gangs have also mostly stopped. Yesterday, only this area handled 2,273 packages of Jiangxi rice and 250 packages of Wenzhou indica rice. Other inquiries were few. Although customers have not released samples, with both inventory and arrivals full, the market has turned flat and soft.

### Yarn and Cotton

Overproduction Makes This Month's Yarn Decline Formidable

The yarn market fell sharply in the morning but turned stable in the afternoon. However, due to the approaching period for closing final accounts, customers have announced that they have stopped buying, so yarn merchants are uniformly bearish. Because yarn mills have accumulated yarn, the delivery of February contracts will be robust. Selling pressure is also heavy when prices rise. Although many parties have released yarn, most have not yet unloaded it. The turbulence ahead is still brewing.

Geng Feng Sells in the Morning, Buys in the Afternoon

The yarn market opened lower across the board in the morning. The recent decline has been severe. Market rumors said that a large batch of spot yarn could be delivered. Secondly, some bulls have already unloaded, so the trading floor is slack, and prices are falling step by step. Geng Feng also sold a huge amount, but Mr. Xu has recently been buying, in a very large quantity. Indian merchants are still in a bullish position. As a result, all months fell by 1.578 yuan to 2.8 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The market was particularly weak in the afternoon, especially for the current month. However, long-term contracts were still good. The current month was still flat in the second session, and the forward months rose by another two to three cents. By the third session, Jin Chang suddenly bought 1,600 bales of February contracts, rising by seven cents, and other months improved. At the close, February rose another three cents, and the forward months improved. Geng Feng and Jin Chang sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. It was found that Yu Da sold 2,550 bales, Heng Yi 800 bales, He Xing 600 bales, Geng Feng 2,450 bales, Chang Ji 1,200 bales, Yuan Yi 2,100 bales, Sen Kang 850 bales, Feng Tai 800 bales, and Da Chang Cheng 600 bales. Jin Chang bought 1,250 bales, Ji Feng 700 bales, Da Fu 700 bales, Tong Fu 900 bales, Xing Chang 950 bales, Yi Chang 1,250 bales, Tai Chang 1,200 bales, Yong Da 1,100 bales, Tong He 1,050 bales, and Chang Feng 1,250 bales, Xie Cheng 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Yarn Sales Less Than 500 Bales

The spot yarn market was unusually quiet. It was found that all gangs bought only 434 bales throughout the day, and the selling price fell by one yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below.

Cotton Prices Unchanged Recently

Buying and selling seem to be ending.

The cotton market initially fell and then rose, and the market remained in a fluctuating state. Because most operators are in the process of closing accounts, there are very few transactions. The spot cotton business has become quiet. Factories have stopped operating, and sources from various routes are increasingly scarce, because inland cotton firms have successively stopped weighing and closing accounts.

Both Bulls and Bears Lack Interest

The cotton market opened weaker in the morning, and the market remained dull. Overseas cotton markets were mediocre, but trading in the exchange was very scarce. Both bulls and bears have no interest in predicting the trend, and the market remains in a fluctuating situation. As a result, all months fell by 0.5 to 1.2 cents compared to the previous day's close. The market was calm in the afternoon, with nothing exciting to say. After the first session, retail short covering increased, and the market gradually rebounded. As a result, all months rose by 0.5 to 1.2 cents. It was found that Da Feng sold 1,900 dan, Ming De 1,000 dan, Yuan Yi 1,100 dan, Chang Feng 5,300 dan, and Yong Yu 1,200 dan. He Xing bought 2,700 dan, Sheng Yuan 1,100 dan, Yi Kang 2,000 dan, and Run Kang 1,400 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed below.

Spot Cotton Sources Scarce

Spot cotton consumption is sluggish, factory demand is closed, and sources are scarce: 100 bales of Yao cotton and 96 bales of Tong cotton.

American Cotton Sellers Are Advantageous

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened weak, and prices fell by one to five points for each month. Initially, due to the fall in various commodity prices, bulls at home and abroad closed their positions. At the same time, the car strike has not been resolved, and the flood situation has shown signs of easing. Sellers were advantageous in the market. It was reported that the water level of the Mississippi River stopped rising, and the water level of the Ohio River suddenly dropped. As a result, those who bought in because of flood news are now selling. However, when the May contract reached 12.5 cents, brokers bought. Before the close, news of the successful car strike strengthened the market again. Spot goods fell by four points, and futures fell by four to eight points. British spot cotton fell by eight points, and futures fell by six or seven points. The large positions closed by old Indian cotton bulls were absorbed by brokers. Favorable Japanese transportation costs and reduced arrivals of Omlas led to short covering in the February contract. Later, trading was sparse, and the market was calm. Ping Guo Er fell by 1.25 rupees, Omla fell by 1.25 to 2 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi fell by 1.75 to 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (2nd).

According to a Mumbai telegram, the forecast for the opening on the 3rd is: Bai Luo Xi at 227 rupees, Omla at 209.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, and Ping Guo Er at 183 rupees, up 0.5 rupees.

Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth All Fall

A telegram from Osaka on the 3rd: spot yarn fell by 2 to 6 yuan. 16-count fan surface at 250 yuan, down 2 yuan. 20-count goldfish at 269 yuan, down 6 yuan. 40-count five-star at 420 yuan, unchanged. 42-count pheasant at 403 yuan, down 4 yuan. Futures yarn fell by 5 cents to 2 yuan. The near month was 259 yuan, and the far month was 256.5 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 0.3 to 0.55 yuan. The near month was 75.2 yuan, and the far month was 77.75 yuan.

### Piece Goods

Eastern Piece Goods Have the Most Transactions

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market remained firm. Although the yarn market suffered setbacks, thread prices remained firm. Spot sales of cotton cloth to this area and the Tianjin gang were still enthusiastic, with Eastern goods being more popular. The Tianjin gang successively transacted over 100 cases of Nei Wai factory Si Jun Zi broadcloth, and over 400 packages of Qingdao goods fine cloth and Gongda factory blue double fish fine twill. This area also stockpiled several hundred packages of Yu Feng Da Kang and other factory fine cloth. There was very little inventory on the market. The sales price fell slightly by 2.5 cents per piece due to the empty sellers dumping on the yarn decline. Secondly, the Shandong gang also absorbed 30 cases of Si Jun Zi broadcloth. The Ningbo gang imported over 100 packages of rough cloth from Yi He, Bao Xing, Zhen Tai, and other factories. Over 40 cases of poplin, foreign yarn, corduroy, white velvet, thread velvet, and printed cloth were also imported. The Hunan and Guangdong gangs continued to add a total of over 200 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, poplin, and rough cloth from this factory. The other nearby customer gangs were very quiet. The market was very firm. Heavy rough cloth rose in price as factory prices increased. Zhen Tai, Bao Xing, Shen Xin, Geng Yu and other factory products all rose by 5 cents (per piece).

British Pullover Woolens Continue to Arrive

Yesterday, the woolen market was quiet. Spot goods and orders were both quiet. Merchants are all taking stock and settling accounts in preparation for the final closing. New woolen goods continue to arrive at the port. Most of them are British pullover woolens, most of which are designated by dismantling gangs. It is reported that more will continue to arrive in the middle of next week.

### Securities

Public Bonds Rise Again

Yesterday, public bonds on the Chinese Stock Exchange rose sharply. Because market sentiment recovered and became firm, large investors bought heavily, and retail investors also bought a lot. The market was tight, and prices gradually advanced, which was very energetic. However, because there will be a longer holiday after the next two days of trading, bulls and bears gradually became busy closing their positions. It is feared that under the booming atmosphere, there will be continued changes. Fuxing public bonds have not been traded for two weeks. Now that buyers have appeared, the price is 77 yuan, which is a sharp rise of 4 yuan compared to before. Yesterday morning, the opening price for No. 50 was suddenly purchased in large quantities, market sentiment turned bullish, and prices rose uniformly by five cents to four dimes. Nos. 32 and 47 were sold a lot. The trend continued to rise in the next session. No. 50 was very strong, and Nos. 6 and 35 also bought a lot. Nos. 43 and 31 continued to sell a lot. Jia, etc. all continued to improve by five cents to 2.5 dimes. The market gradually became firm in the afternoon. Nos. 4 and 11 were also purchased in large quantities. Nos. 46 and 31 continued to sell. Bing, etc. rose by five cents to 2.5 dimes. Category B bonds fell back by 1.5 dimes in half a month. The closing price was flat and firm due to the competition between bulls and bears. Nos. 32 and 43 were still selling, while Nos. 11 and 10 were buying. The price only rose or fell by a dime. As a result of the whole day, all rose by 1.5 dimes to 6.5 dimes. The total turnover was 7,755,000 yuan. The comparison of its gains, losses, highs, and lows is listed in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).

Yunnan Tin Very Few Arrivals

Yunnan tin (commonly known as Dian tin) has recently been very popular due to very few arrivals, and the opening price is quite firm.

It was heard that the Hongkou gang and shipyards handled it.

However, sentiment is good, the fixed price is high, and the shortage of arrivals has helped to stabilize the market. It was found that yesterday's city-wide transactions were only 2,000 to 3,000 dan, which is not as lively as before.

### The Problem of Dry Cocoon Exports

— Qian Tianda

In recent years, the world economy has gradually recovered, prices have risen, and raw silk prices in Japan and the United States have soared. Our country's silk industry, which was gradually declining, has received this life-sustaining elixir, and it also shows a thriving trend. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the national raw silk exports totaled 97,238 bales, more than double the 32,977 bales in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. If it were not for the lack of raw materials, the export volume would have been even more considerable. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the export of raw silk from Shanghai was 41,446 bales, which was an increase compared with the 23rd year of the Republic of China, but a decrease compared with the 24th year of the Republic of China. The biggest reason is only affected by the weather, the spring and autumn silkworm farming is not good, the raw materials are insufficient, and the price of dry cocoons is high. Silk factories do not count the cost, which leads to high silk prices abroad, and our country has no goods to respond to. A great opportunity has been missed, which is regrettable.

At a time when raw materials are scarce, there are also unscrupulous silk cocoon merchants who have successively loaded and exported large quantities of dry cocoons, resulting in a thin inventory. Silk factories with short capital have been forced to shut down, and tens of millions of workers have suddenly become unemployed. The impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is huge. Reading Mr. Jin Sheng's "View on Dry Cocoon Export" published in the special column of Shen Bao on January 28 is tantamount to defending those who export dry cocoons. The author believes that the impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is huge, confusing right and wrong, like a bone stuck in the throat, and cannot help but speak out. I dare to raise a few points and discuss them with domestic sericulture experts:

Mr. Jin Sheng said: "As far as the author knows, the reason why silk factories in this city are forced to stop production is not because raw materials are exhausted, but because the cocoon price is not suitable. At present, there are still more than 10,000 dan of dry cocoons piled up in the warehouses of this city and Wuxi." Anyone who knows a little about economic principles will know that this statement is unreasonable. We know that market transactions cannot go beyond the scope of the law of supply and demand, but the purpose of dry cocoon merchants and silk merchants is to make profits. At the same time, silk factories must consider costs when purchasing dry cocoons. If the cocoon price exceeds the silk price, a deal will definitely not be reached. Therefore, if the number of dry cocoons is small and the price is expensive, silk manufacturers can still make a small profit. If the price of dry cocoons exceeds the price of raw silk (the cocoon price is not suitable), it is really unreasonable. As for the dry cocoons that are currently on the market for sale, there are less than 5,000 dan in Shanghai and Wuxi. This is the actual situation and cannot be fabricated. Even if it is calculated as 10,000 dan, there are about 60 silk factories that have started operations in Shanghai this year, with an average of 200 silk reeling machines per factory. Each machine consumes 5 jin of cocoons per day (assuming that each machine produces 16 liang of silk per day, and the dry cocoons are discounted by 500 jin of market weight, and 1 dan of silk is reeled). Then 10,000 dan of dry cocoons is not enough for Shanghai silk factories to use for one month. However, new cocoons will be available in mid-May, so the lack of raw materials is really a fatal blow to the silk industry. How can it be more than 10,000 dan?

Dry cocoon exports affect the silk industry, which is needless to say. Let us try to think from the perspective of the entire country and nation. The nature of raw silk exports and dry cocoon exports is also obviously different. Dry cocoons are agricultural products, while raw silk is a semi-finished product. The biggest reason for the adverse international trade in our country over the years is that most of the exports are raw materials, while most of the imports are manufactured products. The exchange of raw materials and manufactured products is unequal. If raw silk is exported, all the wages and expenses during manufacturing are paid by foreigners. The Chinese people have more income, which also increases their financial resources. The export of dry cocoons is not the same. We will not discuss what foreign countries will use after purchasing them. In our country, it is a reduction in manufacturing raw materials, and at the same time, it reflects an increase in the unemployment of workers (as for the overproduction of dry cocoons, which exceeds the needs of the country, it should be discussed separately). Especially at a time when raw materials are scarce and the number of unemployed workers is increasing in the domestic silk industry, we certainly do not agree with the shipment and export of large quantities of dry cocoons.

"The government should use the international market to stipulate the domestic cocoon price and silk price, and should not use the market price of the Japanese and American stock exchanges as a standard, because the mother burden was raised by 50 or 60 yuan in both spring and autumn last year." The largest silk markets abroad are Yokohama and Kobe in Japan, New York in the United States, and Lyon in France. There are no other important international raw silk markets besides these. I don't know what the so-called international market is based on. As far as I know, the cocoon price set in the spring and autumn last year was appropriate, and there was no huge difference of 50 or 60 yuan.

Mr. Jin Sheng believes that the only reason for the export of dry cocoons is that our country's silk factories have outdated machinery and are not suitable for reeling high-grade raw silk. In fact, in recent years, our country's silk reeling machinery has been greatly improved. Factories in Wuxi such as Yongtai, Huaxin, Jiangchang, Yongsheng, Dingchang, and Dacheng have all been completely improved (Mr. Jin Sheng has already mentioned the factories in Shanghai), and they can reel high-grade raw silk with an evenness of 85 points or more, so this point is also not true.

As for "improving machinery" and "cultivating talents," it is of course reasonable to say, but these points do not seem to have much to do with this article. As for citing examples such as double palace, wheat flour, and cotton cloth, may I ask if our country encounters famine and food is insufficient, and there are large quantities of food exports, should it be stopped? This meaning is very clear and does not need to be distinguished, so why is the export of dry cocoons different?

The above points are based on the major points of the argument. Other trivial matters are too numerous to mention. In order to save the space of Shen Bao, I will not go into details.

Editor's note: A few days ago, we received a manuscript from Mr. Jin Sheng, which described the problem of dry cocoon exports. At that time, we thought it was strange that there was such a large export of raw materials when the raw materials for silk making were so scarce, so we disclosed it. Now we have received a manuscript from Mr. Qian Tianda, which seems to be correcting Mr. Jin Sheng's remarks as a defense for dry cocoon exporters. The editor does not care about the identity of the author. When it comes to writing and discussing issues, anyone who can conduct in-depth research will be of great benefit to the matter. However, it is still unclear where this dry cocoon export is going and what it is used for, which can dispel the readers' doubts. From the perspective of the entire silk industry, we also oppose the export of dry cocoons. However, how to preserve raw materials from flowing out cannot be solved by empty arguments. It still depends on the silk cocoon merchants' ability to cooperate and unite in spirit to restore the lost foundation of the sericulture motherland. It also depends on the silk manufacturers' efforts to be enterprising and pay attention to the collection of raw materials!

### Overseas Chinese in Siam Hope to Open a Sino-Siamese Air Route

Xu Wanting is Negotiating with the China Merchants Bureau

According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Xu Geting, a member of the Standing Committee of the Siamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, has been back in China to contact the Sino-Siamese Association and the China National Products Sales Association to discuss the affairs of the associations and to carry out matters with the Bangkok China National Products Company, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Mr. Xu is also meeting with Mr. Cai Zengji, the director of the China Merchants Bureau, to discuss the opening of the Sino-Siamese air route. According to Mr. Xu, no less than 4,000 overseas Chinese travel between Shantou, Hong Kong, and Siam every month, and the import of Siamese rice into China reaches one million tons. There are also many other shipments of timber and seafood. If ships of 3,000 to 4,000 tons with a draft of less than 15 feet operate between Shanghai and Bangkok, passing through Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, with two sailings per month in each direction, there will definitely be considerable certainty in passenger and freight transport, and it will also be sufficient to facilitate the export of national products and benefit the cultural communication between China and foreign countries. It is reported that Mr. Cai greatly appreciated Mr. Xu's plan and often continued to discuss ways to promote its realization.

### Ms. Gao Yuzhu Gave a Radio Speech on the Problems of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities

Border Compatriots are Actually the Oldest Ethnic Group in Our Country, and Foreign Aggression and Temptation are Gradually Isolating Them from the Mainland

Ms. Gao Yuzhu, the representative of the chieftains of the southwestern border ethnic minorities who petitioned in Beijing, visited leaders from all walks of life in the city yesterday morning. At noon, she was publicly hosted by Li Shizeng and others, and at 5 p.m., she gave a speech on the "Problems of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities" at the China-West Radio Station. The local association has scheduled a grand tea party to welcome her at the association's location at 3 p.m. today. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Li Shizeng and Others Gave a Public Banquet at Noon

Ms. Gao Yuzhu, the representative of the chieftains of the southwestern ethnic minorities who petitioned, was warmly welcomed by all walks of life when she passed through Shanghai on her return trip. At 10:00 yesterday morning, Ms. Gao first visited Qian Xinzhi at the Four-Line Savings Association, and then went to the local association to visit Du Yuesheng, Huang Yanpei, and others. They deeply admired Ms. Gao for her petition to Beijing, requesting the reorganization of ethnic minority affairs and the consolidation of border defense. At noon, Li Shizeng, Cui Zhuxi, Huang Jingwan, Liu Zhanen, Zhang Yaozeng, and others held a public banquet for Ms. Gao at the Gongdelin Restaurant. In addition to persuading the guests to inscribe words in ethnic minority languages ​​or Chinese to leave as a souvenir, she also gave a sincere speech, first stating the purpose of her petition from the north, and then describing the lives of the local ethnic minorities and the situation of being invaded by foreign forces. Her loyalty and patriotism were overflowing in her words, and the audience applauded continuously.

The Local Association Will Hold a Tea Party Today

The local association in the city has scheduled a tea party to welcome her at the association's location in the Zhonghui Building at 3 p.m. today. In addition to the leaders from all walks of life in the city who will come to participate, students from Nanjing, and along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and southwestern students have also been notified to come to Shanghai to participate, which will surely be a grand occasion. It is slightly heard that at the tea party, in addition to inviting Ms. Gao to give a speech, opinions on assisting in the development of the border areas will also be exchanged, so as to improve the culture and improve the lives of ethnic minorities.

Speech on the Problems of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities

Ms. Gao Yuzhu gave a speech on the "Problems of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities" at the China-West Radio Station at 5 p.m. yesterday. Zhou Bangjun first gave an introductory speech, and then Ms. Gao gave a speech in the ethnic minority language, which was translated by Yu Jiecai. The speech is recorded as follows: Compatriots from all walks of life, our great Republic of China is formed by the joint combination of the Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and southwestern ethnic minorities. However, many people only know the five ethnic groups of Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan, and do not know that there is also a very large southwestern ethnic minority. Some people even do not understand the term "ethnic minority." Isn't this very ridiculous? Some people think that all people in the southwestern provinces are ethnic minorities, which is an extreme mistake. We must know that most of the inland areas of the southwestern provinces are Han people, and some Han people have assimilated with the literati. Their cultural life is completely as noble and superior as the Han people in the country. The ethnic minorities we are talking about now specifically refer to the ethnic minority compatriots in the border areas of the southwestern provinces. These border compatriots are the oldest ethnic group in our country, that is, the original literati of the Central Plains. For thousands of years, they have had a close relationship with the advanced Han people in the country, and they have also had a lot of relationship with other ethnic groups. However, our southwestern ethnic minorities are located in remote border areas, traffic is blocked, they are overly conservative, and their own culture is extremely backward. They cannot keep pace with the various ethnic groups in the country, but have formed modern primitive humans and uncivilized people. This is very painful for us. Speaking of the entry of the southwestern ethnic minorities, they are scattered in the border areas of Dian, Qian, Chuan, and Kang provinces, with a total of no less than 20 million people, occupying vast and fertile land and possessing extremely rich resources, such as mountain products, medicinal materials, livestock, forests, minerals, agriculture, and so on. It can be said that it is a virgin land that has not been developed in China for thousands of years, which is much superior to other desert border areas. In particular, the heroic and simple ethnic character of tens of millions of ethnic minorities cannot be compared with any other ethnic group. Therefore, many people say that the strong position of the southwest will become China's Angola, and the abundance of products can become the world's greatest industrial area. Some people also say that ethnic minorities are a constituent of the future new culture, and the southwest and ethnic minorities are the lifeline of national defense. All these expectations are indeed equipped with necessary and special conditions. We can believe that there is a possibility that it can be fully expressed in facts. Regarding the problems of the southwestern ethnic minorities, in the past imperial era, the policy of indirect control was used, and the local chieftains were held responsible for protecting the people and maintaining peace. The local chieftains always loved and supported the country because they received the grace of the country. After the Republic of China, the country was in turmoil, and the government was unable to reach them. They were left to fend for themselves, and the border officials were unvirtuous and corrupt, and there was discrimination between ethnic groups. The invasion and temptation of foreign forces gradually isolated them from the mainland. The ethnic minority compatriots in the southwestern region are suffering more and more under the devastation of natural disasters and man-made disasters. The disturbances in the border areas are also becoming more and more serious, directly and indirectly causing great problems in national defense. This is the misfortune of the ethnic minorities themselves, and it is also the greatest hidden worry of the country. Although in the past few years, many wise local officials have tried to develop ethnic minorities and consolidate national defense, their power is weak and they have achieved little success, which we cannot but regret. Now the country is unified, government orders are implemented, and the whole country is working hard to pay attention to the development of the border areas and consolidate national defense. This is the first step in securing the country and resisting foreign aggression, and it is also the way to revive the country and the nation. This time, because we feel the severity of our own suffering and see the international crisis in the southwest, we have gathered the chieftains from all over the southwest to unanimously support the central government and sent us to petition in Beijing from afar. For half a year, we have been grateful to the central government for treating the ethnic minorities in the southwestern border areas equally, and we have been particularly valued by the domestic compatriots, who believe that developing the ethnic minorities in the southwest and increasing the national strength is the most important plan at present. The various opinions we have presented before and after on the education, upbringing, health, and other aspects of the southwestern ethnic minorities have been adopted and processed separately. This is the happiness of the tens of millions of ethnic minorities in the southwest, and it is also the greatest hope for the future of the country. We hope that this virtue of the central government will continue to be implemented, and we especially hope that our local authorities will bear the actual responsibility for us based on the virtue given to us by the central government and do their best to handle it. At the same time, we feel that the heavy and big issue of developing the ethnic minorities in the southwest cannot be done by the government alone. We hope that all sectors of the country will work hard to assist the government. We welcome academic circles to investigate and study. We welcome domestic and overseas Chinese to invest in development. We welcome domestic talents to go to the southwestern border areas to serve and sacrifice for the country and the nation, and to jointly complete the new mission given to us by the times.

A translation of the gist of his words is as follows: "We are extremely pleased with the visit of the 'Emden' to Shanghai. On behalf of all the overseas Chinese in Shanghai, I extend my sincere welcome. I believe that those of us living overseas will have closer relations with our country from now on. We all have work to do and cannot accompany you officers on a leisurely tour, which is a pity. Shanghai is one of the largest commercial ports in the world, with the Chinese Municipal Government and the administrative organs of three different nationalities: the Public Concession Bureau, and the French Concession Bureau. The nature is special. We overseas Chinese live here and have a lot of contact with all parties, which is very gratifying. Your visit to China is a friendly one, and you will show the spirit of peaceful unification of our Germany to the people of friendly countries, and this spirit of peaceful unification is also needed by friendly countries (referring to China)," and so on.

### The Shipping Industry Improved Last Year, and All Companies Made Huge Profits

Monthly Income of 900,000 Yuan - Broke the Record of More Than Ten Years

The decline of China's shipping industry has lasted for many years. Before the summer of last year, many private shipping companies closed down due to the sharp decline in business. By autumn, due to the bumper harvest of farmland in various provinces along the Yangtze River and the congested transportation of grain, the Yangtze River route became active due to the strong purchasing power of the people in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces. Shanghai's shipping industry suddenly improved. After this month, the situation of excess tonnage has changed to a situation of demand exceeding supply.

The current situation of more goods than ships. The six companies have also increased their income by handling public allocations, soaring freight rates, implementing gauging, and increasing revenue. The Yangtze River ships of the wheel companies are making huge profits. The private Sanbei Company, only on the Yangtze River line, has a monthly income of more than 400,000 yuan, which breaks the record of more than ten years. The company used the surplus profit to purchase three ships: Longxing, Long'an, and Dapu. As for the state-run China Merchants Bureau, after the autumn of last year, the development of the shipping industry and the huge income from cargo on the Yangtze River and the sea have created the bureau

The latest record is that the daily income from cargo is said to average 900,000 yuan. The Yangtze River route has the best business. Wuhan has a particularly large amount of cargo to be transshipped. Last year, the freight for goods transshipped to other ports alone reached 800,000 yuan, almost the entire operating income of the Commercial Office era. The bureau made a lot of profit last year. In addition to the Emei wheel of the Sichuan River class, which is already being built, a new large-scale new type of Yangtze River wheel and a medium Yangtze River shallow-water cargo wheel have been added. Now, according to the bureau's regulations, for employees who work hard in business,

The awards given to employees in the Hankou Bureau are the best, and the bonus for each employee is calculated according to salary. For example, those with a monthly salary of ten yuan can get a bonus of thirty-five yuan. The Shanghai General Bureau has double salaries, so the bonus is slightly less. Each salary of one yuan can get eight cents, and so on. In addition, the business of Minsheng Industrial Company, which navigates the Sichuan River, was so good last year and the current transportation rate is so high that it is similar to the golden age before the European War. The company's business last year is said to have a surplus of more than one million yuan. In addition to the two express trains, Minyuan and Minben, which have already been built, the Minlian wheel will be added soon. This ship will be docked in the mountains in a few days. This ship will run from Shanghai to Yichang. However, the company's ships have never stopped in the section from Shanghai to Hankou. Now the Minlian wheel will stop at Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Datong, Jiujiang, and Hankou ports, which also operates the lower Yangtze shipping industry.

### Employees of the China Merchants Inland River Bureau Petitioned Yesterday

Request the Ministry to Withdraw the Order - So as to Avoid Unemployment of Workers on Shipping Routes

After the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to suspend operations, all 23 shipping routes were completely suspended from the 1st. The ships and properties were all taken over by special commissioners sent by the China Merchants General Bureau, and it was decided to put the bureau's entire staff of more than 1,000 people up for tender and sale, who were suddenly unemployed. Therefore, at 9 o'clock in the morning, a general meeting of employees in Shanghai was held on the bureau's ships on Suzhou Creek. It was resolved to organize a 'Representative Group of Employees on Shenhu Ling and Other Shipping Routes' to handle negotiations, and Shen Jingyi, Shen Guixing, Shen Gendi, Yang Zuomin, Hu Xiaoshu, Chen Meisi, Li Yaoting, Tang Changgen, Cao Ronggui, Zhang Guisheng and other ten people were elected as representatives. At 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the representatives submitted a joint petition to the Municipal Government Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Party Department General Labor Union. The original petition is recorded as follows: A petition is submitted to the Ministry of Communications for remittance and requests for relief for unemployed workers and restoration of the original shipping routes to facilitate transportation and maintain people's livelihood. The China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau was originally a privately-run company with more than 20 shipping routes, hundreds of branch offices, and was spread throughout the old prefectures of Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Tai, Huaiyang, and Zhejiang's Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. The number of inland river small ports has been around for decades and has always been the crown of the inland river shipping industry. The people of the two provinces have praised its convenience, and thousands of employees and tens of thousands of family members rely on this for their livelihoods. Over the years, we have been safe and sound. Since it was taken over by the government in June of the 24th year of the Republic of China, we have been actively organizing and striving for development, and there is a great atmosphere of revitalization. The employees are all praising and celebrating. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, it was heard that the company would be completely eliminated shortly after taking over. The employees are all unemployed and panicked. Therefore, we gathered together to discuss and publicly elected Zhang Yizhong, the son of the former head of the Inland River Bureau, Yi Zeng, as the plenipotentiary representative to submit a petition to the Ministry for relief. After receiving the approval, we were entrusted to contact the China Merchants General Bureau to undertake it. A contract was signed on December 21st of the 25th year and a deposit of 10,000 yuan was paid to the bureau, and an official receipt was given. The contract stated that the entire transfer would be handled on January 16th of the 26th year. The China Merchants General Bureau was requested to work hard to sign the agreement, and Lawyer Feng was present to testify. The employees, although hoarse and exhausted, were spared the pain of unemployment. Unexpectedly, a disturbance arose and the bureau was ordered to abolish the previous agreement. Therefore, on the 18th of the month, the employees of each shipping route gathered to discuss and publicly elected representatives Jingyi and others to submit a petition to the China Merchants General Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs on the afternoon of the 19th. While waiting for a solution, on January 22, we received a reply from the China Merchants General Bureau stating that the request was not approved on the grounds that it was still ordered by the Ministry of Communications to suspend shipping. Thousands of employees were disappointed and will put their lives on the line. At this time of national impoverishment and displacement, it is unbearable to see such trampling and high-pressure tactics when the country is not providing relief. Therefore, we have no choice but to jointly petition the employees of Shenhu Ling, Suxi, and other shipping routes. In addition to submitting petitions to the Municipal Party Department, the General Labor Union, and various agencies, we implore your Excellency to grant relief and find a way to achieve success, so as to avoid unemployment and maintain the people's livelihood. We also implore the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order and restore the original shipping routes, so as to live up to the original intention of the first Prime Minister's revolution to relieve the small and weak people. We are extremely urgent to await orders.

### Workers of the New Beijing Wheel Request Work Solution

Supported by New Ningxing Wheel Workers - Subsidize Living Expenses

After the New Beijing Wheel of the Shanghai-Ningbo class of the British Swire Shipping Company hit a reef and entered the dock for repairs, it was rented to the New Ning and wheel of the Sanbei Company to replace the voyage because it would take a month to complete. It sailed for the first time last night. The original workers of the New Beijing wheel requested the Seamen's Union to work on the ship yesterday. Secretary Wang Ji-yi, Section Chief Wang Yalun, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch Peng Bowei, and members Lu Shuangxi, Shou Yufeng, and Cheng Yongming mediated between the two parties yesterday afternoon. As a result, the New Beijing workers will wait ashore for repairs to be completed before being assigned work. During this period, the New Ning and workers will subsidize the New Beijing workers with living expenses for each trip. Both parties were satisfied at the time, and the dispute was temporarily resolved.

### Eurasia Company Seeks to Restore Ping-Yue Route

The opening and closing of the Eurasia Airlines Company's direct Eurasia route has been repeatedly hindered and has not yet been realized, but it is still working hard. The domestic routes have shortened the transportation between the northwest and south border provinces and the capital and Shanghai, arriving in one or two days. It has made a great contribution to communicating domestic economy and culture. The solution to the Shaanxi Incident in the short term was also due to the convenience of transportation. Although the regular postal flights between Xi'an and Lanzhou have not been restored, the company's routes fly to the two places every day to prepare for the travel of government officials and escort foreigners out of the country. It is heard that the company's Ping-Yue line was opened before the year, but due to the Yangtze River flood and the inundation of the airports in Changsha and other places, only the section from Beiping to Zhengzhou is temporarily operating. Now the company is planning to restore the entire line. The first step is to go from Beiping to Hankou via Zhengzhou. Depending on the business situation, we will consider restoring flights to Guangzhou. It is currently being submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval.

### Jiangsu Bank on Xinzha Road Robbed Yesterday

Police and Detectives in Fierce Gunbattle with Robbers, One Policeman Killed, Two Wounded

At approximately 5:10 PM yesterday, a robbery suddenly occurred at the Xinzha branch of Jiangsu Bank, located at the bridgehead of Wuzhen Road on Xinzha Road in the Public Concession. The bank usually stops transactions at 4:00 PM every day. However, the daily deposits and remaining balances must wait for the arrival of the main branch's cashier car to deliver the funds before ending the day's work. This had become a routine, but unfortunately, this was learned by the robbers. Yesterday, when the cashier car arrived at the entrance of the Xinzha branch, a robber car followed. The car was coffee-colored and resembled a Yunfei Company car. The cashier did not notice anything at the time. When he entered the counter to collect the suspicious items, the robbers in the car rushed in, drew their pistols, and shouted for silence, grabbing several bundles of banknotes totaling 7,000 yuan and fleeing. At that time, the bank's employed policeman, Gu Wenlin (顧文林), a 42-year-old from Yangzhou, saw that things were not good and wanted to draw his pistol to fire. However, a robber standing next to him snatched the pistol from the policeman's hand and then fired several shots, wounding the policeman and knocking him to the ground. The robbers, about four or five in number, rushed into the car and tried to escape. However, the last robber was chased by Jiang Zigen (姜子根), a 31-year-old Shandong native who was the bodyguard of the main branch's cashier car. The two sides engaged in a fierce gunbattle with box cannons and pistols. The robber fled while fighting and threw a pistol and several bundles of banknotes snatched from the policeman onto the road before getting into the car and speeding away to the west. A rickshaw puller was also injured by a stray bullet. While the bodyguard Jiang Zigen was in a fierce gunbattle with the robbers, he was also wounded by the robbers. However, he still turned around to pick up the banknotes and a pistol that the robbers had abandoned on the road. When the Xinzha police station learned of this, they immediately dispatched patrol cars and Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. However, the robbers' car was nowhere to be found. The wounded policeman, bodyguard, and rickshaw puller, Chen Youlu (陳有祿), from Yancheng, were taken to Baolong Hospital (寶隆醫院) for treatment. Before long, the employed policeman died of his serious injuries. The bank's entrance was stained with blood, which was unbearable to witness. Later, the Western detectives collected several bullet casings and took them back as evidence, while investigating the source of the robbers' car. It was then learned that the car was indeed rented from the Yunfei Car Rental Company (雲飛汽車行) on Jing'an Temple Road (靜安寺路) at around 3:30 PM by two men and one woman, all around the age of 30, who claimed to be going to Lincoln Road (林肯路). At that time, the company dispatched car rental license No. 12314 and city license No. 4264. When the car reached the intersection of Lincoln Road, the men and women in the car shouted for the driver to stop and forced him out of the car with pistols. The driver had no choice but to leave the car. At that time, one of the robbers sat in the driver's seat and drove off. The driver waited until the car was far away and then ran to the nearby police station to report the incident. Sure enough, not long after, the robbers in the car committed the robbery on Xinzha Road. However, after the gunbattle, the robbers still managed to escape in the car. Therefore, the police station and police authorities are making every effort to investigate the whereabouts of the car. It was not until around 9:00 PM that it was discovered within the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road police station. The robbers had long since disappeared. The police station sent personnel to inspect it and took it back to the police station, notifying Yunfei Company to claim it.

### Fire Caused by Decanting Stolen Kerosene

Apprentice Wang Guisheng Severely Burned and Died; Police Closely Pursuing Fugitive Culprit Feng Huisheng

A fire broke out at the Xiangji Clothing Store (祥記成衣舖) at No. 1296 Lafayette Road (辣斐德路) in the French Concession at 2:50 PM on the 28th of last month, causing the fire to spread and burn an apprentice. The fire brigade rushed to put out the fire and sent the injured person to the hospital for treatment. It is now known that the Texaco Oil Company (德士古火油公司) in this city has had more than 1,000 gallons of kerosene stolen in succession. Although it has been reported to the police, the case has not been solved. Feng Huisheng (馮惠生), a 20-year-old man from Yangzhou, who lives in the kitchen of the Xiangji Clothing Store at No. 1296 Lafayette Road, has recently specialized in buying stolen kerosene from Texaco Company. He buys it for 80 cents per gallon and sells it for 1.05 yuan, making a profit of 15 cents per gallon in one transaction. Because the quantity is quite large, the profit is very high. At 2:50 PM on the 28th of last month, Feng opened a large barrel of kerosene in his room to decant it into smaller barrels for sale. While pouring, he accidentally spilled some kerosene, which splashed onto a nearby stove. The stove was burning, causing a sudden explosion and fire, which could not be contained for a while. The apprentice of the clothing store, Yu Guisheng (于桂生), a 14-year-old man from Shishi, was watching nearby and was burned on his head, face, and hands. Seeing that he had caused the disaster, Feng fled immediately. The fire brigade rushed to put out the fire and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital (廣慈醫院). However, due to the fire toxins attacking his heart, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 1:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall (同仁輔元分堂) mortuary. Yesterday, Wang, the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 Court, confirmed the death. The father of the deceased, Wang Anxiang (王安香), claimed the body for inspection. The French police station charged the fugitive culprit Feng Huisheng with the crimes of buying stolen goods, profiting from them, and causing death through negligence. An order was issued to all detectives to arrest Feng and bring him to justice.

### International Banker from Paris Finds Love in Shanghai Dance Hall

Secretly Engaged to 'Ciro's' Dancer, Quietly Boarded the Nagasaki Maru Yesterday Morning for Japan

The English *China Press* reports that a young international banker, Mr. Lubin Stein, recently came to the Far East from Paris on business. It is widely believed that his business involves large transactions between the Chinese and Japanese governments. He is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel in Shanghai and often visits the Ciro's dance hall on Jing'an Temple Road for entertainment. In the hall, there is a dancer, Ms. Setto, who is in her prime, beautiful and charming. Mr. Lu fell in love at first sight and gave her many gifts.

After a long time of affection,

he proposed to her, and the woman readily agreed. However, the two did not tell the hall owner about this matter. Mr. Lu only used a large sum of money to ask the hall owner to terminate the woman's contract. The hall owner refused because the woman was able to attract a general customer. Therefore, this pair of lovers secretly packed their luggage and quietly boarded the Nagasaki Maru this morning (the 3rd) and sailed to Japan at 9:00 AM. The woman's mother also went with her. The woman was still

Performing on Stage

last night, so no one knew that she was about to leave Shanghai. This morning, after the Nagasaki Maru set sail, a reporter from the *China Press* visited Mr. Kaufman, the manager of the hall. According to him, the woman disregarded the contract and eloped with her lover, which is not in line with reason. However, he sincerely wished that this pair of lovers would have an early marriage

and share happiness.

If he had known earlier that they were engaged, he would have been happy to terminate the woman's contract. It is said that Mr. Lu's father was a banker of the Russian emperor before the Russian Revolution. When his family went to Paris from Russia, they brought with them a lot of valuable jewelry. Some of these jewels will surely become the woman's decorations in the near future.

### Suzhou River Blocked Yesterday Due to Congestion

Blocked for Four Hours, Water Police Immediately Cleared It

A Suzhou dispatch states that every year at the end of the lunar year, inland villagers sail their boats to Shanghai to purchase goods and daily necessities, causing the water traffic on the Suzhou River to be frequently blocked. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the river surface was blocked again, completely cutting off traffic from the Old Zha Bridge to the New Zha Bridge. The second squadron of the water police in charge immediately dispatched patrol boats to dredge and clear the area. It was not until after 6:00 PM that the traffic was restored. In addition, the river surface under the Tianhou Palace Bridge on the Suzhou River was also congested with boats. At the same time, the Dredging Bureau's dredgers were also dredging the river channel there, which made the river channel narrower and blocked it for a moment. It was not until late at night that the traffic was dredged and cleared.

### Maid Interrogated in Qin Zhen Home Theft Case

Qin Zhen (覃振), the President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, is 50 years old and a native of Taoyuan, Hunan. His Beijing residence is at No. 20 Lujia Road, Xiaoxi Road (小西路盧家路), and his Shanghai residence is at No. 97 Massenet Road (馬斯南路) in the French Concession. His wife and son live in Shanghai most of the time. His eldest son, Qin Wen (覃文), is 8 years old this year, and his second son, Qin Wu (覃武), is 2 years old this year. Therefore, in February of last year, he hired Yu He (兪何氏), a woman from Anhui, to be a nanny, specifically to take care of his second son. Since Yu He came to the Shanghai residence, there had been thefts, but because there were many servants, it was difficult to investigate at once, and the amount was small, so no further investigation was made. Recently, valuable ornaments used by Vice President Qin, such as gold seals, gold watches, and gold chains, worth a considerable amount, were stolen again. Yang Baisheng (楊柏生), the secretary of the Qin residence, reported this to the French police station. Detectives Li Tiqing (李悌青) and Wang Wenhua (王文華) went to investigate and suspected the nanny Yu He. They took her to the police station, where she confessed after interrogation. She confessed that her husband, Yu Shixue (俞士學), had instigated the theft and that two pawn tickets were found in her clothes. Her husband, Yu Shixue, was also arrested and confessed to the conspiracy without denial. Detectives also investigated the stolen goods. Yesterday's newspaper has already reported on this briefly. Yesterday, the police station sent the defendants to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Pi Songlin (𣓾松鄰) interrogated them. Yao Zhaodi (姚肇弟), a lawyer from the police department, explained the case. Yu He confessed to the theft, while Yu Shixue denied it, claiming that he did not know about his wife's theft. The court summoned Gu Jianzhang (股建章), the representative of the plaintiff, Qin's residence, and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 6th. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Butler Steals Gold and Silver Utensils Worth 200,000 Francs

Thief Hu Yunong Arrested and Sent for Interrogation

Hu Yunong (胡雨農), a 21-year-old man from Ningbo, worked as a butler in the home of a Westerner at No. 1302 Avenue Joffre (霞飛路) in the French Concession. Recently, he suddenly became unscrupulous. On the night of the 16th of last month, while his master was out, he stole gold and silver ornaments and utensils worth 100,000 francs and fled. The owner discovered this and reported it to the French police station, requesting an investigation. Detective Ke Siqing (柯思慶) of the French police station learned that Hu was hiding in the Public Concession and that he would definitely pass by the front of the Central Cinema (中央影戲院) on Sixth Avenue (六馬路) every afternoon. Therefore, the detective Ke, along with an informant, waited in front of the Central Cinema the day before yesterday. Soon, they saw Hu walking by and arrested him, taking him back to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. The lawyer from the police department requested an adjournment for further investigation and then filed a lawsuit for interrogation. After Judge Yang (楊推) questioned the defendant, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 10th. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Nagasaki Maru Post Office

The *Japanese Daily News* (日文每日新聞) reports that the Sino-Japanese connecting ship *Nagasaki Maru* (‘長崎丸’) entered the port at 2:30 PM on the 2nd. The post office inside the ship has begun to handle postal affairs on this voyage to ensure the safety and speed of important Sino-Japanese mail delivery. The bureau belongs to the 'Uncollected and Undelivered Second-Class Post Office' and the director is directly under the Ministry of Communications and is Kusa Kabe Tsuneo (草壁經雄) from the Kumamoto Communications Bureau. The staff belongs to the Nagasaki Post Office and includes Mr. Kigai Ei-saburo (寄井營三郎), Mr. Tanaka Kane-kichi (田中兼吉), and Mr. Kata Jyun-hachiki (片潤八木). On the first day of business, postal savings were very popular, totaling 20 households. There were 500 postcards and letters sent to various countries and 250 from Nagasaki to Shanghai. The Shanghai-Tokyo route can be 11 hours faster. For example, if it leaves Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 3rd, it can be delivered to the special express train leaving the Nagasaki Dejima (長崎出島) wharf at 2:30 PM on the 4th, arriving in Tokyo at 4:00 PM on the 5th and Osaka at 9:00 AM on the 9th.

### Yongxin Fast Steamer Had Accident Near Pingwang

More Than Sixty Passengers, Only Three Rescued

A Suzhou dispatch states that the Yongxin (永新) daytime fast steamer of the Shanghai Yongshun Steamer Company (上海永順輪船公司) had an accident at 12:30 PM yesterday in the Hunshui River (渾水河) area, between Pingwang (平望) and Lili (黎里). While turning east, due to the river being more than ten feet wide and the wind being strong, the passengers also leaned to the left, causing the ship to become unstable and sink. Nearby civilian boats heard the alarm and rushed to rescue. The ship had more than 40 passengers in the cabin and more than 20 on the bamboo deck. The passengers on the bamboo deck all fell into the river. Three people were rescued by civilian boats, and six bodies (four men and three women) were recovered. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown. The ship's mate, Mao Quangen (毛泉根), drowned. Forty to fifty bolts of silk, twenty-odd suitcases, and eighty to ninety pieces of luggage were recovered. The whereabouts of the ship's accountants, Zhang Zhenfu (張眞甫) and Miao Fagen (繆發根), are also unknown. The Pingwang shipping office has telegraphed the Shanghai head office to find a way to deal with the aftermath and has reported the matter to the authorities for inspection.

The *New Voice News* (新聲社) reports that the Yongxin (永新) and Yongan (永安) steamers of the Yongshun Steamer Company at No. 458 North Suzhou Road (北蘇州路四五八號) specialize in the Shanghai-Huzhou route and depart daily. The Yongxin steamer departed from Huzhou for Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday, carrying passengers and cargo. At 2:00 PM, about five or six miles past Pingwang, it hit a reef, damaging the bottom of the ship. Because the port there is very large, deep, and wide, the ship sank, and passengers and cargo fell into the water. Fortunately, nearby civilian boats heard the alarm and rushed to rescue. Most of the passengers and crew were rescued, but the captain, Wang Jingen (王金根), drowned. The exact number of deaths is difficult to ascertain at this time. The Shanghai company sent someone surnamed Bi (畢) to the scene of the accident last night to handle the aftermath after receiving a long-distance call from Pingwang.

### Chen Chugen Sues Chen Chuxiang Case to Confirm Siblinghood

Claims voice and appearance are similar to the defendants, defendants also present evidence to deny everything

Merchant Chen Chugen, 29 years old, recently hired lawyers Yang Tianxun and Zhu Wende to sue Chen Chuxiang, Chen Chufan, and Chen Chugao, shareholders of Huacheng Tobacco Company, in the First Special District Court, seeking confirmation as brothers. The plaintiff's claim is that the plaintiff and the defendants are all sons of Zhu Wen, with the plaintiff being the youngest. After the plaintiff's birth, the defendants became jealous and tried to make the plaintiff leave the clan, eventually achieving their goal. Wenjian publicly gave the plaintiff to relatives Yao Chaolun and Yao Bao, a couple, as an adopted son, named Zhicheng. In 1922, when the plaintiff was 14 years old, Wenjian passed away, and the defendants secretly kept the plaintiff from knowing. It was not until the plaintiff was 16 or 17 years old that Yao Bao slightly revealed the truth. In 1929, Yao Bao drove the plaintiff away, terminated the adoption, and pursued the surname Guan Chupu, named Yang. Now that the plaintiff knows the whole story, he is filing a lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo Can heard the case in the Civil Division and summoned the defendants. The defendants did not appear, and a lawyer represented them. First, Chen Chugen explained the facts of the lawsuit, stating that his face and voice were exactly the same as the three defendants. This alone is enough to prove that they are indeed brothers. If the defendants deny it, a blood test should be requested. Then, the defendants' lawyer rose to protest, saying that the plaintiff was not their brother. At that time, the defendants' older sister had hired a wet nurse surnamed, and the plaintiff was born to her. Because she was hired out, she could no longer raise him herself, so she planned to give him away. Through the introduction of the defendant's older sister, he was adopted by Yao Bao as a son. Later, because the plaintiff grew up and spent money excessively, Yao Bao broke off relations with the plaintiff and gave him 15,000 yuan as a condition for separation. Afterwards, the plaintiff repeatedly litigated with her, all resulting in defeats. Therefore, he has filed this lawsuit and presented various evidences. After hearing the facts of the case, the judge ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing and ordered the defendants to appear in court in person for questioning.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Use Lottery to Reduce the Number of Rickshaws

Approved by the Board of Directors Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Council had previously decided to reduce the number of public rickshaws to 9,500 from March 1 this year. The Council announced this decision in September last year and entrusted the Council's Rickshaw Special Committee to consider the methods to implement this decision. The Committee had written to the Rickshaw Trade Association to express its views on the most fair implementation method that the Association considered for reference. However, the Association replied that it was unwilling to express its views until the Municipal Council had fully explained the reasons and intentions for reducing the number of rickshaws. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Special Committee believed that this response allowed the Municipal Council to handle the matter at its discretion and submitted the following three recommendations to the Board of Directors: 1. The Municipal Council should announce in Chinese and Western newspapers that it would reduce the number of rickshaws by 484 from February 28 this year. 2. The reduction should be decided by lottery. All public rickshaws, except for one pulled by the owner himself, should participate to ensure fairness. 3. The lottery should be held at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, February 13. The commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps should be requested to lend the Corps' parade ground and all necessary items. The lottery should be conducted jointly by the Police Department and the Tax Bureau, and the Rickshaw Trade Association should be formally invited to send two representatives to attend. The results of the lottery should be announced by the Municipal Council in a bulletin as soon as possible. The above recommendations were approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council at a meeting on February 3.

### Cotton Cloth Industry's Monthly Report Postponed for Three Months

The Cotton Cloth Trade Association previously received an order from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau to submit a monthly report form for the purchase of yarn and cloth starting in January. The Association believed that this would require hiring an employee to be responsible, which would inevitably increase expenses. Therefore, it jointly sent a letter with the related trade associations such as the Knitting Industry, the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry, and the Towel Industry to the Tax Bureau to request a postponement of implementation. However, because the reply was not approved, the Association sent representatives Ke Ganchen, Ye Xiaoshan, Zheng Hairuo, etc., together with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative Jin Runxiang to the Tax Bureau and the Unified Tax Bureau yesterday afternoon to petition. The section chief Shen Fuqiang and the deputy director Xue received them. First, the representatives stated the difficulties in filling out the form and requested a postponement of implementation in order to start preparing. Then, the section chief Shen and the deputy director Xue decided on three accommodating measures: 1. Approval is granted to postpone implementation for two months, and reporting will begin in April. 2. For each column in the form, if there are indeed difficulties in filling it out, a request can be submitted for appropriate modification. 3. The original punishment of canceling the registration of merchants who do not fill out the form is considered too severe and will be reduced.

### Night Soil Carrier Yao Qiansheng Impersonates Sanitation Worker

Forcibly Uses Zhenxin Factory Pier and Fabricates False Accusations Against a Woman

The Xinji Zhishi Powder Factory, located at 397 Jessfield Road, is organized by commercial tycoon Jin Runxiang and others, and managed by Ma Shaoquan, the former executive member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The factory is large in scale and has a thriving business. The factory had obtained a shoreline pier license from the Land Bureau for the loading and unloading of goods and built a dedicated pier for the factory to facilitate transportation. Previously, the pier had been occupied by nearby docked night soil boats, which had been strictly prohibited by the local Public Security Bureau. On January 18 this year, another night soil boatman trespassed into the pier to unload night soil. The factory workers came forward to stop them. Unexpectedly, a night soil carrier named Yao Qiansheng (also known as Xinwei) claimed to be a sanitation bureau employee and made trouble for the workers. The factory worker Xu Cheng reported to the Zhoujiaqiao Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched officers to the scene and took both parties to the station. They were transferred to the Caojiadu Sub-bureau, which ordered the night soil boats to leave the pier and strictly prohibited them from encroaching again. Unexpectedly, Yao Qiansheng used the female's fear of shame and falsely claimed that the wife of the factory manager Ma Shaoquan had committed a crime of obstructing freedom, and groundlessly filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Procuratorate of the Local Court. The factory, believing that the matter was fabricated, has legally filed a lawsuit to investigate the matter.

### Kangyuan Factory Appeal Heard by the Third Branch of the High Court

The Kangyuan Printing and Can Making Factory on Huade Road in this city and Gu Qiushui, a former porcelain department engineer, filed a case for compensation for damages. Dissatisfied with the First Special District Court's decision, they filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court approved the appeal and heard the case in the Civil Third Court at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Both the plaintiff and the defendant arrived in court on time with their lawyers. After Judge Tong took his seat, he first inquired about the appellant's intention to sue. Zhang Xiang, the representative of the factory, testified that Gu Qiushui had worked in the factory for three years since 1922 and made a lot of bad porcelain paper. Customers could not use it, so they returned the goods one after another, resulting in a loss of more than 20,000 yuan. According to the contract, the technician who made the bad goods should be liable for one-fifth of the price. Therefore, he requested that the respondent be ordered to pay the loss of 4,542.68 yuan. (Question) How do you know that the products are not good? (Answer) The porcelain paper made by the respondent is because 1. the ingredients do not match the kiln temperature of the user, 2. the patterns and colors are very blurred and dull, and there are cracks, 3. the address of the issuing office is printed on the porcelain paper on Jiangxi Road, and the Big Knife brand trademark. After Gu Qiushui was dismissed on May 27, 1935, the products made by the revised version printed the rice bowl brand trademark, and the address of the issuing office has been selected to Guangdong Road. This is clear evidence. After the testimony, the damaged porcelain paper and fired porcelain dishes were presented to the court. Judge Tong then questioned Gu Qiushui, who testified that the porcelain paper he made during his tenure was all in good condition. The reason why the temperature was not suitable was because the kiln users used different fire temperatures, which could not be regarded as a technical error. As for the return of goods, it may be due to market conditions and flower styles, so he could not bear the responsibility for compensation. (Question) Did you make the Jiangxi Road address and the Big Knife brand products? (Answer) Yes, I made them, but I have been retired for a long time and cannot admit it. Then, the appellant testified that customers also returned goods when Gu Qiushui was in office. Gu signed the word "repair" on the delivery note, and Gu also signed on the damaged porcelain paper base, which could be used as evidence. He presented the delivery note and the porcelain paper base. After reading it, Judge Tong turned to Gu Qiushui and asked, Do you admit this visa? Gu said that it was signed by me, but I really cannot afford to compensate for this loss. (Question) Are you willing to reconcile this case? According to the appellant, the loss suffered by our factory is significant, so it is not convenient to reconcile. He requested that the respondent be ordered to compensate in accordance with the agreement. At this point, because the court must conduct a detailed investigation, the court adjourned the hearing for further review.

### Two Retired Chinese Constables Connected to Robbery Case

Both Were Arrested by the Police, Awaiting Further Investigation and Interrogation

Chinese and Western detectives from the Avenue Haig Police Station previously arrested four bandits, including Luo Wenqing, who were interrogated by the First Special District Court and sentenced to imprisonment. However, at the time, Luo and others testified in court that Yang Yuchun (also known as Yang Qingchen), a Chinese constable No. 1558 from Shandong who had already retired, was also involved in the robbery of the residents of No. 45 Heyu Lane, Wuzhou Road, on December 23 last year at 7:30 p.m. The First Special Court issued an arrest warrant. Yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 p.m., Liu Qingsheng and Han Shoushan, Chinese detectives from the General Police Station, learned that Yang must pass through the vicinity of Dongyouheng Road, Tongzhou Road, so they went to wait. They saw Yang and another Shandong native, Zhang Wenxuan, coming along, so they stepped forward and arrested them together and brought them back to the police station. It was found that Zhang Wenxuan had also served as a Chinese constable in the police station, but he has now retired and should be detained. Yesterday morning, Ru Baoqi, a lawyer from the First Special Court's Criminal First Tribunal, stated the previous situation and requested permission for detention because the defendant had just been arrested and had not yet been subjected to detailed investigation, so as to investigate and prosecute the crime. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered that he be detained for one week for further interrogation.

The said lady hired a lawyer and filed a criminal self-accusation against Tan in the First Special District Local Court based on Article 229 of the Criminal Law. The court held a hearing previously, but the defendant evaded and did not appear. The hearing was postponed to yesterday afternoon, and Judge Xiao again summoned both parties to court for questioning. According to the plaintiff Shi Minren, at the beginning of the cohabitation, because the defendant was still poor, the wedding was not held. Now that he is a compradore in Dechang Foreign Company, he has married another woman and abandoned me. The defendant Tan Zhaohui also admitted that he had lived with Shi, Xiao Judge said that the crime was committed in the Chinese territory, so according to the agreement, it should not be under the jurisdiction of the concession court. Therefore, he immediately ruled that the jurisdiction of this case was wrong and waited to be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial.

### Two Acts of Righteousness in Zhuyai

— Zheng Kan Ci

Many tragedies in families are caused by misunderstandings. To dispel misunderstandings, one must rely on wisdom and utmost sincerity.

Here was a very happy family—a loving young couple, living with an adorable little baby—but since the wife fell ill, everything good changed. The husband was a very responsible schoolteacher. Even during their honeymoon period, he never left school early for even a single day. Other teachers were already home having dinner by 5 PM, but he was still at school, packing up, preparing to return home. His wife understood him very well. No matter how late he came home, she always greeted him with a smile, waiting for him to eat together. With the child, things were even better. At the time, she would first prepare the food and put it in the steamer, then carry the child to the gate to meet her husband. Sometimes, she would be so engrossed in her happiness, so carried away, that she wouldn't notice her husband approaching. But the child wasn't like her. As soon as her father rounded the corner at the alley entrance, the child would see him immediately. She would wave to her father with one hand and push her mother with the other, jumping up and down, eager to throw herself into her father's arms. At the same time, she would keep shouting, "Daddy! Come quickly! Daddy, come and hold baby!" When they got together, the wife would say to the baby, "Baby, Daddy is tired, give Daddy a kiss!" In such a fervent welcome, the husband was so happy he couldn't speak. He would stand there, letting the baby kiss him, and then pretend to tickle the baby, secretly wiping the tears from his eyes on the baby's bib. Truly, he was moved to tears with gratitude.

Once the wife fell ill, things were no longer the same. She lay in bed all day, not wanting to pay attention to anyone. She was afraid of loneliness and liked having someone keep her company. As soon as her husband went to school, she would want him to come back immediately. When she couldn't wait any longer, all sorts of doubts arose. She doubted her husband's love and feared that she would die. Sometimes, she even thought, "If I die, the baby must come with me. I can't leave a piece of my flesh in this world to suffer like Ping'er!" The thought of Ping'er terrified her, and she shivered uncontrollably.

It turned out that she had a niece named Ping'er. Ping'er's mother died when she was three years old. The following year, her father married a stepmother who treated her very cruelly. She wasn't allowed to eat her fill, and she wore the same set of tattered clothes all year round. Because this woman was fiercely shrewish, everyone in the family was afraid of her, and no one dared to protect Ping'er and offend her. At that time, Ping'er's aunt (the sick wife mentioned earlier) was still young and certainly didn't dare to offend her sister-in-law. Even when she sometimes gave Ping'er something to eat, she had to do it behind her sister-in-law's back. She would always remember Ping'er's timid, pitiful appearance. Ping'er died the second month after her aunt got married. It was said that because she accidentally broke a vase, her stepmother forbade her from eating for two days. She was so hungry that she secretly went to the kitchen to steal cat food. Afraid of being caught, she hurriedly gulped it down, accidentally swallowing a large bone that got stuck in her throat. She couldn't swallow it down or cough it up and died of cold that same day.

She usually thought about this tragedy, and who knows how many tears she shed. How much more so now that she was sick and thinking about it? Originally, having such a lively little baby could have broken the silence for the patient and made her happy, but she always thought about this terrible event. Having a little baby only increased her pain. Because she was so apprehensive, her illness naturally worsened day by day.

Because there was no one at home to take care of the patient and the child, the husband had no choice but to leave school one or two hours early every day. He thought that doing this was too much and always felt like he was bearing a great wrong, which was very difficult to endure. When he came home, everything urgently needed attention, and he didn't know which task to tackle first! The child's diaper was full of feces and urine, and she was crying to be changed. The wife's spittoon had overturned, making a mess of the bed, and she was also crying. The porridge that had been simmering in the kitchen since morning had burned and turned yellow and black, but the stove had no warmth at all. The basin of dirty clothes that had been soaking for a month emitted a foul odor that made people want to vomit as soon as they entered the house. At the same time, the three of them were wearing their last set of clothes, which were so dirty they had to be changed. ... He was dizzy and busy for half a day and half a night but couldn't manage anything. On the other hand, the wife couldn't bear it any longer and began to complain!

"Achu's (the baby's name) father! My life won't last more than a few days. Can you take care of me? Alas! I've wanted to defecate since morning, but because I can't get out of bed, I've been holding it in until now." When the husband heard this, he hurried over, helping her while saying, "You should have said so earlier!" The wife leaned weakly against her husband, saying, "Don't make sarcastic remarks. Tell me, all day long, when were you by my side? This morning, when you left, I begged, 'I'm so lonely, take a day off from school and keep me company!' You replied heartlessly, 'My responsibilities are here, I can't!' You saw how uncomfortable I was and therefore came up with an idea to deceive me, 'Good sister, you understand me, don't you know I love you the most? Endure it for me; I will definitely leave school early today. When I come back, I'll tell you stories and cheer you up.' I was so foolish, I believed your words and happily lay in bed waiting. I didn't expect to wait all day long, and it was dark before I saw you come back, and you still tried to avoid me. Okay! I know your heart!" After saying this, she began to sob.

The husband didn't have the wife's eloquence. His head was full of reasons, but he couldn't express them. When he left in the morning, he had promised his wife to come back and tell her stories and had also said a few words to comfort her, but not as pleasant as the wife had embellished it. He was in a hurry for a long time and finally managed to stop the wife's tears. He knew that now was the time to fulfill his promise of telling a story. He tidied up for his wife, made the bed, and sat on the edge of the bed, asking, "What do you want to hear?" The wife, as usual, became more gentle after venting her temper. The corners of her eyes were still wet, but there was already a smile on her face. Although the near-sighted husband couldn't see anything clearly in the dim light, he knew from her soft words that she had calmed down. She replied, "Didn't you say you would tell a story? I just love to hear stories."

"Okay, you love to hear stories, I'll tell stories; you love to hear stories, I'll find stories..." He repeated these two sentences several times, mechanically speaking the words while thinking, "What story should I tell her? Where can I find a story?" He was thinking so intently that the baby, who was sleeping at the foot of the bed, woke up and needed to urinate. He quickly turned around to hold her. After she finished urinating, she pointed to her mouth and cried, "Mommy, hungry, baby wants to eat." When the wife heard this, she quickly asked the husband, "Hasn't the baby eaten yet?" The husband yawned a long yawn before lazily replying, "She did eat, but she fell asleep after eating only half a stomach." The wife's face immediately darkened and she angrily said, "It's all because you don't know how to feed her. How could she fall asleep after eating only half? Good person, seeing that you can't come up with a story, you'd better heat up some porridge and feed her! I want to eat some too." When the husband heard that he was excused from telling a story, he felt like he had received a pardon and immediately sneaked away.

After a while, the husband brought the porridge in, but both the wife and the baby were already fast asleep. The husband didn't want to disturb them, so he put the two bowls of porridge in the rice container. At this time, the last drumbeats of the night watch had already sounded, and the husband knew it was almost five in the morning, so he quickly extinguished the candle and went to bed. The husband had just fallen into a hazy sleep when he was suddenly awakened by the wife's nightmare. She tightly hugged the husband, constantly crying "Ping'er," like she was crazy. The husband finally managed to bring her back to her senses. After waking up, the wife cried to the husband, "Touch me, I have a fever all over my body, like a hot coal. That's how Sister-in-law died, I know I'm almost there too. Alas, in the future, the baby will inevitably be a Ping'er!" After saying this, she wailed loudly. The husband understood her worries but didn't know how to comfort her. After anxiously waiting for a long time, he leaned close to the wife's ear and whispered, "What are you afraid of? In the event, in the event... I just won't remarry."

It's not known whether the wife actually heard these words because she didn't express anything and from then on entered a state of unconsciousness. At dawn, the husband still wanted to go to school, but he really couldn't separate himself, so he had to ask someone to tell the school and stayed by his wife's side all day. Some kind-hearted neighbors, hearing that the wife was critically ill, came to visit and help. In the evening, the wife passed away. Because she had been unconscious for a long time, she didn't leave any last words. The child didn't understand and thought that her mother was asleep and ignoring her, so she kept crying for her mother to hold her. After the funeral, she didn't see her mother come back and cried every day, asking her father to bring her back. Everyone said that the husband should remarry as soon as possible, but because the husband had promised his wife not to remarry, he refused to break his promise. When someone tried to set him up with a match, he declined, saying, "What wrong did the dead have against me? She only just stopped breathing, how can I bear to take another person!" He didn't dare to tell people about his determination to keep his promise and not remarry, because he was afraid people would laugh at him.

After a few days, the husband went to school to teach, but he couldn't leave the child, so he took her along. At school, the child kept crying about wanting to go home to find her mother, which made everyone uncomfortable. Some students who didn't have mothers were holding back their tears. After struggling for a few days, other troubles came. The husband was lecturing and explaining rituals, but the child sitting next to him became impatient. She would either cry to defecate or urinate, or she would doze off and fall to the ground. The husband valued dignity the most when it came to his students and couldn't bear such embarrassing things. The next day, he had no choice but to lock the child at home and no longer take her to the school. But when he came home from school, the child had cried until she was hoarse and didn't even recognize her father. He was very sad. After thinking it over, he couldn't find a way to properly place the child, so he had to listen to others and remarry. He consoled himself, saying, "Not wanting to remarry is for the sake of the child; today, wanting to remarry is also for the sake of the child. I think I can be worthy of the deceased, right?"

He was afraid that people would mistreat his child, so he searched everywhere for a virtuous woman. He didn't care about anything else, only virtue was his sole requirement. As a result, he found a woman who he thought fit his ideal. This woman was older and ugly. Because she didn't have any brothers, she had to farm herself to support her elderly parents, so she couldn't get married in time. Now that her elderly parents had just died, she was worried that she had a full belly of enthusiasm but nowhere to place it. She and the husband were from the same village and knew that he was a loyal and kind person, so when someone proposed a match to her, she agreed.

On the night the wife came to the house, after she had just removed her makeup, the husband led his child with tears in his eyes to pay respects to her stepmother. He deceived the child, saying, "Chu'er, aren't you always asking me for your mother? Now that mother has come back, why aren't you going to find her?" The child was very happy. She followed her father, shouting "Mother." Unexpectedly, when she arrived at the new house, she only saw a stranger sitting there. The child immediately became frightened and turned to leave. The husband quickly stopped her and said, "It's mother, good child, come, call her mother!" The child struggled to get out, crying, "I want to find my mother, this isn't my mother, I want to find my mother!" The husband had no choice but to carry her out.

When the husband went to bring the child in, the wife had prepared a pile of candy in the house for the child to eat. She was determined to be a good stepmother but didn't expect the child to refuse to recognize her at first sight, which disappointed her. She couldn't help but remember what her sister had said. The day before she got married, her sister told her, "Sister, I am a stepmother (her sister was also married to a widower), and I know what it's like to be a stepmother. Even if you cut out your heart and liver for the children of the previous marriage, they will treat it like dog lungs. Everyone thinks that there isn't a good stepmother. Even if you are a good person, you will be wronged." At that time, she didn't believe her sister's words. She always thought that if you treat the children of the previous marriage with a mother's heart, they will treat you like their own mother. Now that she saw even a small girl being so disgusted with stepmothers, she felt that her sister's words seemed to make sense. However, she still refused to be discouraged. She said, "Why must people treat you well, it's enough to treat people well yourself." After a while, she laughed at herself again and said, "She's just a child, what does she know? I'm being serious, what a fool!"

The wife tried her best to please the child. In less than ten days, the child became very familiar with her. The child now naturally called her "Mother" without being taught. She was very obedient. Whatever the stepmother told her to do, she would do it. Unlike when her own mother was still alive, she didn't act spoiled or stubborn so easily. She sometimes had to look at her stepmother's face, and without her stepmother saying anything, she would do things that pleased her. If someone asked her, "Who gave birth to you?" she would point to her stepmother and say, "It's mother." If someone asked her, "Who do you love the most?" she would point to her stepmother and say, "I love mother the most." If someone asked her, "Who is the prettiest?" she would point to her stepmother and say, "Mother is the prettiest." But when she was alone with her father, she would ask him with tears in her eyes, "Won't Mother (this, of course, refers to her own mother) come back? Will Mother still come back?" The father was sad for a while before replying, "Isn't Mother already back? She's with you every day, don't you recognize her?" The child didn't say anything. She was very disappointed and quietly slipped into the old house where her mother used to live. She pushed aside the heavy spiderwebs, sat on a small chair covered in dust, and looked at the old wooden bed filled with broken things, saying, "Baby won't be naughty anymore, Mother, get up, give baby a piece of candy." Immediately, she pretended to be her mother, changing her tone and saying, "Good baby, good乖乖, Mother will get up, I'll give you all the candy." At that time, the father had quietly followed and entered. When he saw this situation, he quickly picked up the child and couldn't help but feel sad and cry. The child was momentarily confused and thought her real mother had come home, and she cried and laughed, shouting "Mother" non-stop.

At that time, the stepmother was in the kitchen preparing food. When she heard the crying, she hurried out. When the child saw her stepmother, she became frightened and immediately regained her senses. The wife's nerves became oversensitive at this time, and she guessed the wrong thing. She didn't say anything and angrily ran back to the kitchen. While chopping vegetables, she muttered, "Alas! It's really a silent dog that bites people to death! Seeing that he doesn't make a sound, I always thought that he was quite satisfied with me, but who knew that he was harboring such a ghost! Have I mistreated his ex-wife's daughter in any way? Is it worth it for the father and daughter to hide in the dead person's house crying for their mother!" Now she thought of her sister's words again: "Everyone thinks that there isn't a good stepmother, even if you are a good person, you will be wronged." But she was a stubborn person and refused to admit defeat so easily. Although she was very sad, she still said, "Why must people treat you well, it's enough to treat people well yourself." She prepared the food and brought it out to eat, chatting and laughing as usual, pretending that she didn't mind at all.

From then on, the wife treated the child even more politely, giving her the best things in the house to eat and wear. Even if she did something wrong, she never said a word to her. Now that the stepmother treated her this way, it was reasonable that she should love her stepmother very much and live happily. But she was really strange. She was afraid when she saw her stepmother and was cautious all day long, without any childlike innocence or liveliness. Only when her father went to school and her stepmother went to the kitchen did she feel the freest and happiest. When she turned around and there was no one, she would push open the door of the main room and happily jump down the steps. When she ran out of the courtyard alone, she would usually sit on a small stone under the jujube tree, holding a large stone in front of the small stone with both hands, tilting her head and looking at the blue sky, wondering. The hot little jujubes fell from the tree to her side, but she was too lazy to pick them up and eat them. She now knew that her mother had not left and was not coming back; she was already dead. As for what death was all about, she certainly didn't know. However, she knew that death was equivalent to a person being hidden away forever, never being able to be with loved ones again, so she was very sad when she thought about her mother being dead. She still clearly remembered what her mother was like. Before her mother died, the two of them would often sit on two stones under the jujube tree. Her mother would peel jujubes for her to eat, and she would sing songs for her mother to listen to. When the moon came up, her father would be correcting papers under the lamp in the house, and she and her mother would still come out to the courtyard to enjoy the cool air. Although she sat very low, because her mother kept fanning her, not even a mosquito dared to bite her. She loved the moon and even more loved her mother's face. She would look at the moon, jump up and touch her mother's face, waving her arms and legs, so happy she wanted to fall down. This kind of feeling, truly, the sweetness of the jujube was not enough to describe it, the fragrance of the flower was not enough to describe it!

Her mother died, and this kind of feeling was over. Although she didn't lack clothes to wear or food to eat, she didn't know what the meaning of eating and wearing was. What she needed was deep enthusiasm and meticulous attention. Only her mother could give her these things. She had also tried to find some of her mother's good qualities in her stepmother, but she was completely disappointed. The more she missed her mother's love, the more afraid she was of her stepmother's strictness. This kind of strictness was made up of "power of control" and "negligence." Because the stepmother had the right to control everything about the child and was too lazy to care for her, the child therefore "respected and kept her distance" from the stepmother. The wife knew that the child wasn't close to her, but she didn't know the reason why. She only thought that this was the usual behavior of the children of a previous marriage towards a stepmother, so she didn't take it to heart.

When Achu was seven years old, the wife gave birth to a baby boy. The wife was determined to be a good stepmother, so she was very careful to avoid discriminating against the two children. She always deliberately tried to treat Achu better. For example, when dividing oranges, she would definitely find a big one for Achu and a small one for her own son. But strangely enough, no matter what, Achu was unwilling (perhaps afraid) to accept such preferential treatment. She would always secretly exchange it with her younger brother, taking a smaller one.

One day, Achu got sick. The wife got up several times at night to check on her, but she fell asleep as soon as she returned to bed. Not long after Achu recovered, the wife's son got sick. The wife didn't get up at night to check on him, but she was worried about his illness all night and couldn't fall asleep. It was while tossing and turning and unable to sleep that she figured out the reason. She thought, "No wonder my son is close to me and Achu isn't close to me. It turns out that I really love my own son more than I love her. When Achu is sick, I can sleep, but when my son is sick, I can't sleep. This is the proof. But this is natural instinct, how can I change it?" She thought for a long time and suddenly understood, saying, "Everything I've done in the past has been too pretentious. Because I was afraid people would say I wasn't good, everything I did was just for show. How could that be how a mother treats her child? I must change now, be realistic, truly treat her with a mother's heart, think of her in everything, and not seek for people to say good things about me."

The wife was indeed a person who was brave enough to change her ways. The next day, she changed her attitude. In the past, she didn't like people mentioning Achu's real mother the most. Even if Achu and her father sat together for a little longer, she would try to call them away, so they wouldn't talk about the past. Now that the wife knew that Achu was still remembering her real mother, she often talked to her about her real mother. She specially asked a calligrapher to write a memorial tablet for the deceased and organized all the things she had used during her lifetime, displaying them in the room where she died. When the weather was good, the wife often took Achu to visit the grave. When Achu cried for her mother, the wife wiped away her tears and comforted her kindly. Because Achu received the stepmother's consideration in everything and had the opportunity to freely express her feelings, she gradually became innocent and lively, not depressed, and didn't think about her mother all the time. She knew that her stepmother was treating her with sincerity, and her heart unknowingly turned towards her mother.

When Achu was thirteen years old, the villagers said that Achu's father was virtuous and recommended him, and the court appointed him as the magistrate of Zhuyai. Unexpectedly, he couldn't adapt to the local climate and died of illness three months after taking office. Achu, her mother, and her younger brother sorrowfully escorted the coffin back to their hometown. The people of Zhuyai, grateful for the husband's goodness, many people wore white clothes to see him off, and they refused to turn back when they reached the border.

Zhuyai was a place where pearls were produced. The government had established a law that anyone who secretly brought pearls into the country would be sentenced to death. The wife had a pearl bracelet. She knew that she couldn't take it out of the country, so she hurriedly threw it on the ground when she was about to leave. Unexpectedly, her son didn't understand and picked it up, secretly hiding it in his mother's jewelry case. When passing through the border, the border official searched it out, took the evidence, and publicly declared, "Who is the one who has broken the law and deserves to die? Speak up quickly." Achu thought that it must have been her stepmother who carelessly caused the disaster. She remembered how good her stepmother had been to her and wanted to take this opportunity to die for her to repay her. She quickly stepped forward and said to the border official, "I am the one who broke the law. This pearl bracelet belongs to my mother. My mother threw it away when she was about to leave. I couldn't bear to pick it up and put it in my mother's jewelry case. I didn't expect it to be found." When the wife heard Achu's words, she also thought that it was her daughter who had broken the law, but she couldn't bear to let her daughter die. At the same time, she thought that she wouldn't have put the pearl bracelet in a good place, it was her own fault, and she couldn't let her daughter take the blame for her. She also quickly stepped forward and explained to the border official, "I am the one who broke the law, it has nothing to do with my daughter. Because I was heartbroken and busy, I forgot to take out the pearl bracelet in the jewelry case when I was about to leave. My daughter couldn't bear to see me suffer the death penalty, so she would rather die for me, so she falsely claimed this crime." Achu cried, "It was really me who did it. Mother loves me and can't bear to see me suffer the death penalty, so she wants to take my place." The mother and daughter both vied to die. The border official and the people who were seeing them off were all moved to tears. The border official didn't want to kill good people, so he had no choice but to let both the mother and daughter enter the country.

When Achu and her mother confessed, Achu's younger brother pulled on his mother and sister's sleeves, crying wildly. He seemed to have something to say, but no one paid attention to him. By the time they entered the country, he was still crying wildly. The mother and sister came over to comfort him, and he finally had the opportunity to tell them about hiding the pearl. Everyone knew that Achu and her mother were both people who hadn't committed a crime but were brave enough to die for righteousness, so they called them the Two Acts of Righteousness in Zhuyai.

Waste Utilization of Tooth Powder Bags.  The Hua Nan Industrial Society, located at 15 Ningbo Road, French Concession, is famous for manufacturing cosmetics. Since its reorganization, it has hired several tooth powder manufacturing experts to modify the original Butterfly Facial Tooth Powder using the latest scientific methods. They also invited doctors with rich experience in beauty and dentistry to carefully research the ingredients and their functions. The aim is to ensure that the facial powder can whiten the skin and the tooth powder can whiten teeth, kill cavities, and not damage the skin or gums. The society first had its own family members try it out to prove its effectiveness before daring to introduce it to the world. To save users money, the outer bag of the tooth powder is packaged in the shape of an envelope. Although the amount of paper used is one-third more than before, which increases the cost, the society is willing to sacrifice this in order to promote sales. The selling price is still the same as ordinary tooth powder. This type of tooth powder bag is considered waste by buyers, but now that it has been changed to an envelope shape, it can be saved for sending letters. Its value is estimated to be at least two cents. However, each package of Butterfly Facial Tooth Powder costs only two national currency cents. Therefore, this envelope-style powder bag is entirely a free gift to reward buyers.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed Shen Bao Newspaper,

I am writing to you regarding a news item recently published in your newspaper concerning a lawsuit between our school and the Mu Shi Night School. This report is inaccurate. The Xu Mu Shi in question is Xu Lin-shu, also known as Chu Lin-shu. In 1930, he studied typing in the typing department of our school, as evidenced by his personally filled-out application form. He was then promoted to assistant teacher at our school and later resigned for personal reasons. Afterwards, this Xu Mu Shi enticed students from our school to open the Mu Shi Night School. Unexpectedly, in October of this year, Xu Mu Shi filed a lawsuit with the Social Bureau and the local court, using a forged diploma from the Zhenhua Typing School and denying that he was a student of our school. After our school presented various certificates and witnesses, the case was dismissed. This Xu Mu Shi, without any sense of shame, continued to forge documents and filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office, which was also rejected. We respectfully request that your esteemed newspaper uphold justice and publish this letter to correct the record.

With sincere gratitude,

Fan Ren-cai, Principal of Wu Shi Advanced Commercial English Tutoring School

### "The Story of Money" (Part II)

—Yu Po

—Commercial Press—

He gave a twofold explanation of the meaning of money, giving us a reasonable understanding of the myriad forms of money.

Following the definition, he began to describe the earliest forms of money. He said that the earliest money in the world was seashells, because seashells were ornaments and therefore could be used as money. In addition to seashells, there were also stone coins, fish teeth, animal teeth, woodpecker feathers, livestock, and tobacco, all of which could be used as a medium of exchange. Strangely, even huge stone wheels could be used as money and enjoyed a high degree of credit. Finally, he also discussed the origin of Chinese currency, from knife money and cloth money to copper coins with holes, and finally evolving into round coins. He also discussed the leather coins that were popular during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. His conclusion was that these earliest forms of money were products of civilization from thousands of years ago, but some modern, barbaric peoples still use them. His storytelling approach to explaining the earliest forms of money and their evolutionary path is quite interesting for readers who lack economic knowledge.

Next, let's take a look at the chapter "Usury - The Church and the Jews." At the beginning of the chapter, the author explains the meaning and origin of interest, and then describes the attacks by ancient politicians and religious figures on the interest generated by borrowing, viewing lending at interest as the most immoral, cruel, and inhuman act, and viewing lenders as vermin of mankind. Then, he explains that the Jews had already taken the reins of European finance by 60 BC and began to engage in the business of lending at interest. He said:

William wanted to reform this financial system and establish it on the basis of currency, without using or citing the Jews. This would allow him to obtain cash from the Jews when collecting taxes in kind. At the same time, taxpayers who only had goods and no cash could also borrow cash from the Jews to pay taxes. (See page 193)

Finally, he pointed out that under the modern economic system, lending at interest has gradually become a legal matter. This is because the current social system is built on the foundation of gold. His sociological examination of the issue of usury based on historical facts is noteworthy.

In short, this "Story of Money" has six advantages: ㊀ extensive research and citations; ㊁ simple and easy-to-understand language; ㊂ correct insights; ㊃ uses both essay and story styles; ㊄ each chapter has a summary at the beginning; ㊅ can be used as a history of money and common economic knowledge. If the author could include illustrations and photographs of various currencies, this book would be even more perfect. (End)

### Childhood Lives of Foreign Celebrities

— Jiang Si

Edited by Shen Zishan and Shen Shoubi, Commercial Press

In recent years, domestic children's literature has seen new developments, which is a common fact. Adults are trying all sorts of ways to create an environment for children to develop healthy bodies and minds, whether in school education or social education. Naturally, the publishing industry's concern for children has become even more pronounced in recent years.

The climax of the publishing industry's special attention to children's literature was often in the past year. No matter which bookstore, they had to think and plan with children in mind. On the one hand, it was the speculation of merchants, but on the other hand, it was also the main reason due to the demands of the times and the needs of children. Although this climax has gradually decreased in recent years, it is still common to see several larger bookstores continuing to publish this type of book.

Recently, I bought a copy of "Childhood Lives of Foreign Celebrities" compiled by Shen Zishan and Shen Shoubi at the Commercial Press, and I found it very interesting. I quickly finished reading it. For childhood, I think everyone has to feel that it is precious and cannot be returned. Of course, children need us to use the enthusiasm and valuable insights of adult memories to imply and stimulate them as much as possible. Moreover, because children need to be instilled with new vitality and a new ideal personality during their school years, we have to seize this period and use their hearts, which have not been tainted by the corrupt society, to provide enlightenment. For this, it is certainly urgent and appropriate for children to have a comparison with the childhoods of foreign celebrities. The Commercial Press's publication of this book must also have this intention.

The title of the book is "Childhood Lives of Foreign Celebrities," and its theme is naturally a narrative of the childhoods of celebrities. In the book, a total of twenty-one celebrities are included, and these people are certainly not strangers to us. Analyzing these celebrities, we can get the following concept: there are two writers, Shakespeare and Goethe; there are about eight or nine scientists, Edison, Newton, Franklin, Watt, Faraday, Darwin, etc.; there are also five politicians, such as Garibaldi, Lincoln, Wilson, Bismarck, etc.; great generals such as Hindenburg, etc.; and educator Froebel. A major tendency here is to favor scientists, which is an excellent hint. The editors have also done their best to write in a clean and clear style in the text, so that children do not feel bored.

However, within these advantages, I have also found points that make people think that they cannot be strongly emphasized. First of all, what readers feel is that twenty-one foreign celebrities are used to represent, which I think is not enough, whether divided by country or by era. Here, we deeply feel the lack of material. Chinese celebrities who have a place in international or historical terms have long been abandoned due to the limitations of the book's title, but there are many foreign celebrities who are just as valuable and prestigious as these twenty-one, or even higher, who are not included in the selection. These regrets should be compensated for. Secondly, I also feel that the childhood lives of figures in our current world are lacking, which makes children temporarily immersed in the figures of the past history, which should give a very bad impression.

Evaluating this booklet from a holistic point of view, I also have to say that its narrative should be based on cleanliness and simplicity, but for this kind of subject matter, it is best to make it as interesting as possible and use a pure literary style to express and inspire it. This way, the childhood lives of great people, great figures from various eras and countries, can be made into stories and made interesting. This is much better than this simple and dull booklet.

Here, I sincerely pray for a booklet of ideal and complete childhood lives of celebrities from all over the world to appear for the tens of millions of children!

### Review of the Techniques of "Gift-Giving"

— Wan Shilan

——A creative work in the New Year's issue of Oriental Magazine——

In the turbulent Chinese literary scene, the talents of all writers have been completely drowned out by people who attempt to use literature as a means to achieve certain desires. As a result, a lot of time is wasted in vain, and genuine works are often rushed to sell by writers and lack the honing of a longer period of time. It is inevitable that young people who eagerly hope to read good books feel disappointed. The so-called garden of art is always a stone field that does not produce fruit, a desert that does not grow good trees and flowers.

Recently, in the New Year's issue of Oriental Magazine, I read Wang Pingling's recent work "Gift-Giving", which made me as happy as a traveler who had been hungry and thirsty for a long time suddenly getting sweet nectar. I read it very smoothly. A medium-length story with about 20,000 words did not encounter any obstacles, forcing me to abandon the book in the middle and sigh. Instead, every section and every paragraph of the plot had a novel interest, enticing me to finish reading it effortlessly. This can be said to be a rare miracle discovered in the modern Chinese literary scene!

The plot of the story describes an accounting section chief who has maintained his position through four successive political changes. In the fourth change, he encounters a bureau chief who is determined to reform the legal system. However, the accounting section chief does not hesitate to sell his entire personality like an old official in an auction house - and tries every means to get close to the bureau chief and win the trust of his relatives. In the end, the bureau chief's good intentions to reform politics are blocked by soft constraints and cannot be realized. And our accounting section chief is still "doing well" in the fourth change. The twists and turns of this story, as well as the personalities of the various characters that appear in this story, are vividly swayed before our eyes by the author's most concise and vicious pen. Moreover, every action of the characters can make the reader guess the protagonist's psychology at the same time, and at the same time understand what tricks the people around the protagonist are playing in the environment. This kind of technique is the use of Montage technique in movies, which is three-dimensional, not half-baked. It is a way of analyzing psychology through actions, not a straightforward explanation and a boring narrative. "Gift-Giving" is indeed a new trend in the Chinese literary scene in terms of writing skills. Using Montage techniques to deal with the subject matter of works is indeed a task that writers urgently need to learn.

### "The Guangdong Spirit"

—Meng Ruo

Recently, many Japanese people, especially those who have traveled in China or worked as diplomats in China, have gradually gained a new understanding of our country. Except for some Japanese people who say that China is a "bandit country," most of them can see that the current China is no longer the China of the past. The China of the past was often called "the old, big China," while the current China is "the new China" and "the young China." Therefore, when everyone discusses Sino-Japanese relations, their conclusion is always to call on their own people to re-evaluate China and change their foreign policy. Recently, Mr. Suma, the Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, was transferred back to his country. In an interview with Japanese reporters, he said: "I have been in China for eleven years. During this time, the changes in China have been as激like raging waves. What I feel most acutely is that the 'Guangdong Spirit' is the center of the National Government and is spreading throughout the country. The characteristics of the Guangdong Spirit are an indomitable soul and the restoration of national rights."

Mr. Suma's criticism of China can be said to be pertinent. It is a conclusion he has drawn from eleven years of observation in China. The progress of China in recent years is precisely the development of this "Guangdong Spirit." Not only has China been like this for eleven years, but this spirit has already been launched since the occurrence of the revolutionary movement. We succeeded in the Xinhai Revolution by relying on this spirit, and we also succeeded in the Northern Era by relying on this spirit. As for the recent response to difficulties, the current completion of unification, and the victory of the Sui War, all are the power of this spirit. Moreover, this "indomitable soul" is, as Mr. Suma said, "deepening and expanding year by year" and will "gradually become stronger" in the future. To sum up in one sentence, the future revival of China must rely on this "Guangdong Spirit" to promote it. This is our Chinese people's self-confidence. No matter how great the difficulties we encounter, we must overcome them with this spirit so that the country can escape from danger and advance on the broad road of national revival.

Finally, I think that Mr. Suma said "Guangdong Spirit" probably because Guangdong is the birthplace of the Chinese revolution, and most of the important people in our government are from Guangdong, so he used the word "Guangdong" to represent it. In fact, this "indomitable soul" has developed to this day and has become a common phenomenon throughout the country. It can be called "the spirit of the Chinese nation." How to develop our spirit, this is what every Chinese person should strive to do.

### Healthy and Beautiful Women

—Ming Mei

Healthy and beautiful women can often arouse people's admiration and respect.

But to become a healthy and beautiful woman, she is not born healthy and beautiful. She must cultivate and temper herself at all times, and she must overcome the diseases in her body at all times...

For example, if she suffers from dysmenorrhea or has scanty menstruation, she should buy the wonderful medicine "Monthly Red" to promote menstruation and activate blood circulation. If she suffers from physical weakness and blood deficiency, or has irregular menstruation, she should buy the tonic "Women's Treasure" to nourish yin and replenish deficiency. In this way, it is not difficult to become a healthy and beautiful woman.

"Monthly Red" and "Women's Treasure" are both products of Wuzhou Drugstore, which have always been supported by female compatriots. You can understand by looking at the picture above.

### Thoughts After Watching "Sunrise"

—Li Yi

Performed by the Drama Workshop at the Carlton

Compared with "Thunderstorm", "Sunrise", apart from the structure, surpasses "Thunderstorm" in all aspects. The fate theory of "Thunderstorm" is too heavy, and the characters in it are all gloomy. Even Zhou Chong, who wants to fly to the new world, is only innocent and too soft. He has a good soul, but he has not experienced storms. As for Fang Dasheng here, his simple so-called "fool" temperament is the same as Zhou Chong, but he is much more experienced. He saw a group of people being deceived and humiliated, but he also saw a new group, like the group of workers singing earthwork songs and patiently laying the foundation. Moreover, he is not just an onlooker. He wants to fight Jin Bafu, and he wants Bai Lu to go with him. As a result, even if Bai Lu does not go, he also walks away with his head held high.

This is a gratifying progress.

The author likes to use symbols to express his theme. He repeatedly proposes that the sun rises and the darkness remains behind. But the sun is not ours, we are going to sleep. At the end, he also ends with the workers' "loud and majestic" axle song, the sunlight outside the house and the darkness inside the house. Such an ending is naturally deeply meaningful to intellectual audiences, but can the general audience understand it? This is worth discussing. "I saw a new heaven and a new earth, because the former heaven and earth have passed away" (the preface excerpted by the author before the play). Compared to "Thunderstorm", the author "saw a new heaven and a new earth". I hope and bless that he can go further like Fang Dasheng in "Sunrise" and fight against the evil forces.

Mr. Mao Dun criticized "Sunrise" and said: "This is an epitome of semi-colonial financial capital." Because of this writing, I was reminded of Mr. Mao Dun's "Midnight." Yes, "Sunrise", just like "Midnight", has cut a very accurate shadow for this semi-colonial financial capital (I remember that "Midnight" also involved national capital). Not only are the themes and materials somewhat similar, but the characters' personalities are also somewhat similar. I can't remember the names of the characters in "Midnight", but when I saw Pan Yuetai and Li Shiqing here, I immediately thought of "Midnight".

### A Group of Devils in ‘Sunrise’

## Page 20

That entrepreneur in “Midnight” and his subordinates who put in great effort during the strike wave. Of course, this is not to say that “Sunrise” plagiarized “Midnight,” nor that the characters in “Sunrise” were copied from “Midnight.” I just want to say that they have some similarities. In any case, works expressed in two different ways, even if there are some coincidences, do not detract from their artistic or social value.

Of course, “Sunrise” also has differences from “Midnight.” I remember that “Midnight” mentioned the forces behind the financial capitalists, while “Sunrise” did not. Fang Dasheng is going to fight countless Jin Bas. When he fights, he will naturally discover that behind the countless Jin Bas there is a larger supporter. But before he fights, the author did not tell the audience about the forces behind Jin Ba within the possible range, which cannot but be considered a regret.

The “Sunrise” performed by the Drama Workshop was directed by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian after being revised and agreed upon by the original author. Most notably, the third act was deleted. As for the other acts, because I haven't reread the script, I can't remember. I glanced over the ending of the fourth act and learned that A Gen (changed to A Fu on stage) was taken away, and Bai Lu's suicide was also moved to a different room. From this, one can infer that there were probably quite a few other changes as well, right?

Somehow, the impression “Sunrise” gave me on stage was not as good as when I read the script. I thought about this carefully and felt that the reason was probably because the performance was too relaxed, so it wasn't as tense as when I read it in one breath. For example, the appearance of the pitiful clerk Huang Sheng San was much more tense when I read it than when I watched it. (Of course, this cannot be entirely blamed on the actors.) Also, when reading the script, it is not easy to feel whether the play is dull or not, but it is different when watching it. Is "Sunrise" also like this? I don't think so, because what I felt here was not dullness, but relaxation. Although the problem of relaxation may also be in the script, for example, there are too many characters, and the development of the main line is hindered by interjections, etc., the lack of atmosphere is probably the responsibility of the director.

The lack of atmosphere and the actors’ unfamiliarity with the lines and effects are probably not without reason. I watched the first performance and heard cues from behind the stage several times while sitting in the balcony. And once, the actors were embarrassed on stage for a while because they were waiting for the phone to ring. All of these things made the atmosphere dissipate. Naturally, becoming proficient in the performance can make up for these shortcomings, but putting on a performance without rehearsing it thoroughly is too dangerous.

As for the actors' acting skills, I really liked Ms. Feng Zi's Chen Bailu and Gao Buxiao's A Gen. Ms. Feng Zi's character was consistent between the first and second acts, but in the third act, she seemed to have changed a bit. I thought she was too silent. Gao Buxiao's A Gen, however, gave me an unexpectedly good impression. Others, such as Cui Shiji's Pan Yueting, Ding Boliu's Fang Dasheng, Su Ling's Xiao Dongxi, Gongsun Min's Huang Shengsan, and Mo Yan's Li Shiqing, all gave me very good impressions. As for Wu Tieyi's Zhang Qiaozhi, I thought he was too fiery. Dai Lisha's Aunt Gu Ba and Li Xianjing's Hu Si were not quite enough. This may be because I had too deep an impression of these three characters when I read the script. Once they were brought to the stage, they didn't match the characters I had imagined, so I was dissatisfied.

The set was divided into two sections. I didn't think it was very good, and it even seemed a bit unreal. The breaks between acts were too long, even for a single scene. This time was wasted a bit too much. The lighting was also not good. The lack of a light source was one reason, and the sudden changes between bright and dark were also too difficult. When I read the script, when I read the last paragraph:

The pile-driving workers sang the pile-driving song in high-pitched and majestic unison (namely, "Sunrise in the east, the sky is red, to eat, you have to work"). The heavy stone pestle fell into the soil one after another. The sound transmitted to the audience's ears was a great life pushing forward, advancing forward, overflowing and filling the universe.

I thought that this effect would definitely make the play more outstanding and highlight the author's meaning, but this time it was done too badly. It was neither majestic enough nor clear enough. As a result, the power of that great life was completely lost. I hope that in the following performances, it can be enriched.

### Night on Yangma Island

— Richness

Life passed by so comfortably and peacefully. Gradually, everyone got tired of this ordinary life! Everyone wanted to adjust it a little, at least to make life a little more eventful, otherwise, it would turn people into a piece of wood.

One night, an order came down! We were ordered to sail our small fleet to the Bohai Sea to work on anti-smuggling missions in the Yantai and Longkou areas! That night, the captain and the lieutenant gave us instructions. Beautiful flowers bloomed in the hearts of every brother. This was not leaving the current sea to go to the Bohai Sea to change the air, but to resist enemies and traitors—the great anti-smuggling work! Happy and excited, every brother was full of energy. No one slept that night. Gunner Li Geng was singing 'Eighteen Touches' softly in his bed. Xiao Shuanzi sat on his bunk wiping his gun, muttering to himself from time to time. Judging from his expression, he had already made up his mind to kill the enemy!

When the red sun leaped from the east, the 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth' flag rose high in the sky in the tragic military music, reflecting each other with the sun. The whistle roared, and the chimney drew a huge line in the long sky. In this way, I joyfully left the outer harbor of 'Liugong Island' and advanced towards the Bohai Sea!

The warship stopped between 'Qiandao Island' and 'Zhifu Island.' It was said that smuggling ships often passed through this route. The anchor was dropped and vigilance began. The captain, the colonel, and the gunner Xiao Guan were all looking around with binoculars on the observation deck.

The radio operator urgently reported that an enemy smuggling ship was discovered on the sea off 'Yangma Island.' The captain immediately ordered to raise the anchor and sail to 'Yangma Island.'

At sunset, our warship sailed to the sea off 'Yangma Island.' We were out of luck! There was no sign of the enemy's smuggling ship. We communicated with the local official agencies on land, and they also said that they had not seen any. Yesterday, a Chinese ship loaded with smuggled goods docked here, but because it was protected by ×× people, the local authorities could not do anything about it. The brothers were angry! Cursing!

The boundless sea had already fallen into a deep darkness. There was no moon in the sky, and sparse stars winked, as if mocking our weakness and incompetence! Fresh air permeated the sea. The vast ocean, stretching for thousands of miles, was calm and waveless. The moving scenery, like a magician, was displaying its mysterious skills there. This was different from the night scene of 'Liugong Island' harbor. The fresh air allowed you to breathe freely, and you couldn't help but feel happy in your spirit and no longer wanted to sleep. However, the night sea, with such a great view, seemed extremely sleepy and slept quietly and steadily. At this time, all was silent, and only the sound of waves slowly flowing could be heard. It spit out the most peaceful and lovely waves, constantly gently kissing our ship's side.

In the middle of the night, a cargo ship was discovered sailing towards "Yangma Island." The captain ordered the ship to be intercepted. After shining the searchlight three times on the cargo ship that was moving, unexpectedly, the ship fired a row of shots. In the darkness, and at a great distance, it was not known whether they were aiming at us. At this moment, gunner Li Geng wanted to open fire, but the order was not to allow it.

The cargo ship turned around and sailed away. This was obviously a smuggling ship! In principle, we should have chased after it, but the captain ordered to drop anchor here. He said, 'It's better to do less than to do more.' It's not our responsibility if they don't land here!

The sea was sleeping soundly, and the stars glared at our warship.

Just as dawn broke, the radio received a report from Longkou: 'A smuggling ship has arrived here and unloaded five hundred bags of sugar, three hundred and fifty pieces of rayon, and one hundred and eighty boxes of porcelain.'

Our warship was stationed on 'Yangma Island.' The captain still adhered to the principle of 'It's better to do less than to do more' and ordered us to carry out anti-smuggling missions on the sea off this small island.

### Completion of "Gate of Flesh and Spirit"

"Gate of Flesh and Spirit," a unique creation in the Chinese film industry, has recently completed filming. It is the latest script by Zhong Shigen, the author of Humanity, City Night, Life, and Family Ethics, and is co-directed by Zhong himself and the newcomer Zhao Ce.

In addition to Lin Chuchu and Li Keng, a mother and son duo, Xiao Ying, Ge Zaozhi, Wen Rong, Wang Guilin, Gong Zhihua, and many others have been specially hired to play the main roles. The famous photographer Zhuang Guojun has been invited to be in charge of the film's photography. The set designer Zhao Fuli and various other staff members are also well-known figures, which further enhances the film's reputation.

"Gate of Flesh and Spirit" is extremely mysterious, suspenseful, tortuous, and bizarre. Its great and solemn significance and sacred spirit are unparalleled in any film. Moreover, the skillful scriptwriting and directing ensure that the film's purpose is fully realized. Almost every shot reaches its peak, directly causing viewers to feel shocked, terrified, tearful, and unable to watch.

Recently, the Jincheng Grand Theater in this city has obtained the premiere rights for the film, which will soon be shown to the audience.

### Cathay Releases "Receiving the God of Wealth"

"Receiving the God of Wealth" (3 Men On A Horse) is originally a famous stage comedy popular in Europe and America. It has been staged on Broadway for more than two years, and the box office is still very crowded, which shows that the play is indeed attractive. Warner Bros. has now brought the play to the screen to introduce it to movie fans all over the world, and Melvin Leroy, the great director of "Outlaw," has been appointed to direct the film. Warner Bros.'s emphasis on this film is evident here. The content is very rich in jokes, and witty remarks can be picked up everywhere. It is a comedy that has not been seen on the screen for ten years. The protagonists are Frank McHugh and Joan Blondell, one being silly and the other being idiotic, their performances are lifelike and hilarious. The film will be released at the Cathay Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre starting today.

### "Mourning for a Pair of Mandarin Ducks" Plays to Packed Houses

Yesterday was the first day that the Lu Qiqi Drama Troupe performed "Mourning for a Pair of Mandarin Ducks" at the Grand China Hotel Theater on Fourth Road, and the number of tickets sold broke records. The play is sad and suspenseful, and every act is moving. The leading actors, such as Wu Meimei, are known for their skill in performing tragedies. This time, their performances were particularly brilliant and realistic, deeply touching. Many audience members were overwhelmed with grief and shed tears. The sequel will be performed tomorrow after the original.

### Qianjiang Capsizing Tragedy

The Qianjiang Railway Bridge is one of our country's great engineering projects. Recently, due to the approaching deadline, work was carried out day and night. Unfortunately, at midnight on the 24th of last month, the small boat transporting bridge workers suddenly capsized due to negligence. It was late at night, and rescue was not possible in time, resulting in the drowning of more than 100 workers in the river. The tragedy was unbearable to hear. This is a part of the corpses recovered at the shore the next day.

After performing "Nora" and "The Inspector General," Shanghai amateur actors recently made their third public performance at the Carlton Theatre. The plays performed were Tolstoy's original work, Ouyang Yuqian's translation and adaptation of "The Power of Darkness" (renamed "Demon of Desire"), Ostrovsky's "Thunderstorm," and Oakse's original work, Shen Xiling and Song Zhi's translation and adaptation of "Shunov and Peacock" (renamed "Living in a Dream"). These are all world-famous plays. The appropriate allocation of actors, the artistic nature of the set design, the sound effects, and the harmony of the lighting are more advanced than the previous two performances. The popularity of ticket sales is no less than that of the Forties Drama Society's performance of "Sai Jinhua." As a prelude to the drama movement in 1937, this achievement is, of course, a joyful message that gives great excitement to those who pay attention to social culture.
