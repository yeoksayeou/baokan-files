### Silver Stored in Shanghai Branch of Bank of Japan Should Be Handed Over to Our Country

—Advocacy of Kodama and Others— Tokyo Observes Sino-Japanese Cotton Industry Cooperation as Important Mission of Kodama and Others’ Trip

(Tokyo) According to today's Chugai Business News, although Kodama Kenji and his delegation are said to be visiting China for reciprocal visits and to attend the Sino-Japanese Trade Association General Assembly held in Shanghai, and therefore did not bring any specific plans, they are paying close attention to the question of whether general cooperation on the cotton industry and cotton planting can be successful. This is because the cotton issue is actually the key to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Regarding this matter, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Japan Textile Association, and the Japan Textile Industry Association in China have exchanged opinions several times, and thorough preparations have been made in various aspects. The reason why three cotton industry representatives have joined this trip is precisely because of this.

The newspaper continued that improvements in cotton seeds and increased cotton yields must also be noted. Regarding this matter, Japanese officials have already consulted with the Chinese Cotton Industry Control Commission several times.

### The White-Hot Military Expansion of Germany and France (1)

— Xiao Ke

Since January 30, 1933, when Hitler, backed by the power of the Nazi Party, seized political power in Germany, Germany has gradually abandoned the unequal Treaty of Versailles and resumed military buildup. On March 7th of last year, Germany violated the Treaty of Locarno and marched into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. As a result, France had to mobilize its troops and station them day and night in the Maginot Line tunnels for defense. It is said that the Maginot Line is about 50 meters deep and fully mechanized internally. It is said that from a distance, it seems like nothing, but as soon as enemy troops approach, machine guns and cannons will emerge from the ground. In terms of the strictness of defense, it is no exaggeration to say that even birds cannot fly over it. German military experts generally believe that the next war will benefit from speed, launching a surprise attack, destroying everything of the enemy in a short time, and then achieving victory. No wonder France is particularly cautious in its defense of the Rhineland, striving for utmost thoroughness. In addition to regularly stationed troops, the Maginot Line, fearing that it would not be able to resupply in time once war breaks out, concentrates healthy residents of nearby villages in the line every week to familiarize themselves with the use of machinery, the location of military equipment storage, etc., so as to avoid panic and delays in an emergency. In order to increase the efficiency of mobilization during wartime, the French military authorities have also pre-stored all uniforms, firearms, and equipment for reserve troops in designated locations, so that they do not need to go to the barracks to concentrate and prepare everything when war breaks out, which can avoid wasting time, and only need to go directly to the designated location.

Since Hitler expanded his military and actively violated various international treaties, international relations in Europe have been extremely tense. The conclusion of the so-called New Locarno Pact had long been publicized internationally, but due to changes in the European political situation, Germany and Italy approached each other due to the resolution of the Austrian issue, and their foreign policies seemed to be highly consistent, using this to coerce Britain and France. Furthermore, due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the surge of Fascist forces, the New Locarno Conference was repeatedly postponed and is now indefinitely delayed.

Little did people know that one wave subsides internationally, and another rises. When Hitler was relaxing in his Borchtesgaden villa, contemplating the snow-capped Alps, he was considering his world-shaking plan, which was announced on August 26th of last year, extending the mandatory military service period from one year to two years. As a result, the number of German standing army troops, since last October, must have exceeded at least 1.2 million. (Before the extension of the military service period, it was about 800,000, of which soldiers of the 1914 class accounted for 450,000, and the other 350,000 were professional soldiers. The 1935 class was the first year with the most severe shortage of soldiers during the war, but there were still 300,000 to 400,000 people, plus 200,000 to 250,000 policemen undergoing military training at the same time, totaling up to 1.5 million people.) The severity of Germany's extension of the military service period to France is self-evident. The number of standing army troops in France is only 400,000 (including 80,000 professional soldiers). Last spring, the French government also requested the parliament to temporarily extend the military service period to two years due to the lack of conscripts in the 1915 class in order to maintain the number of standing army troops. Therefore, after the news of Germany's military expansion spread, French Prime Minister Leon Blum and Minister of National Defense Daladier immediately convened the General Staff for a joint meeting to discuss countermeasures. As a result, there are only two ways to deal with the threat of German force: first, extend military service to two and a half or three years. This method is considered too costly and unpopular with the people, and there is no possibility of implementation. The second method is to strengthen the mechanization of military equipment. Therefore, it was decided to increase its effectiveness in terms of both the quality and quantity of military equipment.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Consistency in Foreign Policy

— Xing

On the same day that the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato held his inaugural ceremony in Tokyo, the National Government, based on the decision of the Central Political Council, announced that Dr. Yu Longhui would be the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Japan and China both have new foreign ministers at the same time. At a time when Sino-Japanese relations have become the focus of the world's attention, changes in the future foreign policies of China and Japan will naturally cause various speculations and assumptions. However, the rise and fall of personnel has little to do with the basic foreign policy of a country. Dr. Yu Longhui issued a statement on the 4th, saying that future foreign policy should continue to advance based on the central government's established policies and the principles declared by the central authorities after the Fifth Plenary Session. Sato announced in the Diet that a country's foreign policy should not be changed frequently but should maintain some continuity. We believe that a foreign policy is based on the two factors of the country's needs and the international environment. If these two factors do not change, the change of personnel in charge of foreign affairs has a very subtle impact.

Over the years, the Chinese government's exercise of foreign affairs powers has gradually formed a fixed system. The Kuomintang's foreign policy has a certain path after being expounded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the leaders of the party and the country and announced by the supreme meetings of the past. In particular, the recent Third Plenary Session made a correct decision on the policy that should be adopted in Sino-Japanese diplomacy. And this decision, the Chinese people, expressed deep sympathy. The duties of the Minister of Foreign Affairs are to handle international relations and all matters related to overseas Chinese, foreign residents, and Sino-foreign commerce, etc. The final decision-making power of foreign policy lies with the Chinese Kuomintang. Because the current Provisional Constitution stipulates that the central ruling power is exercised by the Chinese Kuomintang. Therefore, the Central Political Council of the Kuomintang is actually the supreme power organ that decides foreign policy and supervises foreign administration. This agency is responsible to the Central Executive Committee itself. And the National Government is responsible to the Central Political Council, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is just a branch of the National Government.

Moreover, all parts of the National Government are responsible for supervising and controlling the implementation of foreign policy. As far as the Executive Yuan is concerned, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is directly responsible to the President of the Yuan. The minister is only a subordinate of the President of the Yuan. Now that the President of the Yuan has not changed, there is naturally no question of a change in foreign policy. Secondly, the Legislative Yuan also has considerable control over foreign affairs power. According to the provisions of the National Government Organization Law, the power to decide on declarations of war, peace talks, and other important international matters lies with the Legislative Yuan. All international agreements and treaties that fall within the scope of the Legislative Yuan must be resolved and announced by the Legislative Yuan, otherwise, the Legislative Yuan has the responsibility to raise inquiries. As for the Supervisory Yuan's supervision of foreign affairs power, it is even more obvious. Because the Supervisory Yuan is the highest supervisory organ, if the Minister of Foreign Affairs has any illegal or dereliction of duty, he can of course be impeached. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed the Sino-Japanese Shanghai Truce Agreement in the twenty-first year, the Minister of Foreign Affairs was impeached by the Supervisory Yuan, which is a clear example.

Therefore, the change of the Minister of Foreign Affairs has no great relationship with the direction of foreign policy. We hope that the government will maintain the consistency of diplomacy. We hope that the new Minister of Foreign Affairs will work hard with the aim of national self-preservation and international equality, using the opportunities of the times.

### Western Powers Reach Compromise on Supervision Plan

Portugal Makes Three Concessions to Russia, Details Pending Discussion; Implementation Expected This Saturday After Assembly Approval

(London) The Non-Intervention Committee, which is responsible for drafting the final details of the plan to monitor the Spanish coast and borders, met for ten hours yesterday and reached an agreement late at night on all issues concerning the implementation of the monitoring plan. The entire committee will be asked to meet on Monday to accept the recommendations of the subcommittee so that the first phase of the land and sea monitoring plan can be implemented immediately. The subcommittee spent a long time considering the report submitted by the naval experts' special meeting on the naval monitoring plan. According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Times, it now appears that Dutch Vice Admiral Graff will be appointed as the administrator of the joint land and sea monitoring plan. According to the monitoring plan, an international office will be set up to implement monitoring on behalf of the 27 countries, and the chairman will be elected by the Non-Intervention Committee. The remaining representatives will be selected by the governments of the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. A total of 500 monitors are needed for the Spanish coast, 130 British monitors are stationed on the Spanish-Portuguese border, 130 international monitors are stationed on the French-Spanish border, and 5 monitors are stationed on the Gibraltar-Spanish border. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch dated the 7th)

(London) The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee has decided that the implementation of the Spanish land and sea border monitoring plan should be postponed to the 13th of this month. (Originally scheduled to start at midnight today) (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 6th)

(London) The subcommittee of the Committee on Adjustment of the Spanish Civil War met at 3:30 PM yesterday and did not disperse until 11:00 PM. It reached an agreement in principle on the Spanish land and sea border monitoring plan and completely revised a method of establishing an international agreement by participating countries. The content is: ㊀ Participating countries agree to send warships to designated locations, ensuring that they arrive on the 13th of this month. The land border monitors should also go to the designated locations on the same day. ㊁ The entire monitoring plan must be effectively implemented only after the maritime monitors (i.e., those who implement monitoring on ships sailing to Spain in various countries' seaports) arrive at the designated locations and are able to perform their duties. In addition, the subcommittee has determined to appoint former Chief of Staff of the Dutch Navy, Admiral Graff, as the Director of the London General Office, British Vice Admiral Yue Lifu as the Director of Sea Monitoring, and Dutch Colonel Lunen as the Director of Monitoring on the French-Spanish border of the Pyrenees. The Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on the 8th of this month to approve the above monitoring plan. However, there are still three details that must be approved by the governments of the Soviet Union, France, and Germany before they can take effect. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether the plenary meeting can approve it at that time. The three details are: ㊀ the monitoring of the Canary Islands of Western Spain (now in the hands of the Nationalist Army), ㊁ the tonnage tax that should be paid by all ships under monitoring should be paid by the General Office instead of being borne by the shipowners, ㊂ the monitoring costs that should be borne by each country should be paid in currencies other than marks. Furthermore, the implementation of monitoring on ships leaving the League and sailing to various ports in Western Spain is the focus of the dispute between Portugal and the Soviet Union, and it is also a major difficulty for the subcommittee. Portugal opposes the implementation of monitoring in Lisbon and Madeira because it does not want Soviet ships to anchor in those ports. The Soviet Union has protested this. After Portugal expressed concessions, the Soviet Union withdrew its protest, and finally, Lisbon and Madeira were used as monitoring locations according to the original plan. According to the situation of the subcommittee's meeting yesterday, it was very strange that many ambassadors used long-distance telephones in the conference room to ask for instructions from their respective governments. This is unprecedented. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 7th)

### Argentine Embassy to Spain Moves to Valencia

⊙Madrid After the Argentine government moved its embassy to the city of Valencia, the current Chargé d'Affaires, Urdasar, will be promoted to Ambassador and will go to Paris soon, and then to Valencia to take up his new post. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch)

### Spanish Rebel Army Concentrates Forces to Prepare for a Major Offensive

Artillery Battles Occur in the Western Suburbs of the Capital; Government Orders Unification of Military Power

⊙Madrid Our correspondent Roling reports that the Nationalist Army is now concentrating large numbers of soldiers in the area around the Kalama River in the southeast of the capital and the area around El Bardo in the northwest. Moradat, a town near the Kalama River, is particularly heavily fortified. A major offensive is expected to launch at any moment. The offensive is roughly divided into two routes: one route is on the south side of the capital, attacking the highway from Madrid to Valencia, and the other route starts from the towns of Las Rozas and El Plantivo in the northwest and attacks the capital. The government army artillery units launched a fierce bombardment on the rear of the Nationalist Army positions this morning, intending to prevent them from concentrating. The Nationalist Army immediately returned fire, and the artillery battle lasted until the afternoon. In addition, twelve strike aircraft of the Nationalist Army also bombed the government army positions in the morning, but were quickly forced to retreat. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 6th)

⊙Valencia The Kalama front line seems to be about to have a decisive battle. It is rumored that General Lano, the commander of the Nationalist Army who captured Malaga, is now concentrating his troops in an attempt to launch a major offensive and control the main road from Madrid to Valencia. Therefore, the government army launched a fierce bombardment with artillery at dawn, which lasted for four hours. The Nationalist Army also returned fire after one hour of fighting. At that time, twelve Nationalist Army bombers, assisted by several fighter planes, bombed the government army positions. Before long, the government army planes took off to fight, and the enemy planes retreated. At the same time, the Spanish government has ordered the merger of foreign volunteers and Republican volunteers in the government army's telegram to unify military power. From then on, the international brigades will no longer operate independently under the command of their commanders. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch dated the 6th)

⊙Madrid Before midnight last night, the rebel army launched a fierce offensive on the front line of the University City, attempting to seize El Bardo. At the same time, a wall of the hospital building suddenly collapsed, causing a squad of rebel soldiers to be crushed to death and creating a 165-yard gap in the rebel army's encirclement line around the capital. Today, the rebel army issued a communiqué in Talafanla, denying that the government army had reached the outskirts of Toledo. The government army headquarters ordered the requisition of all civilian gas masks for the use of the troops defending the capital, and ordered special vigilance on the central front line to prevent the rebel army from launching a general offensive. It is reported that 25,000 troops who will launch a general offensive on the capital will arrive one after another. (National Telegram dated the 6th)

### Twelve Italian Divisions Preparing to Go to Spain to Assist in the War

News Reported by French Newspapers

(Paris) After the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War decided to postpone the implementation of the Spanish land and sea border monitoring plan to the +3rd of this month, some newspapers here were deeply concerned that Italy might send troops to Spain before the sea monitoring plan is implemented. The Business Daily published an article by Mrs. Tabui, which briefly stated, "The Italian Army has four corps, each corps has three divisions, and they are now preparing to depart. The country is doing its utmost to assist the Spanish Nationalist Army, which is the most intense this time. This news comes from an eyewitness, the same person who reported three months ago that Italy sent 60,000 troops to Spain (which has now been proven to be true)."

### Hungary's Right-Wing Coup Plot Discovered

Prime Minister Handles Situation Effectively; Suppresses the Disorder Before It Takes Shape

⊙Budapest Although the official has not confirmed the joint uprising of far-right groups in Hungary, the huge changes in the political situation are almost inevitable. Fortunately, Prime Minister Darányi handled the situation effectively and was able to contain it. In Hungary, there are recently the National Socialist Arrow Cross Group, the Sickle Cross Group, the Nationalist Group, the Turul Group, and the Movement Group, all of which are far-right groups that have planned unrest, attempted to seize power, and received financial support from a certain country. The government authorities were aware of this and have repeatedly consulted and decided on measures to maintain law and order and stop it. Prime Minister Darányi also delivered a speech to the National Unity Party in this city yesterday, stating that "Regardless of whether it is internal or external, adventurous actions are not allowed. The government has decided to maintain law and order and has the strength to do so." In addition, the Hungarian Police Commissioner Ferenc resigned at this time, and the German Minister to Hungary, Macgansen, also left Budapest at the same time to travel to Greece.

⊙Budapest Although the racist Movement Group's plot to launch a coup has been discovered, its secrets have not yet been fully revealed. In general, this conspiracy is still brewing, but the measures taken by the authorities to quell the unrest are also kept secret. What is known is that Police Commissioner Ferencz has resigned, and his confidant Hedeny will probably also resign. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 6th)

### Nazi Party Dominates Danzig City Council

⊙Free City of Danzig The Social Democratic councilor of the Free City Council, Brier, was recently arrested by the Nazi authorities of this city and detained for a long time. He has just been released, but he has been forced to give up his seat and sign a declaration allowing him not to engage in political activities again. His vacated seat will be taken over by the Nazi Party member Grossman. Currently, the Nazi Party occupies 46 of the 72 councilors in the city council, which is close to the statutory two-thirds, namely 48 seats. Once this number is reached, the constitution of the Free City can be amended legally. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch dated the 6th)

### The Japanese Diet Session Is Expected to Pass Peacefully; The Foundation of the Hayashi Cabinet Is Solid

Budget Bill Expected to Pass the House of Representatives Today; Confrontational Situation Between Political Parties and the Military Eases

(Tokyo) Japan's unprecedentedly huge budget, estimated at approximately 2.8 billion yen, was approved yesterday by the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. Except for an increase in subsidies to local governments, the original proposal was not modified. This was the expected result and is not surprising. Although the Seiyukai and Minseito parties attached a joint warning of four points, this move was only to maintain the face of the political parties. As for the movement to reform policies, the political parties themselves are full of sores and carbuncles and have no ability to fight again. After the adjournment of the Diet, the injury will become even more serious. The Social Masses Party and the Toho Society fundamentally opposed the budget, but the views of the two parties differed. The former opposed it because of the huge military expenditure and tax increase plans, which increased the pressure on the people, while the latter opposed it because the current budget could not fully express the policies of the Hayashi Cabinet. Now that the budget has been approved by the Budget Committee, it should soon be safely passed by the plenary session of the House of Representatives. After it is approved by the House of Representatives, it seems that it will not encounter much opposition in the House of Peers. Therefore, there is no doubt that this session of the Diet will be able to adjourn at the end of March without any waves. The future political trend depends on the development of various forces after the end of the Diet's work. At present, the foundation of the Hayashi Cabinet seems to be more solid than when the cabinet was first formed, but there are still many internal contradictions. It is doubtful whether the cabinet can completely overcome the difficulties. The political development after the adjournment of the Diet will definitely be more noteworthy and more important than the political trend during the Diet session. (Central News Agency dispatch dated the 7th)

### Premier Hayashi Discusses Future Measures

Reforming Administrative Organs is Imperative; No Need to Imitate British Party Politics

(Tokyo) The budget for the Showa 12th year has already been decided upon by the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 6th and is expected to pass the House of Representatives safely on the 8th before being sent to the House of Peers. It is now certain that the Hayashi Cabinet will overcome the difficulties in this session of parliament. Premier Hayashi discussed the government's future policy at his official residence last night, as follows:

㊀ The Minister of Education Issue: We are seeking a full-time Minister of Education promptly, but after much consideration, we have not yet found a suitable candidate. Whether we should seek someone from academia or any other field is not restricted. We plan to find someone who is suitable for the cabinet. A decision should be made soon.

㊁ The Full-Time Issue for Ministers of Railways and Colonial Affairs: The full-time appointment of the Ministers of Railways and Colonial Affairs is related to the issue of reforming administrative organizations. Whether to proceed with this again has not yet been decided.

㊂ The Issue of Administrative Organization Reform: Reforming administrative organizations is planned to be implemented after consultation with key personnel. Whether to handle this matter through the current Investigation Bureau or whether to expand the functions of the Investigation Bureau is being considered. As for whether a so-called General Affairs Agency is necessary, it is currently under study. The previous cabinet's plan for a General Affairs Agency emphasized managing personnel and budget matters, but it created an overly powerful situation, which has its drawbacks. Therefore, careful consideration is needed. While the organization of an Economic Planning Headquarters is necessary, whether it should be a key department or a larger-scale organization is being considered.

㊃ Working with Political Parties: When I formed the cabinet, the confrontational state between political parties and the military was quite sharp. Even selecting cabinet members required them to leave their parties. However, recently, both sides have reached a point of mutual reflection, so the relationship between the two sides seems to have eased somewhat. I believe that there is no hindrance if it is a political party that is not biased towards party interests, but I do not think that the party politics of Britain, where the two major parties control power, is necessary. There is no need to immediately apply foreign-style politics to Japan because Japan has its own unique politics.

㊄ Extraordinary Session of Parliament: This parliamentary session does not have time to promote the realization of the unique policies of the current cabinet, so it may be possible to convene an extraordinary session of parliament. The ministers of each ministry are currently studying appropriate plans, but because the next parliamentary session is being held early, it is not yet possible to predict whether preparations can be made properly.

㊅ Policy Issues: Establishing an industrial plan that corresponds to the national defense plan is an urgent issue. It is also necessary to have thorough policies on price controls and stabilizing the lives of the people.

Issues such as increasing the salaries of lower-level officials are also issues that should be considered, but due to financial considerations, it is necessary to listen to the opinions of the Minister of Finance to study them. (Kyodo News, 7th)

### Tokyo Women's Association Invites Madame Chiang Kai-shek

A Joyful Meeting in May

(Tokyo) This year marks the 20th anniversary of Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling)'s graduation from Wellesley College in the United States. The university deeply admires Madame Chiang's courageous act of personally saving her husband during the Xi'an Incident and has awarded her an honorary doctorate in philosophy. The presentation ceremony is scheduled to be held in June this year. The Tokyo United Women's Association learned of this and, led by Chairman Yayoi Yoshioka and Hideko Inoue, plans to invite Madame Chiang Kai-shek to land in Japan on her way to the United States, where the association will host her in the hope of clarifying Sino-Japanese relations. On the 3rd of this month, they entrusted Ms. Ikuko Shimizu, a member in China, to deliver the invitation to Madame Chiang. The invitation praised Madame Chiang's actions and stated that women across Japan eagerly look forward to meeting her and requested that she stop over in Japan on her way to the United States. The Women's Association is now awaiting Madame Chiang's good news and expects to welcome Madame Chiang Kai-shek to Japan in May for a joyful Sino-Japanese exchange. (Kyodo News, 7th)

### France Implements Financial Policies, Urges People to Cooperate

Premier's Radio Address Clarifies Significance; National Defense Bonds Scheduled for Issue This Wednesday

(Paris) The national defense bonds to be issued by the government will begin to be issued on Wednesday (the 10th). All departments under the Ministry of Finance are spending today organizing the regulations for these bonds, which are expected to be announced around the morning of the 9th so that the public is fully informed. (Central News Agency, Geneva, 7th)

(Paris) Premier Léon Blum gave a radio address tonight explaining the significance of the financial measures taken by the government yesterday and calling on the people of the country to enthusiastically contribute by purchasing national defense bonds. The following is an excerpt of the speech: The Premier first stated that although the financial situation of France, as described by French and foreign figures, is grim, it is necessary to pay serious attention to this matter. If we adopt superficial methods of treating the symptom rather than the cause, many malpractices will result. It is necessary to address the root cause for a permanent solution. The purpose of the financial measures taken by the government this time is to do just that. The main reasons for France's financial difficulties are two: one is due to the economic panic, and the other is due to the tension in the international situation. The government's proposed solution is to use effective means to resolve these two difficulties, improve the economic situation, and hope for a revival of public finance. The recovery of the French economy has already begun to show signs, but the recovery of public finance alone is slow. This is not surprising. Those who do not understand this believe that France's financial situation is on the verge of collapse and are deeply concerned that the government will take extreme measures, such as devaluing the currency again or managing foreign exchange. They even express doubts about whether the national treasury can meet its debts. The people lack confidence in the government's finances, and as a result, capital flows out, and foreign exchange speculation becomes a trend. From this, it can be seen that financial difficulties directly affect the stability of the currency. This is why the government, in order to treat the root cause, must simultaneously consider the financial situation and the currency situation.

As far as France's financial situation is concerned, it is sufficient to meet its debts and there is no fear of exhaustion. The total amount of the national treasury's deficit is about 360 billion francs, plus the British loan of 40 billion francs (i.e., the 40 million pounds loaned by the twelve London railway companies to France, which is equivalent to the above amount in francs), for a total of 400 billion francs. However, since January of this year, the government has already repaid 80 billion francs, and the remaining deficit is no more than 320 billion francs. The government has now decided to reduce various temporary expenditures by 60 billion francs, leaving a deficit of 260 billion francs. Part of this amount is due to railway losses, which should gradually decrease in the future. For this reason, even if the tax situation is at its worst, the amount of the deficit will not exceed the total amount of the government's revenue. Moreover, 50 percent of the final remaining deficit (260 billion francs) is for temporary expenditures for national defense funds. Therefore, the government has decided to issue a large number of national defense bonds to inject funds. These bonds will be issued within days, with denominations in francs, dollars, and pounds, representing the currencies of the three signatory countries of the Anglo-American-French Currency Agreement. Therefore, the bondholders can be protected, and even if the exchange rates between the three countries fluctuate, there is no risk of loss. Those French people who export funds abroad do so only to avoid the risk of the franc falling in value. Now the national defense bonds are available in francs, dollars, and pounds, allowing people to choose, so there is protection against the risk of currency devaluation, both now and in the future. Those who have funds abroad will not be able to find an excuse to refuse to buy the bonds. For this reason, the government expects that after the issuance of the national defense bonds, a large amount of exported funds can return to the country. If so, the foreign exchange market will change its original situation. To achieve this goal, the government has decided that from now on, the import and sale of gold will be free. (According to previous regulations, people who had cash in the country or abroad had to report it to the government, and the government would extract the value increased by the franc's devaluation. This measure will be abolished in the future.) In addition, Premier Blum repeatedly stated that the government has decided to abide by the Anglo-American-French Currency Agreement and that all mandatory measures, such as the foreign exchange management system, should be avoided.

The second part of the Premier's speech concerned the reduction of government spending, stating that the total reduction amounted to 60 billion francs, which would be reduced from various temporary expenditures such as national defense expenditures, public works expenditures, subsidies to local governments, subsidies to several railway companies, and construction expenditures of various post offices. Other parts of the budget have not been changed, and all public works that have already begun must be completed and will never be abandoned. Finally, the Premier stated that the main purpose of the government's decision yesterday was to make the funds flowing out of the country return to the country. Therefore, the government must create various situations so that the return of capital to the country can obtain benefits. In addition, the government should take all possible measures to prevent the outflow of funds, but all mandatory measures, such as foreign exchange management, should be avoided because these measures are contrary to France's foreign policy. He also said that the government's past achievements have strengthened domestic and international peace and restored the economy, which is the only way to reduce government spending. His conclusion was: "We do not want to engage in war again. At this time, what we are calling for is to concentrate the power of the whole country. The government that is issuing this call to the whole country today is worthy of the trust of the people and is not ashamed. This is what I dare to say." (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)

### French Government Rushing to Draft Bills

Requesting Congressional Authorization to Issue National Defense Bonds

(Paris) Rumors have it that the total amount of French national defense bonds will be 100 billion francs, with a fixed interest rate of 4%. It was originally scheduled to be issued tomorrow, but due to legal issues, it will be changed to Wednesday. The government feels it is necessary to ask Congress to approve the amendment to the financial law passed last October, so it is rushing to draft bills to submit to the Senate and the House of Representatives for approval so that the government's decisions can take effect. (Reuters, 7th)

(Paris) The government is now scheduled to submit a bill to the House of Representatives on Tuesday (the 9th of this month) requesting authorization to issue national defense bonds, along with a foreign exchange guarantee (referring to the fact that the bond is denominated in francs, pounds, and dollars, and that the principal of the pound and dollar bonds will be converted into francs at the exchange rate of the pound and dollar against the franc at the time of repayment). The House Finance Committee will meet on Tuesday morning to review the bill, and the Senate Finance Committee will meet on the same day in the afternoon to review it so that the government can issue the bonds on Tuesday (the 10th of this month). According to sources responsible, Finance Minister Olivoir discussed the issuance of bonds from a legal perspective with Roueff, a member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, and Alex, the dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris, this morning, and discovered several difficulties that should be resolved. In addition, the government will also ask the House of Representatives to authorize the government to: ㊀ denominate the bonds in francs, pounds, and dollars; ㊁ modify the system of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund (referring to expanding the organization and ordering it to monitor the domestic bond market). Finally, the government will submit an amendment to the currency law to abolish the provisions prohibiting the sale and purchase of gold and ordering people to report their gold holdings. It is learned that when the House Finance Committee meets to review the National Defense Bond Bill, Finance Minister Olivoir will personally attend to explain it and submit a report on the state of the Treasury's revenue and expenditure, pointing out that the Treasury's revenue is the lowest in February each year, but the revenue in February of this year was actually higher than the budget figure. Regarding the issue of national defense bonds, most members in the House of Representatives lounge believe that the bill proposed by the government will definitely be passed, and the issuance of the bonds will also be satisfactory. Premier Léon Blum, Defense Minister Daladier, and Interior Minister Tourmo have recently jointly issued an order to the governors of all provinces across the country to organize committees within their borders. All members of the organization, regardless of political affiliation, as well as members of provincial and municipal councils, civil and military officials, and representatives of business associations, should be ordered to join the committee to jointly study various methods of selling national defense bonds to observe their success.

### Rumor of Understanding Reached Between the U.S. and France

Allowing Americans to Invest in France Does Not Contradict the Johnson Act; French Ambassador Visits U.S. Treasury Secretary

(Paris) Unofficial sources here said today that U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has reached an understanding with French Premier Blum to allow U.S. banks to invest in French national defense bonds, which will not contradict the U.S. Johnson Act prohibiting loans to countries in default. It is understood that if French bonds are repaid in U.S. dollars or British pounds, the U.S. government will not object to banks notifying customers to purchase them, but banks may not purchase them directly. Experts here believe that if Americans automatically remit their private funds to Paris to purchase French bonds, of course, they cannot be prohibited. It is likely that Britain will also introduce France's national defense loan as an attractive investment. (National Telegram, 6th)

(New York) The banking community here today is skeptical about the rumor that the Treasury Department has reached an understanding with France to allow Americans to purchase French national defense bonds, but said that the Johnson Act only prohibits countries in default of U.S. debts from issuing bonds in the United States.

### U.S.-Canada Talks

—Details Unknown— Summoning a World Economic Conference; Beret Explores President's Intentions

(Washington) Canadian Prime Minister King arrived here yesterday and held talks with President Roosevelt, which have now concluded. The U.S. government has not issued a press release on these talks. It is reported that matters of mutual interest to both Canada and the U.S. were discussed. At the same time, it is widely rumored that U.S. Ambassador to France Beret has returned here from France and plans to inform President Roosevelt whether to send officials through diplomatic channels to inquire about the opinions of various countries on summoning a world economic and disarmament conference. This rumor has not been confirmed by officials. According to the opinions of well-informed sources, Beret's trip is related to his speech before leaving Paris, in which he said that the United States is prepared to participate in future trade and disarmament conferences. Since the New York Times published a report that President Roosevelt is considering inviting the rulers of the world to attend a conference, people still believe that President Roosevelt will take this action soon after the general election. However, no matter what proposals are made, it is doubtful whether President Roosevelt will consider carrying out this work at a time when the Supreme Court battle is imminent. (Reuters, 7th)

(Washington) It is learned that President Roosevelt held negotiations with Canadian Prime Minister King today on a reciprocal trade agreement between the United States and Britain in order to eliminate difficulties on the Canadian side. (National Telegram, 6th)

### Military and Police on High Alert: Liu Lurui Escorted to Wuchang

Temporarily Held in the First Prison with Great Courtesy; Higher Court to Commence Trial Soon; Cheng Bianchao Awaiting Confrontation, Not Yet Executed

Hankou Correspondence: Central Committee member Liu Lurui, implicated in the Tang Youren and Yang Yongtai case, was arrested by the Shanghai Public Concession police on the 24th of last month. After a ruling by the First Special District Court, he was handed over to the Hubei Higher Court for trial. The Chief Prosecutor of the court, Lu Shizeng, specially appointed Prosecutor Zhang Fusen to lead over a dozen police officers to Shanghai to escort him back. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, they escorted Liu onto the China Merchants Bureau's Jiang'an steamer to be transported to Hubei. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau also dispatched eleven police officers, including Yang Fulin and Xue Yuewu, to accompany and transfer him. Zhang then returned to Hubei by plane on the 3rd to report the details of the escort to Chief Prosecutor Lu. Meanwhile, arrangements were made at the First Prison Detention Center as a temporary detention place for Liu. The Jiang'an steamer passed Nanjing on the 3rd, Wuhu on the 4th, and Jiujiang at 3:00 AM on the 5th, arriving at Pier No. 3 of the China Merchants Bureau in Hankou at 4:30 PM. In advance, the Wuhan Garrison Brigade's Seventh Regiment of Military Police, police officers from the Sixth Branch of the Municipal Police, inspectors from the Inspection Office, detectives from the Detective Team, and detectives and police from the Higher Court were assigned to be on guard and take care of matters. The riverbank was also cordoned off. After the Jiang'an steamer docked, passengers on board were not allowed to disembark. The Military Affairs Ministry's Huan'an chartered steamer immediately approached and docked to the left of the Jiang'an steamer. The Maritime Public Security Bureau dispatched patrol boats to patrol the river surface. Liu, wearing a blue-gray sheepskin robe and leather shoes, slowly walked out of the dining hall and directly boarded the An Huan chartered steamer, heading towards Wuchang. At 5:00 PM, the steamer arrived at the Hanyangmen pier. The security measures on the steamer and on the riverbank were as strict as in Hankou. Under the surveillance of military and police, Liu ascended the steps, maintaining his composure. After landing, Liu and the detectives and bailiffs rode in the Higher Court's prepared No. 360 car to the court. The remaining military and police escorted them in two other cars. At 5:10 PM, they arrived at the entrance of the Higher Court, entered the auditorium directly, and Chief Prosecutor Bian Shizeng dispatched personnel to complete the handover procedures with the Shanghai Police Bureau. Liu was then handed over to the director's office of the First Prison Detention Center for custody, where he received considerable courtesy. It is said that before Liu was escorted back, the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office had already begun investigating the assassination of Yang Yongqin. The assassin, Cheng Bianchao (aka Tan Wenxin), and accomplices, suspects Gu Yifan, Luo Jingning, Wen Maogong, Gong Bozhou, Cai Decheng, Yang Qixin, Huang Zhenglin, Wang Guangzong, Yang Xiangmin, Yu Jianzhong, Xiao Ruoxu, Li Qunjian, Li Guozhong, He Yunxiao, and over ten others, are all detained in prison. The Prosecutor's Office will begin the trial in the coming days, summoning all parties to confront Liu, in order to handle the case according to the law. Rumors that Cheng Xiechao had already been executed by firing squad have now been clarified as inaccurate. (March 5th)

### Reorganization of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council's Internal Structure

Reduction in the Number of Specialized Committees, to be Renamed as Offices; Cao Rulin to Assume Leadership of the Foreign Affairs Committee

Tianjin Correspondence: Mr. Song Zheyuan has completed his task of entertaining foreign guests in Tianjin. He originally intended to return to Beiping on the 5th to handle political affairs, but due to the resurgence of the land purchase dispute by the Japanese military in Fengtai, Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai came to Tianjin to report. Song is currently negotiating with the other party, seeking a peaceful resolution. At the same time, Lieutenant Colonel Wachi, the Second Section Chief of the Japanese military, has returned to his country to consult with the new cabinet and Land Minister Sugiyama regarding North China diplomacy. He is expected to return to Tianjin on the 7th. Song wants to hear the Japanese side's response before making a move, so he is staying for a few more days. However, due to his long absence from Beiping, political affairs are waiting to be handled. On the 4th, he specifically ordered Qin Dechun, Qi Bianyuan, and Jia Deyao to return to Beiping first to handle everything on his behalf. Song himself will leave Tianjin no later than next Wednesday. Recent rumors of structural changes in the Hebei-Chahar Political Council are still prevalent. Judging from the news obtained here, the various specialized committees under the council will inevitably undergo reorganization, with the name of the committee being abolished or changed to a certain office. In terms of personnel, in order to achieve internal unity and external strength, there will also be slight changes. However, these will not hinder the actual operation. Jia Deyao resigned from the position of Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee a few days ago when he came to Tianjin, facing Song. This position has diplomatic obstacles, and it is difficult to select a successor. Previously, Song had sought Cao Rulin's consent to invite him to take the position, but Cao declined due to illness. Although Song is still searching for a candidate, it is unlikely that anyone will be willing to take the position due to the aforementioned reasons. If necessary, Cao will still be invited to take the honorary chairmanship, while Jia Deyao will actually take on the arduous task.

After the formation of the new Japanese cabinet, the general diplomatic policy towards North China has not yet been put into practice. The garrison headquarters is waiting for Section Chief Wachi's return to convene a meeting of military attachés to decide on the way forward. On his way back, Wachi stopped in Northeast China to visit the new Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Dong Xiuying, to exchange views on diplomacy towards China. The military attachés' meeting is expected to be held around March 20th. Japanese Land Minister Sugiyama recently answered questions from members of the House of Representatives, stating that the diplomatic situation in North China is special and still needs to be handled directly by the army. The Japanese consulates stationed in North China are paying close attention to this. The Jinan Consul-General Ono, the Zhangjiakou Consul Nakane, and the Shanhaiguan Consul Fujii came to Tianjin on the 4th to visit the Tianjin Consul-General Horiuchi to discuss the attitude to be adopted in the future and to assist the army in promoting diplomatic strategies. On the morning of the 5th, they also held a meeting at the British Concession Consulate to decide to send the Tianjin Consul Kishi Weiichi to return to his country on March 12th with the joint opinions of the consuls in North China to petition the new Foreign Minister Sato and report on the recent diplomatic trends in North China. He is expected to return to Tianjin in about three weeks, after which the consuls in Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao will follow the instructions to decide on everything. Overall, the Japanese diplomatic attitude towards North China, whether on the military or diplomatic side, will not be determined until Wachi and Kishi Weiichi return after their briefings.

Sogo Shinji, the president of Xingzhong Company, came to Tianjin on the 26th of last month to attend the board meeting of Tianjin Electric Power Company. Recently, he has been stationed in Tianjin to coordinate the company's plans for developing the North China economy, planning to stay in Tianjin for two months, focusing on the establishment of Tanggu Transportation Company, the restoration of Longyan Iron Mine, and the export of Lu salt. Li Sihao came to Tianjin last week to meet with Sogo, but only exchanged views with each other, without any concrete discussion. However, the export of Lu salt has been negotiated by Sogo with relevant parties for days, and their opinions are close to agreement. It is expected that exports can be realized next month.

### Random Notes from a European Journey (Continued)

— Our Correspondent in Europe, Lieshan

Spain was originally a country with backward military equipment, but this civil war has seen all kinds of new-style military equipment, such as artillery, tanks, and airplanes. On the one hand, this is because the people helping both sides are generous and do not hesitate to supply them. On the other hand, the helpers also want to take this opportunity to test their own military equipment in the field to see if it is good enough. I remember that after the Francoist generals received many of the latest anti-aircraft guns from Germany, they shot down several Russian and French-made planes. A German acquaintance said to me: "You see, German machines are working after all. Our military equipment is better than that of France and Russia." A few days later, several German and Italian-made planes of the Francoist side were also shot down by Russian-made anti-aircraft guns on the Madrid front. So I joked with this acquaintance and asked him if he admitted that Russian military equipment was also good. He did not deny it.

Although it has been less than twenty years since the end of the last European war, the military equipment manufacturing of European countries has made amazing progress in this short period of time. Especially airplanes and anti-aircraft guns, tanks and anti-tank guns. These new-style military equipment will undoubtedly occupy a major position in future wars. Although countries today possess many of these weapons, they have not yet undergone a field test. What the results will be is just a theoretical answer. It is precisely for this reason that European countries want to use the Spanish Civil War as a good testing ground for them. And in fact, they are doing just that.

A few weeks ago, a member of the French parliament questioned Aviation Minister Cote about why so many French-made planes crashed in the Spanish Civil War. At the time, Mr. Cote replied that most of the crashed planes were old. As for the new French planes, they were very reliable. Mr. Cote's statement amounted to admitting that French planes had participated in the Spanish Civil War. Similarly, a member of the British House of Lords once questioned the British aviation authorities as to why Britain did not send air force attachés to Madrid. According to this member, the latest weapons of various countries, especially air forces, are being tested on the Madrid front. Britain should pay attention to the development of these new-style military equipment. Later, Britain did send an air force attaché to Spain.

If countries continue to test like this, this civil war will probably last for a considerable period of time. Only the Spanish people will suffer.

Twenty-One. The Spanish Civil War and the Issue of Volunteer Armies

Generally speaking, the most disappointing thing in the Spanish Civil War is the weakness of the Spanish soldiers' combat effectiveness. Because the Spanish lacked the ability to fight and could not use new military equipment, the helpers themselves became anxious, which led to the issue of volunteer armies. In addition to sending a large number of air force personnel, Germany and Italy are said to have recently transported formal troops in plain clothes to Spain to join the Francoist generals' forces. Similarly, socialists from various countries have also run to Spain to help the "People's Front" government. Left-wing newspapers praised these people as warriors fighting for socialism. Right-wing newspapers say they are "cannon fodder." However, one point is recognized by both sides: that the defense of Madrid is due to the efforts of these international volunteer armies.

Speaking of the volunteer armies from various countries participating in the Spanish Civil War, the situation is different. Most of the German and Italian fascists standing on the side of the Francoist generals have received military training and are stronger. Conversely, the volunteer armies on the side of the "People's Front" government, except for some military experts or junior officers from France and Russia, are just ordinary communists and socialists from various countries. This group of people is still a "disorganized mob." Although they have the spirit of sacrificing for their cause, they lack war experience. As a result, they are only good at defensive warfare when fighting, and their combat effectiveness is not as good when it comes to offensive warfare. We can see this very clearly in the fighting on the Madrid front in the past month. So it makes one wonder whether recruiting another batch of such international troops and sending them to Spain can guarantee the "People's Front" government a final victory. It still seems to be a question.

Relying solely on its own strength, or with the international army as the main force, the "People's Front" government probably cannot resolve the Spanish Civil War in a considerable amount of time. If France and Russia are willing to send formal troops into Spain to help fight, then the chaos can be quelled within one or two months. However, such an action will definitely arouse the resentment of Germany and Italy, and may result in a world war. The hope of Britain and France is to turn the Spanish incident into a local event so that it does not affect the whole of Europe. Therefore, the problem of banning volunteer armies from going to Spain has recently arisen in various European countries. Needless to say, this is a blow to the "People's Front" government.

According to a gentleman with military knowledge, besides the French and Russian national armies, only the Chinese Red Army has the ability to help the "People's Front" government resolve the internal chaos. If these tens of thousands of Red Army soldiers went to Spain, they would definitely create a different situation in less than a month. "This may be good for everyone," he said. "In the eyes of the communists, the revolution is world-wide anyway. Whether it is in China or in Spain, it is the same. In our Chinese eyes, this would at least temporarily avoid Chinese fighting Chinese within China...

### A Glimpse of Financial Fluctuations in Guangdong

Rumors of Increased Value of Guangdong Currency Cause Decline in Shanghai Exchange Rate; Shanghai-Guangdong Exchange Rate Gradually Recovers After Increased Issuance of Subsidiary Currency

Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province's finances have experienced a major fluctuation in recent days. The Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates have suddenly fallen. The ratio of Hong Kong dollars and Guangdong subsidiary currency has dropped from plus 54 to plus 48. The ratio of silver dollars to Guangdong subsidiary currency has dropped from plus 5 to plus 47. The reason for this is that there are widespread rumors that the central authorities are considering increasing the value of the Guangdong currency, causing the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates to fall accordingly. When the Shanghai exchange rate fell on the first day, the ratio of Shanghai banknotes to Guangdong subsidiary currency set by the Provincial Bank was still plus 5, while foreign banks outside were only receiving plus 47 for Shanghai banknotes. Those banks that had Shanghai banknotes in storage transferred them in large quantities to the Provincial Bank to exchange for Guangdong currency. It is said that they made a huge profit from this transfer. At the same time, the Provincial Bank lost a significant amount of exchange water. Therefore, on the day after the sudden surge, the Provincial Bank was forced to change the ratio of Shanghai banknotes to Guangdong currency to be the same as the market ratio, in order to avoid further losses. This contraction of the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange water lasted for several days. The situation only began to ease on February 28, as the rumors of increasing the value of the Guangdong currency had not been confirmed. At the time, the official person in charge also solemnly stated that the authorities had entrusted the Provincial Bank to maintain the currency value, and the Provincial Bank would continue to follow the Guangdong financial regulation policy already set by the Ministry of Finance. In other words, the ratio of Shanghai banknotes to Guangdong currency would still be set at between plus 48 and plus 5. Moreover, seeing the high value of the Guangdong currency and the low exchange rate of Shanghai currency, they took the opportunity to increase the issuance of 4.5 million yuan of new Guangdong subsidiary currency banknotes in order to balance the exchange rate and maintain the stipulated ratio of plus 5 between Shanghai banknotes and Guangdong currency. Therefore, the Shanghai exchange rate has not fallen further in recent days. As of March 1, the ratio of Guangdong currency to Shanghai banknotes was a little over plus 47. The Hong Kong exchange rate has also risen accordingly, with the Hong Kong exchange rate being between plus 507 yuan per thousand yuan. According to political sources, the ratio of silver dollars to Guangdong currency will remain at the original ratio in the short term. The government does not seem to intend to increase the value of the Guangdong currency. However, the Guangdong Province silver dollar system seems to be accelerating. Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke and Economic Committee Standing Member Song Ziwen will go south in the coming days. There is a report of a major relationship between the Guangdong change to the silver dollar system. In the business community, increasing the value of the Guangdong currency has become a unanimous request in recent years. Because the ratio of silver dollars to Guangdong currency is as high as plus 5, it is extremely difficult to purchase goods from various provinces in the country. Moreover, the domestic products of various provinces are all based on silver dollars, and the cost of transporting goods to Guangdong is too high, making it difficult to sell, and business decline is inevitable. If the Shanghai exchange rate is reduced, it will be easier for goods from various provinces to be transported to Guangdong, and after entering Guangdong, they will also be easier to sell. Therefore, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce recently sent a call to the central government to reduce the ratio of silver dollars to Guangdong currency again. However, in order to maintain the original plan, the government has not made a sudden change in policy, and has recently increased the issuance of Guangdong subsidiary currency banknotes in order to balance the Shanghai exchange rate. The official and business parties' claims are still in extreme positions.

### ⊙The Great Danger of Tuberculosis in Families

The Shared Meal System and Tuberculosis - As Described by Mr. Yu Yunxiu, a Great Contemporary Chinese Physician

One

The system of shared meals is prevalent throughout China, especially in the South. Around a square table, seven or eight people sit together, with various dishes mixed together and cups and chopsticks intermingling. Family members, father and son, gather in harmony, and guests and hosts alike eat and drink to their fill. It seems intimate and thoughtful, but it is precisely here that the insidious medium of disease transmission lies. Engaging in this practice is no different from knowingly walking on thin ice or plunging into boiling water. Do those who hear this doubt my words? Let me explain using tuberculosis as an example. Although medical science is as advanced as it is today, if the disease progresses, there is little guarantee of a cure. Once diagnosed, the prognosis is uncertain. This is something everyone has heard of and shudders at, avoiding it as quickly as possible. Yet, it spreads wider and wider, and more and more people contract it. We fear it but cannot escape, and avoid it but have nowhere to hide. Is it truly a matter of destiny, hanging in the balance? No, it is due to insufficient knowledge, poor habits, and a failure to prevent it in the right way.

Two

Tuberculosis is caused by bacterial infection. It has been over forty years since Dr. Koch of Germany discovered the tuberculosis bacillus. Scholars worldwide have no disagreement. This ancient villain has been exposed, and its discovery is as significant as Yu the Great's forging of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons. Today, even women and children know this, yet only our old customs remain oblivious. These bacteria are less than fifteen ten-thousandths of a millimeter long and less than five ten-thousandths of a millimeter wide. Under a thousand-fold microscope, they look like short whiskers, without feet to walk, without tails to swim, and without wings to fly. The common saying that consumption is caused by anger, or that the "lung worm" is a spiritual being that flies out of a dying person and attaches itself to others, is nonsense. The "Ziting Tuberculosis Capture Method," which describes the shape of the "worm" through six generations, as recorded in Wang Kentang's "Standards of Diagnosis and Treatment," are merely vague and similar descriptions, criticized by the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature) as dealing with the strange.

Three

When tuberculosis bacteria enter the lungs, they develop, grow, and reproduce ugly offspring. Therefore, the sputum of tuberculosis patients often contains these bacteria. In severe cases, even a tiny speck of sputum contains thousands of these bacteria. This can be clearly counted under a microscope and is not just empty words or threats. Based on this, how many billions of bacteria are in a mouthful of sputum? This sputum, containing billions of bacteria, is expelled from the lungs, passing through the throat, tongue, and lips. Therefore, how many specks of sputum containing tuberculosis bacteria contaminate the patient's throat, tongue, and lips? The number of bacteria clinging to the patient's throat, tongue, and lips is unimaginable. Once cups and chopsticks come into contact with the mouth of a tuberculosis patient, how many specks of sputum containing tuberculosis bacteria contaminate them? The number of bacteria crawling on the cups and chopsticks is unimaginable. When a tuberculosis patient uses chopsticks to eat from the dishes on the table, how many specks of sputum containing tuberculosis bacteria contaminate the dishes? The number of bacteria attaching and floating in the dishes is also unimaginable. When people at the same table carelessly use the same cups and chopsticks and eat the leftovers, they are swallowing tuberculosis bacteria.

Four

Alas, if a person with tuberculosis is a guest at a feast, perhaps they can avoid spreading the disease through one or two shared meals. But if they are family members living and working together, eating together every day, two or three times a day, they are taking tuberculosis bacteria and swallowing them. How can they avoid spreading the disease? Therefore, I say that engaging in this practice is no different from knowingly walking on thin ice or plunging into boiling water. If someone is not infected, it may be due to a special physical condition, but this is mere luck and cannot be relied upon. Although tuberculosis is often transmitted through the air, contaminated food is also a pathway to disaster. The shared meal system is a way of taking tuberculosis bacteria and suppressing healthy people. Is this not a bad habit? Is it not something that wise people should be alarmed by and avoid? Is it not something that benevolent and virtuous people should loudly denounce and eradicate? The prevalence of tuberculosis in China is truly alarming, like a raging flood whose limits are unknown, and it is a source of national decline and racial weakness. Those who care about the world should pay attention to reforming this custom. (This article is reprinted from Yu's Medical Discourses)

### The Latest Medical Treatment for Tuberculosis

The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that location, cutting off the blood supply. Furthermore, the tubercle bacillus secretes an acid-resistant wax that encapsulates its body to protect against the intrusion of external medicinal forces. Therefore, even with various antibacterial drugs taken internally or injected, they cannot reach the actual body of the bacteria. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, pharmaceutical therapy, and all other treatments traditionally used by physicians have not been entirely successful. The saying that there is no cure for tuberculosis has spread throughout the world because this profound scientific principle was unknown. Consequently, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the aforementioned scientific principle, have continued their research tirelessly. As a result, they have created a chemical holy grail that eradicates tuberculosis bacteria, called Sanosin. This drug was successfully developed in accordance with the latest medical principles of Dr. Koch of Germany, the discoverer of the tuberculosis bacillus, and Dr. Berger of Germany, the inventor of the tuberculosis bacillus dewaxing technique. According to experimental reports from various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of tuberculosis and dissolving the physique, and it also has bactericidal power. It can radically cure tuberculosis in stages one, two, and three and has a proven effective effect in ten thousand tests. In China, the Central Hygiene Laboratory of the National Government has tested the drug's properties and found it to be harmless and non-toxic, with absolutely no side effects. A brief description of its therapeutic effects is provided below.

(1) When the medicinal power of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, the acid resistance of the tubercle bacillus disappears after one minute. After three minutes, the tubercle bacillus is completely eradicated, with no survivors.

(2) Animal experiments have found that "Sanosin" can penetrate the tuberculosis lesions. Examination of the tubercle bacilli lurking within the lesions reveals that they have lost their acid resistance, which proves that their waxy substance has been completely dissolved.

(3) When patients take "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they immediately experience a diluted sputum and a reduced body temperature, indicating a positive state.

(4) Continued internal administration of "Sanosin" for 30 to 60 days or more will visibly increase body weight, stimulate appetite, and gradually alleviate all symptoms, ultimately achieving the great feat of regeneration.

A Sanosin experimental report and a tuberculosis treatment guide will be sent upon request.

### International Cup Soccer: Unexpected Result – Jewish Team Gains Final Qualification

Eliminating England 4-3

The replay of the International Cup soccer championship between England and the Jewish team was held at the racecourse yesterday. The English team, with Loyal at its core and supported by elite English players such as the French businessman Xibu, had a strong lineup. The Jewish team, on the other hand, consisted mostly of the best players from Lacky and Western businessmen. After yesterday's match, the English team performed poorly, resulting in a 2-2 draw in the first half. In the second half, the Jewish team scored two more goals, while the English team only managed one, resulting in England being eliminated with a total score of 4-2. The Jewish team won the right to play in the International Cup final and will compete against the winner between China and Portugal for the championship at a scheduled date. The result of yesterday's game can be considered unexpected. Before the game, England was highly favored, as Loyal was at the peak of his career and had sufficient strength, making it difficult for the Jewish team to compete. The Chinese team was concerned about the Portuguese team, but also about England. Now that the Jewish team has eliminated England, it indirectly benefits the Chinese team immensely. The only difficulty now is how to solve the Portuguese issue. If we can successfully overcome this hurdle, then winning the championship again should be easier than expected. Yesterday, because the fields in various locations were not completely dry, the replay of the International Cup between the Chinese team and Portugal at the Shen Garden and the morning league match between Jinde and Zhendan at Hongkou Park were both postponed and rescheduled.

### Zhou Ruquan Retains Championship in 10,000-Meter Walk

Time: 1 hour, 50 minutes, 35.2 seconds; Xie Xingdao still disqualified due to improper form; Tan Rongsheng wins in the exhibition group

The third 20,000-meter walking competition organized by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau was held in the downtown area yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. As a result, Tan Rongsheng won the championship in the exhibition group with a time of 1 hour, 48 minutes, and 17 seconds. Zhou Ruquan retained the championship in the open group with a time of 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 35.2 seconds. Although Xie Xingdao reached the finish line first, he was still disqualified due to improper form. Details are as follows:

Starting Situation

Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., referees, Boy Scouts, and athletes arrived at the front gate of Fudan University one after another. Although the weather was cloudy and slightly cold, their spirits were high. This year's competition included four deaf-mute participants and two elderly participants, which added to the interest of the spectators. At 8:50 a.m., the roll call was taken, and 51 people were present. Those who were absent were Zhu Rongxiang, Chen Shulun, Cai Renliang, Shen Zule, Xu Yunsheng, and five others. At exactly 9:00 a.m., at the sound of the gun, 1,502 swift feet surged forward towards Xiangyin Road. It was difficult to see who was in the lead at first. After 500 meters, Xie Xingdao, Zhou Ruquan, Qiu Dechang, and others began to lead the way, with Tan Rongsheng following closely behind, while Wang Yuren and Zheng Chengshan lagged behind by more than 20 meters.

Competition Midway

In this long-distance of 20,000 meters, there was a sense of "the road is long and difficult to reach the end." However, Xie Xingdao and Zhou Ruquan remained close throughout, sometimes in front, sometimes behind, neither too close nor too far. Qiu Dechang had led the way for the first 1,000 meters, but after reaching Kongjiang Road, he declined sharply. At Ma Yushan Road, Zhou was ahead of Xie, at the Military Industry Road Power Plant, Xie was ahead of Zhou, and at the Water and Electricity Plant, Zhou was again ahead of Xie. In the end, Xie was still ahead of Zhou, but the distance between them was no more than 100 meters. Tan Rongsheng had maintained third place since Kongjiang Road, and at the Water and Electricity Plant, he suddenly sprinted and overtook Zhou and Xie to take the lead. Zheng Chengshan suffered a cramp and fell behind, while Wang Jingren remained between fifth and sixth place throughout. The others fluctuated greatly, and Lin Jiemu, who was watched by the crowd, unfortunately dropped out due to a lack of stamina.

Reaching the Finish Line

At about 10:45 a.m., Tan Rongsheng reported his arrival, and applause erupted. About 100 meters behind him was Xie Xingdao, and another 10 meters behind was Zhou Ruquan. When Xu Aichen and Wang Jingren arrived, they were already 500 meters away from Zhou, while Xu Guofu and Le Acai were nearly 1,000 meters behind. The subsequent order was Yang Jun, Cui Weimin, Wu Runchang, Tang Wenyi, Shen Jingsheng, Qiu Dechang, Shi Binggui, Zhu Shiying, Chen Chungeng, and others. All participants arrived by 11:45 a.m., and the count was 44 people. The elderly Wu Shuifu was 36th, Ge Jingkang was 41st, the deaf-mute Qian Jiazhang was 29th, and Li Wenbin was 42nd.

Recorded Rankings

After inspection and deliberation by the referees, and after excluding those who committed fouls, the official rankings were announced as follows: Exhibition Group: 1st place, Tan Rongsheng, time 1 hour, 48 minutes, 17 seconds; 2nd place, Wang Jingren, time 1 hour, 55 minutes, 17.4 seconds. Open Group: 1st place, Zhou Ruquan, time 1 hour, 50 minutes, 35.2 seconds; 2nd place, Xu Aichen, time 1 hour, 55 minutes, 17 seconds; 3rd place, Xu Guofu, time 1 hour, 57 minutes, 28.4 seconds; 4th place, Yang Jun, 5th place, Tang Wenyi, 6th place, Shen Jingsheng, 7th place, Qiu Dechang, 8th place, Shi Binggui, 9th place, Zhu Shiying, 10th place, Chen Chungeng.

Disqualifications

Many people were disqualified for committing fouls yesterday, but the most regrettable was Xie Xingdao. Xie reached the finish line with a time of 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 22.4 seconds, but he was not recorded due to improper form. It was found that Xie had won first place in the previous competition but was disqualified. At that time, because all the referees were hired by the Chinese Walking Association, it was still feared that people would suspect collusion. Therefore, this year, referees were hired from all parties, including those from Beijing, who did not know any of the athletes. Therefore, Xie's improper form has become an ironclad rule. According to the referees, Xie's form needs to be fundamentally trained and corrected before he can participate again. It is hoped that Xie will see winning or losing as a small matter. If he can correct his form and practice diligently, he can still be a talented person. However, if he is discouraged by this and harbors resentment, then there is no hope for his future. Furthermore, his outrageous shouting after the referee announced his disqualification was not appropriate behavior. In addition, the Chinese Municipal Bureau's car was driving back and forth in front of and behind Xie, which is not allowed by the rules and may have contributed to Xie's foul. It is hoped that attention will be paid to this.

Awards Ceremony

After the competition, the awards were presented at the City Hall steps at 12:00 noon. Section Chief Zhang of the Social Affairs Bureau, Yu Zhongbiao of the City Party Department, Honorary Secretary-General Ma Chonggan, Chief Referee Shao Rugan, Secretary-General Wang Keyong, and others were present. Yuan Zengyu presided over the ceremony, following the proper etiquette. First, Section Chief Zhang gave a speech, stating that this year's course was twice as long as the previous year's, so there were fewer participants, but their spirits were very good. He hoped that they would practice diligently and that the goal for the next competition would be to increase the distance to 50,000 meters. Next, Yu Zhongbiao of the City Party Department gave a speech, and Chief Referee Shao Rugan reported. Finally, the awards were presented. The first-place winner received Mayor Wu's shield, Director Pan's cup, and Mayor Wu's flag. The second-place winner received Mayor Wu's shield and flag, and Director Pan's shield. The third-place winner received the same. The fourth-place winner received Mayor Wu's flag and Director Pan's shield. The fifth-place winner received the same. The sixth to tenth-place winners each received Director Pan's shield. In addition, all those who completed the entire course received a medal. It is reported that all the prizes were manufactured by the Biao Di Sports Equipment Company, and the designs were quite beautiful.

### Xiqing Men's Volleyball Team to Battle Haiqing, Suzhou Shell

Two Class A Matches; Women's Games Yesterday

There will be two Class A matches today for Xiqing volleyball. Both are second-round matches. Haiqing will play against Su Keer. In the previous match, Haiqing almost suffered an upset, but the strength of the two teams is vastly different. Therefore, if Haiqing does not underestimate its opponent tonight, it should win steadily. In the other match, the Russian team will meet Xiqing again. The Russian team has the momentum of defeating Haiqing, and its strength has returned to normal. Xiqing is suffering from a new defeat. Therefore, although the Russian team once surrendered to Xiqing, the outcome of tonight's match is difficult to predict. In the women's matches the night before last, the Public Concession Girls' High School won again. The Red team only scored one point in the first set, a maximum of four points in the second set, and only two points in the last set, for a total score of 45 to 7. The difference was as much as 38 points, and the difference in strength was like heaven and earth. The schedule and women's results for tonight are as follows:

Tonight's Schedule

Russian Team vs. Xiqing (Class A) 7:00 p.m.

Haiqing vs. Su Keer (Class A) 7:30 p.m.

### Fujian Province Implements Mass Literacy Education Plan

Already Filed with the Ministry of Education

The first-year (25th year of the Republic) plan for mass literacy education in Fujian Province for out-of-school citizens has been filed with the Ministry of Education by the provincial government. The original plan is quite lengthy. Its main points are that mass schools will be established in counties and cities, with each Lianbao (collective security unit) as a unit. The distribution of school locations should be as even as possible. In addition to providing education to the general out-of-school population and providing education to workers in factories or companies, starting with the implementation of this plan, each prison in the provincial capital and various counties and cities will have a mass school established by its governing office to teach out-of-school citizens in prison. The methods, in addition to being handled in accordance with ordinary mass schools, should also pay attention to correcting their thoughts and imparting skills for making a living. The overview of the establishment of mass schools in various counties and cities throughout Fujian Province in the 15th year is as follows: The total population of all 64 counties and cities in the province is 10,058,631. Excluding those who are already in school, the number of out-of-school citizens who should receive literacy education is 4,537,960. According to this year's mass education plan, the number of out-of-school citizens who should be enrolled this year should be 276,456. Therefore, 1,441 to 2,830 mass schools will be established this year, with 5,547 classes, to accommodate out-of-school citizens. They are roughly divided into three categories: ⑴ Large counties and cities with more than 100,000 people who should receive literacy education: the number of people who should be enrolled this year is stipulated to account for one-twenty-first of the total number of people who should be educated. ⑵ Medium-sized counties and cities with more than 50,000 people who should receive literacy education: the number of people who should be enrolled this year is stipulated to account for one-sixteenth of the total number of people who should be educated. ⑶ Small counties and cities with less than 50,000 people who should receive literacy education: the number of people who should be enrolled this year is stipulated to account for one-twenty-seventh of the total number of people who should be educated. As for the teachers of mass schools, the education departments have established mass education teacher training institutes in various districts to train students sent by the counties for the purpose of implementing mass literacy education.

The second volume contains twenty articles explaining research methods in various subjects such as politics, economics, education, literature and art, books, music, etc. Issues such as hygiene, further education, and employment are also discussed in detail. It is a truly essential book for students nationwide to pursue their studies and cultivate themselves. The educational community unanimously praised Mr. Cai Yuanpei who lauded the book saying, "The 'Student's Guide' broadly covers various methods of studying, and discusses the pros and cons of choosing a career after graduation, emphasizing reading, exercise, and hygiene. It enables readers to choose a plan, proceed in an orderly manner, and have a standard for both exertion and relaxation. It prevents them from being lured by schools that deceive and seek profit, and from being exploited by ruthless and unscrupulous ambitious individuals. It can truly be said to educate students with virtue and perfect their qualities." The book is a large volume of over 300,000 words, priced at two yuan, with a reduced price of one yuan and ten cents, and now further reduced by 30% to eighty-four cents. Postage by registered mail is an additional twelve cents. Buyers have been flocking to purchase it, and over a thousand copies have already been sold. The distributor is the Qin Fen Medical Bureau at 277 Sima Road, Shanghai.

### Issues Regarding the Middle School Graduation Examination

---Answering

⑶

Does this mean that the joint examination has no serious flaws? Not so. The situation in the previous Beijing primary schools, where the joint examination increased the workload, may still be the case in middle schools across the country. Even if the subjects for the joint examination have been reduced, schools still inevitably increase the teaching hours for the subjects tested in the joint examination. For example, subjects like Chinese history and Chinese geography, their academic schedules have already been completed in the second grade. Subjects like foreign history, foreign geography, mathematics, and chemistry, although they are completed only in the last semester, a large part or part of the academic schedule has also long passed. It is not easy to prepare for the examination of these past subjects and academic schedules without a review. Moreover, schools with poor grades feel that they have been negligent in the past, and there is no way to take the examination without reviewing. Even those with good grades feel that they must review in order to win the competition. As a result, the learning burden on young people has increased sharply, and the damage to their health can be known without measuring their weight. Or how to correct the problem? The subjects and academic schedules of the joint examination can be limited to those in the last semester, without having to trace back to the past. This is a sincere consideration for the joint examination. What about those who still have to take the entrance examination after graduation, which requires testing of the entire academic schedule? Moreover, the graduation examination is limited to the graduation level, while the entrance examination even exceeds the graduation level. This issue is still above the joint examination issue. If the entrance examination and the graduation joint examination cannot be communicated and combined, then those who can be exempted from the joint examination cannot be exempted from the entrance examination. Why blame this temporary exemption and then concentrate the difficulties later? If they can be combined into one, then the examination will inevitably cover the entire academic schedule, and there is no reason to only test the scope of the last stage. It seems that there is no need to change the subjects and academic schedule content of the joint examination for the time being. For the current plan, instead of allowing schools to increase the number of hours and review past academic schedules on their own, it is better to order schools to stipulate 3 to 5 hours of review time per week outside of class in the last semester, and to allocate it to the joint examination subjects in moderation. The teachers of each subject should provide practical guidance, and no additional teaching hours should be added inside or outside of class. In this way, both practical needs and the learning burden can be taken into consideration. In addition, there is one more thing, that is, the publication of the passing grades of the joint examination. In the past, it seemed that the award-winning approach was adopted. The scores of each subject for each student were posted according to the scores. Now that the joint examination system has been established and there is no fear of obstacles, it seems that there is no need to disclose the score. Only announce the results separately according to whether they passed or failed. This is also to reduce its stimulation and maintain the mental health of young people. The author does not absolutely support the joint examination system. However, before the principle of using examinations as a method of examining academic performance can be fundamentally reformed, it is considered that the joint examination is not more harmful than the strict examination held by the school, but is more beneficial. However, the atmosphere of temporary tension caused by the joint examination and the improper measures of the school have a serious impact. At the same time, the entrance examination, which is closely related to the time of the joint examination, is theoretically impossible to repeat, and in fact, the difficulty of the latter exceeds the former several times. As a result, the observers are unclear, the arguments are confused, the joint examination is criticized, and it is cursed as an oppressive policy. In all fairness, how can the joint examination system bear its expenses? For the sake of protecting young people and their academic studies, we dare to ask those who actually handle it to earnestly reflect on the practical basis of teaching each subject at ordinary times, carefully examine academic performance, and cultivate students' habit of studying hard and taking examinations. At the same time, we ask the educational administrative organs to supervise and correct the indiscriminate increase of teaching hours by various schools concentrated on the subjects of the joint examination and the suspension of teaching subjects not included in the joint examination. Finally, we ask the educational administrative authorities and various universities to find a way to communicate the university entrance examination with the high school graduation joint examination, and strive to rationalize the examination. In this way, the inherent and external difficulties of the joint examination system can be reduced to a minimum, and the practical effect of streamlining academic standards and improving teaching efficiency can be greatly enhanced. This is my humble wish to discuss with colleagues in the church community. (The End)

### Xiong Xiling and Others Return to Shanghai Yesterday

Issue Written Statement Stating that the Conference Proposals Were All Beneficial to Our Country, Passport Requirements for Chinese Traveling to Singapore and Gender Ratio Restrictions Have Been Revoked, Promoting the World Red Swastika Society as Xiong's Second Mission Abroad

According to the Shenzhou News Agency, Xiong Xiling and other four representatives of our country who attended the second Far East Conference for the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children, convened by the League of Nations, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the Java Company's ship "Chisadani." The ship docked at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf at 10:30 AM. The Shenzhou News Agency reporter has recorded the details as follows:

Welcome to Xiong and Others Upon Arrival in Shanghai

In addition to Consul Song Faxiang, who returned to his post after attending, the other representatives of our country, including World Red Swastika Society President Xiong Xiling and his wife, Executive Committee Member of the Children's Welfare Association Chen Heqin, and Director of the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute Ms. Guan Ruiwu, a total of four representatives, returned to China yesterday morning aboard the "Chisadani." Representatives from various circles who went to the ship to welcome them included Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the National Government Accounting Committee; Zhu Tingqi and his wife, Director of the Ministry of Finance Salt Revenue Inspection Office; Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Children's Welfare Association; Zhang Guanshan, Vice President of the World Red Swastika Society China Southeast Branch; and Team Leader Hu Zhongcheng of the Red Swastika Society, leading ten members, as well as other charity figures such as Han Fuhang and his wife, Li Cikai and his wife, Wang Daoyuan, Tian Xiuben, and more than 50 others. The ship arrived at the new customs wharf at 12:00 PM. Xiong and others took a group photo with the welcomers at the wharf before departing separately.

Xiong's Second Mission Abroad

In addition to attending the conference, Xiong's second mission abroad was to take advantage of the gathering of various charitable organizations in the Far East to promote the situation of the international charitable organization "World Red Swastika Society," which was founded in China. According to Xiong's statement to the Shenzhou News Agency reporter yesterday, the World Red Swastika Society was founded in China, but there are still places abroad that are unaware of it, and some even think that the Swastika is related to the German National Socialist Party. This time, after explaining it to people from various countries, he has won the understanding and sympathy of the representatives. He hosted a banquet for all the representatives in Wannjiang, which was particularly pleasant. His impression of this trip abroad is excellent. The World Red Swastika Society and this Conference for the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children are indeed of great importance: ⑴ The Association's various disaster relief efforts for water, drought, and war, in order to prevent women and children from being victimized by disasters, are a passive means of preventing trafficking in women and children. ⑵ Using moral influence to prevent frequent family separations. ⑶ The Association runs women's vocational training centers, orphanages, etc., which are active ways to prevent trafficking in women and children. The Red Swastika Society was founded in the 12th year of the Republic of China and has been actively engaged in charitable work ever since. According to Ms. Wu Yanwen, Xiong's wife, the abolition of officially sanctioned brothels has been passed, and countries will take actions in various fields to complete it in the future. As for women serving society, China is already working on it. According to Mr. Chen Heqin, the Chinese representatives at this conference argued on principle, and the requirements for Chinese to have food passports when going to Singapore and the gender ratio of Chinese entering the country have been abolished. The conference also resolved that: ⑴ The League of Nations should seek the consent of the Chinese government and cooperate with the authorities in the concessions in China to engage in anti-trafficking work. ⑵ Cooperate with shipping companies to prevent trafficking. ⑶ To rescue prostitutes, it advocates starting with education and medical methods. All of these were proposed by our representatives and passed by the conference.

The Delegation Issues a Written Statement

Xiong and the other four representatives issued a written statement aboard the ship yesterday, stating, "The League of Nations has always paid great attention to the issue of trafficking in women and children. The first conference was held in Geneva in 1921, and the problem of trafficking in women and children in Europe and America was largely resolved. In recent years, the League of Nations has been committed to the problem of trafficking in women and children in the Far East. In 1930, it sent personnel to investigate. The group consisted of one American and one Swede. They traveled from Europe to Asia, passing through Singapore, Siam, Annam, the Philippines, China, Japan, the Dutch East Indies, India, Persia, Syria, and other countries for a year and a half. The investigation was completed in 1932, and a report was published, which attracted great attention from various countries. The report proposed a variety of methods, and it seemed necessary for governments to take common steps. As a result, the League of Nations held this Far East Conference for the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children. A total of 30 representatives from nine countries participated in this conference, including the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States, the Hong Kong government, China, France, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Siam, and the United States. There were also six international organizations and seven private organizations, with a total of 30 representatives. The Chinese private organizations were invited to participate by the government, including the World Red Swastika Society China General Association, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, and the Peiping Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute. This conference began on February 2 and lasted until the 13th, a total of one week. The agenda was predetermined. Each time a problem was discussed, the representatives of each country would first submit a report at the conference, and then the representatives would debate and suggest. After the discussion had some direction, it would be submitted to the small group meeting for detailed review, and then submitted to the conference for voting. Therefore, the establishment and passage of a resolution required thorough research and considerable debate. The results of the meeting were satisfactory.

Six Resolutions Benefit China

Various resolutions are very beneficial to China, such as the first resolution to promote close cooperation and exchange of information between the police departments and competent authorities of various countries and the anti-trafficking agencies. The conference has resolved to establish an information office to handle this matter. When the League of Nations Far East Trafficking in Women and Children Investigation Team came to China for inspection several years ago, it felt that it was necessary for the countries of the East to cooperate effectively on this issue, and the information office was necessary to exchange information between countries. The Chinese representatives believe that in addition to setting up an information office, liaison officers should be added to enhance the effectiveness of cooperation. This proposal was also adopted by the conference. In the past, the most difficult point for China in preventing and suppressing trafficking in women and children was the concessions in the coastal trading ports, because the Chinese concessions were places where Chinese government orders could not reach, and they were no different from places to hide dirt. Now, they can contact each other and communicate with each other, so that the villains who traffic in people are no longer easy to be active in the concessions. Therefore, this resolution is of great benefit to China. However, the Chinese representatives hope that this information office can be established in Shanghai. The largest gain of the second proposal, which is to prevent trafficking in women and children, is that the shipping companies in various ports should cooperate with the local government to prevent the trafficking of women and children. Regarding the third proposal, we express satisfaction with the cooperation between the Far East police departments and other agencies and private organizations and government agencies, and hope that they will continue to work together to enhance the welfare of women and children. Regarding the fourth proposal, the authorities in charge of the welfare of women and children should widely employ female staff. This issue has been practiced in China for many years. The conference's resolution also hopes that local governments should make every effort to employ more female staff in the future. Regarding the fifth proposal, which is the abolition of officially sanctioned brothels, this issue is due to the existence of officially sanctioned prostitution systems in Eastern countries, such as Japan and French territories. Therefore, its resolution can only be made in principle: ⑴ Expand publicity work and cultivate public opinion, and use educational methods to eliminate prostitution. ⑵ Impose appropriate restrictions administratively, and provide prostitutes with medical diagnosis, treatment, and relief. Regarding the sixth proposal, the Far East White Russian issue, the conference decided that the League of Nations should select a commissioner to handle the matter in the Far East. The Chinese representatives gave the foreign representatives a very deep impression this time. The representatives of all countries also paid great attention to this conference and made long-term preparations."

### This City's Women's Association to Commemorate "March 8th" Today

Meeting and Broadcasting for Widespread Promotion, the Association Also Issues a Letter to Women

Today is International Women's Day. To raise awareness among women throughout the city and express its views, the Shanghai Women's Association is holding a commemorative meeting at the Huadong Women's Middle School on Xiafei Road. This morning, they will invite celebrities to broadcast on Yasheng and Greater China radio stations. This afternoon, the association will send members to remote and educationally underdeveloped areas in the suburbs for widespread promotion. The association will also issue a "Letter to Women on International Women's Day." The original text is as follows: "Dear sisters, today is March 8th, a day to commemorate the liberation of women worldwide. On March 8th, 1909, a group of awakened women in the United States, unwilling to accept social discrimination and unequal treatment, rose up and held a great demonstration to awaken women to seek their own liberation. Therefore, at the International Women's Socialist Congress held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that March 8th would be International Women's Day. In 1911, women in Germany and the United States took the lead in commemorating the day by holding a great mass demonstration on March 8th. At the same time, more than 80,000 female workers in Vienna, Austria, participated, demanding 'women's suffrage and protection of female workers,' and striving for equality between men and women in politics, economics, and society. Later, women in Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries held similar events. Thus, March 8th became a day for international women to promote solidarity and seek equal liberation. The various constraints and oppressions suffered by Chinese women are far more severe than those faced by women in Europe and America, and their demands for freedom and equality are even more pressing. Since the high tide of the 'March 8th' commemoration spread to East Asia, Chinese women have also automatically commemorated it in the same way as women around the world. This not only shows the awareness of Chinese women regarding their own suffering but also deeply reflects their understanding and courage regarding the need for revolution. Therefore, since the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, awakened Chinese women have enthusiastically participated, and the government has been able to respond to the demands of women by enacting many laws to improve the status of women. Today, although most Chinese women are still in bondage and oppression, it cannot be denied that there have been considerable gains in terms of politics and law. Therefore, we believe that the Chinese women's movement should do more active work in the future, to be clearer, that is, to act in accordance with the purpose of this association, to awaken women's national sense of responsibility, promote their morality and intelligence, participate in the National Revolution, and enhance their own and the nation's welfare. Its important tasks are: (1) planning for the improvement of women's lives and habits; (2) developing women's education; (3) developing women's careers; (4) conducting various investigations into the women's movement; (5) promoting the women's movement; (6) improving their families and their organization; (7) ensuring the motherhood of national survival; (8) protecting women's human rights; (9) providing relief to women; and (10) developing social welfare. In addition, China is now in a time of great national crisis, and our women should strive to rise up and, under the guidance of the government, do the work of resisting aggression and saving the country. When China is free and equal, most of China's women's problems can be solved as well. May all my female compatriots work hard."

### Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Revision of

Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Income Tax

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the resolution of the Special Committee on Income Tax, yesterday submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting revisions to the detailed rules for the implementation of income tax. The original petition stated: "Regarding the matter of submitting petitions, it was resolved at the meeting convened by the association on January 20th to study income tax, that two points of opinion be submitted for revision regarding Article 7, paragraph 1, and Article 26 of the detailed rules for implementation. On February 5th, the association forwarded the situation to the Ministry of Finance, which issued approval No. 12288. After the adjournment of the study meeting, the association considered that the implementation of income tax is closely related to commerce and is extremely complex. To ensure thorough discussion, a special committee was organized to continue the study. In addition to the opinions on the collection guidelines, which have been submitted directly to the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance for adoption, the results of the study on the detailed rules for implementation propose fourteen revisions or additions. The articles are listed separately on another sheet of paper. We respectfully request that the Executive Yuan (Ministry) review them. Some require a brief explanation, such as the proposed revision of Article 7, which is the same as the proposal submitted by the association on February 5th, No. 87, on behalf of the representatives of various chambers of commerce. However, the wording of this revision is slightly different from the previous one in terms of detail. The proposal to delete Article 14 in its entirety is because the association's document No. 88, submitted to the Executive Yuan (Ministry) on February 4th, requesting the revision of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, has already explained that the current mandatory savings of various industries are the same as statutory savings in terms of function and meaning. Since the scope of the regulations is requested to be expanded, the restrictions added in Article 14 of the detailed rules for implementation should be deleted to ensure consistency. The proposed revision of Article 36 regarding the time limit for tax refunds is because tax payment has a fixed period, so tax refunds should be handled in the same way to avoid merchants waiting for years and suffering losses. Other articles that are proposed to be revised are considered unnecessary to explain further and are not mentioned again in the document. This petition is prepared and submitted, respectfully requesting that the Executive Yuan (Ministry) grant approval to adopt each item and allow the revisions, as it is for the public benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, attached are the proposed revisions to the articles of the detailed rules for the implementation of income tax: Article 7: This article is proposed to be revised as follows: 'The term 'capital' refers to the paid-in capital of a company organized as a corporation, or the actual capital invested in other organizations. If there is a public reserve fund, it may be included in the calculation of capital.' Article 12: This article is proposed to be revised as follows: 'Non-profit legal persons or organizations that also engage in profit-making activities shall pay taxes on the profit-making portion in accordance with the regulations.' Article 14: This article is proposed to be deleted. Article 15: This article is proposed to be revised as follows: 'When calculating income of the first category, the total revenue shall be reduced by the expenses incurred during the business period, bad debts, depreciation, depletion, amortization, inventory consumption, public levies, and public reserve funds stipulated by law, and the remaining amount shall be the net profit, which shall be taxed at the tax rate stipulated in Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations.' Article 17: Please delete the word 'directly' in the fourth paragraph of this article, and delete the phrase 'the travel expenses in the third paragraph of the first item of this article are limited to those who receive remuneration, but shall not exceed 30% of their respective remuneration' at the end of the article. Article 15: Please add a proviso to this article: 'However, in the case of frequently used transactions, the settlement may be made according to the semi-annual settlement period.' Article 22: Please change 'twenty days' in this article to 'one month.' Article 23: Please change 'twenty days' in this article to 'one month.' Article 24: Please change the phrase 'account books and documents' in this article to 'documents.' Article 26: Please change the second paragraph of this article to: 'In addition to public servants who pay income tax in the second category on a monthly basis, freelancers and others engaged in various industries may pay it within one month after the annual settlement.' Also, in the third paragraph of the same article, please change 'settlement interest' to 'payment of interest,' and change the last sentence 'pay within twenty days' to 'pay within one month.' Article 34: Please change 'proof documents' in this article to 'proof documents.' Article 36: This article is proposed to be revised as follows: 'Taxpayers who believe that the income tax withheld should be reduced may apply for a tax refund to the local competent collection agency. When the local competent collection agency receives the aforementioned application for a tax refund, it shall refund it within one month.' Article 45 and Article 46: These two articles are proposed to be revised as Article 45: 'Companies, firms, stores, factories, and profit-making individuals shall, at the time of opening a business, report the name of the person in charge, business address, business type, business year, and actual amount of capital to the local competent collection agency. In addition to complying with the preceding paragraph, limited liability companies shall also report the total amount of share capital, the full amount of each share, and the amount of each public reserve to the local competent collection agency.' Article 46: 'Companies, firms, stores, factories, and profit-making individuals that have already opened a business before the implementation of these detailed rules shall, within six months from the date of implementation of these detailed rules, report the matters listed in the preceding article to the local competent collection agency.'"

### County Party Headquarters Sends Telegram in Response to Unified National Salvation

The Shanghai County Party Headquarters yesterday telegraphed the city party headquarters of this city in response to the "Unified National Salvation" movement. The text reads, "The policy of internal pacification and external resistance has been a consistent national policy of the Central Government. However, internal pacification must be based on unification. Only with domestic unification can we talk about resisting aggression and teaching about national humiliation. The establishment of the Grand Alliance for Unified National Salvation by various circles in your city is a work that is urgently needed at present. The people of the whole country should unite and jointly impose severe sanctions on traitors and remnant communist bandits and warlords who undermine unification in order to complete the great cause of national unification. In addition to expressing unlimited sympathy for this unified national salvation movement, this association respectfully leads the county party members and the masses to follow your city and work together. Respectfully, the Shanghai County Executive Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Party of the Chinese Kuomintang."

### Tram Services on All Routes in the Public Concession Resumed as Usual Yesterday Morning

Party and Government Officials Sent to Monitor Order, Which Was Good. Machine Workers to Enter the Factory for Work Today.

Terms of Treatment to be Mediated in Accordance with the Law.

According to Dagong News, after the strike by all the workers in the machinery department of the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession, mediation by the party and government agencies was ineffective. The workers in the machinery department went out the day before yesterday morning to block ticket sellers and drivers from going to work, resulting in the inability of all trams to run and the disruption of transportation. After receiving the report, the party and government agencies immediately issued a joint announcement, ordering the resumption of work immediately and awaiting legal mediation on the issue of conditions. In order to comply with the orders of the party and government, all workers entered the factory for work at 6:00 AM yesterday, and tram services on all routes have resumed. Details are recorded below:

Tram Services on All Routes Resume

The day before yesterday morning, all the drivers and ticket sellers of the British Tramway Company were blocked from working. After receiving the report, the party and government agencies of this city, considering that tram services are related to public transportation, decided after consultation to issue a joint announcement by the Social Bureau of the City Party Headquarters, ordering all workers to resume work immediately. They also summoned representatives of the workers all night for earnest persuasion. In order to comply with the orders of the party and government agencies, all the workers in the transportation department entered the factory at 6:00 AM yesterday and resumed work as usual. Tram services on all routes have also started on time and resumed. Trams on routes 5, 17, and 18 in the French Concession also entered the Public Concession as usual, and all transportation has resumed.

Party and Government Agencies Sent to Monitor

The party and government agencies of this city were deeply concerned that some workers who were unaware of the situation might come out again to block the trams and cause disturbances when the tram workers went to work. Therefore, at about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, Yu Yaoqiu and Lu Yinchu of the City Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao of the Social Bureau, and Gong Yuting of the General Labor Union took cars to the Yangshupu Station in East Shanghai and the Jing'an Temple Station in West Shanghai for strict monitoring. The Yulin Road Police Station and the Jing'an Temple Police Station in the Public Concession also dispatched a large number of detectives and guard cars to provide strict protection around the factory gates. By 6:30 AM, all the workers were working as usual, and the order was very good. Representatives of the party and government agencies and Chinese and foreign detectives from the police stations also withdrew separately.

Machine Workers Resume Work This Morning

Yesterday happened to be Sunday, and the workers in the machinery department had a holiday as usual. Except for more than 80 night shift workers in the Huishan Road Branch of the machinery department who entered the factory for work at 6:00 PM last night, more than 300 workers in the machinery department of the old Hed Road factory and the new Beikaier Road factory were all day shift workers, so they are scheduled to enter the factory at 6:00 AM this morning and resume work as usual. Party and government agencies will also send personnel to monitor at that time to avoid misunderstandings.

Terms of Treatment to be Mediated

Regarding the conditions of treatment requested by the workers: (1) The two dismissed workers should be allowed to resume work. (2) Those who voluntarily resign due to illness or have served for 15 years should also be given a retirement payment of one month for each year of service (and so on). (3) Workers should not have their wages deducted for sick leave. The City Party Headquarters has notified Ivan, the manager of the company, who has accepted it and promised to convene a board meeting to discuss it. In order to quickly resolve the issue, the party and government agencies of this city will still send the original handlers, Lu Yinchu and Yu Yaoqiu of the City Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao of the Social Bureau, and Zhu Xuefan and Gong Yuting of the General Labor Union, to the company today to conduct mediation. The issue of the Shen Gong workers' request for equal treatment as ticket sellers will also be included in the mediation.

### Three Banks, Including Zhongshi, Increase Government Shares

Shareholders' Meetings to be Held Separately on a Scheduled Basis

The matter of increasing government shares in three banks, including China Industrial, China General Chamber of Commerce, and Siming Commercial Bank, has been approved by the shareholders' meeting to authorize the board of directors to contact the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry's order specifying the number of government shares was received last month. The three banks are scheduled to convene separate shareholders' meetings on the 22nd of this month to report on the progress of the negotiations and discuss restructuring matters. It is reported that Siming was established in the 34th year of Guangxu during the Qing Dynasty, with a total capital of 1.5 million taels, half of which was collected first. After the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, it was converted into 2.25 million yuan in national currency. This restructuring will expand the capital to 4 million yuan. The old shares will be converted into 337,500 yuan of new shares at a rate of 15%, and the Ministry of Finance will add 3,662,500 yuan of government shares. China General Chamber of Commerce was established in the 22nd year of Guangxu, with a capital of 5 million taels, which was later converted into 7 million yuan of new shares. This restructuring will change the capital to 4 million yuan. The old shares will also be converted into 525,000 yuan of new shares at a rate of 15%, and 3,475,000 yuan of government shares will be added. China Industrial was established in the 8th year of the Republic of China, with its head office originally located in Tianjin and moved to Shanghai in the 21st year. The original capital was 3.5074 million yuan. This restructuring will expand the capital to 4 million yuan. The old shares will be converted into 526,110 yuan of new shares at a rate of 15%, and 3,473,890 yuan of government shares will be added. The three banks will add a total of 10,586,390 yuan of government shares. After the three banks' extraordinary shareholders' meetings resolve to restructure, the Ministry of Finance will allocate public bonds to fill them. The representatives of the government shares are being selected by the Ministry.

### The Municipal General Labor Union Holds a Women's Labor Family Service Group That Departed Yesterday for Service

Guiding Family Cleaning and Imparting Common Sense. The Second Joint Event is Held in West Shanghai with the Health Bureau

In order to promote labor services and improve the family life of workers, the Shanghai Municipal General Labor Union has decided to establish a Women's Labor Family Service Group. The group held its first service yesterday. The details are recorded below:

Key Points of Work: The task of the group is to promote labor services, investigate the family life of workers, and guide labor families in hygiene and children's education. The service work is temporarily divided into the following five items: (A) Family visits to investigate family conditions and pay attention to their most painful and most hopeful things, and tell them that the association cares about their pain and is willing to help them solve it. (B) Medical assistance, instructions on family medical care and nursing knowledge, and a number of Chinese and Western doctors are invited by the association (at least five districts in Pudong, Nanshi, Hudong, Husi, and Hubei) to provide free medical treatment, print consultation vouchers, and distribute them with household medicines, such as Wan Jin Oil, A. S. Pilling, quinine, rubber bands, cotton gauze, etc., which are also attached. (C) Hygiene guidance, instructions on family cleaning and health methods, explained with extremely simple and popular books. (D) Children's education, appropriate introduction of children's reading books, educational toys, and instructions on methods of raising children, and answers to difficult questions about children's education. (E) Special matters, such as holding district-level children's health competitions, labor family gatherings, etc. The service time is tentatively set for two to four times a month. During the service, the members will use extremely popular language to explain the domestic political situation, instill national significance, and stimulate patriotic thought.

Departure Situation: Yesterday was the first service of the group. All the female members of the group gathered at the General Labor Union at 9:00 AM, and Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Promotion Committee of the group, gave instructions, and Wang Jiashu, General Secretary, gave instructions on the work policy, and issued a service outline, stipulating the items for guiding family cleaning, and there were various small slogans about hygiene, and toys and medicines donated by domestic factories, etc., which were given to the group members to distribute to the families of workers.

Service Area: Because the number of members of the group is still small at present, the group only provided services in the Nanshi and Pudong districts yesterday. The list of members participating in the service group is as follows: Group 1: Xu Shuzhen, Shao Xiuying, Wang Qin (Laiyidu area of Pudong). Group 2: Yue Ying, Chen Rufen, Ni Peizeng (Qichangzhan area of Yangjiazai, Pudong). Group 3: Qian Weiyin, Yu Yanchun (Bansongyuan Road and Chezhan Road areas of Nanshi). The group is still recruiting members. In addition to the General Labor Union's notification to various labor unions to introduce members, women with junior high school education who are enthusiastic about social undertakings are also welcome to participate. For participation procedures, you can directly inquire with the General Labor Union. It is heard that the second service of the group will be held jointly with the health authorities in the workers' area of West Shanghai to hold a children's health guidance meeting and provide free smallpox vaccination.

### Central Trust Bureau Negotiates with Consulate in Singapore to Handle Domestic Products

Local Manufacturers Participate in Singapore's National Goods Exhibition Hall

According to Shenzhou News Agency, since the arrival of Gao Lingbai, our country's Consul General in Singapore, he has actively sought to communicate and develop business between Southeast Asia and China. He has also realized that the number of Southeast Asian overseas Chinese who have been working with domestic raw materials and commodities has been increasing in recent years. However, most overseas Chinese businessmen are isolated from domestic market conditions. Even though they are enthusiastic about running domestic products, they often suffer from the lack of trust. Now, in order to alleviate this difficulty and develop overseas trade markets, Gao has sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau. A result has been negotiated. In the future, if overseas Chinese businessmen want to order domestic products, they can first fill out a price inquiry form to the Consulate General in Singapore, and the Consulate will immediately inform the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau to investigate prices on its behalf. If a public tender is required, it will be advertised in the newspaper on its behalf. After receiving a notice from the Bureau regarding the handling situation, our overseas Chinese businessmen can sign a consignment contract with the Consulate General. All customs declaration, tax payment, transportation, and purchase procedures will be handled by the Central Trust Bureau. However, the goods handled must be at least 10,000 yuan or more. According to the capital strength of the Central Trust Bureau, it is set up by the government and is not comparable to general for-profit organizations. The development of international trade and the convenience of overseas Chinese will be enhanced by this.

In addition, domestic lenders in this city are also sparing no effort to develop trade in Southeast Asia. The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, the China National Products Production and Sales Association, and the Singapore Branch of the Bank of China in this city have jointly established the China National Products Exhibition Hall in Singapore. The new layout has been basically completed, and the opening cost is set at 6,000 yuan in national currency, with 20 factories participating in principle. It would be even better if the number could be increased, and a method has been formulated. It is reported that the manufacturers in this city who have already participated include the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, the Ya Guang Bakelite Factory, the Wu He Weaving Factory, the China Enamel Factory, and the Hua Feng Steel Refinement Factory, etc. 15 companies. Those who are contacting to participate are still very enthusiastic. After 20 companies are satisfied, they will transport the goods to the exhibition for a scheduled opening. It is expected that it will be established soon.

### Municipal Hospital Officially Opens on Schedule

The Municipal Hospital and Hygiene Testing Laboratory of this city are the newest medical construction projects in Shanghai. Construction was ordered by the municipal government's Health Bureau in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), and all projects were completed at the end of last year. Work began successively on New Year's Day of the 26th year (1937). According to reliable sources, the two institutions are scheduled to hold their opening ceremonies simultaneously at 2:30 PM on April 3rd. It is said that invitation cards for the ceremony will be sent out soon. With the beautiful spring weather, it is expected that many people will be eager to attend, and the city center will inevitably be bustling with traffic.

### Three Things Businesses Should Note After Income Tax Implementation

Li Wenjie's Speech at the Civic Auditorium Provides Important Reference for the Business Community

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, accountant Li Wenjie gave a speech entitled "Matters That Businesses Should Pay Attention to in Accounting After the Implementation of Income Tax" at the Civic Joint Association of the First Special District. He provided a very thorough and concrete analysis of various practical issues concerning income tax. It serves as an important reference for the current business community. We have urgently recorded it as follows: The importance of the relationship between income tax and accounting is extremely obvious. Income tax laws and regulations in our country have now begun to be implemented. The business community has already paid close attention to this issue. Today, I will use the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and its Implementation Rules, as well as the draft of the three types of collection guidelines, as the framework to discuss the accounting matters and issues that are related to it. The accounting I am talking about now is of course industrial and commercial accounting, and it includes bookkeeping techniques. Now, I will explain it in three points: (A) Matters to be prepared immediately, (B) Matters to be noted regularly, and (C) Matters to be noted at the time of final settlement.

(A) Matters to be Prepared Immediately

㊀ Improve incomplete bookkeeping and establish a unified and accurate accounting system. Most industrial and commercial firms in our country are sole proprietorships or partnerships, and the scale is generally small. "Integrity in commerce" and "taking righteousness as profit" are long-standing good habits. Between the capital owner and the managers, between the factory/store and the customers, any major matter is often consistently determined and the formalities are not necessarily complete. As a result, not much attention is paid to bookkeeping, and incomplete shortcomings are naturally unavoidable. Now, because income tax has to be paid, there must be accurate bookkeeping in order to produce accurate profits and losses and provide reliable supporting documents. When paying taxes, many difficulties and disputes can be avoided. Therefore, improving incomplete bookkeeping and establishing a unified and accurate accounting system is a matter that should be prepared immediately. Establishing a unified and accurate accounting system should take into account the business conditions, inherent habits, and operating conditions of each industry. It is not something that can be described in general terms. Now, I can only extract and describe the points that have commonality as follows: 1. The names, types, and functions of accounting books should be clearly defined. 2. The methods of bookkeeping and final settlement should be collectively discussed and jointly followed. 3. The accounting subjects and sub-items used for bookkeeping should strive for comprehensiveness and consistency. For example, the use of "temporary entries" and "miscellaneous items" should be minimized. 4. The formats of receipts, invoices, orders, and other accounting vouchers should be uniform. 5. The forms to be used for settling accounts should have a unified format. 6. The preservation of various contracts, letters, and documents related to business should also be discussed and agreed upon using the same method. All of the above points should be handled immediately. Now is an excellent opportunity to improve the accounting system of various industries because companies and firms in various industries will certainly be happy to engage in it for their own interests. Industry trade associations should take on this responsibility in a timely manner. On the one hand, they should invite experts to recommend a simple, easy-to-implement, unified, and accurate accounting system for the industry. On the other hand, they should organize bookkeeping training courses and send personnel from member factories and stores to attend the training. By doing so, members can achieve the benefits of improving bookkeeping and accurately calculating profits and losses in a short period of time without increasing labor costs or changing staff.

㊁ Solidly organize the records of assets and liabilities and estimate their correct value. This can be discussed in several items. 1. Regarding capital, the amount of capital recorded in the books of general industrial and commercial firms often cannot represent the funds actually used in their operations. For example, undistributed profits from previous years, secret reserves hidden in assets, and long-term loans directly lent to the business by the capital owner are, in nature, no different from capital. Our country's income tax system also uses the profit and actual capital amount to determine the tax rate for non-corporate profit-making enterprises. In theory, there is room for discussion. Therefore, if a profit-making enterprise operates a business with funds that are nominally not capital, it obviously bears an unfair burden in terms of taxation. Therefore, the first step for each company and firm should be to quickly and accurately calculate its actual capital amount to avoid paying taxes meaninglessly at a loss. However, one point should not be forgotten: if it is a corporate organization, the articles of association should be revised for capital increase registration; if it has been registered as a commercial firm, the registered capital amount should be changed, and the partnership agreement should be revised. As for those who have not or have handled company registration or commercial firm registration, they should take this opportunity to complete the registration procedures because obtaining a license from the Ministry of Industry is, of course, the most powerful proof of the actual amount of capital. 2. Regarding other liabilities, the most important of other liabilities of general industrial and commercial firms is the deposits absorbed from relatives and friends. Usually, only a mark or shop name is recorded in the sub-account ledger. Only the handler knows the true name and address of the depositor. Now, because firms that absorb deposits should bear the obligation of withholding income tax, the account names in the books should be clear and detailed. If a mark or shop name is used to open an account, the true name, address, and interest rate should be added under the account. If it is a fixed-term deposit, the due date should also be recorded. When transferring to a new book in subsequent years, it should also be handled in the same way. This is not only for the convenience of withholding income tax, but even if the handler leaves the job, others can continue to manage the accounts, receive and pay funds without any difficulty. 3. Regarding current assets, A. Cash: The amount of cash balance on the books of many industrial and commercial institutions often cannot match the actual amount in the treasury. The difference is the amount of various types of outstanding accounts, such as employee outstanding debts and returned promissory notes. Employee outstanding debts are originally a bad habit and should be eliminated. Even if there is an urgent need, it should be treated as an outstanding account and paid off, and must never be kept outstanding in the cash inventory for a long time. As for accounts receivable on forward promissory notes, they should also be listed in the "accounts receivable promissory notes" subject. On the one hand, the figures expressed in the accounting books can accurately represent the true financial situation. Moreover, according to Article 19 of the draft Guidelines for the First Category of Collection, uncollectible accounts receivable promissory notes are allowed to be listed as bad debt losses. Setting up a separate subject of accounts receivable promissory notes can also facilitate investigation. B. Inventory or raw materials: When general industrial and commercial firms purchase goods, in addition to recording the debt owed for the purchase price in the goods source book by household, the receipt and delivery of the goods themselves are often not recorded, but the inventory is taken once at the time of final settlement to determine the profit and loss. This is not a perfect approach. In the future, in order to facilitate the settlement of accounts at any time, the profit and loss should be recorded in detail every month, and the existing goods should be checked to prevent leakage. Separate books should also be set up for the receipt and delivery of goods for recording and investigation. When settling accounts every year, the physical inventory should be taken again. If a difference loss is found between the amount recorded in the books and the amount of the physical inventory, it should be adjusted with the "inventory consumption" subject. Regarding inventory or raw materials, there is another point, that is, if the original valuation on the books is too low (commonly known as thick bottom), the firm can estimate the accurate price allowed by law according to the principle of taking the lower of cost and market price. The so-called market price, according to Article 5 of the First Category Collection Guidelines, refers to the prevailing price in the local market at the time of settlement. The price jointly formulated by the local chamber of commerce or trade association is naturally regarded as the prevailing price in the market. 4. Regarding fixed assets, long-established and stable industrial and commercial institutions, in order to prevent business decline, often make extreme depreciation of assets such as houses, land, machinery, tools, and living things, so that they are far from the actual price. This is a constant example. In order to prevent tax evasion, the income tax law has to crack down on unreasonable hidden profits. Therefore, many meticulous asset valuation methods have been attached to the first category collection guidelines for compliance. This is a matter for the future. When the income tax begins to be implemented, industrial and commercial operators should check whether the value expressed on the books of all existing assets is real. If it is too low, then underestimating assets is underestimating capital, which is increasing the burden of income tax. In order to eliminate this shortcoming, the value should be re-estimated in a practical manner to achieve the purpose of accurately representing the financial situation. As for the various fixed assets, their names, quantities, original prices, market prices, years of use, and currently estimated prices should be recorded separately as a basis for future depreciation and investigation. If there are relevant supporting documents, such as construction contracts, sales contracts, and various invoices and receipts, they should also be kept separately for proof. 5. Regarding branch store accounts, Article 6 of the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that if the head office and its branches and business offices are all within the territory of the Republic of China and their capital is divided among themselves, their income should be calculated separately. Article 2 of the Draft Guidelines for the First Category Collection stipulates that the division of capital between the head office and its branches referred to in the Implementation Rules refers to the capital and business of the branches being completely independent. According to the above regulations, if an industrial and commercial institution has branches opened in other places, the business负责人 should examine the actual situation and decide whether it is necessary to divide the capital between the head office and the branches. In the future, the transactions between the branches and the head office should be sorted out in a practical and clear manner, and no ambiguity should be allowed. 6. Regarding investments in affiliated businesses, it is common for an industrial and commercial institution to independently establish profit-making businesses of different natures in the same or different places due to certain needs. However, capital is often not independently divided. Instead, the name of a reciprocal account is used to allow the use of funds, and the profit and loss at the end of the year can also be disposed of at will. After the implementation of income tax, problems will arise. According to the law, capital should be divided and business should be operated independently. This is also a matter that needs to be prepared immediately. 7. Regarding loss and profit accounts, the most important point is that for the accounts of sales and purchases of general industrial and commercial firms, in addition to indicating the debts owed for the purchases in the accounts in the goods source book and the claims arising from the sales in the accounts in the customer book, which are asset and liability books, and recording the daily transactions in the business books, which are auxiliary books of a running nature, there is a lack of a comprehensive and continuous record of the quantity and amount of sales and purchases in the general ledger. The closing balance of the account is only sufficient to indicate the received part of the accounts receivable and is not sufficient to indicate all credit transactions. Therefore, the investigation of the business situation must be added up day by day and household by household, and it cannot be seen at a glance. If "total sales" and "total purchases" accounts are set up in the general ledger, and the transactions of cash purchases, credit purchases, cash sales, and credit sales are recorded separately, the accounting purposes can be achieved with only a slight increase in the procedure. In addition, such as the receipt of accounts receivable, all the roundings and changes, etc., should be set up separately as a subject for sorting out.

㊂ Pay attention to studying the content of the income tax law. Since the relationship between income tax laws and regulations and industry and commerce is extremely close, industrial and commercial operators should thoroughly understand its content, especially the procedures for declaration, investigation, and review, and should study it at any time. If there are any opinions, they should be contributed to the government so that the implementation of the income tax law will not encounter obstacles, and the system itself can be improved day by day. In the future, they should also pay attention to court precedents, resolutions of review committees, explanatory letters and orders of the Ministry of Finance, and theoretical explorations by experts and scholars at any time, so that they can almost cope with everything at ordinary times, and when difficulties or disputes arise, they can calmly handle them at their discretion. This kind of attention and research is continuous. It is best to be led by the Chamber of Commerce or the Industry Association for greater effectiveness.

㊃ Whether to declare the absorption of deposits and capital, etc. According to the announcement of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, if industrial and commercial institutions receive deposits, they should report to the local offices before the end of February of this year. Companies, commercial firms, factories, and profit-making individuals should also report their brand names, addresses, responsible person's name, operating capital or paid-in capital before the end of February. If it is a limited company or a limited partnership with shares, the total number of shares, types, amount per share, and operating year should also be reported.

### New Directors of the Public Concession's Municipal Council

The US and Japan Have Already Nominated, the British Position Is Still Vacant

According to the Shanghai Times, the new directors of the Public Concession's Municipal Council will be elected by foreign taxpayers on April 5th and 6th. The number of seats is two each for the US and Japan, and five for the UK. The US candidates have recently been nominated by the US Community Committee in this city, namely current director Mr. Fessenden, a lawyer, and Mr. Bland, the new president of the US Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. The Japanese candidates were also announced last Friday by the presidents of the Japanese Association and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in this city, namely Mr. Yamamoto, director of the Shanghai branch of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, and Mr. Ube, president of the Shanghai branch of Mitsubishi Corporation. Both are current directors. The UK candidates have not yet been nominated. It is said that of the current five directors, except for Mr. Brett, the remaining four will leave Shanghai due to business or other reasons, so they are unwilling to be re-elected and others need to be nominated. It is said that the British Community Association in this city has decided to hold a meeting within days to nominate them. Although there are only five seats, there will be at least ten candidates nominated. As for the Chinese directors, there are also five seats, and they can be selected within days. Therefore, judging from the current situation, since the nominated candidates are equal to the statutory number of seats, the candidates do not need to compete in this election, and foreign taxpayers do not need to vote. The new directors can be decided. Furthermore, although the Japanese community has only nominated two candidates this time, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun in this city still published an editorial stating that this move by the Japanese community does not mean that it has given up its advocacy of increasing the number of Japanese directors to three.

### Civic Association Writes to the Municipal Council to Speed Up the Construction of Low-Cost Housing

To Avoid Tens of Thousands of Shantytown Dwellers Becoming Homeless

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Civic Joint Association of the First Special District wrote to the Municipal Council regarding the Municipal Council's deadline for the demolition of shantytowns on various roads in the Hongkou District, stating that, according to reports from shantytown representatives Tang Anping, Wang Qiben, Sun Hankui, and others in the Hongkou District, the Municipal Council has set a deadline of May 1 of this year for all shantytowns on Dalian Bay Road, Yulin Road, Qiwupu Road, Pingliang Road, Lanhua Road, Yangshupu Road, and Zhaofeng Road, and the boundary road of the concession to be relocated voluntarily, otherwise the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council will demolish them. This has caused extreme panic among the shantytown dwellers in the area, and they have come to the association one after another to ask for help. The shantytown problem was previously suggested by this association to the Municipal Council to raise funds to build low-cost housing to accommodate them in order to gradually eliminate shantytowns. It was later learned that the Municipal Council had a plan to implement the construction of low-cost housing, which was a source of great joy. However, the Municipal Council suddenly ordered the demolition of shantytowns on various roads in the Hongkou District, disregarding the livelihood of tens of thousands of shantytown dwellers and allowing them to become homeless. The impact of this is enough to become a burden on public security, and this association cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are writing to the Municipal Council to ask it to consider the livelihood of the poor and not demolish the shantytowns, and to speed up the realization of the construction of low-cost housing in order to seek a fundamental solution.

### Jade Art Preview Attracts Enthusiastic Visitors

It was a weekend, and although it was only open for half a day, from 1:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the number of visitors was unusually crowded, and there was almost no room to stand inside. The audience surrounded the enclosure and were reluctant to leave after careful examination, causing those who came late to regret their visit.

Because the Capital National Hospital is a public welfare undertaking in society, I am a National Doctor, and I must donate as much as I can. Moreover, I am honored by the kindness of Chen and Jiao, and how can I refuse? I will not set up a auditorium or prepare a banquet, which can both avoid killing and save materials and resources. All the money received will be donated to the National Hospital to help the good deeds and save lives.

I sincerely hope that comrades from all over the world and philanthropists at home and abroad can help the Capital National Hospital when there are celebrations, so that the collection of armpits can be successful.

A woman named Cao from Shaoxing, thirty-four years old this year, married Long Haijin (forty years old this year), a Sichuanese who worked as a cook. They lived in a room in the Suzhou native Gu Xiangqing's house, No. 211, Ma Lang Road, in the French Concession. The couple had a good relationship, but she was infertile and suffered from syphilis, which had been treated repeatedly, but ultimately it would flare up and then recede, and she could not be completely cured. Recently, it recurred and became uncontrollable, causing ulcers in her lower body and unbearable pain.

### Lake Society Holds Discussions on the Yongxin Wheel Disaster Case

Three Measures Decided to Assist the Bereaved Families

The Lake Society of this city held a discussion meeting for the bereaved families of the Yongxin Wheel disaster at the society at 1:00 PM yesterday. In addition to the society's committee members Pan Gongzhan and Shen Jiesheng, representatives from the Wujiang County Government, Pingwang Police Station, Wujiang No. 8 District Office, Pingwang Chamber of Commerce, the First Administrative Inspectorate of Zhejiang Province, the Wuxing County Government, the Shanghai Tongxiang Association of Wujiang, and the bereaved families all attended. The chairman, Shen Tianxin, reported the purpose of the meeting, and then Huang Ren, the head of the Pingwang Public Security Bureau, reported:

Important Report　He stated briefly that the bureau only received the report two hours after the sinking of the Yongxin Wheel. He immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Yongshun Company and sent police to the scene of the accident, together with the water police patrol boat, to supervise the recovery of corpses and objects. Throughout the day, no one from the Yongshun Shipping Company was seen, nor was any report received from the Yongshun Company. The so-called heavy machinery from the company departed from Shanghai at 11:00 AM on the 4th and arrived at Pingwang on the 5th. Several boatmen came with it, claiming they would only salvage the ship and refused to salvage the corpses. This was what was agreed upon by the Yongshun Company. After repeated discussions, it was agreed that 5 yuan would be paid for each corpse salvaged. However, due to the large number of corpses, it was not until the afternoon of the 7th that all were salvaged, a total of 54 corpses.

Three Requests　Subsequently, Wu Lusheng, Wang Zhaoji, Liu Enzhen, Lu Jingxian, and others from the bereaved families successively expressed their opinions, expressing deep indignation at the company's improper handling and requesting three points: ㊀ Strictly punish the employees who caused the accident, ㊁ Compensate for the losses according to the law, ㊂ Request the Lake Society to uphold justice and provide assistance to the best of its ability.

Lake Society's Assistance　Finally, lawyer Wang from the Lake Society's legal team expressed two points based on the facts: ㊀ The Lake Society, standing as a fellow native organization, will do its best to assist in the administrative part. ㊁ As for the judicial part, the Wujiang County Government, which also handles judicial affairs, is already investigating, and each family can follow the summons for interrogation. It was decided to implement three measures: ㊀ The Lake Society will invite the person in charge of Yongshun Company to discuss again, ㊁ Regarding the administrative aspects, the Lake Society will do its best to assist each bereaved family, ㊂ The Lake Society will compile the reports from all parties and send them to the Wujiang County Government for prosecution. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.

Economic Special Issue

### Adjusting the World's Currency

— Translated by Xie Juceng

This article is from Professor Ganmoer's new book, published in the recent issue of Nation's Business magazine, specially translated for reference.

On September 26, 1936, the long-anticipated collapse of the French gold standard was formally announced. The French government, to make it sound more appealing, euphemistically stated that it was suggesting to the parliament to "adjust the currency," followed by the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and Czechoslovakia, quickly making similar announcements.

Simultaneous with the French declaration, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France announced that they had established an agreement to strive for stability in international exchange rates. Although the wording of the three governments' statements was not identical, the nature was entirely the same.

According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement, the purpose of the agreement was to maintain "the greatest possible balance in the international exchange rate system." The three governments agreed to "avoid, as much as possible, the potential disturbances to the international exchange rate basis caused by this proposed adjustment," and invited other countries to cooperate, whereupon Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands were invited to join successively.

(I) The Movement of Gold

On October 13, a supplementary agreement was announced. According to the U.S. side, this move was the U.S.'s "intention" to "sell gold to various countries for immediate export or designated for use in balancing or stabilizing exchange rate funds. And these countries must similarly express their willingness to sell gold to the United States, under conditions satisfactory to the United States." The selling agency was the New York Federal Reserve Bank representing the Treasury Department, with the price set at US$35 per ounce, plus a handling fee of 0.15%.

On the same day, the U.S. announced that Britain and France had complied with the terms of the agreement, and thus this plan became effective among the three countries.

Those who have always been concerned about this issue were not surprised by this supplementary agreement. Because it was recognized that if France abandoned the gold standard, it would be necessary to establish such an agreement in order to continue international gold settlements. The reasons can be summarized as follows:

The U.S. Treasury Department has long stipulated that gold exports from the country are limited to countries on the gold standard that can maintain a fixed gold buying and selling price. Because whenever natural economic trends cause gold to flow into the United States, the United States can only reasonably expect to obtain gold from these countries. The countries that meet this requirement are France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with France being particularly important. The United States, of course, is not among them. As for France itself, it has never restricted gold exports, and U.S. payments to other countries, including gold exports, often flowed into France. To facilitate gold exports, the Bank of France specifically established a basic reference point for the value of gold, also serving as a means for other countries to transfer gold deposits among themselves.

When France, Belgium, and the Netherlands abandoned the gold standard, they completely broke this agreement. Therefore, U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced a supplementary agreement on January 13 to replace it. This was a new clear agreement among the three countries on gold settlements, inviting other countries to join. The agreement allowed each of the three countries to use its stabilization fund to convert the amount owed to other countries into gold at the agreed exchange rate, or to allocate gold held overseas to its domestic account, or to transport gold from the country for this purpose.

The practical result of this implementation is to restrict the movement of gold between the countries concerned for those countries and government agencies affected by the stabilization fund. Therefore, the role of the supplementary agreement is simply a tool of the first agreement.

The essence of the two agreements includes the following three items:

(1) The world's two most important countries are actually cooperating under a plan, from a monetary standpoint, to seek exchange rate stability. Given the breakdown of the World Economic Conference three years ago, and the volatility of international exchange rates in recent years, this move in itself is a truly progressive approach.

(2) The plan establishes an international clearing mechanism, serving as the basis for international gold settlement.

(3) The plan includes a declaration of intent to reduce the numerous international trade restrictions that have emerged in recent years, as such restrictions have a significant impact on currency disturbances and exchange rate fluctuations.

(II) The Importance of Balance Outweighs Stability

However, there are still some things not included in the exchange rate stabilization agreement. First, they did not specify the monetary basis for stabilizing international exchange rates. They focused on maintaining the balance of exchange rates, but they did not say anything about important issues such as the monetary unit on which the balance is based, or the method of standard. Looking at the entire agreement, its basic plan may be the gold standard, the silver standard, the bimetallic standard, the price index standard, or even any well-managed currency. Clearly, exchange rates can be kept in balance either in a situation of rapid inflation, or in a situation of rapid deflation, or in a situation of stable prices, assuming that the general price changes between countries are the same. At the same time, this agreement can be interpreted and implemented to cater to the wishes of the orthodox proponents of the gold standard, and can also be interpreted and implemented to satisfy the desires of those who advocate the commodity currency standard.

Second, this agreement does not specify a definite period, but is merely a day-to-day approach. A clause like "exchange rate stability" or "exchange rate balance" usually cannot fix the relative value between different currencies for a long period of time. Therefore, the "exchange rate stabilization agreement" among the three countries can be canceled every day, as long as any party involved lacks the element of stability, they can come forward and argue.

This plan may tolerate the introduction of a better situation for some time; it may collapse at any time in the exchange rate war. The devaluation of the currencies of France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Switzerland as a result of artificial stimulation is sufficient to benefit the export trade of these countries, but in this situation, how Germany, Russia, and Japan will choose their currency policies is indeed a serious matter.

France's new monetary law authorizes the government to reduce the gold content of the franc from 25% to 34%. Switzerland also enacted similar laws, reducing the gold content of the Swiss franc from 30% to 40%. Italy reduced the gold content of the lira to 40% to 50%. As for the Netherlands, it did not announce a specific ratio, temporarily allowing the guilder to float on the exchange rate market.

Almost every country that devalued its currency obtained a stabilization or balance fund, generated from the so-called "devaluation profit." The so-called devaluation profit is the value of the gold reserve, expressed in the difference between the gold content of the old currency and the gold content of the new currency. For example, the gold reserve of France, from its old value devalued to 74.8% of the gold content of the franc, was re-evaluated on this basis, resulting in a "gold profit" of approximately 17,000,000,000 francs, all owned by the government. Of this amount, 10,000,000,000 francs—equivalent to approximately US$466,000,000 at the current price—were separately allocated to establish a balance fund, managed by the Bank of France to maintain the value of the franc within the limits prescribed by law.

The impact of exchange rate transactions and gold movements caused by this huge stabilization fund is controlled by the governments concerned, mostly carried out secretly by the central banks of various countries.

In summary, this is my judgment, that the recent successive devaluations of the gold bloc countries, as well as the plan for international currency stabilization, all indicate progress towards currency stability. I further believe that when the time comes, it will force international currency to stabilize on a gold basis, for which the reasons may be traced back to past history.

(III) The Pursuit of the Gold Standard

When the European War broke out in 1914, almost all advanced countries were using the gold standard—a standard they had reached after centuries of experimentation with and criticism of other standards—the gold standard was not working perfectly, but it was much better than the silver standard, bimetallic standard, and managed paper standard that prevailed in the past. People generally believed that the gold standard was the currency standard with the best performance in past experiments, and the real question for the future was not the issue of replacing the gold standard with some other standard, but how to make the gold standard a more superior international currency standard.

During the Great War and the first two years after the war, currency standards collapsed almost everywhere, and every gold standard country abandoned it. Although the United States' departure from the gold standard was not as severe as other countries, it also had to restrict gold exports. As for other currency standards, they also declared bankruptcy, and even some countries implemented a managed paper standard during the war, experiencing extreme currency depreciation.

When the war ended, countries were determined to quickly restore the gold standard, which obviously greatly increased the demand for gold, and if the pre-war currency units were still used, the result would be a sharp drop in prices. If all countries restored the gold standard to the high price level of the United States in 1920, then there would not be enough gold in the world for circulation. Sure enough, in the late 1920s and early 1921, the anticipated price collapse arrived. Within a year, U.S. wholesale prices fell by 44%, which also represents an 80% increase in the value of gold.

This increase in the value of gold greatly encouraged gold production, and thus the gold mining industry, which had been severely hit during the war, quickly recovered.

After the peace treaty was signed, most of the gold hoarded and inactive during the war was released into circulation. The world slowly and resolutely returned to the gold standard. The outflow of this hoarded gold, together with the increase in gold mine production, and the improvement in methods of saving gold in currency use, were sufficient to meet the needs arising from the restoration of the gold standard. By 1927, most countries had restored the gold basis. As for the value of gold, measured by its purchasing power over goods, it was simply extremely stable from the late 1921s until the outbreak of the world panic in the late 1929s.

(IV) Devaluing the Value of Gold

Many countries' restoration of the gold standard did not want to rebuild their pre-war gold parity, but to stabilize on the greatly devalued gold value in their paper currency units at that time. In other words, they were stabilizing on the gold value that represented their true face at the time. For example, France stabilized the franc at US$0.0392, instead of the pre-war US$0.193; Italy stabilized at US$0.0526, instead of the pre-war US$0.193. As for some countries that had experienced crazy inflation, such as Poland, Germany, etc., they created new currency units, representing a huge multiple of the value of the paper money circulating at that time. For example, Germany stipulated that one hundred trillion paper marks were equivalent to one gold mark.

This stabilization method can minimize the disturbances to current prices and wages caused by this. However, a small number of European countries, whose currencies had been devalued, then began to restore their pre-war gold currency units, with Britain being the most prominent. Once the exchange controls maintained during the war were lifted, the gold value of the pound sterling immediately fell. Until February 1920, it fell to US$3.195. After that, it slowly rose, but encountered many obstacles and some strong reactions, until the spring of 1926, when the gold standard was re-established at the old gold parity.

When Britain restored the gold standard to US$4.87 per pound sterling, it went through a long and painful process of deflation, raising the gold value of the pound sterling from an extremely low level by 52%. Their government adopted this deflation plan, disregarding the advice of many famous economists and financial experts in their country, and also ignoring the criticisms of general famous economists in other countries. And the economic difficulties that Britain encountered in these years and the following years cannot but be attributed to this violent deflation policy.

During most of the period from 1921 to 1929, British prices showed a strong decline, but at the same time, U.S. prices, measured by the famous U.S. index, were relatively more stable.

The contraction of the pound sterling made British export trade suffer a lot. Because the gold value of the pound sterling rose, the amount of money received by exporters from foreign countries was less and less when converted into pounds sterling. For example, if he exported goods to the United States and sold them for US$100,000, assuming the exchange rate was US$3.33 1/3, he could receive £30,000; if the exchange rate rose to US$4, he would only get £25,000. And in fact, the decline in the cost of exporters was definitely not as fast as the rise in the gold value of the pound sterling.

Deflation also increased the British government's post-war financial burden, because it raised the value of the pound sterling used to pay off large amounts of domestic debt and pensions. And the most important thing was that the rise in the gold value of the pound sterling could not reduce wages, because the British trade unions were very powerful, and their resistance was very effective. This increased the cost of British exports competing in overseas markets. Therefore, during most of this period, British export trade was greatly weakened, and it could no longer compete with important rivals such as the United States and Germany in the world market. Because Britain is an island country, with a small territory, the welfare of the United Kingdom relies on her foreign trade, far more than her main competitors.

When the panic of 1929 began, prices in gold standard countries around the world fell sharply, and confidence was reduced to a low point everywhere. The world scrambled for gold for safety, and at that time, measured by prices, the value of gold was extremely high.

Britain had undergone a long period of deflation, during which she raised the value of the paper currency from approximately 3.195 gold dollars to 4.87 gold dollars. When she restored the paper currency to gold parity, before she could catch her breath, the value of gold itself soared due to the world economic panic, thus putting her on a further path of deflation.

Britain's gold standard finally ran out of steam and declared bankruptcy. On September 21, 1931, it stopped gold payments. The gold value of the pound sterling quickly plummeted. In 1935, it was on average about 4% lower than the old U.S. dollar exchange rate.

(V) Heavy Blows to the World Currency System

Originally, the world monetary system had already suffered major pressure due to the world economic panic, and at this point, it was hit hard by the collapse of the pound sterling. Since Britain broke away from the gold standard, the gold standards of most of the British territories and colonies, the Nordic countries, and some South American countries were also kicked over by Britain, disrupting the world's currency and causing many exchange rate wars.

In the next few years, one country after another successively abandoned the gold standard, and even the United States, which had the largest gold supply in the world, joined this group in early 1933. At the beginning of 1936, only a few countries were left that still retained the pre-recession gold standard, and Belgium and the United States returned to the gold standard after devaluing their currencies.

This situation caused disorder in international trade and international finance. It is a universally recognized principle that when the foreign exchange value of a country's currency unit declines, its export trade will be stimulated, and the import of goods will be hit. The decline in exchange rates acts like an import tax on import trade, but this is a temporary phenomenon. Once prices and wages are able to return to equilibrium, this phenomenon disappears, and this stimulation of exports and hindrance of imports is part of the mechanical action of returning to equilibrium. But this process takes time, often involves pain, and because the exchange rate stimulates exports, they are not welcomed by the other country, and as a result, they must impose various restrictions on what is called exchange rate dumping.

On the other hand, using a devalued currency to impose a special burden on a country's import trade can create new and broad benefits in uneconomical industries. In this situation, everyone competes in the market, eventually leading to a large number of restrictions and prohibitions piling up on international trade.

Such exchange rate wars have affected almost every country. If a logical conclusion is sought, it can be summarized into a reductio ad absurdum argument. A country adopts a policy of continuously devaluing its currency to stimulate exports and hinder imports, so that more and more of its goods are sent to foreigners, while fewer and fewer goods are received from foreigners. A country cannot get rich in this way.

(VI) An International Gold Unit Will Inevitably Be Re-established

During this exchange rate war, countries that did not devalue their currencies were greatly harmed. They lost the export market of countries with cheap currencies. Making their domestic industries suffer unfortunate reactions, affecting a country's budget. If these countries have sufficient and solid economic and political power to resist such attacks until domestic and foreign price exchange rates return to equilibrium, then there is of course no problem. They can ignore it, and even prove that the suffering they have suffered is less than that of the devaluing countries. Unfortunately, the opposite is true, putting them in a very difficult position.

The recent devaluations of France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and Czechoslovakia can make their currency units gradually balance with the currency units of countries that have already devalued, and can remove many of the obstacles that these gold bloc countries have encountered in competing in world export trade in recent years, and can make these newly devalued countries compete with the countries that have already devalued, becoming stronger rivals than in the past.

All of these situations, if the countries concerned move forward according to the policy, and no longer re-enter the vortex of new exchange rate wars due to temporary favorable and unfavorable shifts in foreign trade competition caused by recent currency devaluations, then it is not difficult to move towards a more stable balance.

Although the agreement does not stipulate the need to return to the gold standard, I dare to believe that the logical result of such an agreement will be to re-establish an international gold standard. Such a gold standard is the only basis on which the permanent equilibrium of international exchange rates stipulated in the agreement can be maintained. Naturally, such a gold standard cannot be completely automatic. All currencies must be managed to some extent. Assuming that any permanent and stable international exchange rate plan is launched, the close cooperation of central banks of various countries is also necessary.

Today, there is no consensus on the merits of the silver standard or the bimetallic standard. A few places, such as Britain, the United States, and the Nordic countries, have a very strong public opinion, in favor of some form of managed currency or commodity standard. But even in these countries, the general rational view tends towards the gold standard. Of course, this situation is especially true in the United States.

We may take the statement in the famous Macmillan Report a few months before Britain broke away from the gold standard in 1931 as the conclusion of this article.

"...Perhaps there is no more important goal within the scope of human skills than to make the world achieve a complete scientific monetary system. But to make the world monetary system become a whole one as soon as possible, there is probably little or no hope of progress, unless it evolves from the historical gold standard...

### Yarn and Cloth

Cloth Sales Surge

U.S. Cotton Prices Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with extremely active trading. Prices rose by 14 to 25 points for various months due to large-scale purchases by the public, foreign firms, industry players, and speculators. The rise in the Liverpool and Egyptian markets, and cloth sales reaching 80 million yards, also contributed to the price increase. Later, long positions were closed and cotton farmers hedged their sales, causing a partial reaction. However, sales volume was absorbed. The current cotton situation is still tight. The Commodity Loan Corporation reported that, as of the 4th, 615,641 bales of cotton pledged had been sold. The recent increase in new outside investors and fears of international inflation have led to extremely high market prices. Spot prices rose by 17 points, and futures prices rose by 16 to 23 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 18 points, and futures prices rose by 21.2 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to favorable foreign news, then retraced due to profit-taking. However, due to large-scale purchases and short covering, market prices rose again. Pingguoer rose by 5 to 5.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 5.75 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 6 to 6.5 rupees.

According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 8th is: Bairoxi at 238.5 rupees, Pingguoer at 189.5 rupees, both up by 0.5 rupees, and Aomula at 221.25 rupees, up by 0.25 rupees.

### Grains

Sub-White Japonica Rises and Falls

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few ships arriving from the river downstream routes, only 15 or 16. Sales of various goods in the market were average. Top-grade white japonica was slightly weak by a small number of points, while mid-grade goods were stable. Lower-grade goods were slightly tight. The market turned weak later. Early rice arrivals were scarce, and although transactions were not brisk, prices were firm. The top grade of thin rice prices barely stood, while medium and lower grades showed a soft trend. Scattered transactions were sluggish due to cloudy weather. The market was flat and weak. Other rice varieties were similar to the previous market.

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over twenty source groups, with a total of 4,300 to 4,400 shi of goods. Sales in this street market were moving, but the appetite was not strong. Only Tianjin, Qingdao, Xi'an, and other groups handled 1,500 to 1,600 packages of thin rice. Therefore, although the arrival of goods was not large, the market condition was only average. The prices of thick and thin japonica were slightly firm for zero sales, while wholesale prices remained at the original level. The supply and demand of Dujian and Yinyuan were similar, and there was no difference.

### A Review of American Economic Conditions and Raw Silk Consumption (Continued)

— Tian Yu

The above clearly demonstrates to us that: (1) Although last year's silk prices did not reach the high levels of the previous year after October, they maintained a price of US$1.67 per pound and exceeded the previous year's average price of US$1.56 per pound almost every month; (2) When compared to the same period in the previous year, the extent of the increase was even greater, with some months reaching nearly 30%. Even when comparing the average price over nine months, there was still an increase of around 17%; (3) The average price per pound for these nine months was US$1.6683, which is a significant increase of over 34.3% compared to the average price of US$1.242 per pound in 1934. This is something that deserves special attention.

Based on observations from various sources regarding employment rates and industrial rates, which can indicate the degree of general purchasing power recovery, the indices for January to March of last year showed an increase of approximately 3-6% compared to the same period in 1934. However, the trend of real wages stagnated due to the rise in the cost of living in the middle of last year. According to government publications, national income increased by approximately 14%, or US$60 million, compared to 1934. Therefore, the estimated increase in general purchasing power is about 10% or less. However, the price of raw silk exceeded that of 1934 by as much as 34.3%. Even if the purchasing power of raw silk increased in proportion to the general purchasing power, it would still be about a quarter less than in 1934. Naturally, the only way to compensate for this reduction rate is to reduce consumption. This explains why last year's silk consumption in the United States (average over nine months) decreased by 15-25% compared to the previous year and 1934.

Furthermore, the increase in purchasing power in the United States was offset by the rise in the cost of living. In particular, since last year, the prices of agricultural products have risen slightly due to the drought, food costs have increased significantly, and the prices of heavy industrial products have also increased, forcing up the cost of housing, fuel, and lighting. In this environment of rising living costs, expenditure on clothing has shown a downward trend month by month. Therefore, raw silk, in the laggard increase of living costs in the United States, had to retreat in the consumer competition. The table below shows this:

Because of the decrease in spending on clothing, the demand for essential clothing items could not be reduced in proportion. Therefore, consideration had to be given to the materials used. Although wool enjoyed particularly good fortune the year before (consumption increased by 78% compared to 1934), last year it had to be replaced by cotton and rayon. If that was the case for wool, it was certainly the case for raw silk, this is the first point. The increase in agricultural product prices caused the price of cotton, a commodity produced and supplied by the United States itself, to increase accordingly. However, precisely because it is a domestic product, it is generally promoted more. Raw silk, on the other hand, comes from abroad and does not have this kind of linked relationship, this is the second point. Speaking only of raw silk and rayon, in terms of consumption, raw silk showed a particularly severe contraction during the transition period of June and July. In contrast, rayon rose, reaching an unprecedentedly good situation during June and July, with the consumption index rising to around 145. Generally speaking, when the price of raw silk exceeds the price of rayon by a certain amount, the consumption area of ​​raw silk is invaded by rayon. According to past experience, this degree is about two and a half times. For example, if the price of rayon is less than US$0.6 per pound, the price of raw silk will be above US$1.5 per pound. Furthermore, the average price of Japanese silk "Special XX Crack" on the New York spot market for ten months was US$1.8 per pound, while Chinese silk "White Filature 21" was also around US$1.7 per pound. This price difference is indeed the only reason for rayon to encroach on raw silk. Leaving aside women's hand-knitted stockings, which are exclusively dominated by raw silk, in terms of fabrics, which account for nearly half of total US consumption, raw silk is now retreating across the board in its competition with rayon, especially in the area of ​​wide fabrics. According to Mr. Inoue's opinion, one reason is that the American people's consumption psychology towards clothing fibers is different from before the panic and that they consider it from an economic perspective. On the other hand, the high and volatile price of raw silk means that changes in fabric raw material costs are immediately reflected in the finished products, making prices unstable. As a result, general fabric manufacturers are showing a relatively hesitant attitude, which is indeed a timely view.

In short, the result of the economic boom in the United States is that silk prices rise along with general prices (here, the relationship between supply and demand must not be forgotten—the decrease in supply passively stimulates silk prices to rise). However, (1) the economic boom in the United States is still on the road to recovery and has not yet reached the normal level, so it inevitably has some shortcomings; (2) on the eve of the second world war, the economic boom has somewhat of a steel smell and lacks a direct influence on raw silk. Therefore, the result of the high price of raw silk is to promote the decline in raw silk consumption. It can be seen that the benefits of the economic boom to raw silk are not the same as to other industries, with an equal proportional distribution of benefits. Although, it cannot be denied that there is a considerable stimulating effect.

5.  Chinese and Japanese Silk in the American Market

After analyzing the impact of American economic conditions on raw silk consumption, we will then discuss the situation of China and Japan, the two major raw silk suppliers for American consumption. Because the two countries have different geographical and personal situations, their supply to American consumption naturally has its own different trends. A review of this issue is one of the main purposes of this article, as it is directly related to China.

In the past, the American raw silk consumption market was exclusively dominated by Japan. In recent years, it has increased from 80% of the total amount to over 90%. The first to be affected by this is naturally Chinese silk. According to statistics, the decline of Chinese silk exports to the United States has retreated from 25% in 1923 to less than 2% in 1934. However, in 1935, judging from the trend after the slight increase in consumption in the United States, Chinese silk and Japanese silk showed a strong struggle. According to a survey by the National Fabric Manufacturers Association of the United States, Japanese exports to the United States increased by only 9.5% in 1935 compared to 1934 (421,006 bales in 1943 and 461,246 bales in 1995), while Chinese silk exports to the United States almost tripled in 1935 compared to 1934 (7,807 bales in 1934 and 22,761 bales in 1935). As for the quantity consumed, Japanese silk increased by only 6.7% (446,004 bales in 1934 and 475,952 bales in 1935), while Chinese silk increased by about 77% (10,316 bales in 1934 and 18,257 bales in 1935). The intensity of the competition can be imagined, and it is also clear why China's silk industry received such good stimulation the year before.

Because the world's raw silk suppliers are mainly China and Japan, there must be an inverse proportional relationship between their raw silk exports. As a result, the consumer competition between Chinese silk and Japanese silk was still very tense last year. According to the survey by the above-mentioned agency, when observing the recent trend of American raw silk imports in the past ten months, with the monthly average number of the previous year as the base, both China and Japan showed a declining trend. However, the degree of decline of Chinese silk was 14 points lower than that of Japan. Japanese silk decreased by an average of 16% compared to the previous year in the past ten months, while Chinese silk had a decline of 30%. However, recently, there has been a gradual tendency to recover. The situation of Chinese silk and Japanese silk exports to the United States in the past ten months is listed below to see the whole picture:

### Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (4)

— Pan Shihao

(1) Report Form for Firms (Continued)

(1) Remarks: After filling in all the above items, other items that need to be declared at the same time can be filled in the remarks section. There are about two aspects to these remarks: (1) Public reserve fund and retained earnings, etc. According to the current laws regarding income tax, although they cannot be included in the capital calculation when calculating the income tax rate, many people in the society have requested the Ministry of Finance to broaden the scope of the public reserve fund stipulated in Articles 7 and 15 of the Taxpayer's Guide. In the future, the goal may be achieved. It would not be useless to declare it now. (2) The head office and branch can declare their firms separately, and their business income can be calculated together to pay income tax. According to the provisions of Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, if the capital of the head office and branch are divided, their income should be calculated separately. Article 2 of the Draft Collection Instructions for the First Category of Business Income Tax states that the division of capital between the head office and its branch offices mentioned in Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation refers to cases where the capital and business of the branch office are completely independent. According to the interpretation of the Ministry of Finance, if the brand name of the branch office is different from that of the head office, and its capital and business are not completely independent, its income will still be calculated together with the head office. In this case, there should be very few cases where the head office and branch office calculate income tax separately. Regardless of whether the brand name is the same or whether the capital is divided, as long as the source of the capital is the same, it can be taxed together. The so-called completely independent business is rarely found in practice. Therefore, when declaring a firm, the name and address of the branch office should be filled in the remarks section so that it can be checked when taxation is consolidated in the future.

(7) Date of Filing: The month and day of filing this form should also be clearly filled in. All the items declared above are the situation at the time of filing. If there are any changes in the future, no matter what kind of matter is changed, a declaration of change must be made. The receiving agency for this form is the local competent collection agency. In Shanghai, it is the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance (on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs Building). When sending it, you can record it in the return receipt book and obtain a receipt for collection. According to the format of this report form, there is no need to affix the firm's seal or prepare a separate letter.

Spring and Autumn

Special Issue on the National Flower

### Preserved Plum

— (Xu Yunqiu)

Lyrics of the Mei Lu Lou: In the year of Yichou, He Zizhen and Wu Pingzhai drank in Pan Yangxian's studio and composed a poem on potted plum blossoms, using the original rhyme of Su Dongpo's "Water Melody": A tree, a round moon, another ancient plum heaven, mountain fist curved hunched, flower longevity unknown, also called bamboo fence thatched cottage, also called grand hall golden house, style always high cold, expected to be Miao Gushe, little exiled to the mortal world. Slanting shadow, solitary crane stands, thin dragon sleeps, short screen curved table clear supply, bottles and pots arranged in a circle, carved by Wu Gang's fairy axe, moved next to Zhen Niang's fragrant tomb, experiencing kalpas to get heaven complete, married to Geng An's painting, white sleeves are more charming. Note: Potted plum blossoms in Wuzhong are best planted by Gu Zhong'an. During the Gengshen Rebellion, the gardener moved them to a remote place in Tiger Hill, so they were safe and sound. My friend, the owner of the Ziluolan'an Studio, has the same hobby as Zhong'an, and his collection of fine species even exceeds his; and his elegant gatherings of poetry and wine, and the joy of feasting on flowers, are no less than those of the Pan family in those years. Now, I have selected a dozen of the most precious ones to participate in the Wuzhong Literature Exhibition. I once read Chen Meigong's "Peaceful Chats" saying: Red plum blossoms used to be popular in Suzhou, and Yan Yuanxian transplanted them to his Xigang mansion; one day, a wealthy tourist bribed the gardener and got a branch to graft. From then on, there were two trees in the capital. This can also prove that red plum blossoms originally came from Suzhou. Therefore, Zhou Jun brought these fairies from Luofu Mountain to the grand meeting, which is truly enough to add luster to Wuzhong's literature and make each other more brilliant.

### On Plum Blossoms

— Tang Dongyuan

Plum, ancient writing as 某, symbolizes the fruit on the tree, later written as 梅, follows 每, a homophone. The Book says, "If you want to make a harmonious soup, you only need plum and salt." If so, it means to mediate various flavors, so calligraphers mistakenly used it as Ganmu, using 梅 for 楳.

Gushan and Yuling are famous in lyrics, and Mei Fei and Mei Xuan are listed in biographies. Lin Bu of the Song Dynasty built a hut on Gushan in West Lake without marrying or having children. He planted many plum trees and raised cranes, using them as his plum wife and crane sons. The ancients called plum blossoms, pine trees, and bamboo the Three Friends of Winter, because they can help people with a clear, noble, and elegant demeanor.

Plum blossoms bloom before the leaves in early spring, with a fragrant aroma, so Jia Sixie said: Plum blossoms are superior in fragrance, peach blossoms are superior in color. I say: No, who doesn't go alone among the Dengwei and Xixi plum blossoms in full bloom, without calling, fragrance and color are both excellent.

Plum, Rosaceae family, deciduous, leaves are broad oval or oval, pointed at the tip, with serrated edges. When young, the tree stretches straight, with many branches and dense flowers, presenting a beautiful appearance; when old, the trunk gradually bends, the heart of the tree decays and becomes hollow, but the outer branches sprout and bloom, increasingly showing an old and elegant appearance.

Fan Shih-hu wrote the Plum Blossom Manual, which contains more than ninety varieties, but recent people claim that there are hundreds of varieties, roughly divided into white plum and red plum, single-petal and double-petal, four categories. Jiangmei, also known as Yemei, Zhijiaomei, is produced in the barren and clear environment of mountains, streams, and waterfronts. The petals are small, grayish-white, the fragrance is rich, and they grow sparsely on the branches. The Japanese Jurui Book says: "Plum blossoms have four virtues: they value sparseness over density, oldness over tenderness, thinness over fatness, and containment over opening." Jiangmei can be said to have all four beauties. Zaomei, also known as Dongzhi Mei, Guangqunfangpu says: "The flowers are better than Zhijiaomei. The spring in Wuzhong is late, and it only begins to bloom in February. Only this variety blooms before the winter solstice, so it is named early. There is also a variety on Qiantang Lake that blooms especially early. I once broke off a new branch on the Double Ninth Festival, with a horizontal branch opening against chrysanthemums." The flowers are single-petaled red, and there are also white ones; there are also Basuomei, which bloom in mid-autumn, light red with many petals, and small and lovely wheels. People cherish those who bear fruit early. In addition, there are Xiaomei, Huangxiangmei, Hedingmei, Huangjinmei, Dongmei, Zimei, Six-petal Mei, Chongyemei, Lüyuemei, Yuanyangmei, etc., all of which are famous. Ancient books also mention Momei, Zhaoshuimei, Pinzimei, Xingmei, and Lizhimei.

### Potted Plum Blossoms Planted in Ziluolan'an Studio

### Plum House Miscellany

— (Zhou Shoujuan)

Since our government clearly designated plum blossoms as the national flower, I have become obsessed with plum blossoms. I planted plum blossoms extensively in my residence and built a small house called Plum House, and a small hill called Plum Hill. Those planted in pots and basins are also full of plum blossoms. In early spring, when the flowers bloom, they are charming with violets. I carefully appreciate the color and fragrance from morning to night, and I can treat them as moth eyebrows in the soil, and I don't get close to my house for a month. In the spring of Bingzi, Yi Zijun came from Jingjiang to see my plum blossoms and gave me a poem: Fairy posture and jade bones are beyond the human world, exchanged for a light frown that is tender and cold, red powder new makeup wears embroidered jacket, plum blossom fragrance wrapped in violets. The word "wrapped" is wonderful.

Mr. Ye Yuhu settled in Wuxia, and we often visited each other. He was also addicted to plum blossoms. He had twenty pots of plum blossoms in his collection, which were the old objects of Hu Huanzhang, an expert in plum blossoms in Wuzhong. The jagged iron bones are more ancient. A few days ago, I came to his door to admire them and saw a trunk standing upright like a falcon, with a few white flowers blooming on it, naturally picturesque. Before leaving, I received a draft of Xia An's poems as a gift. I washed my hands and read them, and I loved them so much that I couldn't bear to put them down. Among them, there were two quatrains about plum blossoms, which I especially liked, such as "A Small Journey of Immortals": The elixir recipe cloud curtain locks the smoke and haze, the color world of human beings recognizes no difference, I am tired of the fairy traces still disturbing, riding a solitary crane to step on plum blossoms. Night Sitting: A solitary tree in an empty courtyard hides returning crows, the pearl blinds are silent and wet with dew, the twelve cloisters are as clear as water, and the lonely moon guards the plum blossoms deep at night. It seems like the words of someone who does not eat human fireworks.

Green calyx plum blossoms are the best, like lightly made-up beauties standing in the moonlight, with the most secluded charm. I recently got an old green plum tree stump, only a foot or so high, with a dry trunk as thick as a human arm, with more than ten flowers, sparse and picturesque, which is very lovable. Among those who have praised green plum blossoms in the past, I especially love Wu Lanxue's "Sitting in the Moon": The forest pond is secluded like a mountain house, sitting and turning the railing, the moon is not slanting, a pair of fairy cranes are asleep, and the cold fragrance blows all over the green plum blossoms. Shao Xinjiong's "Awkward Spring" says: The awkward spring weather makes it difficult to borrow wine, the slight snow is clear and the sun is easy to slant, tonight the tile stove stops the medicine paste, and my wife teaches me to cook green plum blossoms. Both poems are also clear and beautiful, like green plum blossoms.

### Exploring Plum Blossoms

— Zhang Zhenxiang

Spring comes early in Jiangnan! The spring news brought by red plum blossoms, especially this year's West Lake, has no silver traces of ice and snow; it makes people feel that they have the opportunity to catch up with spring in Jiangnan first.

At Wang Zhuang, a tea merchant's residence on the lake, we saw the trees full of extremely beautiful red plum blossoms as early as a few days before the Beginning of Spring. We remembered a seven-character quatrain "Exploring Plum Blossoms on Dengwei Mountain" by Mr. Wang Jingwei fourteen or fifteen years ago. The original poem says: "The spring mountains outside the forest are broken and connected again, the melting ice in the pond is just trickling, in the secluded places of the farmhouse's broken fences, a tree of red plum blossoms is particularly beautiful." The appreciation displayed in this poem is, after all, superior. He specially focused on "in the secluded places of the farmhouse's broken fences", telling that red plum blossoms have another kind of touching beauty. It seems that ordinary tourists who go sightseeing do not have enough words to describe this feeling. We, with the mood of ordinary people touring the lake, can only feel that the red plum blossoms in Wang Zhuang have a particularly vivid posture, it seems very difficult to say in other places!

In the homes of some friends in Jiangnan, I first saw a few potted red plum bonsai, and I always thought they were artificially forced. It was not until I went to Wang Zhuang to see the red plum blossoms on the lake that I realized that the mildness of the natural air is a natural flower house.

### Japan and Plum Blossoms

— Ji Yun

The Japanese's favorite is, of course, their national flower, the cherry blossom, but cherry blossoms do not last long, and they wither in less than a week, and they are not suitable for bonsai for the desk, which is the biggest drawback. Plum blossoms not only have branches and trunks in hundreds of forms, but also have many types. The tall ones can be arranged in gardens, and the small ones can be used as bonsai. Everything is more suitable than cherry blossoms. Therefore, the Japanese who like to plant trees are very fond of and cherish my country's national flower, the plum blossom. However, plum blossoms are very expensive in Japan. According to their customs, they must offer the Three Friends of Pine, Bamboo, and Plum on New Year's Day. Ordinary people only put pine and bamboo in front of the door, and they cannot put a pot of plum blossoms on the "tokonoma" in the house.

Japanese single-petal plum blossoms include varieties such as Yuyu, Golden Plum, Snow Cup, Full Moon, and Yuhong. There are more double-petal varieties, including Baiyunlongliannei, Jinmei, Tangmei, Huan Shanbai, Yueying, and Canyue. The red plum blossoms of Kagoshima are darker in color than our Tiegu red, so it is also called Zhenheimei. Japanese plum bonsai are very different from those in our country. Most of the plum bonsai in ordinary flower gardens in our country mainly focus on blooming luxuriantly, and the pruning posture is very vulgar. Although the upright plum bonsai have no artificiality, they lose the beauty of sparse shadows when left to nature. Therefore, in our country, it is really not easy to obtain perfect specimens except for experts who grow them for private appreciation.

Pine and cypress bonsai are famous plants in Japan. They also cultivate plum blossoms in the same way as pine and cypress. In addition to the flower species and flower colors, they also pay great attention to the posture of the branches and trunks, flower pots, and mountain stones. Fortunately, those who grow flowers and trees in Japan are not large flower gardens, but retired soldiers and idle nobles. Therefore, they do not focus on buying and selling, and all kinds of research can be done. The only key to Japanese bonsai is to cultivate a very small tree so that it is like a big tree, plant it in the middle of a flower pot, and appreciate it as if standing under a big tree. The same is true for looking up and down. At the Hibiya Plum Blossom Exhibition, I once saw one named "Hong Shidare," whose branches drooped downward, slender like willows. There is also one named "Miken," whose trunk is unusually withered and empty, shaking and falling, but it has countless flowers, which is clear and unique. There are four trees planted in one pot, each with its own posture, shaped like a plum forest, but the height is less than a foot, and the arrangement is very orderly. The trunks of the plum bonsai are not thick, but the emphasis is on the bending posture. Those with exposed roots are attached with green moss and mountain stones, which have the meaning of ancient Chinese paintings. Among Japanese bonsai, pine and cypress are the most recommended, followed by plum blossoms, and then chrysanthemums and miscellaneous fruit trees.

In winter, cut flowers are also mainly plum blossoms, sometimes set off with camellias, waterside mountains, and pine and bamboo, to maintain them until the cherry blossoms bloom. Japanese women all learn flower arrangement and use scientific methods to make them last longer. When arranging flowers in our country, first burn the cut end with fire, and it can last for a long time if it is placed upright in water. According to the Japanese, the cut end should be slanted to increase the area. After burning with fire, immediately insert it into the water and do not allow air to enter the trunk. Then the water contained in the trunk can be heated by fire to form steam, which rises directly to the top of the trunk to nourish the flowers, so the plum blossoms can last for more than a month.

### Watching Plum Blossoms (Part 1)

— Yafei

The giant wheel of time is speeding rapidly on the track of life. It has taken away my childhood and crushed my youth. The impoverished life is cruelly whipping me, forcing me to leave my lovely hometown and my warm home, drifting from this city to that city, and from that city to another city. Many rugged paths in the world have been rushed through so hastily that I have never had the leisure to think about some elegant things. Although I am not ignorant of elegance, or do not love elegance, all the wonderful ideas have long gone with the troubled years of life!

Sometimes, I would occasionally think of some leisurely pleasures, such as: traveling, watching the tide, seeking scenic spots, visiting plum blossoms, etc. Especially visiting plum blossoms. Whenever I think of plum blossoms, I will think of my hometown where the mountains and fields are full of plum forests. Although in childhood, as long as it was the season when plum blossoms were in full bloom, I would almost every day run and jump with my playmates under the cover of the plum forest. There, on the hillsides, in the suburbs, on the branches of many plum trees, all were covered with balls of snow-white plain flowers, shining with silver foil in the sunlight. It set off the maiden-like tranquility and loveliness even more against this dull gray background. However, although I had a good impression of plum blossoms at that time, I did not understand what sparse shadows and slanting slopes meant, or what a faint fragrance meant. It was just that sometimes when I looked down from the mountain peaks, I saw a vast expanse of silver sea, and when I shook the plum trees a few times, I saw countless plum petals falling from the branches like flying snow, and I thought it was very beautiful.

Recently, I have gained some leisure time due to unemployment, so I have been able to come here during the season when plum blossoms are in full bloom to appreciate the snow-white plum blossoms.

However, the weather this spring is really as cold as the depth of winter, so although I chose to come back during the season when plum blossoms are in full bloom, the plum blossoms are still deeply asleep in their dreams. This has given me a disappointment that has struck heavily into the depths of my heart.

For half a month, the weather has always been gloomy, and it has been cold and warm from time to time, so there is no trace of spring in nature. Until recently, the sky has been clear, and the weather has been warm, so a few old plum trees in the corner of the house have been spitting out plum petals. One day, two days, three days... the buds on the branches have all opened, and the plain shadows are jumping outside the glass window. From then on, I seemed to have recovered my childhood and found my youth. Every morning, I would push open the lattice glass window and look outside, like a hungry prisoner standing behind iron bars hoping for freedom and bread, I just watched so greedily.

### Changing Nest Luan Feng

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 11 (Mutterings Arouse Compassionate Parental Concern, Repentance Betrays Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dimly Reflects Jade Complexion, Scene Evokes Literary Sentiment)

Menglan said: It's not, it's not. I have another idea now. Today, I want to decide what kind of person I should be. Either an old person or a new person? I can choose either of these two types, but I shouldn't waver between the new and the old. The Second Young Mistress said: In that case, I don't know, let me ask my younger sister another question. Do you want to be an old person? Or a new person? Menglan held the empty teacup in her hand after finishing her tea, shaking it tightly several times. When she shook it, she seemed to be struggling very hard, as if the teacup could be crushed at any moment. The Second Young Mistress was taken aback and could only stare at her blankly. She bit her lip, thought for a long time, and said to herself: It's hard to be a person! I'll choose the easier one, to be a filial daughter. The Second Young Mistress felt that she couldn't ask any further after talking this far. So she smiled slightly and said: Sister, I am a straightforward person, I just speak frankly and forget taboos, there are many things I shouldn't have told you. After telling you, I regretted it a little. If Mother knows, won't she say I'm gossiping? Menglan said: You can rest assured about this, I will never say you told me. Besides, I have given up all hope and don't want any chance of advancement, even if you told me, it doesn't matter. The Second Young Mistress stood up, tidied her temples, and smiled: I don't care what you plan to do after hearing my words? Anyway, I'm telling the truth. Even if Mother knows, she can't say I'm spreading rumors. I think Mother would have wanted to tell you this a long time ago, but she just couldn't bring herself to say it. As she said this, she was still holding the edge of the table, looking at Menglan. Although she moved forward slightly, she didn't leave. Menglan said: What are you still hesitating about? Is there anything else you should tell me that you haven't said? The Second Young Mistress looked at her with a smile, shook her head twice, and said: There's nothing else to say. As she said this, she walked forward, held Menglan's hand and shook it twice. Only then did she look back at her twice and slowly go downstairs. Of course, Menglan sat in the small building, thought about her sister-in-law's words, and added countless worries. When the Second Sister-in-law was speaking, she didn't feel anything strange. But after she finished speaking, she kept looking at her again and again, as if there was still a sentence she wanted to say but hadn't said. So she first leaned on the table, propped her head and thought. Then she lay down on the bed, hugged the pillow to her side, and closed her eyes to think. Finally, she got up and leaned on the windowsill, looking at the white clouds in the sky. She waited until the clouds in the sky turned red, and flocks of crows flew across the sky, and she saw that the day's time was spent in confusion. (141)

International Women's Day Special Edition

### What We Should Do to Commemorate "March 8th"

— Jin Guangmei

The annual March 8th International Women's Day has arrived again today.

The significance of the commemoration is for us to review our past work, grasp the current situation, and create a future.

In today's era of serious national crisis, our commemoration of March 8th clearly gives us a special mission. Our nation is a nation that is being oppressed and invaded. Our country is seeking survival in death and striving to save itself. Therefore, our burden is heavier and more difficult than that of women in other countries.

Undoubtedly, we women are members who are being advanced in the entire national liberation movement, but we cannot ignore our own strength, which is also sufficient to help the future development of the national liberation movement. We cannot ignore this interactive effect either.

In this torrent of national rejuvenation of uniting to save the country and saving the country through our own efforts, we women should concentrate and cherish all human and financial resources to contribute to the country, which cannot be different from others.

Therefore, in the current stage of national crisis, in commemorating "March 8th", we should take the Three Principles of the People as our common belief, and under the premise that national interests are above all else, strive for our future work and strive for our glorious and splendid future.

### Letter to Women of the Whole Country on March 8th

— Wang Xiaoying

The great and glorious "March 8th" festival has quietly arrived again today!

"March 8th" is the most brilliant page in the history of the women's movement, no, it is the most praiseworthy page in the history of human evolution! How should we pay our joyful respects to this glorious day!

However, in this era of serious national crisis and broken mountains and rivers, our commemoration of this "Women's Liberation Day" makes us feel that the responsibility borne by Chinese women is extremely heavy, — thus the meaning of the commemoration is particularly profound!

The women's movement in China has a history of more than 30 years. Looking back, on the one hand, women have achieved a lot in the process of struggling through various hardships for their own liberation, the evolution of society, and the freedom and equality of the nation, and have fulfilled their due responsibilities. From the "May Fourth" Movement, to the "May Thirtieth" Movement, to the "September 18th" Incident, to the "January 28th" Incident, and up to today, women have always stood on the front line of the anti-imperialist movement, bravely doing the work of saving the country. Objective facts have long provided correct proof, so there is no need to be long-winded here.

But on the other hand, women inevitably have some shortcomings: The most prominent of these is that most women lack the spirit of unity like loose sand. Because of the lack of the spirit of unity, the actual effect obtained for any matter is often not in line with what we ideally hope for. This is such a painful thing. I dare say: If the women's movement in the past had the spirit of iron-like unity, its achievements would have been thousands of times better than today!

Yes, "the past" is like "the dead". How should we remedy our shortcomings in the future? Indeed, there are many ways to remedy this, but I think the work that urgently needs to be done at present is: ——

The first is unity! The second is unity! The third is still unity!

Because only with unity can there be great strength; with great strength, we can resist the enemy's invasion, save the nation's crisis, and establish all great and difficult undertakings and achieve amazing results!

Women of the whole country, on this glorious "March 8th" festival, for the sake of the nation, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of ourselves, let us unite together!

### Review of the Chinese Women's Movement in Recent Years and the Path It Should Take in the Future

— Jiang Huiruo

Today, March 8th is the anniversary of the International Women's Labor Movement. Looking at the achievements of the labor and women's movements in various countries around the world, and observing the current situation of our country's women's movement, I can't help but feel emotional. Due to space limitations, the world women's movement will not be discussed for the time being, but I will briefly review the decline of our country's women's movement in recent years:

One or two years ago, some people in our country advocated that we should follow the policies of Italy and Germany, and shout "Women should return home" to free up positions for men. For a time, many people echoed this view. Although this policy of quenching thirst with poison can temporarily relieve some unemployed men for a while, it is ultimately not a long-term solution. Why? Because if working women leave their jobs and return home, relying on their fathers and husbands for a living, and if their fathers and husbands have abundant income, then the women will return to their families, living a life of luxury and leisure, enjoying their parasitic life. And the fathers and husbands will exhaust their energy to support their wives and daughters, spending their entire lives as oxen and horses for their wives and daughters. I really feel sorry for these men. This is discussed from the perspective of middle and upper-class families. If it is a middle and lower-class family, the father and husband's hard-earned income will not be enough to support their wives and children. They will inevitably rely on their wives and daughters to go out to work to supplement the family's insufficient income. If they are dismissed from their jobs and return home, although society euphemistically calls it "managing household affairs," even a clever wife cannot cook without rice. In the end, the gentle ones will complain and feel sorry for themselves; the cunning ones will do evil. This kind of situation is obvious to everyone. People with insight have risen up to attack this view, believing that men and women should each work according to their individual characteristics in order to create a happy family and a strong country. Therefore, in the past year, the call for women to return to their families has not been heard again.

Of the 220 million female compatriots in our country, less than one-thousandth can receive education, and within that one-thousandth, with the exception of a small number who have received university education, the rest have only received primary and secondary education. Primary education is national education, so I will not discuss it for the time being. However, if you look around at the secondary education of women in our country, it is all given a general education, preparing them for entering universities. But let me ask, how many secondary school graduates in our country can enter universities? And in general, women who have received secondary education do not have a skill and cannot adapt to society, wasting talents, which is regrettable. Therefore, I say that in the future, the secondary education of women should focus on vocational education, so that women who are generally unable to attend university will not feel incompetent and overwhelmed after entering society. This is the first thing that those engaged in the women's movement should strive to improve.

At present, middle and upper-class women are all carefully calculating their own interests, and are indifferent to the suffering of the majority of working women. In the future, we should strive to assist working women, remove their pain, improve their lives, and provide them with appropriate education, so that those who are aware can awaken those who are not, and those who know can enlighten those who do not, so that working women can get rid of the difficult and oppressive life and ascend to the paradise of equality and freedom. This is the second thing that those engaged in the women's movement should strive to improve in the future.

I hope that people of insight at home and abroad will provide guidance on whether the above opinions are appropriate. I would be very grateful.

### Reflections on March 8th

— Wu Daiyi

The times are constantly advancing. The annual March 8th International Women's Day has arrived again. This solemn and great international women's festival is a day to commemorate the world women's liberation movement, and it can also be said to be a day of awakening for women around the world. Remembering the efforts of our predecessors, how should we continue to struggle? This is a point that women around the world should pay attention to when commemorating March 8th.

Regarding the historical facts of March 8th, women engaged in the women's movement and women in the intellectual class probably all know about it. I feel that the Chinese women's movement is significantly different from those of other countries, so I will just talk casually about what I have seen and heard, which may be what is needed now!

The times are constantly advancing, and the environments are also different. Dealing with each issue must be adapted to the times and examine the environment. The slogan of the Chinese women's movement is indeed the same as that of other countries, demanding liberation, but China is a country with un-popularized education and very backward production. The feudal forces of society have not been fundamentally eradicated, and the moral intelligence of women themselves is still declining. Foreign troubles and internal worries are pressing each other, and the nation is in danger. Therefore, the greatest goal of the Chinese women's movement, in addition to demanding liberation, should take national revival as a prerequisite. Otherwise, if we do not focus on the root and only focus on the branches, I dare say that there will be no results.

Chinese women have been granted the same equality as men in politics and economics by law, so Chinese women basically do not need to fight for the principle of equality in rights anymore. As for the scope of freedom, under the permission of the law, there is no discrimination against men, but the reality is not always the case, and it is still not truly realized. The reason is that the patriarchal system and feudal poison that have existed for thousands of years have deeply rooted in people's hearts and are not easy to reform in a short time; and the fact that women's education and occupations cannot be widespread is the biggest obstacle to the progress of the women's movement! In this situation, popularizing women's education and promoting women's occupations are indeed urgent and immediate tasks.

In recent years, women in the intellectual class have gradually awakened. The majority of women are still unaware and are content with their inherent dark lives. Not only do they not know anything, but they also think that it should be like this. How pitiful, these ignorant women! Women who are enlightened are responsible for awakening them. I believe that if they do not join our group, the women's movement will never be completely successful. Going deep into the masses is very necessary.

Now that we have understood the direction we should strive for in the future and have actually done it, we must also actively eliminate all obstacles, move forward resolutely and decisively without hesitation, without being complacent, without fearing difficulties, without compromising, and without yielding, so that we can realize our ideals. I would like to offer some superficial views on this glorious day of commemoration.

### Man's Conspiracy Against Me

— Luo Caiqing

After reading the report in this newspaper "Going to Bailing Temple," I felt as if I were there myself. A soldier said to me: "Soldiers are afraid of dying in vain. This is our only chance. How can we easily let it go?" China has always been known as the nation that loves peace the most and the best market in the world. However, there are still countless brave soldiers who "are willing to use their flesh and blood to fight the enemy and sacrifice for the freedom of the entire nation and people," — not soldiers who "bullets enter from the back."

However, as the author said, "What we find most heartbreaking is that the enemy's war expenses of more than 10 million yuan were all allocated from the smuggling items of the pseudo-organization in eastern Hebei, and the guns, ammunition, and bombing aircraft used were all produced by the Shenyang Arsenal. Taking the money of the Chinese to pay for the war expenses of the Chinese killing each other, and taking the military equipment made by the Chinese to slaughter the Chinese, what a fierce and cruel means this is!" Man's conspiracy against me has reached the extreme. Looking at the three treasures obtained in the recovery of Bailing Temple this time: One is Major General Shima's book "Notes on Military Affairs," which contains special records. The places where military fortresses can be set up and food can be stored are all clearly investigated; the second is a military map of 1/50,000 and a military map of 1/100,000, from the various leagues and banners of northern Chahar to Lanzhou, Gansu and Ningxia, all measured with extraordinary precision; the third is various planning documents for the enemy's invasion of the northwest, which makes people shudder!

They have already planned very carefully for our country, which is "large in area, rich in resources, and rich in products," and the intelligence agencies in various places, such as the Zhengzhou Special Service Agency, are carrying out their "dreams of ambition" overtly or covertly! On the same day (7th), we also read in a certain newspaper a special dispatch from Tokyo, saying that they had completed an international film called "New Land," which tells the story of a couple going to Manchuria to open up their "New Land." There is a song called "New Land" in the film: "People without land! Where are you going? Look, the continent and heaven beyond the sea! There is land waiting for us there."

"Can we let the four northeastern provinces of our country be permanently occupied by others as 'New Land'?"

### Rickshaw Ride That Doesn't Cost Money

— Laoxin

I was very hungry. As usual, I was quickening my pace to rush home to make my own meal with the gas stove. But when I turned from Avenue Joffre into Route Tenant de St. Julien, I remembered that I hadn't been home for a long time, and there was no food at home. So, where should I go? — Just as this thought came to mind, my pace slowed down. My mind was spinning in confusion, almost as if I wouldn't even notice if I bumped into a wall in front of me. Just as I was regaining my senses, I suddenly heard an unfamiliar, low, anxious, and unnatural call in my ear:

"Sir, rickshaw!"

I'm not used to taking rickshaws, especially when there's no need to take one. Although I felt that it was a bit unusual, I still ignored this very plain sentence and continued walking my own way.

However!

"Thank you," I had to pay attention to what this rickshaw puller, who must be hiding something secret, was saying. "Thank you for taking my rickshaw, — Avenue Albert! Thank you."

Although it was a thank you, it was unnecessary, so even though I had paid attention to this very forceful sentence, I still walked on my own way without caring. And wasn't I still worrying about the problem of eating in my heart: cooking, no; going to a restaurant, that would be too expensive; so, was I really going to just have a bowl of plain noodles, which didn't seem very appealing, …

"Sir, please do a good deed! Sir: Sir…"

This unexpected voice finally woke me up from my chaotic emotions. So, I had to look at this guy who was begging others to take his rickshaw with strange eyes — a rickshaw puller, no different from the thousands and thousands of others seen on the road, with a swarthy face, strong arms, and those strong legs, weren't they just as thick and hairy as ordinary rickshaw pullers, very strong and powerful? Although he was a bit older, he was only in his forties or fifties, definitely not a weakling who had to beg people to take his rickshaw because he couldn't compete with others. …

Before I could finish scrutinizing this strange rickshaw puller, he had already revealed a spark of hope on his wrinkled forehead. His lively eyes were signaling to me, and his hands had also stopped the rickshaw shafts. He was bending his waist, forming a posture for someone to get on the rickshaw. I understood that this must be the trouble I had gotten myself into after I looked at him. However, since I didn't need it, even if it was a kidnapping-like action, I definitely couldn't give in. So, I didn't continue scrutinizing him and walked forward with my head held high, as if nothing had happened. However, this strange stranger didn't let me slip away from his hands. My ears clearly heard him pulling the rickshaw and following me. And he also said —

"Sir! I don't want your money! Thank you…"

My nerves twitched a bit, and my head immediately turned around again. This strange rickshaw puller actually dragged the rickshaw over, crying, and putting on a welcoming posture again. And I, this shameless, greedy person, was immediately stopped by my self-esteem from this desperate act. After hesitating for a moment, I blushed and walked on my own way with my head held high.

"I don't want your money! I don't want your money…"

I was tired, I knew it myself. But, what was going on? How could there be freebies in this society? However, now that this freebie was actually being offered to me, wouldn't it be a deception, or even something more terrible? But, facing this strange thing that was constantly buzzing in my ear, it actually aroused my curiosity.

So, my foot stopped slightly. This strange guy seemed to be afraid that I would really escape from his hands, so he quickly chased after me again. Again, it was a welcoming posture, but his mouth was begging even more pitifully:

"Thank you, I don't want your money! Just drag it across the road, I don't want your money!"

This time, a burst of courage made me sit on it, and he, this pitiful stranger who was asking for trouble, seemed to be dragging the rickshaw very hard to run west. After passing the Route Cardinal Mercier intersection, I realized that there were still quite a few rickshaws stranded on the east side of the road, and they, those poor rickshaw pullers, were all watching my rickshaw with envious eyes. At this time, my heart was mostly relieved, and I slightly speculated on the cleverness of this matter. Later, I simply asked this lucky rickshaw puller, and he answered happily:

"Empty rickshaws are not allowed to be pulled!"

It was the traffic regulations of civilized people again. So, I began to talk to this person who had already become familiar with me.

"If they're not allowed to be pulled, aren't they trapped there?"

"Isn't it so, there will be no business for a lifetime, unless you pass Avenue Joffre, but that's even more unthinkable."

"Then, how do you change shifts?"

"God knows."

"Is there no way to reason?"

"This world doesn't reason! Yesterday, I accidentally had my license confiscated and was fined five jiao, and I dragged the rickshaw for a day for nothing. Who can you reason with!…"

His words were not finished, and the destination had arrived. This strange and short-lived relationship of ours was over. He, like a bird out of a cage, was burning with the light of his hope. (Casual Encounters)

### Exploring Plum Blossoms

— Jiang Jingding

During this winter vacation, I went back to Zhejiang. On the train, I met an old friend from Hangzhou. He insisted on dragging me to stay in Hangzhou for one night. Fortunately, I hadn't seen Hangzhou for three years. It would be good to stay one night and play for a day. That night, I stayed at my friend's house. The next morning, I visited a few old friends whom I hadn't seen for a long time. With more people, it was even better to play. So, we decided to go see the plum blossoms (or rather, "search for plum blossoms"). Although it wasn't snowing that day.

We had a full meal at eleven o'clock, and the three of us started from the Banner.

The willow leaves on both sides of the lake embankment had all fallen, leaving only some dead branches swaying there. We walked to the end of the Bojue Bridge on the West Lake. This is the area of Gushan. Walking west along the northern foot of Gushan, the plum blossoms were in full bloom in less than two hundred steps, and a faint fragrance wafted over from time to time. On the roadside, I picked up a white plum blossom that had been discarded from the hands of cruel people. I picked it up and inserted it in my front lapel. What a fragrant smell. I only felt that this white plum blossom was like a chaste little girl, a lucky one who had escaped from the sexual period of bestial people.

Thinking like this, it seemed that we shouldn't have come to explore the plum blossoms. We walked to the tomb of Su Manshu and didn't want to leave for a long time. Looking at the many tourists walking towards Gushan, many plum branches were probably sacrificed in their hands.

### Sai Jinhua (1)

— Written by Chen He

Due to the inferiority of the social system, and the economic oppression of people, regardless of danger or shame, as long as it is a job that can earn money, they will do everything they can to do it. Jin Yunxian was a woman who only cared about profit: She saw that Sai Jinhua was beautiful, so she tricked Sai into going to various flower boats to play, secretly earning a lot of money. The young and ignorant Sai Jinhua was swallowed up by the dark society from then on!

### Chen Boer Returns

— Zhi Er

Chen Boer returned from comforting the troops in Suiyuan. She arrived on the express train from Ping to Shanghai at 7:40 yesterday morning. Only she alone returned this time. It is said that the other members of the troupe had returned earlier. Only Wu Sihong and Cui Wei have not returned. Wu Sihong had some private matters and had to go to Qingdao once. Cui Wei is still in Peiping because she is preparing to participate in the military-civilian memorial service to be held in Suiyuan on March 15.

When they stayed in Peiping, wasn't there a rumor in Shanghai about them being under house arrest? In fact, this rumor is not true. The Peiping authorities hoped they would leave sooner rather than later to avoid causing more trouble! It was they who were unwilling to leave because they had promised the soldiers guarding the territory at the front that after returning to Peiping, they would definitely raise some money by performing plays to buy things to send to them. In order to keep their promise and to fight for freedom of performance, they refused to leave before the play was performed. On the one hand, news and advice obtained directly and indirectly advised them not to perform for the best. Under such circumstances, it was almost deadlocked for a month. Later, on the evening of the 1st of this month, they performed four plays at Yenching University: (1) Descendants of Traitors; (2) Female Reporter; (3) Abandoned Child; (4) Dawn. There were more than 1,000 audience members, and the performance was very successful, so those who sympathized with them had an even better impression of them.

At the front, they performed three plays: "Put Down Your Whip," "Zhangjiadian," and "Smuggling." In addition, there were singing and speeches. All these results were very good. The tears and loud shouts that moved the soldiers were clear evidence. There were only ten of them when they left Shanghai, but because people joined their team along the way, there were a total of thirty-nine people who went to the front. They stayed in Gui Sui for two days, Bailing Temple for two days, and Pingdiquan for one day. Adding the time spent on the road, it took about a week in total. During this week, although they suffered from the cold and suffered some physical hardships, they were quite happy in spirit. They fulfilled a part of their responsibility as citizens, and they who had fulfilled their responsibility were still the so-called weak and "difficult to raise" "women" who were usually looked down upon by adults and gentlemen.

Regarding Chen Boer's future path, because the newspaper had mentioned her resignation to the Star Film Company a few days ago, she was asked about it. She said: "I just came back from Peiping, and I am not very familiar with the situation in Shanghai. As for the resignation, it didn't happen. It's even more impossible to leave the Star Film Company because I have a contract with the Star Film Company."

Finally, let me go back and talk about the people who went to welcome her yesterday morning. Because it came so suddenly, too few people knew about it, and there was no time to notify everyone, so the people who went to the station yesterday morning were, in addition to reporters from various newspapers, only Miss Ji and three others, and then her husband and her child, Ren Ke.

### Strongman Backmen

Since the Backmen Beauty Contest at the Carlton, all circles have expressed surprise at the strongman Backmen. In addition to being able to move his whole body muscles to any part to dance to the music, Backmen can also use the muscles on his back to hold the car handles on a car weighing 300 pounds and carrying three people on it, pulling it slowly. He can also stand on an octagonal platform, holding a wooden plate with more than a dozen men and women sitting and standing in between, supporting it with his head and hands, and rotating the octagonal platform with electricity, so that the audience can see that there are no traces of borrowing in the front and back. His martial arts are really not easy. In order to understand Backmen's own history, the reporter met him backstage yesterday through the introduction of Mr. Zhou Shengcai, the Chinese manager of the troupe.

Backmen is from Latvia and is 41 years old this year. Before the age of sixteen, he was physically weak and felt pain. He then joined the Lige Sports Association. After a year of hard work, his body became stronger, completely different from before. In that year, he won first place in weightlifting at the association. Three years later, he won the German weightlifting championship. In 1925, he won third place in the world weightlifting championship. His highest record is 306 pounds with both hands and 210 pounds with his right hand, which he can lift three times in a row. His head can withstand more than 1,000 pounds of weight, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. In addition to the muscle dancing, muscle pulling, and weightlifting performances, his martial arts also include using iron hooks to clamp on the muscles of his back to hang in the air, with three or four people hanging on his feet. He can also play with iron bars as thick as silver coins in his hands like noodles, and he can carry more than twenty people on his left and right shoulders, walking calmly, etc. His martial arts can be seen.

Backmen also clarified to the reporter the situation of muscle pulling. He had seven people stand on the stage for a live test. The reporter also stood among them without any clamping. As for the movement of his muscles, it is actually controlled by a kind of nerve sensation, and it must be combined with both soft gymnastics and mechanical exercise to achieve success over time. As for his head, it can withstand at least 2,000 pounds of weight, so lifting more than a dozen people is not difficult. Backmen then led a tour of his octagonal platform. There is a small door behind this platform, with a plate inside. Backmen stands in it and rises using electricity, but the ascent and descent are very slow, taking more than twenty minutes. Therefore, the performance time cannot be too long.

Backmen is in his mid-century but looks like he is only in his twenties. He is crude, with many mustaches and bald in the middle of his yellow hair, which is actually because he often performs head stunts. He has never married in his life and is still a virgin. He has no feeling for sexual desire. He has an older brother who has passed away. He usually pays attention to muscle training, averaging six hours a day. He stipulates that he must sleep for at least eight hours. When he sleeps, no one is allowed to enter, and the windows are not closed, because he loves outdoor living. He gives up smoking and drinking, eats vegetables, and does not eat meat. Therefore, his method of solidifying essence, circulating energy, and protecting the original yang can reach this level.

Backmen also said: He recently plans to publish an advertisement, offering a reward of 5,000 yuan to anyone in Shanghai who can perform the same martial arts or any part of his martial arts as him, with half of the money going to charity. He hopes that people from all walks of life will come to compete, and he will definitely not go back on his word.

Backmen came to Shanghai with the Haijingbo Circus two years ago, then returned to Germany. Recently, he organized a song and dance troupe in Germany, using his own name as the name of the troupe. He hired famous performers from various countries along the way. The entire group of seventy people came directly to Shanghai from Germany. Since they performed on the 25th of last month, they have been quite popular. Starting tomorrow, they will perform for various groups for free for a few days. There is not much time left. Before leaving, he briefly expressed his elegant intentions. Backmen shook hands with the reporter and gave him several recent photos as a souvenir.
