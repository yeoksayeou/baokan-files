### Britain and Fascist Nations (Part Two)

— By British MP Strabolgi, Translated by Jin Tunan

In the past, Britain had a strong fleet, and the sea surrounding its coasts, even a channel as wide as the twenty-two miles between England and France, provided sufficient defense. Now, due to the rapid increase in the effectiveness and number of European air forces, its entire position has changed. At the same time, Britain is also aware of the threat from Japan in the Pacific, as Japan's established policy is to move toward the Malay Federation under British protection and reach the gateway to India, which is strategically very important.

However, what the ruling class of Britain, social leaders, financiers, and the general upper class fear most is communism. In the minds of these people, the current governments of France and Spain are the same as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The general aristocracy and banking circles of Britain, fearing the threat of communism, mostly try their best to be pro-German. In addition, there are other forces at work, and generally speaking, German influence in Britain is growing.

This pressure and its repercussions have caused rifts within the British Cabinet regarding the most important policy issues of today. A portion of the cabinet members, roughly subordinate to the Prime Minister, want to make peace with Germany to obtain peace. Another portion of the cabinet members, however, believe that this is impossible to satisfy Germany. This group still believes in the traditional British policy of maintaining the balance of power in Europe for four hundred years, which is to constantly support unity and resist any strong nation becoming a hegemon. And the meaning of "balance" today is to show that the League of Nations and cooperation with the League of Nations should be strengthened.

For convenience, we can call this group the pro-French faction, which represents the majority of British voters who support the League of Nations. When the two factions clash, sometimes one faction's intentions extend, and sometimes the other faction's intentions extend.

When the German army reoccupied the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, the issue of breaking the Locarno Treaty caused tension between the foreign ministries of Britain and France.

Britain advocated leniency, while France advocated accountability and forced Germany to withdraw its troops. Any part of the British cabinet or government knew about Germany's breach of contract; however, someone had notified Hitler and his advisors of the British reaction beforehand. This notification was accurate, and British public opinion on this matter tended to side with Germany. This happened in March of this year.

In the autumn of last year, British public opinion supported the group favoring the League of Nations and being pro-French, leading to the overthrow of the Hoare-Laval Pact to partition Abyssinia. This group within the British Cabinet then prevented any public declaration in favor of restoring Germany's former colonies. However, this does not mean that a powerful group of key cabinet members and a group of the same nature as Germany did not have a secret understanding.

There is some evidence to prove this.

A subtle change can be seen in some authoritative newspapers, such as the famous London Times, which represents the views of the Foreign Office. These many opinion organs have gradually become anti-Soviet and pro-German. They are trying their best to support the position of Schacht, the financial dictator of Berlin. Some raw materials for German arms manufacturing are purchased with British money.

Last year, the British Admiralty—which has always been one of the most powerful departments in the British political system and often adopted its own foreign policy—signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, concealing it from the US and French governments. This matter was actually accomplished by Monsell. He was the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time and one of Prime Minister Baldwin's confidants. Although he has now retired, the trend of this policy is still maintained.

At the Montreux Conference held last summer regarding the issue of the Turkish Straits, the British representative alone argued for the right of enemy fleets to pass through the straits to reach the Black Sea in the event of war. This was particularly beneficial to Germany, even though Germany did not participate in the negotiations. This claim by Britain was unanimously opposed by France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Romania, the three Black Sea coastal countries. According to Britain's attitude, it simply did not take the League of Nations into account, and in the end, the British representative had to give in. However, it was soon clearly revealed that this matter was initiated for the benefit of Germany.

In the complex process of the League of Nations attempting to suppress Italy with sanctions to maintain peace with Abyssinia, the right-wing government of France under the Laval cabinet was unwilling to break with Italy because it wanted to cooperate with Italy through the Locarno Treaty to contain Germany. However, British policy was exactly the opposite. The British government and public did not want to weaken Mussolini and the fascist government in Rome too much, because they feared the rise of the Italian left wing (which in their minds was the Communist Party). This view was also the main prejudice of the German government and the Foreign Office at the time. The British policy of not wanting to impose real sanctions on Italy—because sanctions would harm it—was welcomed by Berlin.

But from a long-term perspective, the establishment of a fascist empire in East Africa is not in Britain's interest. This not only threatens Britain's colonies but also threatens the sea route through the Red Sea to India. This affects Britain's prestige. In short, behind Britain's hesitant attitude, there are ulterior motives, especially at this time when preparations are being made to impose an oil embargo on Italy and when most of the cooperation with the United States under the Neutrality Act can be determined.

This ulterior motive is a secret agreement within the British government within the cabinet to meet Germany halfway and express reconciliation with Hitler, part of the price being to condone Germany's handling of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. What Germany wants is a price higher than this, including interference in the Free City of Danzig, Britain, and Czechoslovakia. As for the policies and ideas of France, even if Germany could get half of its price, it would be directly opposed.

This trick is the preparation for the rupture between the United States and France, even if the terms of the Anglo-German deal do not include France and Belgium.

Current Commentary

### Trends in Sino-Japanese Diplomacy

— Qi

Since the resolution of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents at the end of last year, there has been a trend for both China and Japan to engage in diplomatic negotiations again. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe made a statement on the 5th to the Nanjing correspondent of the Asahi Shimbun, stating that Sino-Japanese negotiations may be continued in the near future. At the same time, there are rumors that the authorities in North China and the Japanese side are also resolving outstanding issues. We hope that there are no other hidden agendas behind these messages, and that they only indicate the establishment of a correct concept on the part of Japan for resolving Sino-Japanese issues.

Looking at the exchange of documents between China and Japan regarding the resolution of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, we cannot help but admit that this is a gratifying start to clearing the gloomy atmosphere between the two countries. Setting aside the content, the establishment of these exchanges ultimately indicates a turn towards a correct concept on the part of Japanese diplomacy. That is, recognizing that incidents like Chengdu and Beihai are ordinary, individual local cases, and not drawing any ambiguous conclusions from them that would cause further disputes. For example, some Japanese people previously interpreted the Chengdu and Beihai incidents as a representation of China's entire anti-Japanese movement. If the Japanese side can truly adjust the relationship between the two countries based on such a realistic diplomatic concept, we believe that the future of diplomatic negotiations between the two sides will definitely return to a clear atmosphere.

In light of the recent situation of diplomatic developments, we believe that we Chinese people should have a new awakening. If the recent Sino-Japanese diplomacy has increased the possibility of gradual stabilization, we should see that such a change is a reflection of our nation's unity and solidarity. For example, even in terms of resolving the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, if last year's Xi'an Incident had been delayed and not resolved quickly, or even if a major and unfortunate rift had occurred internally, perhaps the negotiations on these two cases would not have been resolved to this day. Even if they were resolved, they would probably have been different in content than they are now. In his recent statement, Kawagoe also said, "The Xi'an Incident lasted only two weeks, but it occurred at the most critical time. The Chinese National Government's handling of the aftermath and the people's trust in the government are both extremely noteworthy. This is clear evidence of China's great progress." Although the diplomat's rhetoric cannot be fully believed to be true, the publication of such a view does have a factual basis. This fact will change the beliefs and attitudes of diplomatic opponents, thereby forming a new turn in the development of diplomatic negotiations. From this, it can be seen that we can only achieve a smooth resolution of diplomacy if we are united from top to bottom and concentrate our strength.

We believe that clearing the low pressure between China and Japan is not only our Chinese people's wish, but also something that Japanese people are very concerned about. If the relationship between China and Japan is not thoroughly improved, East Asian peace, no matter how loudly it is proclaimed, is probably just a bubble and a flower in the mirror. If East Asian peace cannot be achieved, it will definitely affect the future of world peace. For the sake of the peace of the entire human race, and for the sake of peace in East Asia, we dare to respectfully present the two points mentioned above to the people of China and Japan.

### Japan Adjusts Relations with Russia

Resolving Border Issues, Differences in Opinions Between Both Parties

[Tokyo] The main existing issues between Japan and Russia are the conclusion of a new fisheries treaty and the establishment of a border commission. In order to resolve these outstanding issues as soon as possible, Foreign Minister Arita has decided to invite the Russian Ambassador to Japan to the Foreign Ministry within days to urge negotiations. On the issue of the Manchurian-Russian border, Japan and Russia generally agree, but there remain three issues on which the two sides have not seen eye to eye: ① the organization of the border processing committee, ② prior to the confirmation of the border, the existing border should be recognized as the legitimate border, and ③ the dispute processing committee should manage all border incidents.

### Roosevelt Announces Policy Guidelines to Congress

Promoting the New Deal Based on the Constitution, Banning Arms Shipments to Spain, Both Houses of Congress Quickly Pass

[Washington] President Roosevelt read his annual message to Congress today, announcing the purpose of the "Second New Deal" to the people. The House chamber was crowded with listeners. The President, in a clear voice, stated that the National Industrial Recovery Act could be made legal without amending the Constitution. (This point is very important, as some had already anticipated that after this election, the government, having gained the trust of the majority of the people, would re-propose the National Industrial Recovery Act and overcome all constitutional issues.) The President also stated that circumstances forced him to make the following requests:

① Extend the powers granted by the previous Congress that are about to expire.

② Further promote neutrality legislation to deal with the situation caused by the Spanish Civil War.

③ Add to this year's budget.

It has been customary for American presidents to send written messages to Congress. Roosevelt personally read his message last time, and this time he followed the same precedent. In addition to the members of the Senate and House of Representatives, the gallery was filled with cabinet members, foreign guests, celebrities, and ordinary people. Most notably, none of the judges of the Supreme Court were present, so they did not hear the President's frank criticism of their interpretation of the Constitution.

The President said, "The operation of American democracy must not be endangered by refusing the necessary powers of a free government. Therefore, the judiciary must also strive for the success of democracy. Now, the executive and legislative branches can cooperate closely. Although we do not seek for the court to produce powers that do not exist, the powers within the scope of the Constitution should be made as effective as possible to enhance the welfare of the public."

The President further stated that he firmly believed that the goals of the National Industrial Recovery Act were quite sound, but it was unavoidable that it was too much to digest. Although the current law has expired, the current problems have not yet been resolved.

The President also advocated that federal laws should supplement the deficiencies of state laws in order to solve the social and economic problems caused by modern inventions that transcend state borders. As for constitutional issues, the President believed that the people have come to understand more clearly in the past year that there is nothing wrong with the Constitution. Therefore, the current urgent need is not to amend the Constitution, but to interpret it clearly. If it can be interpreted properly, it can be a tool for progress and not an obstacle to any action.

The President opposed unlimited overproduction and the suppression of production by monopolies. The interests of the country depend entirely on the government assisting private industries to maintain stable prices and preventing them from rising and falling sharply.

Finally, the President addressed foreign policy issues, saying that militarism has become rampant in oligarchical countries. (National Telegram of the 6th)

[Washington] After President Roosevelt's message was read, both houses of Congress passed the bill to prohibit the export of arms, ammunition, and military supplies to Spain or their transit to Spain by a large majority last night. The bill was passed after a short discussion, which was unprecedented in its speed. (Reuters dispatch of the 7th)

### Brutality of the Spanish War Leads to Amendment of American Neutrality Law

To Take Effect Upon Signature on Friday, Batch of Arms Hurriedly Shipped Out

[Washington] The Senate and the House of Representatives voted today to pass an amendment to the current Neutrality Act proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stipulating that all kinds of military supplies are prohibited from being shipped to Spain, and any recently issued export permits for military supplies to Spain will also be cancelled as a result.

The bill states, "The Spanish revolution is a rare and brutal war, and its war is likely to spread beyond the borders of Spain. Therefore, the export of American military supplies to Spain poses a great danger to the security and peace of the United States itself, and is also contrary to the neutral policy of the United States. In this situation, it is necessary to pass a bill immediately."

The bill also stipulates, "All arms, ammunition, and military supplies are prohibited from being transported from the United States or its territories to Spain, or from being transported to other countries for the purpose of being transported to the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War. Violators of this prohibition will be fined $10,000 or imprisoned for five years."

The military supplies specified in the bill as prohibited are the same items specified in President Roosevelt's declaration of arms embargo during the war between Italy and Abyssinia on April 10 last year. All non-military aircraft and their dismantled parts are also prohibited. The effective period will be determined by President Roosevelt. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)

[Washington] Both houses of Congress convened today, and the bill proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to prohibit arms shipments to Spain passed smoothly without objection. President Roosevelt thus won a great victory, but several speakers at the time stated that they voted in favor because the current international situation is serious and they had to take expedited procedures in legislation. However, they did not agree that the only way to safeguard American neutrality was to prohibit arms exports. It seems that if Congress expects to follow the government's wishes in discussing the new Neutrality Act this month, as it did today, it may not be entirely true. However, all parties praised President Roosevelt's message. Although some believed that the President's speech would have been more practical, observers said that the President's lack of lofty rhetoric further showed his agility. Because the President has an unprecedented majority in this Congress, he did not want to exceed the scope of his authority on major national policies and would rather let the Senate and House of Representatives propose bills on their own. Therefore, in his message, the President only proposed two things to Congress: ① The resolution to prohibit arms shipments to Spain should be passed. ② Regarding the issue of organizing financial relief for unemployment, certain privileges currently enjoyed by the government should be extended by Congress in order to achieve complete success. In addition, well-informed sources also stated that the President is also planning several measures on domestic affairs to be submitted to Congress for discussion. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)

[New York] The Spanish cargo ship Mar Cantabrico, loaded with eighteen American aircraft and four hundred and eleven engines, bound for the Republican government in the Spanish port of Valencia, cast off at 6:45 p.m. and sailed to the Spanish port of Cadiz. Beforehand, the ship's crew and dockworkers hurriedly loaded the cargo in order to ship it out before Congress passed the new Chinese Civil Law Act and extended the arms embargo measures to the Spanish Civil War. However, after the Mar Cantabrico cast off and sailed past Sandy Hook Point, a coast guard patrol boat and an aircraft rushed to order it to return to the port of New York. Fortunately, an order from Washington arrived shortly thereafter, granting permission to leave, so the Mar Cantabrico was able to sail out. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)

### American Volunteers Also Eager to Fight for Spain

Six Hundred Men Will Depart from New York, Britain Opposes Blockade of Spain, Rebel Army Continues Siege of Capital

[San Francisco] The California Secretary of the Socialist Party, Mr. Qu Bai'er, declared today that he is currently recruiting volunteers, intending to send hundreds to Spain to assist the government army in combat. Twenty people have already applied, including veterans of the European War and one aviator who participated in the Sino-Japanese War of 1932. There are also several chemists and one striking seaman. New York also has five hundred volunteers scheduled to depart on the 19th of this month. It is said that those recruited here will join them. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

[London] The British Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Drummond, today conveyed to the Italian Foreign Ministry his serious concern regarding the continued dispatch of large numbers of Italian volunteers to Spain. He requested that Italy provide a written reply to the previous notes from Britain and France within this week. It is reported that Germany has also received similar urgent requests. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

[Berlin] The government decided today to halt the continued dispatch of volunteers to Spain before responding to the neutrality proposals of Britain and France. None of the soldiers stationed in southeastern Germany have volunteered today. Officials have expressed satisfaction with this. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

[Berlin] Regarding the proposal by Britain and France to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain, responsible persons recently declared that the German government's reply will still be sent out today. It is said that its content reiterates the country's views and will not differ greatly from those of Italy in essence. It is unknown whether this reply will be delivered by the ambassadors of Britain and France in Berlin or by the German ambassadors to Britain and France to the governments of their respective host countries. The main points generally include the following three items: ㊀ The German government advocates that the issue of non-intervention should be resolved comprehensively. In other words, various indirect methods of intervention, especially financial assistance, must be prohibited simultaneously with the dispatch of volunteers. ㊁ Foreign political personnel currently in Spain must be withdrawn. This clearly refers to Soviet personnel, because these personnel are reportedly holding important positions in the Spanish government. ㊂ This reply will also clarify that the views of Germany and Italy are completely consistent. (Havas News Agency, 7th)

[Paris] An international brigade composed of left-wing individuals from various countries, totaling about two thousand people, crossed the border at Bobigny at 1:00 PM today and traveled by train to Barcelona, Spain. Poles are the most numerous among them. There is also a medical team, including one American. Forty Soviet anti-aircraft guns were simultaneously transported to Bilbao. A French government spokesperson told the Associated Press today that France is preparing to participate in a naval, land, and air blockade of Spain to prevent any goods other than food and medicine from being transported to Spain, but this requires the cooperation of Germany, Italy, and Russia. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

[Paris] The French Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Poncet, was originally scheduled to return to France on Friday to meet with Foreign Minister Delbos. It is now learned that his departure has been postponed. Some newspapers here believe that Mr. Poncet may be conducting important talks with the German authorities and therefore is not leaving his post immediately. An afternoon newspaper reported, "The German authorities believe that it is time for Germany and France to conduct direct negotiations to clarify the situation." (Havas News Agency, 7th)

[London] Someone from the Foreign Office declared that the expert committee of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War, when holding a plenary meeting in Shanghai, had discussed the proposal to blockade the Spanish coast. At that time, the British representative stated that if Japan, the United States, and the countries of Central and South America did not join the Spanish Non-Intervention Agreement, the British government would oppose the principle of blockading the Spanish coast. Therefore, the Spanish coastal surveillance plan drafted by the experts only stipulated that the coast of that country should be patrolled by warships dispatched by various countries. When suspicious ships are found, their actions can only be reported to the port surveillance committee, and no direct investigation should be initiated. (Havas News Agency, 7th)

Avila The Nationalist forces launched an attack in the vicinity of Madrid yesterday, advancing ten kilometers from south to north and six kilometers from west to east. The northwestern suburbs of Madrid are therefore increasingly falling under the control of the Nationalist forces. The front line in the western suburbs is closer to Madrid, but it is calm and peaceful. Furthermore, the government army suffered a large number of casualties during yesterday's fierce attack by the Nationalist forces. Military experts have declared that yesterday's battle was the most important in the entire campaign to besiege Madrid. (Havas News Agency, 7th)

Avila This newspaper's correspondent, Pete, reports that the weather cleared up yesterday, and the Nationalist forces again occupied many new positions in the vicinity of Madrid. Under the cover of several air force squadrons, the Nationalist forces' Fourth Column launched an attack on the town of Boadilla del Monte in the northwestern suburbs. At the same time, the government army's attack from the left flank was also repelled by the Nationalist forces. Nationalist aircraft also carried out heavy bombing in the northwestern suburbs of Majadahonda, Pozuelo de Alarcón, and Aravaca, causing many houses to catch fire. (Havas News Agency, 7th)

Madrid Nationalist aircraft again heavily bombed the central business district of the capital today, targeting the telephone exchange building. Nationalist artillery first bombarded the building, followed by aircraft bombing. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented since the Nationalist forces reached the vicinity of the capital. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

### Germany's Ultimatum to Spain is Ignored

Neither Requesting the League of Nations to Intervene, Nor Mentioning the Neutrality Committee

[Geneva] League of Nations personnel declared today that the Spanish government will not be intimidated by Germany's ultimatum. Germany and Spain are currently engaged in an informal naval war, which poses a risk of accidental disputes. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

[Geneva] The Spanish government sent a note to the League of Nations yesterday, lodging a serious protest against Germany's naval activities in Spanish territorial waters in violation of international law, but did not request the League of Nations to intervene. This note is merely for informational purposes, outlining the recent actions of the German navy in Spanish territorial waters and requesting the League of Nations to convey this matter to all member states. According to the meaning of the note, the Valencia government does not intend to comply with Germany's ultimatum to return the cargo and passengers of the German ship "Palos" by 8:00 AM on Friday, pending investigation by the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War. According to Spanish sources, there is no reason to submit this case to the Adjustment Committee. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)

[Paris] The Spanish Ambassador to France, Mr. Coronas, recently visited Deputy Foreign Minister Vienot to discuss the ship detention negotiations between Germany and Spain, as well as the warning issued by Germany. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

### The Rexist Party of Belgium Propagates its Platform

Using Italian Radio Stations to Proclaim United Anti-Communism

Brussels After arriving in Italy a few days ago, the leader of the fascist Rexist Party, Léon Degrelle, made a broadcast speech from the Turin radio station today, expounding on the Rexist Party's platform. He stated, "The current barbaric system of Soviet Russia is sufficient to threaten European culture and is the common enemy of the Fascist Party and the Rexist Party. Italy was the first country in Europe to complete the people's revolution, and the Italian farmers and workers have thus regained their true dignity. The Rexist Party of Belgium must strive to restore the people's unity so that they can break away from the rule of bureaucratic politicians and establish a corporatist system." Degrelle's speech was broadcast to this area and was clearly audible. It is generally expected that the Belgian government will protest to Italy because the Belgian government has always prohibited Degrelle from using radio broadcasts to give speeches. Degrelle was unable to achieve his goals in his own country, so he used the Turin radio station instead. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

### Soviet Road Construction Plan

Warsaw According to reports from Moscow, a plan to build a military road from Moscow to the western border has been decided and will be completed this year. The road is being built by political prisoners and is wide enough to accommodate several vehicles. At the same time, there are branches connecting to the borders of Latvia and Poland. The road is currently 250 kilometers long. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

### Germany Builds Defensive Works Along the Border with Poland

Aircraft Prohibited from Flying Overhead to Prevent Leakage of Military Secrets

[Berlin] An official gazette published an order prohibiting all aircraft except German military aircraft from flying over an area of approximately 2,000 square miles in the eastern border area of Prussia near Poland. This order was apparently issued because Polish Foreign Minister Beck announced the continuation of the Franco-Polish alliance in the Polish Parliament yesterday. Germany was deeply irritated by Beck's speech, and especially dissatisfied with the statement, "Now that negotiations for a new Locarno Pact are about to begin, I wish to see our alliance with France maintain its full value." (Reuters News Agency, 7th)

[Berlin] Aviation Minister General Göring issued an order a few days ago prohibiting aircraft from flying over the area between the Polish border and the right bank of the German Warta River. This area is bounded on the north by the Warthe River (a tributary of the Warta River), on the south by the section of the Warta River between the small towns of Krosno and Ciechocinek, on the west by the straight line between Landsberg an der Warthe and Krosno, and on the east by the Polish border. The above prohibition does not specify a time limit. From now on, all aircraft flying from Germany to Poland should circumvent the south or north of this area. It is reported that the Aviation Ministry's issuance of this prohibition is not a new creation, but it is the first time for a relatively important area. It is generally believed that the German authorities are now building defensive works in the forested and mountainous area between the Warta River and the Polish border, and the prohibition was issued to prevent the leakage of military secrets. Furthermore, the above prohibition was issued on December 30, in other words, the day after Polish Foreign Minister Beck delivered a speech in the Polish Parliament requesting approval of Poland's loan from France. This is also quite noteworthy. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

### Germany Actively Prepares for War, Training Military Medical Personnel

New Expressway Completed, Total Length Over 200 Kilometers

[Berlin] The government has recently issued an order stipulating that all doctors in the country should receive special training in preparation for wartime conscription. In addition, special military medical schools should be established in all major cities across the country to cultivate military medical talent. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

[Berlin] The government recently built an expressway between Berlin and Hanover, with a length of 225 kilometers, which is the longest expressway in Germany. It has now been completed and will be opened to traffic on the 10th of this month. (Havas News Agency, 6th)

### Pope's Illness for Three Weeks, Likely to Succumb

Vatican City Vatican officials told Associated Press reporters today that Pope Pius XI has been ill for three weeks and is likely to succumb. The Pope has long known this, but he is quite remorseful for failing to complete some important religious affairs. Heart specialists proposed an examination, but the Pope refused. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

Vatican City Since the news that the archbishop in charge of convening religious conferences has been invited to reside in or near Rome to prevent the Pope's unexpected passing was released, Catholics are concerned about the Pope's condition. It is generally expected that Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State, has a chance of being elected as the new Pope. Although the Pope was still quiet last night, officials said that his condition has not changed, but the current situation is still precarious. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)

The Hague Today is the auspicious day for the marriage of Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld of the German royal family. The weather is clear and the sun is shining, and the streets of the entire city are decorated with flags and colorful ribbons, dazzlingly beautiful. The wedding procession departed from the palace at 11:00 AM. It was led by several squadrons of cavalry, followed by carriages carrying the groomsmen and bridesmaids. The newlywed couple rode together in a golden carriage drawn by eight magnificent horses. The Prince wore a blue cavalry uniform, and several officers were lined up in five rows behind the carriage to escort them. Soldiers and police were densely deployed along the route, but the crowds surged and their emotions were intense, and there was a risk of breaking through the cordon. When they arrived in front of the City Hall, three bands played music to welcome them. After the civil ceremony was completed, the procession again proceeded to the church for the religious ceremony, and then returned to the palace. The route of the procession was extremely lively. Many people stood in front of the palace, the City Hall, or the church late last night, eager to see the demeanor of the newlywed couple first. It is estimated that no less than a million people attended the ceremony today, which can be described as extremely grand. Since the groom, Prince Bernhard, is the son-in-law of the Queen of the Netherlands, he was bestowed with the prestigious title of "Prince of the Netherlands" and appointed as a member of the Council of State. The bride followed her husband's surname and was called "Princess Lippe-Biesterfeld." (Havas News Agency, 7th)

### Tianjin Municipal Government Implements Expanded Authority

Directly Administering Five Land and Water Agencies; The Reason is to Adapt to the Environment

Tianjin Communication The expansion of the Tianjin Municipal Government's powers has been implemented this month. Mayor Zhang Zizhong must still consult with various agencies in Peiping [Beijing] regarding the allocation of funds. The agencies designated by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to be under the jurisdiction of Tianjin City include: ㊀ Tianjin Garrison Headquarters (formerly under the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters); ㊁ Hebei Province Five Rivers Water Police Bureau (formerly under the Hebei Provincial Government); ㊂ Hebei Province Maritime Police Bureau (formerly under the Hebei Provincial Government); ㊃ Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office (formerly under the Hebei Provincial Government); ㊄ Tianjin Shipping Bureau (formerly under the Hebei Provincial Government). Among the above five agencies, the Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office originally had jurisdiction over Tianjin and Jinghai counties. Recently, due to the expansion of the municipal government's powers, the jurisdiction has been extended to Ninghe and Wuqing counties. In terms of municipal area, it is impossible to directly incorporate them, so the name of the Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office is used to absorb the two counties and then transfer them to the Tianjin Municipal Government. According to the regulations of the Hebei-Chahar Council, all official documents submitted by the five agencies must follow the usual procedures of requesting the approval of higher-level agencies. That is to say, the procedures of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Government for the Tianjin Municipal Government to approve or reject the documents have been eliminated. What remains to be discussed at this moment is only the issue of funding. The five agencies spend more than 400,000 yuan per month in total. The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters is paid by the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters, the Five Rivers Water Police Bureau, the Maritime Police Bureau, the Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office, and the four counties under its jurisdiction (Tianjin, Jinghai, Ninghe, and Wuqing) are paid by the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Tianjin Shipping Bureau retains funds from shipping damage and dock donations. The source of funding for the five agencies has nothing to do with the municipal government. Once they are under its jurisdiction, it is not easy to seek unified payment. Zhang Zizhong indicated in Peiping that it is generally decided that all agencies with original income will directly deduct the funds and submit them to the municipal government, and then the municipal government will allocate them according to the budget. Although the procedures seem slightly complicated, they are much more convenient than transferring funds from the original agencies. Zhang Zizhong will be able to decide on this matter when he returns to Tianjin.

The reason for the expansion of Tianjin's powers this time is said to be partly to adapt to the environment. Because there are more and more foreign affairs in the four counties of Tianjin, Jinghai, Ninghe, and Wuqing, under the pressure of the abnormal foreign forces in North China, it is neither possible for a small county magistrate to deal with them adequately, nor is it possible for an administrative commissioner to take on heavy responsibilities. At the same time, the situation is turbulent, and it is necessary to have meticulous and unified command of security, land, and water defenses. The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, the Five Rivers Water Police Bureau, and the Maritime Police Bureau are under the jurisdiction of three or several agencies. These three or several agencies are all located far away from Tianjin, and seeking instructions and discussing matters back and forth often leads to delays. The Tianjin Municipal Government has no relationship with the various agencies, so it has no power to dispatch and control them, and it is feared that there will be unexpected accidents, confused steps, and improper responses. Therefore, the Hebei-Chahar authorities, in seeking to adapt to local conditions, have taken this action to expand powers. Not only is Tianjin like this, but the Peiping Municipal Government will also expand its powers to include the Wanping Administrative Commissioner District, with jurisdiction over the administrative and foreign affairs of the four counties of Daxing, Wanping, Qinghe, and Shunyi. It will be implemented in the near future according to the example of Tianjin City. (6th)

### Judgment on the Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang Case of Endangering the Republic of China

Each Sentenced to Seven Years Imprisonment and Seven Years Deprivation of Civil Rights

The assassination case of former Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan has been concluded after trials by the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court at the Capital District Court. On December 31st of last year, Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights each for organizing a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. Four copies of prohibited publications were confiscated. As for the part concerning murder, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi were transferred to the Capital District Court due to jurisdictional error. The following is an excerpt of the facts and reasons from the judgment.

Facts

Zhang Yuhua's thinking leaned to the left. When he served as a section member in the political department of the 25th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, he tried to join the Communist Party but failed. In 1931, he came to Shanghai, where he lived a frustrated life. Through Yan Shaopeng, whom he had known for a long time, he joined the Socialist League, an outer group of the Communist Party (hereinafter referred to as "She Lian"). Under the guidance of the Cultural General League (hereinafter referred to as "Wen Zong"), he participated in gatherings, wrote articles, distributed leaflets, and posted slogans. Later, he was promoted to the District Committee of West Shanghai by the standing committee of She Lian and served as the editor of the She Lian newspaper and a member of the She Lian Economic Committee. Later, he and his friend Hua Ke, who is now at large, came to Nanjing and founded the Chenguang News Agency, after which he no longer held positions in She Lian. He Poguang served as the secretary of the Shanghai Pudong New-Style Laundry Industry Union and the Stevedores' Union. In April 1933, through the introduction of Xie Fensheng, he got to know Zhang Yuhua. First, they organized a reading group, stipulating that they would meet once a week. Later, through Zhang Yuhua's introduction, he joined She Lian and formed a small group with Shen Mingzhao and Zhang Yuhua. Subsequently, he also joined the Workers' Education League (hereinafter referred to as "Gong Jiao Lian"), which was also led by Wen Zong. On September 13th, at Zhang Yuhua's invitation, he came to Nanjing to work as a reporter for the Chenguang News Agency. On the morning of November 1st, 1935, at around 10:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. All the members of the Central Executive Committee stood in front and back rows in front of the conference hall to take a group photo. After the photo was taken, the members of the Central Executive Committee in the back row turned and entered the conference hall. Wang Jingwei, the former Premier of the Executive Yuan, happened to be in the front row. At that time, Sun Fengming, who had entered the venue under the name of a reporter for the Chenguang News Agency, suddenly stepped out from the crowd next to the camera and fired three shots at Premier Wang with a gun. Fortunately, they were not fatal. Sun Fengming was apprehended on the spot and was fatally shot by a police officer. He died the next day. The defendants Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi were all suspected of participating in the assassination and were arrested one after another in Shanghai, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and other places. They were sent by the Capital Police Department to the Military Police Command. With the resolution of the Central Standing Committee, they were transferred to the court for handling. After the prosecutor of this court concluded the investigation, he charged Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi with jointly violating Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China, and Article 271, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law. According to Article 55 of the Criminal Law, they should be punished according to the more severe offense. Zhang Yuhua had joined She Lian and served as a district committee member, and He Poguang had joined She Lian and Gong Jiao Lian, and had also violated Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China. A public prosecution was filed with the court.

Reasons

This case is divided into two parts for discussion as follows:

[A. The part where Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang are accused of organizing a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. It has been found that the defendant Zhang Yuhua confessed during the investigation, "After the January 28th Incident, I was introduced by Yan to join She Lian, served as the District Committee of West Shanghai, and was guided by Wen Zong. Wen Zong is an outer group of the Communist Party and is guided by the Communist Party." (See page 412 of the investigation file of the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor). In his confession to the Nanjing Garrison Command, he described in detail the reasons for participating in She Lian's activities, the content of She Lian's organization, and the work he held in She Lian (see pages 10 to 13 of Zhang Yuhua's confession). Now he argues that She Lian is an abbreviation for the Social Science League, not the Socialist League, and is a group that studies social sciences. The Three Principles of the People are also included in the research. It has no reactionary nature at all. The group is not a Communist group, and its members are not Communist Party members, etc. This is obviously an attempt to justify himself and cannot be believed. As for the defendant He Poguang, he organized a reading group with Xie Fensheng and Zhang Yuhua in Shanghai in February and March of 1934. Later, he was introduced by Zhang Yuhua to join She Lian. He not only confessed repeatedly during the investigation by the Garrison Command and the prosecutor, but also admitted it without hesitation during the trial in this court (see the trial record of this court on March 31, 1936). In his confession, he even stated that in July 1934, through Zhang Yuhua's relationship, he joined the Socialist League and formed a small group with Shen Mingjian and Zhang Yuhua to specialize in theoretical research. There were also printed materials such as "A Letter to Workers on Revolutionary Memorial Day," "She Lian Work Report," and "Current Affairs Commentary," which were brought for distribution. In August, the New-Style Laundry Industry Union was closed down, so I moved to Pudong and joined the Workers' Education League. I was close to Chen Wangzhi, a member of the standing committee of Wen Zong, and considered launching a labor-capital struggle for laundry workers, but it failed to develop due to the death of the workers' leader Xu Benliang, etc. (see page 7 of He Poguang's confession). Now he says that he does not know what kind of nature She Lian belongs to, only knowing that it is a reading organization. His empty words are overturned and cannot be adopted. Furthermore, the content of She Lian's organization, according to Zhang Yuhua's confession, is "to participate in all groups in action and use opportunities to launch struggles to win over their own masses; in propaganda, to break into all publications to publish texts that are beneficial to them." It can be seen that the main purpose of this group is to seize the masses for the Communist Party in order to launch class struggles and to hope to transform the country of the Three Principles of the People into a Communist country. Therefore, Zhang Yuhua and others' participation in She Lian's activities is to organize a group for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, which is undoubtedly true. Although He Poguang was arrested because of Sun Fengming's assassination of Premier Wang, he described the process of joining She Lian during the interrogation, but there was no expression of intention to seek judgment, which does not meet the requirements of surrender. As for Zhang Yuhua's arrest, it was after He Poguang's arrest. The fact that he and He Poguang jointly joined She Lian had already been stated by He Poguang, so his confession of joining She Lian cannot be regarded as surrender, let alone said. It is also claimed that after they arrived at the Chenguang News Agency, they broke away from She Lian, but since they did not legally surrender, it is difficult to reduce or exempt them from criminal liability. Furthermore, both Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang served in propaganda work that was beneficial to the Communist Party after joining She Lian and Gong Jiao Lian, as has been stated in the record. In addition to committing the crime of organizing a group for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, they also committed the crime of propagating doctrines that are incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. However, it has been found that although there are three types of acts in Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China, they are legal provisions that coincide and should be punished according to the more serious crime of organizing a group for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. In accordance with Articles 6 and 10 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China, Article 28, Section 37, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, they are each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. The books seized in the case have been reviewed by the Central Organization Department. The two books "Left-Wing Infantile Disorder" and "The Current Situation of World Labor" are Communist publications. The book "On the State" and other books are anarchist publications. The book "Communism and China" is a publication of the State-Faction Youth Party. All of them are reactionary books that should be banned. Even if it cannot be proven who owns them, since they are prohibited items, they should be confiscated in accordance with Article 38, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Article 40 of the Criminal Law. (To be continued)

Approved New Tax Rate for Land Tax

The revision of the land tax regulations has been drafted by the county and submitted to the authorities. The original regulations have been merged and revised into three classes and nine grades, which have already been reported to the bureau. Now, according to the instructions, the new tax rates have been examined, and amendments have been made to test them for one year. The tax rates for each grade are listed below: First class, upper grade: 1.6 yuan per mu of arable land; middle grade: 1.3 yuan per mu; lower grade: 1.1 yuan per mu. Second class, upper grade: 0.83 yuan per mu; middle grade: 0.68 yuan per mu; lower grade: 0.64 yuan per mu.

All arrears of taxes were previously pursued by the Qingfu Committee sent by the bureau, and a deadline of the 5th of this month was set to pay them off uniformly. The deadline has expired, and very few have completed the payment. From now on, they will be pursued and押缴户 by户 in order to maintain national taxes.

The Procuratorate of the Wuxian County District Court received a report from Zhao Ashuang, the local security officer of Xukou Township, stating that an unidentified male corpse, about thirty years old, was found murdered on the river beach of Xiaojing, Shajin Bridge, on the bank of West Taihu. The hands were tied with hemp rope. He requested that personnel be sent to examine the corpse to clarify the truth.

### Wuxi

Raiding a Monk's Secret Chamber

Zhongdushan in the third district of the county is one of the scenic areas of this county. There is a Niangniang Temple on the mountain, which is very popular on weekdays. The common people flock to it like ducks to water. The abbot of the temple, Monk Hongyuan (aka Hongyuan), did not abide by the monastic rules and often came to the city, indulging in pleasure. There was also an opium couch in the temple for people to smoke privately, and a secret chamber was opened to be a golden house for hiding a lover. On November 27th of last year, Tan Gujin, a police officer from the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau under its jurisdiction, together with Song Jingren, the squad leader of the militia team, went to search and arrest the perpetrators. Many opium smoking utensils were seized on the spot. At that time, a young woman named Chen Li (said to be the concubine of a merchant in Shanghai) was lying in the room and claimed to be a pilgrim. The police officers brought the smoking utensils to the bureau and submitted them to the General Bureau, which then forwarded them to the county government. County Magistrate Long instructed the Public Security Bureau to summon all the witnesses to the county government for thorough investigation, because the inside story of the case was unclear. Director Zhang then ordered Director He Chaoan of the Sixth Branch to comply. On the 6th, Director He had summoned Monk Hongyuan, the woman Chen Li, and Zhang Chaoxuan to be presented to the General Bureau and forwarded to the county government for interrogation.

Children in urban and rural areas are prone to diseases. The weather was warm a few days ago, as if it were spring. However, on the morning of the 7th, it suddenly turned cold again. The Fahrenheit thermometer dropped to 38 degrees. The sky was covered with floating clouds, and snowflakes fluttered in the sky at 1:00 PM, melting as soon as they hit the ground.

### Telegrams from Two Railway Unions

Supporting the Central Government's Handling of the Aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions sent the following two telegrams to the central government and Zhang Xueliang yesterday: ㊀ "To the Central Party Headquarters (National Government) in Nanjing, greetings. The Xi'an Incident has caused outrage throughout the country and shocked the world. Fortunately, due to the great personality of our leader, the stubborn and rebellious have obeyed, and weapons have turned into jade. Great calamities have led to auspicious harmony. Our joy and excitement cannot be expressed in words. Upon reading the newspaper, we learned that the central government, in dealing with the case, has granted a special pardon outside of the sentence, and handed him over to the Military Affairs Commission for strict supervision in order to atone for his crimes. We can see that while rectifying discipline, the central government is also giving those who repent a path to self-renewal. Although the people of the whole country feel that there are still some regrets, they can still be forgiven. However, we still ask the central government to strictly restrain Zhang Xueliang's actions in the future in order to correct his thinking and break the delusion of his feudal tribe, so that he sincerely obeys the central government and supports the leader. All Northeast troops should also be strictly trained and not be incited by reactionary elements. As for the management of military expenditures, it should be directly disbursed by the military in order to eliminate the previous contracting system, so that all the country's troops are the country's troops and cannot establish a separate system to avoid disrupting discipline. We humbly submit this opinion and ask for your consideration. Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions, bowed respectfully. Yang." ㊁ "To Mr. Zhang Hanqing, greetings from Nanjing. In the Xi'an Incident, due to a moment of error, you almost plunged the nation into an abyss of destruction. Fortunately, our leader has a great personality, and the central government has handled the matter appropriately. You were able to pull back from the brink, bravely and thoroughly realize your mistake, and turn weapons into jade and anger into harmony. The past is like yesterday's death, and the future is like today's birth. We hope that you will appreciate the central government's extraordinary generosity and atone for your sins. Sincerely obey the supervision of the Military Affairs Commission, and please inform your comrades on the front lines to invigorate the righteousness, recognize the nation, and eliminate the previous feudal habits. Do not be incited by reactionary elements, follow the principles of our party, and support the leader. All military affairs, military orders, military expenditures, and military education should be completely obeyed by the central government, so that the national army can become a powerful force and complete the great task of national rejuvenation. This will not fail the expectations of the central government, the chairman, and the people of the whole country. We look forward to your observation. Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions, bowed respectfully. Yang."

### Ministry of Communications Urges Private Shipping Companies to Register Speedily

In order to conduct the registration of private shipping businesses, promote cooperation, and avoid independent actions, in addition to promulgating the registration rules, the Ministry of Communications has issued a petition form to the Maritime Affairs Bureau to inform the various shipping companies to register speedily within a short period. The Maritime Affairs Bureau's instruction is recorded as follows: "According to the instruction No. 4867 of the Ministry of Communications on December 25 of this year, 'It is found that due to the failure to conduct registration of private shipping businesses in our country, supervision is extremely difficult. In recent years, due to the impact of domestic and foreign economic insecurity, the shipping business has been deteriorating. In addition, shipping companies are acting independently and failing to cooperate effectively, while general unofficial shipping companies are engaged in speculation and disruption, making it impossible to restrict them. As a result, route disputes are occurring repeatedly, and shipping companies are often resorting to price cuts to compete, ultimately leading to mutually destructive outcomes. This situation is a major obstacle to the future of the shipping industry. In order to seek ways to implement registration for private shipping businesses, so as to supervise and promote national shipping cooperation, the Ministry has formulated the 'Shipping Business Registration Rules', 'Shipping Business Supervision Regulations', and 'Measures for Promoting Shipping Cooperation,' which were promulgated simultaneously on the 9th of this month with ministerial orders. In addition to petitioning the Executive Yuan for record and issuing separate orders, these rules, regulations, measures, and petition forms have been compiled and issued, so that you may be informed, and you are instructed to inform your subordinate offices and shipping trade associations, this order,' etc. attached are the 'Shipping Business Registration Rules', 'Shipping Business Supervision Regulations', 'Measures for Promoting Shipping Cooperation', and the 'Shipping Business Establishment Registration Petition Form', and 'Supplementary Registration Petition Form'. Upon receiving this, in addition to issuing separate orders, the corresponding 'Shipping Business Registration Rules', 'Shipping Business Supervision Regulations', and 'Measures for Promoting Shipping Cooperation' are enclosed for your information, and you are instructed to inform your subordinates accordingly, this order (below omitted)."

### Salt Revenue Auditing Office Develops Salt Affairs on the Anhui Shore

According to the Central News Agency, in recent years, the Salt Revenue Auditing Office of the Ministry of Finance has achieved significant results in the reform of salt administration and the rectification of salt taxes in various regions. According to the announcement of the office regarding the organization of salt affairs on the Anhui shore, the following is an abstract for the information of those concerned. The Anhui shore is one of the four major sales shores of Huai salt (Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui), with an annual salt tax revenue of more than six million yuan. Its geographical scope is within Anhui Province, excluding the nineteen counties in northern Anhui under the jurisdiction of the Bengbu Tax Collection Office, and Tianchang County, which is also under the jurisdiction of the Lianghuai salt region. The remaining seven counties in northern Anhui, including Hefei, and the entire southern Anhui region are managed by the Tax and Transportation Bureau, which manages salt administrative affairs. The Audit Office for Anhui Shore is responsible for auditing, tax collection, weighing, and distribution. In recent years, the financial authorities have been eager to unify powers and improve efficiency, so they ordered the Director of the Audit Office to concurrently manage the affairs of the Tax and Transportation Bureau. In recent years, it has achieved considerable results in increasing revenue, eliminating abuses, and facilitating the people.

Establishment of Central General Warehouse in Wuhu Planned

The salt in various parts of Anhui shore is transported from the Twelve Forts of the Huai region and distributed by sailboats. After arrival, taxes are paid before sales can begin. In order to concentrate the salt, facilitate management and distribution, and prepare for the implementation of the new salt law, land has been purchased on the Jiangnan (Yangtze River) shore in Wuhu to plan for the establishment of a central general warehouse. The plan is that after the completion of this general warehouse, all salt transported to the shore will first be concentrated and stored, and then distributed according to the needs of each branch shore and the means of transportation. In this way, merchants can safely store their goods without worrying about losses, and the government can prevent smuggling and increase official sales. The plan for this warehouse has been finalized and construction can begin in the near future.

Establishment of a Huai Salt Branch in Anqing

The salt consumed in the seven counties of Huaining (Anqing) and Taihu in the upper reaches of the Anhui shore has traditionally been supplied by Datong. People have to travel long distances to purchase it, which not only increases transportation costs, but also requires a handling fee of five cents per dan to the transport salt company, which is neither fair nor convenient. Therefore, the Audit Office specially obtained approval to establish a Huai Salt Branch in Anqing, and instructed salt merchants to directly transport salt from the production area for storage. The price of salt will be the same as that of Datong. It is recently heard that the branch can sell up to 100 tickets of salt per year.

Improve Transportation and Reduce Transportation Costs

The salt on Anhui shore has traditionally been transported by sailboat, and its transshipment to various branch shores requires changing to smaller boats for river transport due to the shallow water level in the inland rivers. The transshipment is costly and difficult, and often leads to unsalability. Merchants pass on the transshipment costs to the price of salt, further increasing the burden on the people. In recent years, the authorities have been aware of this and instructed merchants to use modern transportation tools as much as possible. At present, the salt used in Yicheng, Qingyang, Shidi, Taiping, and other counties is transported by road and automobile. Salt from the riverbank to Hefei is transported by train on the Huainan Railway, which not only reduces the risk, but also saves costs and time.

Reduce Tax Rates to Prevent Private Sales

The tax rate on Huai salt on the Anhui shore is higher than that of neighboring provinces, except for a portion of the sales area bordering Jiangxi. Neighboring salt is constantly encroaching on sales, which is a constant occurrence. Therefore, the salt tax in Taihu, Hexian, Dangtu, Shidi, Taiping, Jingde, and other counties has recently been reduced by one yuan per dan, so as to be roughly the same as that of Kunshan and other places. At the same time, the number of tax police has been adjusted to prevent it. Both samples and measures have been implemented, with considerable results. For example, Taihu County, which has been deprived of sales by the low-tax areas in previous years, has almost no market. Recently, it can sell more than a thousand dan per month. After tax reduction and anti-smuggling in Taiping and Shidi counties, transportation has been improved, thereby reducing costs and increasing sales volume.

Suppressing Boat Households and Improving Salt Quality

The quality of edible salt on the Anhui shore is quite poor, the reason being that all salt is transported from the Twelve Forts, where the quality and color of the stored salt are inferior. In addition, the sailboat transportation is slow, and boatmen sprinkle and sell along the way, often adding water to make up for the shortage. Therefore, once the salt arrives ashore, the amount of brine lost is very large, and the quality of the salt is even worse. Recently, the authorities have supervised the Food Salt Review Office of the Xiliang Customs to extract salt samples for testing when salt boats pass through the customs. Those that do not meet the standard composition will not be certified for release. On the one hand, each weighing and distribution office is instructed to pay attention. If there is dirty salt, it will be ordered to be destroyed. Wet salt will be instructed to filter the brine and dry it before it can be weighed and stored. Color matching is not allowed to reduce the net weight of the salt. After repeated strict rectifications, the above-mentioned malpractices have gradually been reduced, and the quality of the salt has been improved.

### China Merchants and Six Other Companies Collect Shallow Water Fees on the Yangtze River

Forty Percent, to be Implemented on the 15th

The China Merchants, Sanbei, NingShao, Taikoo Jardine, Nissin, and other six companies decided through a joint meeting to collect shallow water fees on the Yangtze River. Their announcement stated: "From January 15, 1937, all goods loaded to ports above Wuhu (including Hankou) must add shallow water fees, collected at 40% of the water power. This is hereby announced."

### Shipping Agents and Other Associations Oppose Weighing for Calculation

Request the Six Companies to Withdraw the Decision

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (state-owned), Sanbei Shipping Company (private), Ningshao, Jardine Matheson (British), Taikoo (British), Nissin (Japanese) and other six companies have jointly decided to calculate Yangtze River freight charges by weight. The Shanghai Shipping Agents Association and the Shanghai Regional Merchant Associations have unanimously opposed the decision and requested that the previous method of calculating freight charges based on the customs-taxed weight be retained. After repeated negotiations between the two parties proved futile, the two associations convened a members' meeting and resolved to notify the six companies yesterday: "To the esteemed companies, regarding the proposed weighing of goods transported to various ports along the Yangtze River by Pingzhun Company, your companies have previously called upon our associations to nominate representatives to discuss the matter together. After separate meetings with members from the Yangtze River region and joint meetings, all concluded that calculating freight charges based on the customs-taxed weight has been a long-standing practice and is convenient for all parties, without causing any undue advantage or disadvantage. As such, it would be difficult to comply with the proposed weighing by Pingzhun Company, and this has been duly recorded. Our associations have worked with your esteemed companies directly or indirectly for many years and have enjoyed a long-standing harmonious relationship. Should the goods be weighed by Pingzhun Company, it would only add unnecessary procedures and inevitably lead to pointless disputes, harming the friendly relationship between us. Therefore, we are writing to convey the situation and respectfully request that you accommodate the wishes of our members, withdraw the decision, and continue to operate as before. We would be most grateful for your consideration. Sincerely, to the Six Yangtze River Shipping Companies."

### Women's Welfare Association Receives Aid Supplies for Suiyuan

The Shanghai Women's Welfare Association for the Suiyuan Anti-Banditry Campaign has continued to receive welfare supplies.

Supplies include 203 silk wadded vests donated by Ms. Wang Hu Baozhen, 116 silk wadded vests from the Fudan Middle School, 2,090 pairs of gloves from the entire student body of Qingfeng Girls' Elementary School, 60 pairs of gloves from Huang Jinrong, and 163 pairs of gloves from the Sanlin Vocational School. The aforementioned winter supplies were delivered to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday by a Zhongxi Pharmacy truck for inventory.

### Banking Association Studies Special Cash Guarantee Measures

Considered Meticulously Planned and Feasible

According to the Central News Agency, Shanghai, a major bank in the city, noting the repeated cases of embezzlement and misappropriation by bank employees in recent years, and considering the current guarantor system to be ineffective in providing guarantees, has proposed special cash guarantee measures to improve the guarantee system. News of this initiative has been reported in the press. It is now understood that the measures have undergone two years of research and supplementation, and various sectors believe that the guarantor system is rife with abuses and should undoubtedly be abolished. There is a strong hope that it will be implemented soon to alleviate the difficulties faced by bank employees, guarantors, and other parties. Recently, the Shanghai Banking Association received a letter from the Ministry of Industry, requesting a thorough study of the measures to ensure their perfection. The Banking Association requested a detailed study by the Banking Institute. All agreed that the guarantee system urgently needs to be improved. However, the credit insurance methods currently practiced in Europe and the United States are too expensive, unsuitable for China, difficult to implement, and lack active measures to prevent fraud in advance. The special cash guarantee measures are based on the principles of credit insurance while adapting to the social conditions of China. The combined effect of the various regulations ensures both security for the bank and improvement of personnel management, implementation of employee welfare programs, and cultivation of employees' intellectual, moral, physical, and communal values. It also provides for joint penalties and rewards for reporting misconduct to curb the motivation for fraud. The amount of the security deposit is small and easily affordable, and it is treated as personal savings for the employee, to be fully refunded upon departure from the bank. This combines insurance with savings and is considered to be in line with the trends of the times and practically feasible. The Banking Institute also believed that the matter was of great importance to the financial community and its practitioners nationwide and sent the measures to financial professionals and companies nationwide for research and comment. The responses received have been overwhelmingly positive, praising the meticulous planning and calling for its immediate implementation. It is now understood that the Banking Institute will send the research results and a summary of the comments to the Banking Association, hoping that all banks will adopt it. It is recently reported that the Shanghai Banking Association attaches great importance to this issue. At the recent 11th Annual Members' Meeting, Chairman Chen Guangfu reported on the proposal to abolish the current bank guarantee system and resolved to promote the special cash guarantee measures, instructing branch associations in various locations to conduct research on the topic.

### Labor Strike Erupts Among Female Workers in the Spinning Department of the Shenxin No. 8 Factory Yesterday Morning

Work Briefly Resumed After Party and Government Officials Mediated, but Conflicts Erupted Again in the Night Shift, Threatening Escalation of Labor Unrest

According to the Dagong News Agency, over 600 workers in the spinning department of the Shenxin Textile Company's No. 8 Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Western Shanghai, initiated a labor strike starting at 6:00 AM yesterday. Following mediation and persuasion by officials from the Party and government organs, the strike was briefly resolved, and workers resumed work at noon. However, conflicts erupted again after the night shift began, and both the spinning and fine spinning departments are completely idle. The local police station dispatched personnel to quell the unrest, and the labor strike is threatening to escalate. The details are as follows:

Causes of the Labor Strike

The Shenxin Textile Company's factories No. 1 and No. 8, as well as the weaving mill, are located in the Zhoujiaqiao area of Western Shanghai, employing over 6,000 male and female workers. Recently, the workers discovered that the factory was underpaying wages, which they believed was intentional deduction. They requested that the factory record the daily wage amount on the work booklet daily (the factory's wages are calculated by piece rate) for verification and to avoid errors. However, the factory has not implemented this request, leading to worker dissatisfaction and fueling the labor strike.

Strike Action Yesterday Morning

At 6:00 AM yesterday, as the night shift ended and the day shift workers entered the factory, the factory management staff failed to open the factory doors of the spinning department, preventing workers from leaving the factory and those on the day shift from entering. This misunderstanding led to the labor strike. Over 600 female workers in the fine spinning department stopped working, followed by over 400 workers in the coarse spinning department, who also announced a strike. As for the other departments, factory No. 1, and the weaving mill, the over 5,000 workers continued to work as usual, unaffected by the strike. The striking workers also presented six demands to the factory, including rewards for work. After this incident occurred, the District Ten Cotton Spinning Workers' Union, fearing the escalation of the labor strike, dispatched personnel to persuade the workers to maintain order and sent representatives to report to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting them to seek a resolution.

Mediation and Resumption of Work

After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Headquarters immediately dispatched Lu Yinchu, a cadre from the Civil Affairs Department, to the factory at around 9:00 AM to investigate the truth and persuade the workers to resume work first. The workers immediately complied and resumed work, but then restarted the strike. Subsequently, Zhu Jintao, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, also arrived at the factory and, together with the factory director Wang Yuncheng, Hua Weiren, representatives Hua Jianren and Li Xintang, and worker representatives Wen Renliang, Liu Shibao, and Chen Cailin, mediated and decided on the following measures: (1) Starting from February 1st, all wages will be clearly recorded in the work booklets; (2) The fine spinning department's worship work shall not exceed 9:00 AM the following morning; (3) Those who are idled due to the strike should be assigned work as soon as possible to avoid long waits; (4) The floor-sweeping work in the spinning department will be funded by the factory, and the workers will sweep the small alleys themselves. The workers deemed the measures satisfactory and resumed work at noon.

Renewed Conflict

After the workers resumed work, the conflict had initially come to an end. However, at around 7:00 PM yesterday, after the night shift workers entered the factory, the female workers in the night shift fine spinning department suddenly went on strike again and rushed into the spinning department, throwing objects at the workers who were working, causing the spinning department workers to be unable to work as well and to stop working. The factory was deeply concerned that accidents might occur due to the chaotic situation and immediately called the Zhoujiaqiao police station to dispatch over 30 police officers to the scene to quell the unrest. However, the workers still gathered in the factory, and the situation was quite serious, threatening the escalation of the labor unrest.

### China Merchants Inland River Steamship Company Decides to Close

It is currently expediting the procedures. The report that a new manager has been reassigned is not true.

### Last Year's Financial Stability Improved Shanghai Real Estate

Hopes for Gradual Recovery and Prosperity

According to the New News Agency, Shanghai's land prices were quite prosperous before the January 28th Shanghai Incident. In recent years, due to the impact of political instability and the global economic downturn, market prices plummeted. According to real estate developers speaking to New News Agency reporters, in the past two to three years, various businesses in Shanghai have reduced their scale and cut expenses due to the market slump. This has led to an increase in vacant houses and numerous empty properties on various roads. Although landlords have voluntarily reduced rents to remedy the situation, real estate valuations remain high and taxes have not decreased. The local real estate association has petitioned the municipal authorities to reduce valuations and provide relief. Recalling the past when the national financial situation was active and real estate transactions were flourishing, the current lifeless state is vastly different. Fortunately, since the implementation of the legal tender policy in our country, the national currency system has been unified and the financial foundation has been consolidated. The national economy has transitioned from decline to recovery. In particular, last year's bumper harvests across the country have invigorated the rural economy, and real estate transactions have improved, marking a sign of the revival of our national economy. It is expected that all industries will recover and prosper in the future, and the real estate industry will gradually restore its vitality, revitalizing the Shanghai market.

### Shanghai West Opens Qinghu Road

Operating Long-Distance Buses

The Shanghai-Qingpu Long-Distance Bus Company, recognizing that the airport station is far from Shanghai and that vehicles on the Hongqiao Road cannot directly reach Shanghai, causing inconvenience to passengers, jointly decided with the Shanghai-Minhang Company this autumn to build a road starting from Huangjia Garden in Caohejing Town in Shanghai West, passing through Jiangjia Village to the west, to Qibao Town, crossing the Puhuitang Port and turning north, directly to Wujiaxiang Town at the western end of the airport, connecting to Qinghu Road.

### Xi E Hears Lawsuit for Disregarding Land Rent

Original Accused are Family Friends; Lawyer Requests Reconciliation

Xi E Han, a 53-year-old Jiangyin native and wealthy merchant of pigments and real estate residing at No. 1051 Jing'an Temple Road, entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent him and filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against Wang Zhulin (55 years old, Wuxi native), Wang Guidong (40 years old, Sichuan native, residing at No. 3 Weixiang Yuli, Catholic Church), and Xi Chenggen (48 years old, Jiangyin native, residing at No. 208 Hede Road), all shareholders of Jiuyuan Real Estate Company, for disregarding land rent of 23,216.09 yuan, requesting a joint and several judgment for repayment. According to the statement, the plaintiff owns a piece of land located at No. 137 on the French register of deeds at the East Xinqiao pier of Edward Road, which was leased to Jiuyuan Real Estate Company to build houses along the road, open the Da Hu Hotel, and build market houses on both sides. At that time, the annual rent was set at 13,400 taels. However, from September 13, 1935, to March 13, 1936, rent arrears amounted to 23,216 yuan. After more than two months of unsuccessful reconciliation between the two parties, the plaintiff sued for a joint and several judgment against the three defendants. The court granted the request, and yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu visited the Civil Court No. 7 to summon the defendants. The plaintiff, represented by lawyer Jiang, stated the meaning of the prosecution and the object of the judgment. The first and third defendants, Wang Zhulin and Xi Chenggen, delegated lawyers to argue that the plaintiff and defendants had been family friends for many years and were relatives, requesting permission for a postponement to allow the two parties to reconcile outside the court. The second defendant, Wang Guidong, delegated lawyer Wu Zhiping to argue that Wang Guidong had published a statement in the newspaper on April 4, 1936, declaring his withdrawal as a shareholder of Jiuyuan Real Estate Company, and there were corresponding letters, which could prove this. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that he did not recognize the second defendant's claim, but he must also be jointly and severally responsible for repaying the rent arrears. Now that the defendants have proposed reconciliation and payment in installments, the plaintiff can agree, but the amount cannot be reduced. After the court verified the statements, it announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 14th. The court then adjourned.

### Wife Comes to Shanghai and Remarries, Found Only After Twelve Years

Cannot Be Taken Back, Sues in Court for Obstructing Family; Defendant Not Present at Yesterday's Trial, Summoned Again for Postponement

Ye Shenglin, a 37-year-old Taoist priest from Zhintang, Taicang, married a fellow villager, Ba Ruibao, ten years ago and had two sons. In 1924, Ba Ruibao falsely claimed to be working as a servant in Shanghai and remarried Zhou Zhaozhang, the owner of the Jincheng cattle shed on Xietu Road, Fenglin Bridge. It has been twelve years since then. Ye Shenglin has now found her in Shanghai. After being blocked from taking her back, Ye discovered that his wife, Ba Ruibao, had met Zhou through Tang Jinfu, a fellow villager, who received a reward. Tang opened a matchmaker shop called Jin Laojian Tou at No. 149 Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession. Ye negotiated with Jin, but to no avail. Therefore, Ye Shenglin hired a lawyer to represent him and filed a lawsuit in the criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing Tang Jinfu and others of obstructing the family and requesting legal investigation. Based on the statement, the court summoned the defendants to the Criminal Court No. 2 yesterday afternoon, with Judge Wang Gangxu presiding. The defendants were not present. The plaintiff, Ye Shenglin, stated the previous situation and said that after his wife fled to Shanghai, he did not know her whereabouts until Ba Ruibao sent a letter to her mother from Shanghai in mid-October last year, which was read by her cousin, Ba Yinsheng, who informed the people and accompanied his friend He Hongchu to Shanghai to find her. It happened that Ba Ruibao and Zhou Zhaozhang returned to Ningbo to build graves and had not yet returned to Shanghai. More than a month later, they went to look for her again and finally met her. At that time, Ruibao refused to go home with him, so they struggled with each other to the British Concession police station. Ruibao then agreed to go home with the people, so the headman ordered the people to take her back. At that time, the people led Ruibao to Hongxiang Hotel in the British Concession for one night. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the defendant Tang Jinfu arrived and forcibly took his wife Ruibao away, claiming that Zhou Zhaozhang was willing to pay 200 yuan and asked to collect the money from the Xiayi Society. Later, the people did not dare to argue with them because they were unfamiliar with the place, and let them take Ruibao away. Later, they repeatedly went to look for her, but they were all hidden and could not be seen. Therefore, they had no choice but to file a lawsuit and request legal action. The witnesses Ba Yinnan and He Hongchu successively proved the process of finding Ba Ruibao, meeting, and negotiating. The court verified the confession and announced that the defendants would be summoned to the court for verification again on the 19th.

### Case to Confirm Invalid Divorce Agreement: Handwriting Needs to be Identified, Witnesses Need to be Summoned Again

The Zhu Yundi vs. Zhuang Tinggui case continued to be heard yesterday.

Zhuang Tinggui, a native of Wuxi, married Zhu Yundi, a woman from the same town, more than ten years ago. Recently, due to disagreements, they signed a divorce agreement in July of this year. At that time, Zhuang paid Zhu 3,000 yuan for living expenses, and Zhuang also married Luo Lili, a local woman. However, Zhu suddenly claimed that the divorce agreement was forged and sued Zhuang and Luo for bigamy in the First Special District Court. After the trial, the court ruled that whether the crime of bigamy was established depended on whether the divorce agreement was valid. Therefore, it was ordered that the civil court should resolve the issue first. Thus, Zhu filed a case with the civil court to confirm that the divorce agreement was invalid. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji opened the Civil Court No. 2 to summon the defendants. Zhuang Tinggui and his lawyer Chen Tingrui appeared in court to respond. First, Zhu's lawyer stated the meaning of the prosecution, and then the lawyer immediately said that the signature of Zhu on the divorce agreement was a cross. It is most difficult to identify a cross. Even the crosses signed by the intellectual class are not consistent. The cross signed today will not be recognized tomorrow. Therefore, the Civil Code stipulates that for those who sign a cross, there must be at least two witnesses, which is the intention of the law. Therefore, the results of the criminal court's submission for identification, saying that the cross on the agreement was not written by Zhu alone, are unreliable. Moreover, Zhu Rongchu (also known as A'da), the brother of the plaintiff, is also a witness on the agreement. However, due to the circumstances of the criminal court's trial, he was unwilling to appear in court to testify. Please summon him to testify. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Zhu Rongchu did not exist. Lawyer Chen said that this point can be investigated, why bother to argue? Judge Xu said that this case still needs to summon witnesses, and then announced that the hearing would be postponed.

### Fraudulent Money Collection Agency Cracked in Rice Store Upstairs on North Jiangxi Road

Victims in Other Ports Send Letters to Shanghai to Report; Han Jiayuan and Others Arrested and Detained for Interrogation

Han Jiayuan from Shaoxing, Dong Wenxiang and Zhou Jincheng from Danyang, Wang Yunxiu from Tianjin, and Mu Ruigen from Zhenjiang recently set up a fake Meiyi Slick Company in the upstairs of a rice store at No. 275 North Jiangxi Road, printing and distributing advertisements to purchase items on behalf of residents and businesses in various ports at home and abroad, charging fees for transportation and making profits from it. There are countless people who are fooled by these guys. Recently, Jin Fuyuan Store in Hunyuan County, Shanxi, remitted 15.20 yuan to the company to purchase a phonograph, a woolen vest, and other items. The payment was sent on November 16 last year, and there has been no news since then. Knowing that the road is long and it is inconvenient to come to Shanghai to investigate, they realized that the company was a fraudulent money collection agency, and they filed a report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. A detective was dispatched to the Hongkou Police Station the day before yesterday, together with Chinese detective Huang Fussen, to secretly go to the address and arrest Han Jiayuan and others, along with an account book, a phonograph, more than a dozen woolen shirts, and other items, and bring them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau, said that the place set up by the defendants was very simple, with only a few tables and old benches. The capital was 50 yuan for Mu Ruigen and 40 yuan each for Han Dong Zhou Wang. It was actually a fraudulent agency. Please postpone the trial so that the deceived customers can come to court to testify one after another. When questioned, the defendants' confessions were ambiguous. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled for verification.

### Family Lawsuits Persist After Fei Kemin's Death

Most of the Lawsuits are for Assault and Defamation; Fei Yusheng Sues Fei Zhiwen Again, Resulting in Conviction and Sentencing

Fei Kepeng, a real estate tycoon, owned a lot of assets and had a residence built at No. 70, Lane 741, East Youheng Road. After Fei died of illness in September two years ago, his children began to quarrel over property. Fei's assets were managed by the eldest son, Susheng. Therefore, the second son, Junwen, robbed the spirit tablet and prevented the funeral at Fei Kemin's funeral. Since then, lawsuits between siblings have arisen one after another, and cases of assault and defamation have followed. Recently, Fei Yusheng sued Fei Zhiwen and Fei Yuwen, cousins of the same ancestor, to the Huishan Police Station, alleging that they jointly assaulted him at No. 70, Lane 741, East Youheng Road, at 12:10 AM on the 17th of last month, causing injuries to his head. Yusheng stated that the reason for the assault was that Fei Zhiwen had 1,000 yuan in his possession, which he was now asking for. He said that the housework had not been cleared yet, and if he needed to withdraw the money, he had to obtain the consent of the other siblings. Fei Zhiwen refused and used violence. Chinese detective Huang Fugen sent Fei Yusheng to Tongren Hospital, where it was confirmed that there was slight swelling on his forehead and a medical certificate was issued. He then requested the First Special Court to summon Fei Zhiwen and Fei Yuwen to the Criminal Court No. 2 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. At that time, Judge Zhan Liangce presided over the interrogation. Police station lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case and prosecuted according to Article 277 of the Criminal Law on Assault. He also said that the defendant Fei Zhiwen had also told the police station that Fei Yusheng had assaulted him, and after being sent to the hospital for examination, there were also abrasions on his left finger. He then presented the medical certificate to the court. Fei Yusheng then stated that Fei Zhiwen punched him once, and Fei Yuwen grabbed his clothes, causing them to be torn. When questioned, Fei Zhiwen denied assaulting the plaintiff, saying that the plaintiff Fei Yusheng had beaten him and bitten his finger. Fei Yuwen denied tearing the plaintiff's clothes. Fei Susheng's younger brother, Fei Junwen, also submitted a statement to the First Special Court, stating that he was willing to assist the defendant in accordance with Article 35 of the Criminal Procedure Law. He was present in court to state his opinion. After Judge Zhan reviewed the statement, he said that the article required that they be within the third degree of kinship to be eligible. Fei Junwen and the two defendants were in the fourth degree of kinship, which was not in accordance with the law, so his request was not approved. The court then sentenced Fei Zhiwen to a fine of 5 yuan and Fei Yuwen was acquitted. Fei Zhiwen immediately stated that he was not satisfied and would appeal.

### Ma Caibin's Lawsuit for Wife

Ma Yulan Denies Everything; Official Orders Wang A'xiao to be Summoned

Ma Yulan, a 19-year-old woman from Haimen, whose father had passed away, was recruited as a son-in-law by her mother, Ma Ji, in 1935 with the help of matchmakers Xu Ashen and Zhao Zhizhong. Ma Caibao, also 19 years old, was immediately married in front of the spirit. Unexpectedly, in November of last year, Ma Yulan was abducted by a person named Zhu Zhishan and sold to a brothel. After the First Special District Court punished Zhu Zhishan, Zhang Kunlin, also known as Wang A'xiao, came to the court and said that Ma Yulan was his wife. After the news was published in the newspaper, Ma Caibao learned about it and sued Wang A'xiao in the local court for obstructing the family. Yesterday, Judge Lu opened the trial. Ma Caibao testified that he was 19 years old, a native of Haimen, and made a living by planting gardens. He currently lives at No. 22, Dasha New Village, Zhongshan Road. He married into the Ma family in April of last year. At that time, he covered his father-in-law's coffin with red paper and kowtowed to Ma Yulan in front of the spirit. In March 1936, he was recommended by someone to go out to do business. Then his wife and Wang A'xiao became acquainted, but he did not know about it. Later, he saw in the newspaper that his wife was sold into prostitution by Zhu Zhishan, and Wang A'xiao claimed to be her husband. It is clearly his wife, how can he call her his wife? Therefore, he asked the court to handle it. At this point, the mother-in-law, Ma Ji, testified that her husband died in April 1935. Ma Caibao did not formally marry her daughter. Her daughter was robbed by Zhu Zhishan and sold to a brothel. The fake prostitute Wang A'xiao, also known as Zhang Kunlin, divorced her daughter because Ma Caibin did not want her. Zhang Kunlin paid 100 yuan for the divorce, of which 55 yuan had been paid, and 45 yuan was still owed. There was a written agreement to prove it. Ma Yulan testified that she did not marry Ma Caibao and had an affair with Wang A'xiao in March. She had divorced Ma Caibin because she owed him money, so Wang A'xiao was trying to find a way. He should not have come to sue them. The judge then ordered Wang A'xiao to appear in court immediately, otherwise he would be wanted. If both parties can reconcile, then he can withdraw the lawsuit.

### Chen Feng's Lawsuit Against Daughter-in-law - Injury Charge Not Established

Convicted of Destroying Another's Property - Chen Li fined 20 yuan

Chen Yunzhong, former Chinese detective of the Public Concession Police, has been living with his wife, Feng, at No. 3, Lane 201, Shanhai Pass Road, since resigning from his position. They have two sons, Bingxing and Maoyi, who have grown up, married, and have children. Both Chen Bingxing and his brother Maoyi graduated from law schools, so they joined the local Bar Association and practiced law. Except for Chen Maoyi, who lives elsewhere, Chen Bingxing, his wife, and children live with his parents. On the afternoon of the 16th of last month, Bingxing's 16-year-old son, Songyuan, returned home from school a little late, and his mother, Li (Bingxing's wife), scolded him. At that time, Bingxing's mother, Ms. Feng, intervened to protect her grandson, leading to a conflict. Li slapped her mother-in-law twice and tore her qipao. Ms. Chen Feng felt that her daughter-in-law, Li, dared to strike an elder, which was lawless, and reported it to the Xin Zha police station. The police station filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court for the crime of injuring a senior relative. The Special Court issued a summons, but Chen Li refused to appear, so she was arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang continued the trial in the Fifth Criminal Court. Chen Feng and witnesses testified that she was slapped and her clothes were torn by her daughter-in-law. In addition to legal punishment, she requested compensation of 20 yuan for the clothing damage. The defendant, Chen Li, denied the assault and hired a lawyer to argue that there was no act of insulting a senior relative. The reason for the prosecution was that the defendant's husband, lawyer Chen Bingxing, disliked the defendant's appearance and kept a mistress near their residence. Therefore, this prosecution was intended to subject the defendant to criminal punishment, laying the groundwork for a future divorce. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated that the plaintiff had not suffered any injury. Therefore, the charge of injury was difficult to establish and should be judged according to the crimes of destroying property and public insult. Chen Feng stated that she would also prosecute for the damage. However, after persuasion, the court expressed its willingness to withdraw the incidental civil suit for compensation for clothing. Judge Pan reviewed the statements and sentenced Chen Li to a fine of 20 yuan for destroying another's property. If she could not pay, two yuan would be counted as one day of detention.

### Kang Yuan Factory Lawsuit Concluded Yesterday

Verdict on the 11th

The Industrial News Agency reports that Gu Qiushui from Jiaxing operated a porcelain flower factory in Shanghai before the January 28th Incident. Due to poor business, he was unable to maintain it. He entrusted someone to contact the Kang Yuan Canning Factory to transfer all machinery and property to Kang Yuan Factory. At that time, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, the owner of Kang Yuan Factory, believed that the porcelain industry was a famous Chinese industry and that porcelain kiln paper was a tool to improve the art of porcelain. Since Mr. Gu was skilled in this field, he should be maintained. Therefore, a porcelain flower department was added to the factory, and Mr. Gu was hired as the head of the department. A preferential contract was signed, and all affairs were entrusted to Mr. Gu. Unexpectedly, after the products were launched, due to poor quality, sales were difficult. After three years, various consignment stores returned the inventory, causing Kang Yuan Factory to lose tens of thousands of gold. When the contract expired, Mr. Gu had breached the contract and set up a new factory. He then left Kang Yuan Factory. However, the new factory founded by Mr. Gu also closed shortly after due to poor product quality. In frustration, he reviewed Kang Yuan Factory's business report for 1934, believing that the porcelain flower department he had presided over in the past still had a surplus, and he could share the dividends according to the contract. He filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against the factory, demanding payment of profits. In fact, the numbers listed in the report were typographical errors and did not match the original table made by accountant Xu Yongzuo. The factory had discarded the publication and reprinted it. Mr. Gu did not carefully review the table before filing the lawsuit and requested the defendant to submit the accounts for review. The factory filed a statement of defense and submitted the account books. After the court summoned them previously, the plaintiff was speechless due to the facts. At 3:00 PM on July 7th, the case was continued to be heard. Xu Fuji was still the judge in charge. Both the plaintiff and defendant, accompanied by lawyers, were present to await the hearing. After the judge took the seat, he asked Gu Qiushui if he had seen the account books. According to the testimony, the accounts had been reviewed. However, there was a total inventory of more than 15,000 yuan at the end of 1935. This inventory should be regarded as a surplus, and the contract should be followed. He could get 5% of the bonus, so according to the semi-finished products of more than 7,000 yuan at the end of June 1935, he should be paid 2,052 yuan and 84 cents. Hearing the testimony, the judge reprimanded him, saying that the company's account books had been handed over to you for review, so you could understand them. But now you say that the accounts are inconsistent, then you must entrust an accountant to verify them. However, if you want to verify, you must first pay the accounting fee before you can do so. Now that you have not paid the fee for verification, and you are making accusations, are you intentionally picking faults? As for the inventory, the goods have not yet been sold. How can you force the profit and demand a bonus? The plaintiff was reprimanded and lowered his head without a word. Then, according to the defendant's statement, the account books of the porcelain flower department had been checked by accountant Xu Yongzuo, and the account books were submitted on November 8, 1936. The two parties checked them clearly. Now the surplus pointed out by the plaintiff is actually the company's inventory. The inventory is the company's asset and cannot be regarded as profit. The court should reject it. After the lawyers of both parties debated and concluded the court debate, the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month. After the announcement, the court adjourned.

### Xiang Sheng Taxi Robbed Yesterday

Robbers Wear Rickshaw Puller Uniforms - Car Not Yet Found

At 5:40 PM yesterday, three well-dressed customers suddenly came to the French Concession Min Ti Ni Yin Road branch of the Xiang Sheng Taxi Company, claiming to rent a car to Cao He Jing. The company's cashier immediately signed the car certificate and ordered driver No. 7878 to drive a taxi with French Concession permit No. 18405 and Municipal permit No. 4805. The three boarded the car, and the car drove straight west. When the car arrived near Tian Yao Bridge Road on Zhongshan Road, the three ordered the car to stop. One of them pulled out a pistol and ordered the driver to get out of the car. He was driven to a secluded mound by the roadside and forced to take off his uniform and hat. The driver's limbs were tied with rope. Then, one of them put on the uniform and drove the car away at lightning speed. Later, a passerby discovered it, untied him, and urgently reported it to the police station in charge. He also notified the British and French police to pay attention to intercepting it.

He requested an extension for detailed investigation. Then, Mr. Bao, a representative of the bank, said that the amount embezzled by the defendant was more than 7,000 yuan. It was likely more than that and was being checked. Questioning Wang Peide, his confession was ambiguous. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered him to be returned to prison and rescheduled for verification.

### Zidi Gentry and Merchants Request Dredging of Panlong River

The gentry of Zidi Town (also known as Zhuzhai) in the western suburbs of the city, Hou Shuda and Huang Chengbo, and more than 100 businesses in the town, including Wang Dachang and Huang Rumao, stated that the Panlong River in the city has not been dredged for a hundred years since the end of the Qing Dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China. It is extremely silted up, and the narrow and shallow places are like ditches, which greatly affect commerce, transportation, sanitation, and fire prevention. In 1935, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works approved the proposal to start construction. However, the government only allowed 70% of the funding for water diversion and dam construction, and the remaining 30% was to be borne by the local area. Zidi was unable to raise the funds, and it has become a suspended case to this day. Mr. Hou, Mr. Huang, and the town's businesses believe that the "Labor Service" campaign in Shanghai can open the river without requiring huge amounts of money. They believe it is a good opportunity, so they emphasized the important position of the Panlong River in the waterway transportation between the west of Shanghai and this city, the impact of siltation on commerce, transportation, sanitation, and fire prevention, and sent a letter to the Local Association, requesting the municipal authorities to dredge it. They also urgently submitted a request to the Municipal Government Bureau of Public Works to amend the Labor Service Committee's proposal, allowing the laborers under the jurisdiction of the 30th Bao, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Tus of the Pu Song District, that is, the old Zidi (Zhuzhai) Township, to dredge the Panlong River nearby. The rest of the Pu Song District will continue the original proposal to dredge the Shuangyang Port and the Shahe Southern Section in separate stages, so as to achieve both goals and facilitate transportation.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor,

Regarding the news item "Yihua Steamer Line Back Cabin Workers Oppose Affairs Group Office" published in your newspaper on the 6th, upon reading it, I found that it does not conform to the facts. The details of the incident are summarized as follows. Please publish it to correct the record. Thank you. To the Shen Bao, ㊀ The Seamen's Union Organization Law stipulates that Grade B seamen are divided into five departments: stokers, sailors, cargo handlers, middle cabin, and affairs. Mess boys belong to the affairs department and should be led by the affairs organization. Therefore, the affairs personnel of Yihua Steamer Line can legally organize the Yihua Affairs Mutual Aid Association. There is absolutely no reason for the so-called back cabin Tongyishe to oppose and ask the union to prevent its establishment. ㊁ After inviting Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Mr. Li Zuqu as Vice Presidents, the Yihua Affairs Mutual Aid Association has applied to the Seamen's Party Department for approval. A small number of workers from Tongyishe asked the Party Department to refuse to issue a permit. The Party Department did not think it was right. ㊂ The affairs personnel of each steamer line treat the mess boys with sincerity. Most mess boys are willing to be led by the affairs personnel. The so-called affairs personnel oppressing the mess boys by deducting wages and firing workers is completely untrue. The petition must have been made by one or two unscrupulous people using the name of Tongyishe. Yihua Steamer Line Affairs Department Office, January 7th.

To the Editor,

Regarding the news published in your newspaper on January 7th, this city, regarding the new achievements of Director Zhang of the China Merchants Inland River Steamer Bureau, it does not conform to the facts. Upon investigation, this Bureau has not announced any suspension of navigation to the outside world, but has only made some internal reforms. Furthermore, there is no appointment of the title of Director. We are especially afraid of misrepresentation. We hope you will correct it to avoid inaccuracies. We hereby send a letter to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao, hoping you will investigate and handle it. Lao Mian, Manager of the China Merchants Inland River Steamer General Bureau, January 7th.

Perry's victory was entirely deserved, demonstrating superior skill, accuracy, and the ability to hold his ground. Initially, he was not accustomed to the felt court. In the first set, he slightly injured his ankle in a slip, but he soon got used to it, demonstrating brilliant and unstoppable tennis skills, completely controlling Vines.

It is worth noting that Vines went to the net more often than his opponent. After losing the first set, he took a 3-0 lead in the second set. Perry then equalized. Vines won three more games, and as a result Vines only won this set.

### China-Portugal Billiards Battle Heats Up: Ding Mingyi vs. Medina

6:30 PM at the Chinese Youth Billiards Room. Yesterday's results: Portugal won by 18 points.

The Shanghai Amateur Billiards League, between the Chinese YMCA and Portugal, has now become a stalemate. On the first day, Portugal won by 32 points in two matches. Yesterday, on the second day, China won by 14 points in two matches. Today, Ding Mingyi, the main player of the Chinese Youth, and Medina, the leader of Portugal, will personally compete. The game will begin at 6:30 PM at the Chinese YMCA billiards room on Sichuan Road. The final victory or defeat will be determined by this. Ding Mingyi's skills are already above the general standard. In today's Shanghai billiards scene, only Li Gongying and Zhang Yingda can compete with Medina. Ding Mingyi is comparable to them. Failure is undeniable, but it is hoped that he will have a good performance. The Chinese Youth is still behind by 18 points after two days, probably due to the heavy losses suffered by Fang Yide on the first day. Yesterday, Zhu Qiliang had a good chance of winning, but due to careless handling, he was defeated by Kang Shisi by 295 to 300. When Zhu was at his peak, he had a lead of 220 to 130. Therefore, he could have at least won back 30 to 40 points. The result of the failure was unexpected. The highest records were Kang Shisi 20, 40, 21, 26, and Zhu Qiliang 63, 31, 31, 29.

In the last match yesterday, Wu Chengqi and Su Shi both showed signs of unease on the court. Wu advanced boldly with 24 points in one shot, followed by 30 points in another shot, taking the lead. Afterwards, wonderful shots were exchanged between the two, sometimes high and sometimes low. Su Shi relied on 36 and 75 points in two shots to lead by 236 to 207. Before long, Wu was fortunate to have 23 points in one shot, turning the situation into a balanced one. Finally, Wu gained another 21 points in one shot, totaling 298 points, only 2 points away from the goal. Su Shi used a scorched earth tactic, preferring to sacrifice rather than act rashly. Wu's last shot succeeded in 2 points, while Su had already hit the enemy ball into the pocket and hit both the red and white balls into the serving area. Wu then spun in the air with two Ers, hitting Kai Teng amidst cheers from the whole room, reaching the goal and winning with 300 points to 281 points.

### Iron City Cup Basketball Tournament Ends Tomorrow Night

Except for the Men's A and B divisions, which still need to fight, the championships of all other groups have been decided.

The second Iron City Cup basketball tournament, organized by the City Sports Field and the City Sports Association, has been going on since last winter, and will come to an end tomorrow, the 9th. Only the Women's B and B2 and B3 divisions have been completed. The Women's B championship belongs to Chongde, B2 to Haijing, and B3 to Guangdong. In the other groups, Fudan and Jinan in Men's A have maintained their perfect records. The match on the 9th will determine who wins the championship. The B1 championship is undoubtedly for the City Sports A team. The match on the 9th with the Law School has nothing to do with winning or losing. In B4, Xinmin and Chizhong still need a final decisive battle. Xinmin once defeated Chizhong by 41 to 16, so there is no problem in winning the championship.

The results of the completed groups are recorded below.

### West Youth Basketball Last Night

Jinan defeats Xin Team. Chizhi defeats Nanjin.

In West Youth Basketball, Chizhi played against Nanjin in the university group last night. Nanjin's players were taking exams, so only five players appeared on the court. Chizhi first responded with its most complete lineup, making it difficult for Nanjin to resist. Even Chen Lin, the young general who is best at shooting, lost his grip. Therefore, the result of the first half was that Chizhi 26, Nanjin 14, and the victory or defeat was already determined. After the restart, Chizhi rotated all ten generals to respond to the battle, and the score increased even more. Nanjin chased fiercely, showing great excitement. About eight minutes away from the end of the game, Wang Yinxi, the right guard of Nanjin, was sent off for four fouls, and there was no one to replace him. Therefore, he responded with four players, and the defense was breached. In the end, he lost by 66 to 34. Chizhi won by a large margin. The next match was Jinan against Xin Team. Xin Team's main players did not play, and only the reserve soldiers responded to the battle. At first, both sides were too excited, and the throws were all clumsy. After Yin Guiren opened the record with a free throw, Yao Siwen of Xin Team scored under the basket and got a free throw to surpass 3 to 1. After that, there were many fouls on both sides. Xin Team was even more depressed. Jinan Han Cai Kuang instantly added 5 points, and Jia Youliang scored repeatedly, 6 to 5, once close. But after that, Yin Guiren was bound to hit every throw, and Han Zhenyuan, Wang Nanzhen, and Cai Yanxiong also made multiple embellishments. In an instant, the score was an absolute difference of 21 to 5. At this time, Xin Team had adjusted Lu Zhongen and Ling Xianyang, and gradually saw its spirit. Yin Guiren, on the other hand, missed every throw. Xin Team once made it 25 to 15, only 10 points behind. Before long, Jinan added 3 points, ending the first half with 28 to 15. After the restart, the three of Jinan, Han Cai Yin, withdrew and were replaced by Yuan Zheng Yan. After Xu Jusheng of Xin Team succeeded, both sides did not score for a long time, and turned into a dull situation. Soon Xu Jusheng was sent off for four fouls, and Jia Youliang came on again, and there were scores for each other, until 34 to 25, Xin Team was only 10 points behind. At this time, the Han Yin Cai of Jinan regained the field, but it was not sharp. Both sides had not opened the record for a long time, and Yao of Xin Team, after re-entering the field, was sent off. Jinan was thriving again. The game ended when Jia Youliang scored a long shot. As a result, Jinan won by a large margin of 40 to 27. There are three games today, two in the independent group, and one in the ordinary group. Except for the Yellow Bee vs. McLing A, which is still worth watching, the Xintong vs. McLing B is bound to be a one-sided game.

### First Anniversary Memorial Ceremony for Ding Wenjiang's Death

Li Shuhua, Hu Shi, and others delivered speeches.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping] The 5th was the first anniversary of the death of Ding Wenjiang, the former director of the Geological Survey of the Academia Sinica. Three agencies and organizations in Beiping, the Geological Society of China, the Department of Geology of Peking University, and the Beiping Branch of the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Industry, launched a memorial ceremony at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th in the library of the Geological Survey on Bingmasi Street. More than 60 people attended the memorial ceremony, which adjourned at 5:30 PM. The details are recorded as follows:

Memorial Ceremony

At the appointed time on the afternoon of the 5th, about 60 people, including Ding's lifelong friends Li Shuhua, Hu Shi, Zhou Binglin, Chen 𪣵, Grip, Yuan Fuli, Yang Zhongjian, Feng Jinglan, Zhang Hongzhao, Wei Dengrui, Xie Jiarong, and Jiang's disciples, arrived. Yang Zhongjian, director of the Beiping Branch of the Geological Survey, presided over the ceremony. Hu Shi, Zhang Hongzhao, Grip, and others delivered speeches. The ceremony was simple and solemn. After the ceremony, Hu Shi played Ding's pre-death lecture films that he brought. The attendees were able to see and hear the images, which gave them the feeling that he had been resurrected. At 5:30 PM, everyone visited the exhibition of Ding's relics at the venue before dispersing.

Yang's Report

The presiding officer Yang Zhongjian reported, stating briefly that today is the first anniversary of Mr. Ding Wenjiang's death. In Beiping, the Geological Society of China, the Department of Geology of Peking University, and the Geological Survey launched this memorial meeting to commemorate Mr. Ding's greatness. Regarding the commemoration of Mr. Ding, special issues have been published in the Geological Review and Independent Review. Now the English Geological Bulletin is also being printed in a special issue, which will be published soon. In Nanjing, more than 42,000 yuan of memorial funds have been raised. However, in addition to this commemoration, the greatest and most beloved thing for Mr. Ding is that the three groups preparing this meeting are following Mr. Ding's legacy, burying themselves in research. Although today's ceremony is simple, its significance is very great. Therefore, in addition to holding the ceremony, we have also invited several gentlemen who had the deepest relationship with Mr. Ding during his lifetime to speak, and so on.

Hu Shi and others speak

After the report, Hu Shi delivered a speech, stating briefly that today's commemoration of Mr. Ding makes all of us who had a relationship with him during his lifetime feel a few indescribable pangs of sorrow. Before his death, he not only handled all the procedures and official affairs very well, but also arranged his family affairs very properly. But there is only one thing that makes him unable to rest in peace after his death, that is, his unfinished work. Secondly, what we should pay attention to is that during his lifetime, he was not only a geologist, but also had great research on politics and economics. During his lifetime, he once said to people that if we want to live a political life in the future, we should have several preparations. The first is to preserve our qualifications as "good people." The second is to be a person with a profession. The third is to find a way to not increase our living standards. The fourth is to unite our friends, small groups of four or five people, eight or nine people, and try to make a tool of political life. From this, we know that Mr. Ding's career and spirit during his lifetime have his great value. Then, Zhang Hongzhao, the former director of the Beiping Branch of the Geological Survey, and Grip, a professor in the Department of Geology of Peking University, delivered speeches.

Exhibition of Works

On the 5th, in order to commemorate Mr. Ding Wenjiang's great achievements during his lifetime, more than ten kinds of Mr. Ding's works, posthumous writings, letters, wills, original manuscripts, travel photos, and maps of domestic work areas were specially displayed in front of the venue for the attendees to visit and commemorate.

### Yi Junzuo and More Than Twenty Others Initiate the Jiangsu Literary and Artistic Writers' Advancement Association

And Issue a Declaration of the Chinese National Literary and Artistic Movement

Yi Junzuo and more than twenty others initiated the "Jiangsu Literary and Artistic Writers' Advancement Association" and issued a declaration of the Chinese National Literary and Artistic Movement, stating: Fellow countrymen, literary and artistic writers across the country, and all who love literature and art,

We must recognize the current era, the current China. The current era is one of rampant international imperialism. They never relax their aggressive ambitions, and they are scheming to oppress and trample on us. The current China has reached the final critical moment of life and death. Within our own country, there are still traitors who sell the soul of the motherland, and "red bandits" who kill without batting an eye. These two kinds of national scum are constantly trying to sabotage our country and subvert our nation. China, in such an extraordinary period, cannot rely on any external forces except self-reliance. Our greatest task is to promote the great spirit inherent in our nation. To put it precisely, it is how to resist insults and how to seek survival. To resist insults and seek survival is how to eliminate traitors and how to eliminate remnant bandits, so as to embark on the road of self-reliance and revitalize our nation.

Literature and art should be based on ideology, and it is necessary to grasp the tasks of the current era and not forget the significance of one's own nation. Therefore, the establishment of "national literature and art" has become an inevitable trend in literature at this stage.

We are pained by the fact that so-called "proletarian writers" are using the beautiful names of "people's front" and "national defense literature" to poison the minds of all pure and innocent young people. We also oppose the shameless behavior of the Communist Party and all reactionaries who use these two beautiful names of "people's front" and "national defense literature."

The greatest meaning of "national literature and art" is how to establish our great "national front," how to determine our "national" consciousness in literature, and how to expand our anti-imperialist, anti-communist, and feudal forces. Anything that stimulates the national spirit of creation, encourages the expression of scientific spirit, cultivates production and construction, elucidates the inherent virtues of the nation, and guides the masses on the right path is the proper posture of "national literature and art."

The "national literature and art" we need is the "literature and art" that suits the current era and the Chinese national character. Conversely, the literature and art that we do not need and should reject includes the following six points: (1) We should eliminate proletarian literature and art that endangers the nation. (2) We should eliminate decadent literature and art of sentimentalism. (3) We should correct romantic literature and art of individualism. (4) We should clear up feudal literature and art with corrupt ideas. (5) We should cleanse slave literature and art of flattery and adulation. (6) We should oppose humorous literature and art of the privileged class.

We pledge to devote our lives to the construction movement of Chinese national literature and art. Now that we have a great and sacred literary and artistic goal, we are willing to unite literary and artistic writers across the country to advance towards this goal. In order to actively build Chinese national literature and art, we intend to have four preliminary plans:

1. Theoretical construction: to establish the theory of "national literature and art" so that they are complete, substantial, and powerful.

2. Encouragement of creation: to encourage the creation of "national literature and art" so that it grasps the core of the nation in the current era and can express it profoundly.

3. Emphasis on introduction: to introduce and promote the "national literature and art" of various countries in the world for our own reference and comparison, as a mirror for national revival.

4. Promotion of historical achievements: to collect, sort out, and promote the historical materials and precious literary and artistic materials inherent in our country regarding "national literature and art" in order to strengthen national self-confidence.

In order to consolidate the "national literature and art" bulwark, rectify the "national literature and art" lineup, and unify the "national literature and art" front, we are now launching the "Jiangsu Literary and Artistic Writers' Advancement Association" in Zhenjiang, the provincial capital of Jiangsu. We look forward to the encouragement and guidance of our compatriots across the country, and we sincerely hope that literary and artistic writers across the country will unite and promote this great Chinese literary and artistic construction movement. This is our declaration. Yi Junzuo, Wang Ci, Zhang Xinyu, Xing Songwen, Shi Qian, Wan Xiaofeng, Xu Ruoping, Ruan Yisun, Huang Xueyi, Wu Dingdi, Wu Bofang, Li Yixian, Ying Zheyuan, Zhou Dilian, Hu Yunyi, Chuan Xiaodong, Wang Wumin, Zuo Ganchen, Ge Xianning, Huang Liren, Huang Qiang, Zhou Huapeng.

### Yarn and Cotton

Third-Grade Yarn Soars, Impact on Standard Yarn Still Minor, Factories Opening Many, Stockpiles Gradually Thickening

The yarn market has turned upward, mainly because the bulk third-grade yarn market soared by nine to twelve yuan, which shocked the market. Buying enthusiasm has risen slightly, but generally, industry peers see that the factories' stocks of yarn are becoming more relaxed day by day and expect to accumulate stock. The courage to hoard in bulk is gradually waning, so the upward momentum is limited. In fact, there is enough capital in coarse yarn, so it cannot soar with the third-grade yarn. In the afternoon, it was also reported that the British factory opened 7,000 to 8,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd. This news was reported in this newspaper earlier, and it is said that the price is very low. The detailed situation is kept strictly secret.

Near-Term Yarn Also Rises by Two Yuan Seven or Eight Jiao

The opening of the standard yarn market saw a slight increase in each month, but most people in the market expected it to fall back because the end of the year is approaching, and accounts are settled to some extent according to commercial practice. The sharp rise in bulk Osaka third-grade yarn pushed the current month above the 270 yuan mark, and people's hearts were stirred up. The market price rebounded slightly, but gradually trended higher. At the opening, only 500 to 600 bales of yarn were traded, and then the market became tired. As a result, each month rose by 2.6 jiao to 1.1 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, the Osaka third-grade yarn took a leap forward, and the near-term two months all broke through the 270 yuan mark. The shorts were shaken and covered their positions. However, it was rumored that the factories had opened a lot of cotton yarn, so the rise was moderate. However, the Japanese merchants had a large short position, and 1,300 bales of yarn were traded. At the close, the price went up another step. As a result, each month rose by 1.5 to 7.9 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 1,200 bales of Yongda were sold, 750 bales of Dafu, 1,950 bales of Mianchang, 800 bales of Yuanda, 1,350 bales of Zhenda, 1,000 bales of Yida, 2,150 bales of Taichang, 1,350 bales of Tonghe, 1,150 bales of Yihe, 700 bales of Changfeng, 950 bales of Xiecheng, 600 bales of Xincheng, and 650 bales of Jinkang. 1,150 bales of Dafeng were bought, 2,200 bales of Hengyi, 1,150 bales of Taixing, 6,550 bales of Gengfeng, 3,150 bales of Wangtaixing, 650 bales of Shenji, and 600 bales of Fengtai. The market prices for the day are compared below.

Spot Yarn Also Rises by One or Two Yuan

Spot yarn sales are still quite good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,314 bales throughout the day, and the selling price rose by 1.2 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:

Cotton Futures Also See a Small Upturn

The cotton market was originally dull and lackluster. In addition, the overseas US and Indian cotton markets were weak, and the local goods in this port had not decreased. Those who sold short at the time of the rise were even more numerous. In the afternoon, the market was also in a good state due to the yarn market.

The Market Will Be Aided by the Standard Cotton

The opening of the standard cotton market in the morning was still weak because US cotton rose slightly, and Indian cotton fell sharply, and people's hearts were not振. After a round of rumors that the yarn market had rebounded, Osaka third-grade cotton also rose by 3.4 jiao, and the market became revitalized. By the third closing, it entered a fatigue state again. As a result, each month fell by one or two jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, the market situation was still flat. Although the third-grade yarn market jumped sharply, the upward momentum of the cotton market was moderate, and people's hearts were still平. Until the third-grade cotton kerchief also rose, the market was affected. As a result, each month rose by 2.5 to 3.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 3,900 piculs of Shengyuan were sold, 3,300 piculs of Jinchang, 2,400 piculs of Jifeng, 4,700 piculs of Hengyi, 3,100 piculs of Fengtai, 2,100 piculs of Runkang, 2,100 piculs of Changhe, 2,200 piculs of Daqing, 3,100 piculs of Gengfeng, 3,600 piculs of Taichang, and 2,400 piculs of Xinchang. 1,800 piculs of Tongji were bought, 3,900 piculs of Yudai, 2,700 piculs of Senkang, 1,700 piculs of Yuanyi, 3,200 piculs of Dachangcheng, 2,700 piculs of Dachang, 1,900 piculs of Yongda, 6,000 piculs of Taixing, and 2,100 piculs of Changfeng. The market prices for the day are compared below.

More Than 3,000 Bales of Yaotong Cotton

The consumption of spot cotton is mediocre, and the factory owner has not seen any great joy. The source is 1,600 bales of Yao cotton and 1,680 bales of Tong cotton.

Third-Grade Yarn Soars by More Than Ten Yuan

On the 7th, the big isolated telegram said that the third-grade futures yarn rose by 7.8 jiao to 12.3 yuan, with the near month at 277.8 yuan and the far month at 257.9 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 7 jiao to 1.05 yuan, with the near month at 71.65 yuan and the far month at 73.6 yuan.

US Cotton Rebounds, British and Indian Cotton Continue to Fall

Yesterday, US cotton opened, the Liverpool news was not good, the bulls closed, the labor unrest was uncertain, the European political situation was unstable, and each month fell by 5 pounds or rose by 2 pounds. Later, there was hope for a solution to the labor unrest, and the industry bought, and the market rebounded strongly. The spot goods were quiet and expensive, and the cloth market was more active than before. Before the close, cotton farmers cashed in, and part of it fell slightly. At the close, the industry bought the near month, and the market price rose again, with the spot goods rising by 5 pounds and the futures rising from motionless to 5 pounds. British cotton spot goods fell by 6 points, and futures fell by 23 points. Indian cotton fell at first due to hedging and sales by holders, and then rebounded due to purchases by speculators. Finally, due to the bad news from Liverpool, the market price softened again. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 2.75 to 3.25 rupees, Aomuchen fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 6th).

According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 7th was 227 rupees for Bailuoxi and 204.5 rupees for Mula, and 174 rupees for Pingguoer, all up by 1 rupee.

### Piece Goods

Cotton Market Recovers Slightly in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the cloth market was tired in the morning and strong in the afternoon. Although the wholesale Zhuang in Zhe Road and this street had very good spot sales for several days, the appetite of the major customers in the north and south was weak. The white goods are fine and fine twill. The output of this port and the goods coming from Qingdao are becoming more and more prosperous every day. The market suddenly suffers from a lot of goods, so the market price fell again and again. However, because futures are strong and expensive, manufacturers have a stable mindset, and spot sales are still not bad, so the decline is not fierce. According to interviews, each piece of fine cloth and fine twill of each brand fell by 1.2 jiao in the past two days. The market continued to fall in the morning yesterday. Later, the third-grade yarn market soared by more than ten yuan, and the standard yarn continued to rise, stirring up people's spirits. The Japanese Dongmian 洋行 reappeared and bought fine cloths such as Hualiao brand, causing the cloth price to rebound by 2.5 cents to 5 cents per piece. Coarse cloth, coarse twill and printed goods are all sold at the original price. Spot sales are uniformly sluggish. However, the Shandong gang slightly entered the local factory's line,呢, 嗶嘰, and the Hankou gang handled printed Zhigong, 嗶嘰. The Ning-Shao gang and the wholesale Zhuang on this street entered light-weight coarse cloth, and Donghuo fine cloth was used to fill the blue cloth dyeing blanks. Among the fine cloths in the local factory, the Fenghe brand produced by Jiafeng Factory is the best, and it can be used as a blue cloth dyeing blank for the upper body. It is reported that 60余包 of this month's goods were opened yesterday, and the price is comparable to the leading fine cloth of Donghuo.

### Securities

Only 55,000 Yuan Were Traded, Unified Bonds Rose by 1 to 6 Jiao

Yesterday, the Reconstruction Public Bonds were actually auctioned on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. However, because not many chips were listed, although the buying enthusiasm was strong, there was only one transaction per round, and the market price was quite tight. It is estimated that the one-month period is 72 yuan, and the two-month period is 73 yuan due to the interest-bearing and mid-signature relationship. The unified bond market was also stable due to the stability of the situation. The major households were very enthusiastic about buying, and the trend was very strong.

Category E and Category Dingjia have recently risen by 5.1 jiao, but because 11.45 and others have a lot of caged and sold Category B and C, they have recovered by 1.2 jiao. At the opening in the afternoon, the market situation turned strong. 10.5.43 and other companies jointly purchased very vigorously, and 戊乙 rose by 5 minutes to 3.5 jiao.

### Grain

Tianjin Merchants Resume Purchases, Flour Price Decline Stabilizes

Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, the market for all months continued to show sluggish and weak signs. Foreign wheat prices reported declines of approximately 0.30 cents for near-term contracts in Chicago and 0.48 cents for distant contracts. Canadian prices fluctuated by about 0.08 cents. Liverpool saw a slight increase of 0.01 pence in near-term contracts. At the opening, market sentiment remained poor, and many long positions were liquidated. The opening price for the current month was only $4.09, a decrease of 0.0425 from the previous day. February and subsequent months fell by 0.01 to 0.02 cents. During the second trading session, near-term contracts saw a slight rally, but long positions for distant contracts continued to be sold off, causing opening prices to weaken again, with distant contracts falling 0.02 to 0.03 cents from the initial opening. The afternoon opening began calmly, but outside long positions re-entered the market. It was rumored that Tianjin merchants were involved, leading to a gradual rise in prices from the second session onwards, with March and April contracts rising by 0.03 to 0.04 cents, while January and February contracts remained down 0.01 to 0.02 cents.

Wheat Futures Fluctuate Slightly

Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening bell in the morning, all months showed signs of weakness. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago fell by only 0.30 cents, with little other movement. Therefore, although trading was active after the opening, market sentiment tended to hover. For example, while opening prices for February, March, and April rose by 0.05 to 0.06 cents, they soon retraced, falling slightly more than 0.03 to 0.05 cents from the previous day. At the afternoon opening, sentiment for the current month stabilized due to the suspension of spot trading by factories, with the lowest price reaching 0.57 cents. Trading in February and subsequent months became sparse, with little movement. New wheat for June initially fell to 0.59 cents, but rebounded by 0.03 to 0.04 cents due to outside buying. Currently, near-term wheat is expected to be under pressure if flour sales remain sluggish. Although the market value of new wheat for June is lower than that of old wheat, it is closely related to the annual harvest, making it difficult to predict gains or losses. Spot wheat saw no inquiries from various factories, with only a rumor of 1,000+ bags of Jiangbei wheat being offered at $6.51, but this was not a formal transaction.

Foreign Firm Sesame Sales Remain Active, Soybean Cake Prices Fluctuate

Yesterday, foreign firms continued to sell 900 tons of sesame through the Central Trust Bureau at a price of $14.95 per original plate. It was rumored that British merchants commissioned the purchase, stabilizing spot raw sesame prices at around $11.00. Yesterday, the market saw transactions of over 400 loads of various sesames from Fuzhou Ben Shu, etc. Soybean cake market prices showed mixed results due to a few factories holding relatively large inventories, followed by price drops to stimulate demand. A total of over 50,000 cakes of various factory brands were traded across the market, with sales in Shantou, Xiamen, and the inland regions. The overall market trend remains stable.

### Sugar Market

Domestic Brown Sugar Price Increase Continues

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to see active trading due to constant price increases reported from Shantou for Chaozhou brown sugar. Chaozhou dealers offered over 1,000 loads of table sugar, priced at $14.00 for Huanggang brown sugar, $13.90 for Huanggang brown sugar, $13.67 for Huilai brown sugar, and $13.45 for Longjiang brown sugar, all increasing by 0.10 to 0.20 cents, indicating a tight market. Our own cotton white sugar retreated slightly by 0.10 cents, with Jinxin Dahua at $20.08, and grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 retreating by 0.20 cents per grade. The foreign sugar market was normal. The Public Concession market saw grade 24 sugar at $22.10, with transshipment at $6.80. Grade 4 Dongbai sugar was at $20.10, with transshipment at $7.05, down by 0.05 cents.

Domestic street demand is currently weak, but market prices remain stable. Assorted grades (92 skin) are selling for $26.00 to $25.50, with no expected easing due to limited supply.

### Silk and Tea

Silk Sales Temporarily Lack Momentum

Yesterday, silk prices on the New York Stock Exchange saw a sharp decline of 3.5 cents for all current contracts, while Japanese and Chinese silk products remained at previous prices. Opening prices in Yokohama fell slightly by $5.00 to $10.00. Lyon remained stagnant. Foreign firms in this port remain inactive. Overseas silk prices are fluctuating, silk merchants are maintaining high prices, and foreign firms are sending few re-export orders. Only American firms are slightly covering shorts, with 70 packages of White Factory silk traded at prices with little fluctuation. Therefore, silk exports are not expected to strengthen in the short term.

Chinese Silk Exports to the US Decreased by 600 Packages Last December

Yesterday, according to a Reuters report on New York raw silk inventory and sales, raw silk imports decreased in December. Japanese silk decreased by 4,905 packages compared to the previous month, Chinese silk decreased by 602 packages, and European silk increased by 21 packages.

### Confession

— Qin Wen

I've only been in the same cell with this fellow inmate for a little over ten days, but I can already sense that he is different from the others in many ways. The first thing is his unusual appearance. While most inmates have their heads shaved every fifty or sixty days, and their hair and beards are thick and black, his scalp is shiny and his face is smooth. Even the prisoner's hair, a mere wisp, is only a tiny bit long. Furthermore, his arms are very thick and strong, but his face shows no flesh at all, and his ribs are clearly countable, which is quite incongruous.

Secondly, because he works as a gardening inmate, and the weather was still hot at the time, he had to water the plants early in the morning and late at night. Every day, he would leave the cell earlier than the others. Often, before exercise even started in the cell, the guard would come with the list to call him out. In the evening, he would return later than the others, always carrying a basin full of hot water, swaying back and forth, as if he had found a treasure, and hurriedly stepped into the cell door. People in the cell often complained of thirst. He would fetch hot water in broad daylight to moisten their throats, not afraid of scalding himself or hearing the reprimands of the authorities. Everyone was very grateful to him.

Although he went to work early, he still needed to trouble me for some time every day after getting up. If you believe in fate, it was truly destined. At night, we slept on the same cell plank, and we sat side by side reading in the early morning. However, his reading was mostly looking up words in the dictionary. Once he found a new word, he would always hold up the book and ask me, "Old Xu! What does this word mean?"

Because he was reading English and checking the English-Chinese dictionary. Although he could find the new word he was looking for according to the English alphabet, he couldn't recognize the Chinese characters that were written there. He hadn't read a single Chinese book. It was said that his parents had died long ago, and he had been sent to work on ships by his maternal uncle since he was a child. He had always worked in the engine room, constantly using force to chisel coal, so his arms were very strong. Having been on foreign ships for a long time, he felt that knowing a little English could be advantageous. Therefore, regardless of when he could leave the prison, and regardless of whether he could go back to working on ships after leaving the prison, he would hum and read English whenever he had the chance. Naturally, his level was quite basic. This was his first unique characteristic.

His fourth unique characteristic was in the evening. When the electric light was not bright enough to read, he would always sit there blankly, without making a sound, always frowning. After many days, he finally told me that he was planning how to write his confession. Although at that time, the days of detention were being converted into a sentence, with two days counting as one, and he hadn't been sentenced for very long, it was still a long way off before he could write a confession and be transferred to a reformatory after serving one-sixth of his sentence.

"How do you write a confession?"

After telling me that he couldn't figure it out, he repeatedly asked me this question, and he also repeatedly asked the inmates he was close to, often asking several times in a three- or five-minute conversation.

In prison, there is an unspoken creed: when heavy objects need to be moved, the farmers and laborers step forward. When writing, sending letters, making reports, or writing confessions, the intellectuals have an inescapable duty.

Writing confessions is, of course, a common thing. Not only do illiterate inmates need someone to write it for them, but the authorities also prefer to have someone write it for them, because this is necessary to complete the procedures. It is not difficult to write a confession for someone else. Just take the sentence and look it up. If there is already a confession admitting the facts of the crime, then write an article based on that, elaborating on it, saying a few words of reflection, expressing remorse, and, as usual, use the standard formula of "I used to mistake a thief for my father," "Now I have awakened," "I will never commit the crime again." Then tell these words to the person and have him memorize them. If there has been no confession of guilt, regardless of whether it is unjust or not, you can simply admit the crime forcefully, make up some facts if there are none, and if there are accomplices, just make contact with them secretly beforehand. Anyway, "We'll talk after we get out," to avoid "dragging out the imprisonment."

This inmate's confession was indeed a bit difficult to write, not because he couldn't recognize Chinese characters. When telling lies in a confession, you must be able to justify yourself, otherwise the "mask" will be revealed, and the person interviewing you from the reformatory will see through it, and you will definitely not be "transferred." His situation was difficult to explain satisfactorily. There were seven people involved in his case. Besides a barber inmate who always shaved him until he was shiny, there was also an English teacher, a merchant, a university student, and a painter. With so many parties involved, the relationships were naturally complicated, and it was impossible to fabricate events out of thin air like in a single case. His charge was "communication," because he transported books that were used for propaganda. However, according to him, he really didn't know the truth of the matter at first:

"We people on the ship bring things to earn extra money. How would we know if it's the XX Party or not?"

He said it frankly and naturally.

The person who asked him to carry the books had said in court that he had not joined any organization. He himself denied the crime outright. But this was worse than admitting the crime, because it was said that he was not reflecting and he was sentenced to five years in prison. Those who admitted the crime were considered to have repented and had their sentences reduced by half, and they were only sentenced to two and a half years. The person who asked him to carry the books had committed suicide, secretly tearing open his suit trousers and hanging himself in the middle of the night, so there was no proof.

"People who haven't joined an organization, of course, wouldn't tell him the real situation!"

Many old inmates said this. Therefore, it was impossible for him to change his story and admit the crime. Not admitting the crime, however, could not be considered a confession, and this became a stalemate.

Later, I was transferred to a different cell, and separated from him. I transferred to a small cell on the east side, and he remained in the large cell in the center. However, I could still see him often in the workshop.

"How do you write a confession?" Every time we met, after greeting each other, he would ask me this question first, as usual. If the conversation went on for more than five sentences, he would have to ask again:

"How do you write a confession?"

Originally, I had already memorized his name very well, and I could even say his number off the top of my head. Because he was always asking me this question, if you didn't understand him, it was hard not to find him annoying. After going to the workshop, as long as I saw him in the distance, I would always think to myself: "The confession is coming!"

Gradually, I forgot his real name and no longer remembered his number, and just treated him as a confession.

### End of the Year

— Shen Shengshi

Carrying heavy steps,

Silently treading through another difficult year.

Still in a helpless,

Situation, reaching New Year's Eve.

As usual, the broken mood of the year,

Will be brought to an end on this day of the year.

Looking forward to the new year,

Hoping that the weariness of life will follow,

This difficult year to pass.

Why look back?

Those countless sorrows and hatreds,

Under the poor and difficult life,

There are light dreams to tease my mind,

But how dare I have the infatuation of a poet,

Adding another layer of heartache memories.

Those past events that pierced my heart,

Pass away with the cold winter wind.

Still a lonely state of mind,

Dazed to see the year pass.

But I still have to live,

To steadfastly resist poverty,

Resist the loneliness of the heart.

Continue to climb through the long and difficult road,

And hope for tomorrow!

So I shake off my tired spirit,

Stretch out my lazy body.

Firmly waving my fist,

Forcing a smile,

Opening my arms to welcome the new year.

### Birandello as a Playwright

— Lü Gang

December 10, Havas Rome Electric: "Luigi Pirandello, the famous Italian playwright and novelist, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934, passed away this morning at eight o'clock due to pneumonia..." This news does not seem to attract much attention. However, Pirandello cannot be considered an unfamiliar writer in China. Perhaps it is because he once acted as an "accomplice," willing to serve Mussolini on the battlefield, declaring his readiness to go to East Africa to conquer Abyssinia, that everyone lost interest? ... However, in any case, his artistic achievements and influence cannot be ignored.

In fact, Pirandello is not a "genuine" fascist writer. Some say he is a liberal, but I don't think that is quite right. In short, he seems to be a "late convert" who leans towards fascism. However, Nicolas Ferretti has another view, saying that he is a skeptical poet. Naturally, he has his reasons. For example, he said: "...In Pirandello's eyes, the land of fascism only increases the soul's suffering, misfortune, and failure due to the feeling of emptiness in life." "Therefore, the certainty explored by the characters described by Pirandello becomes elusive; this gives rise to doubt, confusion, distress, and disappointment." But in fact, Ferretti's statement can almost be said to be based on a psychological point of view. However, it does not seem appropriate to criticize and observe Pirandello's entire work or his artistic development process from this point of view alone, because his mind—his ideals—still exist within his art.

Pirandello's thoughts were limited to the society and environment in which he lived, so Ferretti said: "Everyone has their own truth" is the title of several plays: this is Pirandello's entire philosophy." This is very true. Moreover; this also explains what Pirandello's thoughts are expressed in these plays? ... Therefore, "Pirandello's thoughts are full of many distresses, and are integrated with the sophists, Protagoras, Gorgias, or Hume's thoughts, or Hegel's doctrine that is being mutually interpreted." The result of this thought also has a source: he was confined by the "spiritual prison" of fascism, and his artistic boundaries were limited. "He cannot run outside the boundaries of 'nature,' and is trapped in disappointment or great natural distress."

Long-term doubt and distress, as well as despair of not finding a way out, finally made him trust in God. — This is naturally the tragedy of the human spirit under fascism.

— Forget yourself: Believe in God.

It is not surprising that Pirandello ended up like this. He cannot see the world, and even if he has glimpsed some "small world," he does not dare to express it in his works. Ferretti said that in "his works, he always carefully avoids direct descriptions of historical and social environments." — This is indeed a sad fact. As a result, he can only forever describe psychological conflicts and always explore the truth within the soul. ... Sometimes, his artistic works depict the psychology of two eras, as well as social contradictions. But this was mostly before the war. Often in his works you can see a terrible psychological expression: the result is anger and madness. ... This is most evident in his plays, because the characters in his plays are mostly tormented by the most complex and contradictory psychology, just as his own thoughts are trapped. ...

Some people think that his drama is an "ideal drama," perhaps because he expressed his ideals and his entire philosophy. ... In his entire life, it seems that his achievements in drama are greater than his achievements in poetry or poetry. And the starting point of his literary life seems to have been first engaged in the creation of poetry.

He is worthy of being a talented poet, playwright and novelist. He was born in Cirgenli on June 28, 1867, his hometown is Sicily. In 1891, he graduated from Bouo University in Germany, and then served as a professor of rhetoric and aesthetics at the Higher Women's Academy of the Roman Church from 1897 to 1924. On March 18, 1929, he was appointed by the government as a member of the "Italian Academy of Letters." During this period, he also engaged in literary writing. Before the war, he had already achieved considerable artistic success. At that time, he mostly wrote novels. In addition to the twenty-four volumes of "One Year's Short Stories" that have been collected, his novels include: "The Excluded Woman" written in 1901, "The Late Mattia Pascal" written in 1912, "Old and Young" written in 1931, "Transformed" written in 1916, and "One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand" ... and so on. His play writing was mostly later. And his later years were mostly spent writing plays. The play collection "Naked Masks" includes almost more than forty plays. Here are: "Glorious Leisure" (1918), "The Game of Duty (1918), "Everyone Has Their Own Truth" (1918), "But This Is Not a Serious Matter" (1919), "Like Before, Yet Better Than Before" (1921), "Six Characters in Search of an Author" (1921), "Henry IV" 1922), "Clothing the Naked" (1923), "Each in His Own Way" (1924), "The Doctor's Duty" (1926), "New Colony" (1928), "Tonight We Improvise" (1922), "As You Desire Me" (1932), "Existence" (1932), "When Someone is a Character" (1933). ...etc. Among them, "New Colony" made a strict critique of fascism, naturally, this is certainly not enough to prove Pirandello's opposition to fascism. Ferretti put it well: "The world illusion based on Pirandello's work can very well promote the Italian bourgeoisie to engage in organizing fascist dictatorship." But if we therefore say that he is promoting fascism, or conversely that he is anti-fascist, then it is completely incorrect. Therefore, it is indeed difficult to affirm the facts; he is a "thorough" fascist figure, and it is therefore no wonder that he was attacked by Marinetti - a fascist futurist writer - at the Vienna International Congress for saying that art should not be used as a political tool. It is even less surprising that fascist critics consider his art to be "immoral" art and remove the play "The Myth of Inherited Children" from the program of the Royal Opera House. ... Now that he is finally dead, it seems to be the time to "cover the coffin."

### Hangzhou Nights

### Literary Supplement Notice

Last year, this publication published a manuscript of "Jiangbei People". The original intention of this article was to satirize the people of Jiangnan who have a very deep regional concept. The words "seemingly think that they are Jiangnan people..." in the article are clear evidence of this. This article does not insult the people of northern Jiangsu. I am afraid that it will cause misunderstanding. I hereby declare and apologize.

### Huge Amount of Dried Cocoons Loaded for Export

— Jian Ping

We just loudly appealed for silk factories that were "out of raw materials" and "forced to stop production," but we actually saw on the news that a huge amount of dried cocoons were being loaded for export. This is undoubtedly a very painful thing.

The local news section of this newspaper on the 6th revealed the following piece of news:

"While the silk factories in our province are being forced to stop production one after another due to lack of raw materials, British firm Jardine Matheson, Swiss firm Reinner, Italian firm Dafeng, etc., suddenly announced that they would buy high-quality cocoons from our country, declare them for export, and transport them to Italy, Switzerland, France, and other places. The purchase price has been particularly increased. For example, high-quality cocoons with a silk reeling yield of over 350 catties are priced at about 250 yuan in national currency per dan of dried cocoons. It is heard that more than 1,000 dan of dried cocoons have been declared for export. The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association convened an emergency meeting and decided to: send a letter to the Jianghai Customs to investigate the number of exports and tax rates; submit a request to the municipal government to quickly find ways to stop it, or forward it to the financial authorities to increase export tax rates. Also, after investigating the reasons for the exports, there are various rumors. Some say that they are used as industrial raw materials, while others say that they are used to make munitions (such as gunpowder)."

Last year, we already felt that the forced shutdown of silk factories was a most hateful thing. This year, only at the beginning, the evening paper on the 3rd published shocking news: "Lack of raw materials, high market prices, silk factories are mostly closed. Of the 113 factories in the city, only 48 were operating last year, and there are currently less than 20. These 20 are expected to stop production during the lunar New Year." It can be seen that this phenomenon is deteriorating. Without a perfect solution, it will never be reversed. Regarding this issue, the author pointed out in "Talk" on December 22 last year that this is also a "man-made conspiracy." At that time, the understanding of this issue was that it was not simply because of the "autumn cocoon harvest" that led to a lack of raw materials, but it was actually because "spring cocoon inventory was being hoarded by unscrupulous merchants." Now, the facts have proven that this is not "slander."

On the one hand, "silk factories are being forced to stop production due to lack of raw materials," but on the other hand, "huge amounts of dried cocoons are being loaded for export." This cannot be admitted to be a "good phenomenon." Originally, in our country under colonial status, exchanging raw materials for finished goods was already a forced thing. If we want to avoid being manipulated, of course, we have to break the shackles that others have prepared for us. Now, the facts provide a good example for our national industrialists. Of course, the industrialists in the silk factory industry, who are at the forefront, should clearly recognize this matter, and other industrialists should also "mourn for the fox after the rabbit dies." Everyone should wake up and work hard from basic work to achieve our requirements.

For example, the remedial measures decided by the Silk Factory Trade Association this time, requesting to "stop" exports and "increase export tax rates," require that our country not be bullied by imperialism. At the same time, for the general "hoarding and speculation" unscrupulous merchants, our national industrialists should fully expose their "traitor faces" and use the collective power to "sanction" them. "It is better to ask for yourself than to ask for others." Our national industrialists should concentrate their strength under the slogan of "national defense first," which is enough to deal with and destroy all tyrannical forces.

Finally, we should pay more attention to the fact that although it is not fully verified, it is "possible" that the huge amount of dried cocoons being loaded for export is to supply others with the manufacture of munitions. On the one hand, they buy at high prices, destroying our weak national industry; on the other hand, they manufacture munitions to guarantee their victory in aggression. We think: in the face of the covetous gaze of the great powers (especially our nation's greatest enemy), we Chinese are such a pitiful little beast!

### On the Snowy Plains

— Zhang Hai

The vast, boundless plains, as flat as a sea, stretched out at the foot of Dokbo Mountain. No trees could be seen, no villages, no Mongolian yurts or herds of livestock, and no color of the earth. From the cloud formations to the mountain ranges, as far as the eye could see, everything was covered with a layer of melting, glittering white snow, a vast expanse of whiteness, as if an angel had scattered velvet across the universe, trying to conceal the turbidity of the mortal world. On this pure snowfield, it was so desolate that even birds and beasts had disappeared, and the world had completely transformed into simplicity and solitude.

The camel's heavy hooves trampled relentlessly on the snow, the trampled snow marks gradually lengthening behind it. Bayar hadn't slept last night, and at this moment he kept yawning, his head drooping, his eyes unable to stay open. For a long time, I hadn't paid attention to him; it was the only camel bell that could awaken the snowfield that attracted me. Its tune was even and rhythmic, an incomparable sound in the wilderness.

"Bayar, how much further to Daqingshan?"

"After crossing Eqi Balu Mountain ahead, we'll reach the Dalat Desert, and further south is Daqingshan. But it will take us another four or five days to reach Pingdi Spring."

Bayar is a Mongolian, belonging to the "Khalkha" tribe. Three years ago, when I took a detour through Inner and Outer Mongolia to Siberia, I met him in Munisi. He gave me a fox skin the color of old sugar, wishing that I would stay in his home forever. This time, I was going to Xikang, and unexpectedly encountered him again while passing through Sayut.

"Mongolians all want to fight the short devils [Japanese], even the lamas are so angry they can't stand it!" He said to me excitedly as we slept in fur blankets at night.

At this moment, the two of us were carrying fifty sheepskin coats donated by herders from the Sayut area, sending them far away to the national warriors in Suidong.

The sun of severe winter, like a person suffering from paralysis, showed no sign of struggling. The frozen clouds always obstructed her, played with her, and simply let anything bully her. The snow hardly melted at all in the sun, but a violent storm rushed fiercely from the distant desert, roaring wildly, stirring up cold currents relentlessly in the vast snowfield, solidifying snow particles, and defeating the weak and powerless sunlight. Gradually, the ground bulged up here and there, and sank down here and there, making it clear that snow ridges were about to rise on this white snowfield.

Snow particles, along with the wind and waves, swept against our noses, against the camels' heads and necks. Bayar's camel suddenly lay down, almost throwing him off. He dismounted, seemingly unconcerned, whipped the camel, and rode on again.

As we approached the foot of Eqi Balu Mountain, he repeatedly instructed me:

"There are often bandits on the mountain ahead who catch people and cut off their ears and scoop out their soles! I heard that people from ×× have even come here to take photos, I don't know what they're using them for. We have to be especially careful, if we run into bandits, we're finished. They all have new weapons, given to them by ××."

Although his face was hidden in his sheepskin hat, so I couldn't see his expression, I believed that he was harboring vigilance, and that the blood in his body must be circulating rapidly. He prayed on the camel's back:

"May Heaven bless us to deliver these things safely to those brothers!"

It wasn't until our camels stepped onto the Dalat Desert that Bayar recovered his peace of mind from the fear, and lightly, incessantly, sucked on his pipe.

The wind and snow fought endlessly.

### Cabbage

— Liao Chuxiu

In recent days, cabbage has become a rather fashionable vegetable. In Shanghai, it is bought and sold by the load or by the catty. What Mr. Lu Xun said, "Hanging under the eaves of fruit stores, sold by the rain, used as a lining for shark fin soup," refers only to a type of Tianjin cabbage.

The Qunfang Pu and Shu Pu state: "Cabbage, also called song, is the most suitable vegetable for regular consumption among all vegetables. There are two types, one with a round, thick, slightly green stem, and the other with a flat, thin, and white stem. The leaves are all pale greenish-white, and the seeds are like those of rapeseed, but gray-black. It is planted in August, and blooms with yellow flowers in February, with four petals like mustard flowers. It forms pods in March, also like mustard. The ones grown in Yan, Zhao, Liaoyang, and Huaiyang are the fattest and thickest, with a single head weighing more than ten catties. Those in the south overwinter in the fields, while those in the north are mostly put in cellars. Gardeners in Yanjing also use horse manure in cellars to mound and cultivate them, keeping them out of the wind and sun, so that they grow out with tender yellow seedlings and leaves, crisp, beautiful, and without dregs, called yellow bud cabbage, which is a different variety of cabbage. The stems and leaves are all flat, with a sweet, warm, and non-toxic taste, which benefits the intestines and stomach, removes chest upset, relieves alcohol soup, promotes urination and defecation, harmonizes the middle and stops coughs, and winter juice is especially good. Before the summer solstice, the cabbage resembles boxes, and can treat skin itching and prevent qi-related diseases. There is also the spring never-old, also called eight-catty cabbage, with leaves like cabbage but larger, very crisp and tender, which can be planted in all four seasons and is very good for pickling."

The Pi Ya says: "The nature of song is to not wither in winter, and it is always available in all four seasons, with the integrity of pine, hence its character is ideographic." This is probably the reason why cabbage is called song.

The Ben Cao says: "The fattest and largest is called cow belly song." The Cai Pu says: "There is spring song and late song." Therefore, in the Biography of Zhou Yong in the Book of Southern Qi: "Yong was poor and had few desires, and ate vegetables all his life. Prince Wenhui asked Yong, what is the best taste among vegetables? He immediately said: Early chives in early spring, late song in late autumn." The early chives of early spring naturally refer to the chive sprouts of the present, and the superiority of late song over spring song is also evident from this.

Cabbage has probably been a common food for commoners for a long time. Therefore, the ancients always used eating song to express frugality. Biography of Prince Wuling Zhao in the Book of Southern Qi: "Shangshuling Wang Jian visited Ye, and Ye kept Jian for a meal, which was just cabbage and abalone in the dish."

In fact, cabbage is not one of the best-tasting vegetables. Chive sprouts, spinach, and shepherd's purse are above it, but its taste is quite "moderate," and there is a lot of it, so people eat it often. In fact, there are also people who hate cabbage:

Qing Yi Lu: "Jiangyou has a lot of song cabbage, and those who cook it with bamboo shoots hate it, scolding it: 'Heart-eating vegetable, slave and concubine of asparagus and mushrooms.'" Although this is because there is too much cabbage for those who cook bamboo shoots, which抢了the bamboo shoots' market, compared with bamboo shoots, cabbage is really only in the position of a slave; not to mention comparing it with fragrant mushrooms.

"After a great war, there must be a famine," this is what Lao Tzu said. However, cabbage is not like that. After a great war, it is not "scarce" like other vegetables, but grows extra long.

Zhuo Geng Lu records: "Between Yangzhou and Wang Bingshen Dingyou, after the ravages of war, the sites of houses in the city were covered with cabbage, the large ones weighing more than fifteen catties, and the small ones were no less than eight or nine catties, with laborers carrying only four or five heads." However, this statement is not necessarily correct. Currently, war is raging everywhere, but cabbage does not seem to be growing extraordinarily large compared to before.

Xie Zhaozhi's Wang Za Zhi says: "In the capital, there is yellow bud cabbage and yellow chives in the depths of winter, which are grown in fire pits in cellars by wealthy families, and the poor cannot afford them." Then, the so-called yellow bud cabbage must be called that only when it is "grown from fire pits and cellars" and "the seedlings and leaves turn yellow." Currently, people in Jiangnan call all cabbage yellow bud cabbage.

In fact, cabbage is better to play with than to eat. Currently, some people in Shanghai grow "red and purple song cabbage" in pots, which is naturally extremely vulgar. However, what Shen Sanbai's Six Records of a Floating Life records: "The heart of yellow bud cabbage is as white as jade, take five or seven heads of various sizes, plant them in a rectangular pot with sand and soil, and use charcoal instead of stone, with clear black and white, which is quite interesting." It is really better than daffodils, etc.

Regarding specialized writings on song cabbage, the earliest is Liang Jianwendi's Xie Chi Lai Da Song Qi, which says: "Wu is ashamed of the honor of a thousand miles, and Shu is ashamed of the Fu of Seven Vegetables, knowing that breaking celery in the school palace is just entering the Lu poetry, and cooking mallows with flowing fire is just specializing in the Bin classic." This greatly praises cabbage.

Finally, I must further clarify that the vegetables mentioned by the ancients all refer to cabbage, and that all writings about cabbage always include what the ancients said about vegetables in them. As for me, I naturally cannot but be cautious and only record some writings that explain song cabbage.

### The Sorrow of the Yu Cheng Boss

— Jiang Tian

The Yu Cheng Old Shop, which owns more than a dozen porcelain kilns and has more than a dozen branches in various places, is the largest porcelain manufacturing company in Gaopo Town. Everyone knows that the Yu Cheng boss (Cantonese for 'owner') is the most capable person in business.

The Yu Cheng boss is already around fifty years old this year, but his ambition to run a business has not waned. He still says from time to time: "Although our products here can't always catch up with those of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi, and our reputation is not as great as theirs, based on my experience of the past twenty or thirty years, I think we will be able to catch up with them sooner or later, won't we? Now, in the southern regions and various parts of Southeast Asia, aren't our products very popular and reputable?"

Indeed, the Yu Cheng boss is a person with great business ambitions. The Gaopo porcelain industry has achieved its present success, and the Yu Cheng boss is definitely a meritorious figure. Twenty or thirty years ago, there were only a few very small porcelain kilns in this town, producing only some crude plates and bowls, which were sold only in nearby villages. However, the Yu Cheng boss believed that this business had potential, so he devoted his efforts to it, selling some ancestral fields to raise money to open new kilns. Gradually, he opened branches in various places, and the products became more diverse. As long as it was porcelainware, he produced it, and sales gradually increased. Other shops in the town also followed suit and sought development. In this way, ten years ago, Gaopo porcelain was already being sold to Southeast Asia. Everyone knew that Gaopo was a famous porcelain-producing area in South China, and the Yu Cheng boss, who developed this business, had become the richest man in the town. Not to mention anything else, just the number of people who relied on his porcelain kilns for their livelihoods was in the thousands, and the name Yu Cheng was known to those who bought porcelain. Yu Cheng plates and bowls were as famous as Chen Jiageng shoes.

The Yu Cheng boss was so good at business that it was no wonder he often boasted that he would run Gaopo porcelain to be as famous as Jingdezhen in Jiangxi. However, in recent years, the sales of Gaopo porcelain have changed a bit. Stacks and stacks of inventory are piled up everywhere, especially sales in Southeast Asia, which have simply disappeared.

This phenomenon is distressing to the Yu Cheng boss. He can only scold the fellow bosses from time to time:

"Damn it, it's all those Japanese devils who sell the goods at a lower price to take away our sales. And there are those worthless Chinese who go to buy them. Those foreign goods aren't durable, they're just a little better-looking. We can only sell the inventory cheaper now. I think foreign goods won't last long."

The Yu Cheng boss thought that selling the inventory cheaper would defeat foreign goods, but foreign goods were even cheaper. Finally, the inventory still couldn't be sold, and batches of new goods were stored up again. In this kind of situation, several fellow businesses in the town had already closed down, but the Yu Cheng boss, who had a lot of capital, was not afraid and continued to produce as usual. However, one year was ultimately not as good as the previous year. The branches in various places all said that there was too much inventory and they couldn't produce any more. Even Jiangxi goods couldn't compete with foreign goods. This is what made the Yu Cheng boss anxious. Looking at the end of this year, the porcelain kilns in the town

all had to stop work.

The Yu Cheng boss ran to the warehouses by the river every day, looking at the goods in the warehouses, which were piling up more and more. Those red-headed wooden boats on the river, which used to transport his porcelain goods to the outside world, were now either empty and parked by the river, or loaded with cabins full of rice. This situation made him think that foreign goods were not as good as his?

Inventory was everywhere. The Yu Cheng boss could only sit on the rosewood pit bed in the living room all day, smoking his water pipe and stroking his beard, thinking. Finally, he had no choice but to stop the work of the porcelain kilns. He said to the workers:

"Now it's because there are no sales, too much inventory, so we have to stop the kilns. This is all due to the dumping of foreign goods. Once sales turn better, we will still open the kilns. I really want you to work."

The Yu Cheng boss looked at the disappointed faces of the workers, looking at the porcelain kilns without a trace of fire, and he also felt sad. However, he was still thinking in his heart: "Maybe foreign goods will decline one day." However, this was just comforting his sad mood. How can such indigenous products that are not improved compete with foreign goods? Perhaps the Yu Cheng boss and those fellow people had not thought of this.

### Afternotes P] The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (1300) will have Mr. Gu Bangji and Mr. Xu Hongji of Daxia University lecture on "Words on Raising Children" from 4:30 PM to 5:15 PM this afternoon. All circles are requested to pay attention at that time. A Visit to the Film "Drama Workshop" "Sunrise" Is Not Difficult to Produce Not long ago, major newspapers in this city published the news that the "Drama Workshop" was rehearsing "Sunrise," and invited the famous playwright Ouyang Yuqian to serve as the director of the play. Since this news came out, not only were general drama-loving audiences watching with great interest, but also the literary world caused considerable attention. Because the script of "Sunrise" is the recent creation of Mr. Cao Yu, which has been published in the Wen Ji Monthly, Mr. Cao's first work is "Thunderstorm," and his achievements have won praise from all sides, considering him to be the most recent outstanding Chinese playwright. Therefore, after the news of his second creation "Sunrise" being prepared for performance was revealed, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Ye Shaojun, Shen Congwen and many other famous writers in the literary world published a special issue in the local Ta Kung Pao, making a collective critique of "Sunrise," unanimously praising it and considering it to be an even more successful step forward than "Thunderstorm." Therefore, all the audiences who have seen "Thunderstorm" on stage are looking forward to the early performance of "Sunrise." But the day before yesterday, news came that "Sunrise" was difficult to produce. What exactly is the reason? It was not said. The reporter is a member of the drama-loving group, and after hearing this news, he made a special trip to the "Drama Workshop" for a visit. There, they were working hard to rehearse, and the working situation was very tense. He found a person in charge, Mr. So-and-so, and asked about the truth about the difficulty of producing "Sunrise." According to him, this is not really true. In fact, because most of the actors in the "Drama Workshop" are the backbone of the "Fudan Drama Society," and now because the winter vacation is approaching, all universities are preparing for the big exam, so some actors are busy with exams and cannot participate in rehearsals, so the work was virtually suspended for two or three days, so there was a misreport of difficult production news. Now they have stepped up their work and will probably be able to meet the audience soon. Drama-loving audiences! Are you looking forward to "Sunrise"? This news is good news. The Lianhua Giant Film "Lianhua Symphony" Premiered Last Night The Lianhua sound giant film "Lianhua Symphony," produced by Huaan Company, is a giant film jointly produced by all the stars of Lianhua's eight major directors. It was originally scheduled to premiere at the New Light Grand Theater on New Year's Day. Because another giant film of the company, "Lone City Heroine," was a great success, it was extended to premiere at 9:15 last night. (Three shows daily from today) The film includes eight parts, namely "Two Mao Money" directed by Situ Huimin, "Broken Dreams of a Spring Boudoir" directed by Fei Mu, "Stranger" directed by Tan Youliu, "Trio" directed by Shen Fu, "Moonlight Sketch" directed by He Mengfu, "Ghost" directed by Song Shilin, "Fools' Rhapsody" directed by Sun Yu, and "Little Five Righteous Ones" directed by Cai Chusheng. The content is rich and the technology is excellent. It is undoubtedly a giant film that audiences who love Lianhua films do not want to give up. Zuo Ming's "The Way to Make Money" Since the start of filming of "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," which was written and directed by Zuo Ming for the second time, it has been nearly three months. During the New Year, Zuo Ming received many New Year's cards from friends. Most of the words on the New Year's cards were different from the others, that is, after "Congratulations on the New Year," there was also a sentence "and wish the success of the way to make money," which is very obvious. On the one hand, they used this auspicious phrase "the way to make money," and on the other hand, they wished him the success of "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," which can be said to be a clever pun. Zuo Ming is loyal to art. He is concentrating on completing his "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money" perfectly, so although it was the New Year, he only rested for two days, and then continued to work, and will soon be "completed." Daguangming Shows "Queen of the Beast Kingdom" Starting today, the Daguangming Grand Theater will show Paramount's all-out production of the beast film "Queen of the Jungle" The Jungle Princess. The protagonist of the film is the healthy and beautiful movie star Dorazan Lamore. Except for this film, it is feared that beast films with female stars as the protagonists have not been seen before. The content includes scenes such as thousands of apes attacking the village inhabited by the natives, the fierce battle between tigers and leopards, the cruel punishment of women by demon natives, and the nude swimming of romantic couples in the creek. Dorazan Lamore has the ability to drive elephants and tigers in this film, and has the beauty to sink fish and drop geese, so it is more interesting to watch than ordinary beast films without romantic colors. When the theater releases this film, it will also show the famous short film "Invincible Sailor," which won the gold medal. The film uses the latest invention of three-dimensional color, which is more beautiful and vivid than the three primary colors, it is said. 代邮 Ye Weihua: The news item was published on December 24 of last year, with the address of Du Aojun at No. 2954 Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, because it is a promotional copy. Please write directly to him. Editor's Reply
