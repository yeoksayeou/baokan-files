### Kato Visits Qin Dechun

Expresses Two Japanese Hopes; Peace Slogan Suspected as a Delaying Tactic

[Beiping] Kato visited Qin Dechun this afternoon and stated that he was acting on orders from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese government hopes for: 1. Non-expansion; 2. Local resolution. Qin stated that peace has always been China's consistent position, but it must be under the principle of preserving territorial sovereignty. Currently, the Japanese army is entering the pass in large numbers, and the front lines are not withdrawing as agreed, which is not a path to peace. Kato also felt that the Japanese diplomatic and military departments' steps were not in sync. General observation suggests that the Japanese side is singing the song of peace regarding the Lugouqiao affair, while firing guns at night and assembling a large army, forming an inevitable victory front. Their peace slogan is actually a delaying tactic. (Special dispatch from the 13th)

### Passengers Overcrowded on Trains Leaving Beiping and Shanghai Heading South

### Qin Dechun Says Hope for Peace is Extremely Slim

Situation Will Inevitably Escalate; All Demands Rejected

[Nanjing] Li Shijun, the representative of the 29th Army stationed in Nanjing, spoke with Beiping Mayor Qin Dechun via long-distance telephone between Nanjing and Beiping at noon on the 13th. According to Qin: ① At dawn on the morning of the 13th, about a thousand Japanese soldiers were discovered at Dahongmen, between Nanwan and Yongdingmen, and launched a fierce attack on the positions of our army near Yongdingmen and Nanwan. They were repelled by our army after two hours of fierce fighting. ② Railways in the southeastern suburbs of Beiping have been mostly destroyed by the Japanese. ③ There is no sincerity whatsoever in the so-called withdrawal of Japanese troops. They are still reinforcing their troops continuously. Although they are still sending people to negotiate with us, the hope for peace is extremely slim, and the situation will inevitably escalate. ④ The fighting in the Lugouqiao area has subsided slightly and is still being defended by troops. The positions are fortified. Also, Li asked about whether the Japanese side had proposed conditions during the continuous negotiations and whether our side had acknowledged any circumstances. Qin replied that the other side often has various demands, which have been rejected. He swore that not a single word of the treaty had been acknowledged and asked to relay this reassurance to the central government. Subsequently, Li also spoke with Sun Weidong, the Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, and the content was similar to what Qin had said. Li has now reported what Qin and Sun said to Minister He.

### US Secretary of State Cables Chinese and Japanese Ambassadors

Chinese-Japanese Conflict Affects World Peace; Hull States Nine-Power Treaty Still Valid

[Washington] The US State Department announced today that Secretary of State Hull has separately cabled Japanese Ambassador to the US, Saito Hiroshi, and the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Ambassador, informing them that armed conflict between China and Japan will be a major blow to peace and world progress. (Reuters dispatch from Washington, 12th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull issued a warning today to the representatives of China and Japan stationed in the United States, stating that the Sino-Japanese conflict in North China will strike a blow to the world's peace and progress. At the same time, the Chinese Embassy also issued a statement saying that although both China and Japan had agreed to retreat on July 9, the Japanese army in the Beiping area has continued to increase. There are now 20,000 Japanese soldiers near Fengtai, which clearly shows that Japan has a predetermined plan, and its sole purpose is to make North China a second Manchuria. Since this incident was initiated by the Japanese side, the Japanese side should be responsible for all losses. (National Telegram, 12th)

[Washington] US Secretary of State Hull responded to various questions about the situation in North China today, but did not make any definite statements. When asked about British Foreign Secretary Eden's statement that the British government is currently considering discussing the matter with the United States, Hull replied that he has not yet received any information about such a move. Someone also asked whether the United States would apply the Neutrality Act to China and Japan.

### Excerpts from Newspaper Commentary in Various Countries

[New York] Important newspapers here were greatly shocked by the sudden actions of Japan in North China, as if struck by lightning out of a clear sky. They all published news of the Beiping war with large headlines and in prominent positions. The American public is now fully aware of Japan's conspiracy to expand its aggressive continental policy south of the Yellow River, unlike the ignorance of a few years ago. According to observers familiar with the Far Eastern situation here, the current action of the Kwantung Army to occupy the Lugouqiao area is only the first step in consolidating Japan's power south of the Great Wall, and thereby occupying the Fengtai and Lugouqiao areas to control transportation in North China. The current attempt by the Japanese army is no different from the tactics adopted in the September 18th Incident in Shenyang. However, observers are unwilling to speculate on whether these military personnel intend to expand the puppet organization to the Beiping-Tianjin area. The People's Tribune stated in its editorial this morning that Japanese soldiers are all arrogant people who do not want to be bound by the peaceful policies of the Eastern government. If they have an opportunity, they will expand their hegemony in North China. It is hoped that the new commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China, Katsuki Kiyoshi, will be able to stop the Japanese army's irregular actions and save all disputes. Other American newspapers here, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, also published commentaries on the North China war in recent days. The New York Times stated that Japan's actions came after the conflict in Heilongjiang tested the strength of the Soviet Union. The Washington Post stated that Japan's actions were no less than "playing with fire." The Sunday edition of The New York Times carried an article written by the famous writer Paul Vin, which stated that the Japanese army had three conflicts in two weeks. Although the locations of these three conflicts are far apart, their relationship is very close. Lugouqiao is a direct consequence of the unrest in East Asia and is promoted by Japan's attempt to control East Asia. Observers now believe that under the guidance of General Chiang Kai-shek, China is becoming stronger day by day and has now become a stabilizing force in the Far East. China has now unified its army, and its troops have been trained for a long time, well-armed, and extremely elite. The author then described in detail the unification of China in the past two years and concluded that if China and Japan were to go to war, Japan might gain some minor advantages in the Beiping-Tianjin area in the early stages, but the spirit of China's New Life Movement and the consolidation of China's national unity would eventually shatter Japan's dream. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 13th)

[Washington] Regarding the situation in North China, it is said that the reason why the United States has not yet invoked the Neutrality Act is that a peaceful resolution is not without hope. Furthermore, The New York Times today published a commentary on the North China issue, stating that Japan's arrogant re-presentation of treaty conditions, seeking to obtain certain political concessions, has once again raised the issue that Americans have been thinking about since the conquest of Manchuria in 1931: "Can Japan's ambition to dominate the five continents coexist with a unified and independent China?" The report stated that this question is also in the minds of the British, which can be seen from the statement made by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons yesterday.

### Market Price of Government Bonds Falls

The Government Will Take Effective Measures

[Nanjing] The market price of government bonds has fallen in recent days due to rumors in North China. However, according to the authorities, the government bond fund is solid and has a well-established reputation, and should not be affected by the incident. As for the reason for the decline in government bonds on the 13th, it is nothing more than speculators manipulating the market. It is said that the government will take effective measures to stabilize the bond market so that speculators will know to be vigilant. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 13th)

### Nakamura Visits Diao Zuqian to Continue Talks on the Swatow Case

The authorities are working hard to maintain public order and prevent traitors from succeeding. (Special dispatch from the 13th)

### Japanese Opinion Circles Have Formed a Nationally United Front

The Overall Situation Has Reached Its Most Concerning Stage

[Tokyo] This morning's Asahi Shimbun editorial was entitled "Nationally United Support," stating that the strong anti-Japanese consciousness in China is the inevitable cause of the current incident. Japan's implementation of its continental policy and China's construction of a modern nation seem to be opposed to each other. To integrate them seamlessly into the national consciousness of both countries, the conflict between the two countries may be an inevitable fate. The depth of the current situation lies in this. The Mainichi Shimbun stated that how the situation will change in the future depends on China's attitude. In any case, Japan's determination has been made (it will surely make it effective until the final goal is reached). The Hochi Shimbun stated that Konoe summoned representatives from various parties, opinion circles, financial circles, and industrial circles in the middle of the night, requesting a nationally united realization of the general mobilization of intentions, which is the same attitude taken by the great powers when participating in the European war. Based on this general mobilization, a new method of permanent solution must be sought. The Miyako Shimbun advocated punishing China in order to have good results. The Chugai Commercial News stated that if China recognizes Japan's position at this time and repents, Sino-Japanese relations will be different from others, and there will be a way to reconciliation. Looking at the Japanese opinion circles as a whole, a nationally united front has been formed. The overall situation has reached its most concerning stage, or it may be difficult to recover.

### War Breaks Out in the Suburbs of Beiping

— Gao

Ever since the Japanese army provoked the Lugouqiao Incident in the form of a hasty challenge, after six days of artillery fire and hand-to-hand combat, the signs of cessation are still nowhere to be found. On the contrary, there is a tendency to expand. The war has extended to the suburbs of Beiping, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. The crisis in East Asia is like a hanging thread. It is like a rotten rope holding a great weight that is about to fall. We, who are known for our ardent love of peace, are truly unable to handle ourselves under such heavy duress. The process of this provocation is extremely bizarre. By analyzing the past events one by one, right and wrong will become clear. The number of Japanese troops currently stationed in Hebei Province has already exceeded the provisions of the Boxer Protocol. From the very beginning of their deployment, there has been much speculation. Later, they repeatedly held large-scale exercises, constantly displaying their threatening and intimidating effects. Local people have long watched with concern. However, ordinary exercises, although illegal, are still limited to daytime. This time, however, they specifically conducted night combat exercises, and held them in locations outside the treaty. This was a premeditated plan to find fault. Even a child can see the general idea. Once the dispute began, the flames of war spread quickly. Based on the principle of settling matters peacefully, our side, under extreme indignation, still tried to restrain itself so as not to expand the situation. After several oral agreements, both sides withdrew their troops, but the Japanese repeatedly broke faith, engaging in interception and attack. Troops from outside the pass continued to enter, carrying with them large amounts of military equipment. It has also been reported that two more divisions have been transferred from their country. What is their purpose? The use of such a large army is obvious to everyone. Therefore, no matter to what extent future changes may occur, the responsibility for causing the incident should be clearly borne by the Japanese side.

Having clarified right and wrong, let us talk about gains and losses. The Japanese, encouraged by the unexpected gains of the past, believe that our country can be treated arbitrarily and insultingly. They do not realize that the situation today is very different from the past. The government has repeatedly stated its diplomatic position, and the people have been able to shake off the past spirit of decadence. The nationally unified understanding of the concept of the nation is such that there is a trend of not being able to withstand further insult. Moreover, modern warfare is by no means limited to the two opposing countries. As the Yomiuri Shimbun said, Song Zheyuan's statement that the number of those who will perish together is not easy to predict is not without grounds. Can the Japanese side also deeply appreciate this? Some say that the Japanese side's intention was not to expand the situation, but to use the old trick of trying to gain without labor. This calculation of theirs is also wrong. It must be understood that the limit of our country's concession has reached the final critical juncture. The statement of vowing to coexist or perish with Lugouqiao is surely not enough to show the determination of our soldiers to defend it, and they must try to put on pressure in many ways. Crisis is imminent, and the consequences will be unimaginable. War is a dangerous sign. Stopping aggression is the way to self-preservation. The American report's theory of "playing with fire" can be said to be an apt metaphor. If the Japanese still have a trace of sincerity in taking care of the overall situation in East Asia, they should rein in their actions and know to do so in time. The shame of piling bottles is not only a cause of concern for us.

### Sino-US Formally Sign Gold and Silver Exchange Agreement

Aimed at Improving China's Credit Institutions

[Washington] The Treasury Department announced today that the Sino-US gold and silver exchange agreement was signed today. According to the agreement, China will purchase a large amount of cash from the United States and pay with silver. The total amount of the exchange has not been announced.

The Treasury Department stated that the agreement also stipulates that in order to stabilize the currency, China may borrow US dollars or Chinese currency from the United States using gold and silver stored in the United States as collateral. The main purpose of the agreement is to improve China's credit institutions. When reporters inquired of Finance Minister Morgenthau whether Japan had raised objections, he replied in the negative.

The enthusiasm of our overseas Chinese for their motherland can be seen from this. Chen, the ship's captain, has sent a telegram to Education Director Ouyang Ge, requesting instructions to determine the direction of the voyage. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 13th)

Soviet aviators will conquer the air route between Moscow, the Arctic, and the United States, making it regularly navigable. We firmly believe this is possible. No difficulties can shake our conviction. Our conviction is based on a solid foundation: excellent machinery, reliable engines, accurate instruments, and the excellent skills of the pilots, enabling us to surpass others in long-distance flight, high-altitude flight, and speed. Our struggle with nature this time is the same as that of Schmidt, Vize, Byalobrzhesky, Babushkin, Chkalov, Baidukov, and Belyakov in the past. We are by no means fighting alone, but have the backing of the entire free and happy Soviet Union and the great Party of Lenin and Stalin." (TASS, 12th)

Aircraft Construction

▲ TASS Moscow Correspondence The "ANT25" aircraft is now famous in the world of aviation and will be forever recorded in history. A year ago, Chkalov, Baidukov, and Belyakov flew this type of aircraft non-stop for 9,374 kilometers, surpassing the world record of 9,104 kilometers set by the Frenchmen Rossi and Codos. This aircraft was manufactured at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute and designed by Sukhoi. The supervisor was the famous aircraft manufacturer Professor Tupolev. This aircraft is a cantilever monoplane with the wing located below the fuselage. The wing length exceeds that of similar aircraft by 30%, making it very fuel-efficient. Three fuel tanks are installed in the wings to make them even stronger. The landing wheels can be retracted into the wings during flight.

This aircraft is equipped with an "AM34" type engine, which was designed by Mikulin and has won awards at international aviation exhibitions in Paris, Milan, and Copenhagen. For the purpose of organizing the Russian-American flight, the engine has been improved and the fuselage has also been slightly modified to make the flight more stable. To ensure the comfort of the crew, the cabin is now heated with waste gas from the engine, raising the temperature inside the cabin to a level suitable for long-distance flight at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 meters above the Arctic Ocean. In addition, oxygen equipment is installed for high-altitude flight, ensuring that no carbon dioxide gas can invade the cabin. In foggy weather, the aircraft is equipped with blind-flying equipment, and there are two sets of flight controls.

The "ANT25" is a land-based aircraft, but it can also float on water. In the event that the crew is forced to land on water or on an ice floe, it is equipped with a spare wireless radio, a rubber boat, and food.

The wireless radio installed on the aircraft is specially designed for this application. The radio is equipped with two receivers, one of which is kept as a backup. Both receivers are capable of receiving both long and short waves. In addition to telegrams, they can also receive telephone calls. The transmitter can only send Morse code telegrams. Tests have shown that the radio can communicate with locations within 6,000 kilometers. In addition, there is also a ground transceiver for use when the aircraft lands.

### Partitioning of Palestine Opposed by Arabs and Israel

⊙ Jerusalem According to local sources, 150 Islamic groups signed a declaration today stipulating that any Muslim who signs a treaty partitioning Palestine will be excommunicated.

### The Price of the Franc Shows Improvement on the London Foreign Exchange Market

[London] After studying the new tax proposals at the end of the week, French foreign exchange speculators seem to have realized that forward foreign exchange transactions will eventually be taxed, so they are closing their positions one after another. As a result, the prices of both spot and forward francs rose today. Most of the selling pressure has now shifted to the US dollar, due to fears that the French and American authorities may cooperate to investigate and punish speculators in the foreign exchange market. There are differing opinions among people in London on whether the French Finance Minister's new tax plan can recover funds flowing abroad. Some criticize the proposal to confiscate all speculative profits made during the period of tension in June, believing that this approach will not help the treasury and only smacks of opposition to capitalism. However, others say that this proposal is only a gesture by the government towards the extreme left, and it remains questionable whether it will be strictly implemented.

### China's Return to Prosperity Benefits Both Britain and Japan

Military Aggression Affects Trade: Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen's Statement at a Reception for the Japanese Inspection Group

[London] The Federation of British Industries hosted a banquet tonight for members of the Japanese Economic Inspection Group. Lord Barnby (former leader of the Federation of British Industries' economic inspection group to Japan and "Manchukuo" in 1934) delivered a speech, stating: "In the next ten years, the development of East Asian countries will be the hope for the recovery of world trade. As leaders of the business communities of Britain and Japan, we can do our best to eliminate misunderstandings and enhance friendship between the two countries. If this is the case, it will not only be fortunate for the two countries, but also contribute to the security and prosperity of the world. I believe the gentlemen of the Japanese inspection group will also agree with this statement." Subsequently, Shigekuro Monono, head of the Japanese inspection group, rose to respond, mentioning Lord Barnby's visit to Japan three years ago, saying that this visit resulted in mutual understanding between the business communities of the two countries. "I also believe that the results of our discussions in recent days are sufficient to allow both sides to understand various facts and each other's views on these facts. This is very valuable and very beneficial. In short, as far as the trade relationship between Britain and Japan is concerned, there is no situation that would make us feel that the traditional friendship between the two countries is in danger of being seriously harmed." (Havas, Central News Agency, 12th)

[London] Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, Chief Economic Advisor to the British Government, continued to speak, referring to the current situation in China, saying that tanks and military trucks are not the best commercial salesmen. He hopes that common sense will prevail and overcome all difficulties. He is pleased to see that Japanese trade with China has expanded in the past eighteen months, but he believes that if there is a better understanding between China and Japan, Japanese trade with China will improve even more. If China's territorial integrity and its ordinary sovereignty are not respected, then events similar to the current conflict will inevitably occur frequently. Only if China becomes more prosperous can we hope to increase trade with China. Among all countries, Japan will benefit the most from China's prosperity. Therefore, the most beneficial thing for both Britain and Japan is for the two countries to cooperate to make China strong and peaceful again. For the sake of mutual benefit, he has high hopes for the future of British-Japanese relations. Now that Japanese trade is expanding, this is the best opportunity to clear up misunderstandings and improve commercial relations. As for the current import quota system, he advocates replacing it with another system that is beneficial to both Britain and Japan. The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigeru Yoshida, rose to reply.

Mussolini Agrees to Convene Peace Conference

[Rome] After meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for the second time, former British Labour Party leader Lansbury told reporters that he believed Mussolini welcomed a general international peace conference, in which financial, economic, and territorial issues could be discussed. Mussolini hopes that other countries will propose this matter, and that there will be careful preparation before the meeting, but it is doubtful whether the time is right at present. Lansbury also said that the Italian Prime Minister assured him of two things during their second conversation: ㊀ Italy has no intention of destroying the integrity of Spain; ㊁ There are no serious disputes between Britain and Italy that cannot be resolved amicably. Mussolini suggested that representatives from Britain and Italy could hold a round-table conference to discuss the Abyssinian issue and all other issues.

### Germany Proposes Four Demands; Austria Has Already Rejected Them

Germany's Attitude Temporarily Relaxes

[Paris] Madame Tabouis, the diplomatic correspondent for the "事业报," recently declared that the German government had recently made four demands on Austria: ㊀ Allow members of the Nazi Party to join the Austrian Schuschnigg cabinet; ㊁ Repeal all laws against the Nazi Party and grant amnesty to all Nazi criminals; ㊂ Prohibit any anti-Nazi Party debate in Austrian newspapers; ㊃ Allow German newspapers to be freely transported into Austria. The above four demands were submitted to the German-Austrian Mixed Committee for discussion. The Austrian members immediately expressed their rejection. German Minister to Austria Papen, due to Austria's strong attitude, requested German leader Hitler to adopt a moderate attitude and not to act rashly. Hitler has also decided not to take any drastic action in Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula until the Spanish Civil War is over. (Havas, Central News Agency, 13th)

### Britain Again Proposes a Compromise Solution to France, Germany, and Italy

British House of Commons Discusses the Spanish Issue; French Border Monitoring Methods Have Been Suspended

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is now scheduled to meet with the ambassadors of France, Russia, Germany, and Italy this afternoon to personally present the compromise solution proposed by the British government, so that it can be submitted for discussion at the meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War on the 16th of this month. (Havas, Central News Agency, 13th)

[London] A compromise solution to the Spanish Civil War non-intervention measures is currently being drafted by Foreign Secretary Eden and experts from the Foreign Office. This solution is roughly divided into the following two items: ㊀ A temporary plan will be adopted for maritime monitoring of Spain, in which naval vessels from Britain and France will patrol all Spanish waters, and observers from Germany and Italy will monitor on board the vessels; ㊁ A concrete plan will be stipulated for future implementation. The details of this plan are unknown, but it roughly advocates the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries within Spain, or the recognition of the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups. Cabinet members related to national defense also gathered at the Prime Minister's Office today to study whether it is feasible to allow observers from Germany and Italy to board British naval vessels participating in the monitoring. Semi-official sources are still pessimistic, fearing that Germany and Italy will not accept either of the above two plans. If so, the non-intervention measures will inevitably collapse completely. In that case, it is still hoped that all countries will at least respect the ban on volunteers traveling to Spain. If foreign volunteers continue to enter Spain in large numbers, international conflict will inevitably escalate, and the future is extremely dangerous. (Central News Agency, 12th)

[London] The Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to meet on Friday, at which time the British government will report on its efforts to find a solution to the impasse in the Spanish maritime monitoring plan. When members of the House of Commons asked about this issue at today's meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the government is well aware of the difficulties in handling this matter and the urgency of the issue, and will naturally fulfill its responsibilities as quickly and seriously as possible. The government is currently actively engaged in the necessary work on the report. The Foreign Secretary then referred to the French government's announcement that it would suspend all facilities currently provided to foreign observers stationed on the French-Spanish border from tomorrow unless the monitoring of the Portuguese border is restored to its previous state, saying that he had heard that the observers would still be allowed to remain in place, and that all relevant French orders would remain in effect. Members also asked about the nature of the proposals that Britain intends to put forward at the Non-Intervention Committee meeting on Friday, but the Foreign Secretary declined to disclose them in advance. The Foreign Secretary also answered other questions about the Spanish Civil War, saying that he is well aware of the importance of non-Spanish volunteers withdrawing from Spain and establishing fair air and sea monitoring. The Foreign Secretary also replied that the British consul would return to Bilbao as soon as possible, and that an official had already gone there to take over the consulate and all documents. The Foreign Secretary concluded by mentioning the mining industry in Bilbao, saying that to his knowledge, General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist forces, and representatives of the British companies involved had not yet begun negotiations. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 12th)

⊙ Bobigny, France After the international monitoring measures currently in place on the border between France and Spain were suspended from noon today, the monitoring director, Danish Colonel Lund, and all the monitors have withdrawn to this place to await further orders. The monitoring work they left behind will be taken over by French personnel, and the border between France and Spain will continue to be blockaded. (Havas, Central News Agency, 13th)

⊙ Darbo, France Danish Colonel Lund, the director of international monitoring on the border between France and Spain, has informed all neutral country monitors to prepare to leave their assigned monitoring locations by noon tomorrow. (Central News Agency, 12th)

[Paris] The Prefect of the French Pyrenees province received instructions from the Ministry of the Interior today to take over the monitoring work on the French-Spanish border at noon tomorrow. At the same time, international monitoring personnel will cease to perform their duties. According to well-informed sources in France, the takeover of the monitoring work by French officials does not mean the cessation of the monitoring work. The execution of the monitoring work will be as strict as before. (National Haitong Telegram, 12th)

[Berlin] French Ambassador to Germany François-Poncet visited Foreign Minister Neurath this morning, informing him that German newspapers often publish distorted or even completely inaccurate French official news, which is very harmful, and requested that the German government pay attention to this matter. Regarding the French government's decision to suspend the monitoring measures on the border between France and Spain, the German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur recently published a fragmented version of the communique issued by the French government, with numerous errors. Although a correction was requested, it had no effect. The French Ambassador raised this issue today. (Central News Agency, 12th)

[London] General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist forces, previously issued a note which was forwarded to the British government by the Portuguese government. The note expressed concern about the political nature of Italian aid to the Nationalist forces and stated that the Nationalist government was willing to conclude an agreement with Britain to obtain financial and economic assistance from Britain. However, General Franco subsequently issued another note to the governments of various countries, including Britain, stating that if the countries do not recognize the Nationalist government as a belligerent group, they will impose economic retaliation on these countries in the future. The wording of these two notes is contradictory, and British government officials are puzzled. Spanish sources here believe that after the first note from General Franco to the British government was issued, it was learned by the German and Italian governments, which then exerted strong pressure on the Nationalist government, ordering it not to get close to Britain again. Therefore, General Franco issued the second note to clarify his position. Spanish sources further believe that General Franco had no choice but to comply with the wishes of Germany and Italy and issue threats to various countries. From this, it can be seen to what extent the Nationalist government relies on Germany and Italy, and the plight of General Franco in seeking to change his policy and maintain a more independent position can also be seen.

### The Socialist Party Continues its Congress

Debating Policy

⊙Marseille. The Socialist Party's National Congress continued this afternoon. Léon Blum, the leader of the left-wing revolutionary faction, delivered a speech, severely criticizing the actions of the former Blum cabinet. He stated that although the previous cabinet possessed patience and skillful tactics, it was still insufficient to curb speculative activities. The enemies engaged in speculative manipulation still exist. If we want to curb such behavior now, it cannot be achieved solely through parliamentary struggle; it requires the action of the masses. Blum then listed various instances of the former Blum cabinet "capitulating to capitalists," saying that Blum himself once claimed that if he had requested full financial powers from the parliament at the beginning of his administration in June 1936, the Senate would definitely have approved it. However, as a result, Blum was unwilling to seek assistance from the people's will to fight, and only used his skills in the parliament's lounge, achieving nothing. Blum finally requested that all Socialist Party cabinet members withdraw from the Chautemps Cabinet, so that they could fully agree with the General Confederation of Labor, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Communist Party to form a fighting cabinet with the Socialist Party as the main body. Subsequently, State Councillor Blum delivered a speech amidst the cheers of the attending representatives, recalling the situation when he took office a year ago, and said, "I do not consider myself a failure at present. After we took office, we deeply changed the lives of the people, increased general purchasing power, and brought the national economy to the point of recovery." Speaking of the Spanish issue, he said that he was responsible for promoting the non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War. The reason why the Spanish Civil War did not transform into a pan-European war was due to the non-intervention policy. "Even regarding the bombing of the German cruiser Deutschland, if there had been no non-intervention policy, dangerous consequences might have occurred. In short, freedom is by no means guaranteed by war." "Now that Germany and Italy have withdrawn from the naval surveillance plan, France has entered the most dangerous zone, but France also has interests vital to its survival that should be protected." Finally, regarding the Senate issue, he said that the election methods for the House of Representatives and the Senate are different, but their powers are equal. The coexistence of the two houses is very obstructive. Moreover, no constitution in any country grants the Senate such absolute veto power as France. The Socialist Party should now study the constitutional issue of the Senate's existence." Blum's speech lasted two and a half hours before it ended. All the representatives in the hall cheered enthusiastically for him. (Central News Agency, Havas, 13th)

### A Glimpse Between Lugou Bridge and Wanping After the Twenty-Ninth Army Accepted the Order to Resist the Enemy

Japanese Soldiers' Fierce Flames Soar, Massacring Civilians Everywhere. Wanping is Under Strict Guard, and Our Army's Morale is Strong.

Beijing Correspondence, late on the 7th, the Japanese army suddenly bombarded Lugou Bridge, and our Twenty-Ninth Army rose up to resist for legitimate defense. The fighting temporarily ceased only at 4 p.m. on the 8th. Both sides suffered casualties, and farmers in Dajing Village were brutally massacred by the Japanese army. After the ceasefire, the reporter specially drove out of Zhangyi Gate to inspect the Lugou Bridge and Wanping area. Gunfire was heard from time to time halfway there. When arriving at Wanping, the city gate was tightly closed, filled with sandbags inside, and our soldiers were on strict guard on the city wall, with high morale. The reporter asked the guards on the city wall outside the city about the method of entering the city. According to the soldiers, the north gate could not be opened, and only the east gate might be passable, but there were many enemy soldiers in the southeast corner, and accidents might inevitably occur. In order to see the truth, the reporter ventured forward. Unexpectedly, just after arriving at the east of the city, several gunshots were heard. The soldiers on the city wall immediately stopped us from proceeding, saying that the Japanese army had seen you and opened fire as a warning. If you don't retreat quickly, you will be in danger. The reporter then turned back to the north gate. Gunfire continued intermittently on the way back. About half a mile from the city, I suddenly saw a military vehicle and a private car parked in the middle of the road. Five heavily armed Japanese soldiers stood on the roadside with guns. The car was carrying about forty or fifty poorly dressed Japanese and Korean plainclothes teams, holding pistols, box cannons, and rifles, ready to shoot. The reporter ordered the driver to speed past. When the car reached the railway bridge hole, I suddenly saw a rickshaw puller running wildly with the rickshaw. Blood was dripping from his thigh. He was extremely embarrassed. The reporter stopped the car and asked the reason. According to him, when he was pulling a passenger through the railway bridge hole, he did not know that pedestrians were prohibited from passing there. The Japanese army did not explain and stabbed him in the thigh with a bayonet. The wound was about three inches deep, so blood was flowing like a fountain. The injury was extremely tragic. The reporter knew that it was impossible to stay there any longer and drove quickly back to the city. Along the way, Japanese military vehicles and motorcycles came and went in an endless stream, extremely busy. In addition to a large team of Japanese troops surrounding Wanping County, a large number of Japanese soldiers transferred from Tianjin arrived in Ping on the afternoon of the 8th. At the same time, a team of Japanese soldiers from Fengtai took many heavy trucks and drove to Shagangzi, five miles from Lugou Bridge, to deploy defenses. In addition, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers in Beiping took four cars and attempted to drive to Longwang Temple from the west gate of Beiping, but were stopped by our army and returned to Beiping. At about 11 a.m. on the 8th, a soldier of ours was stabbed to death with a bayonet by a Japanese sentry at Lugou Bridge Station. Now, in addition to the strict guard by our military police inside Zhangyi Gate, there are also troops stationed and sentries deployed outside the city and in nearby areas. Pedestrians have disappeared from the highway and railway near Zhangyi Gate and Wulidian. Only a row of armed police patrols back and forth. Japanese soldiers are stationed everywhere near Lugou Bridge. Plainclothes Japanese people in groups of three or five are scattered in moats and low-lying areas, with extremely fierce faces. Japanese soldiers often go out to search and arrest farmers, forcing them to build fortifications and transport supplies and ammunition. If they are slightly dissatisfied, they will be killed. The Japanese army in Lugou Bridge and other places is well-prepared, and its armed strength is very strong. In addition, there are more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, most of whom are wearing plain clothes, scattered in the farmland near Wanping, using sorghum and rice fields as cover, and arbitrarily shooting at passers-by. More than a dozen sentries are stationed at the Lugou Bridge iron bridge. All pedestrians going west are blocked and returned. At nine o'clock in the morning on the 8th, a shoemaker who was passing by was also killed by a Japanese soldier with a bayonet. After the conflict temporarily stopped, we checked inside Wanping City and found that more than 50 soldiers and civilians were killed, and more than 60 were injured. The Japanese are still deploying troops to reinforce. Our loyal and brave soldiers of the Twenty-Ninth Army are also determined to continue fighting bravely to defend the territory when all hope of peace is lost. (9th)

### Northeast Foreign Trade Statistics for June

Import Surplus Exceeded 24.9 Million Yuan. Japanese Goods' Dumping in the Northeast Greatly Expands.

Dalian Correspondence, according to the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry's announcement, the Northeast foreign trade statistics for June of this year are as follows (unit: thousand yuan):

Exports 48,889

Imports 73,793

Total 122,682

Import Surplus 24,904

The above exports decreased by 7.24 million compared with the previous month. Although the exports of special products decreased during the summer off-season, they increased by 13.3 million compared with the same period last year. If the cumulative amount since January is 35.27 million, it exceeds the cumulative export amount of the same period last year by about 8.6 million. However, the imports are even more vigorous, increasing by 13.4 million compared with the same period last year. If the cumulative import amount since January reaches 40.67 million, the cumulative import surplus is 54 million. Furthermore, the exports to Japan in June were 23.48 million, accounting for 48% of the total exports, while the imports were 54.07 million, accounting for 75% of the total imports. It can be seen that the dumping power of Japanese goods in the Northeast has expanded.

### Shandong Province Establishes Cotton Planting Guidance Institute

Drafting a Six-Year Plan to Improve Cotton Production Throughout the Province. Production and Income Will Increase Sharply in Five Years.

Jinan Correspondence. The Construction Department of the Shandong Provincial Government has established the Shandong Provincial Cotton Planting Guidance Institute to improve cotton planting technology and increase cotton production income in Shandong Province. Hu Changzhun has been appointed as the director of the institute, which was officially established on June 1st and started working. The institute has now set up American cotton original seed fields in five counties including Shanghe and cooperative breeding fields in four counties including Qidong. Two instructors have been assigned to each field and have gone to the respective counties to conduct trials. To understand its work situation, the reporter specially visited Hu Changzhun, the director of the institute. The following is a record of his conversation.

Cotton Seed Improvement

According to Director Hu, the institute was preparing in April and officially established on June 1st. Regarding the improvement of cotton seeds, it is planned to implement it for six years. The first year is for the cotton field, with the cotton improvement field supplying 15,000 jin of cotton seeds. The second year is for the original seed field, that is, the seeds supplied by the cotton field are transported to various cotton-producing counties and distributed to cotton farmers for trial planting, and personnel are sent to provide guidance at any time. The third year is for the cooperative breeding field, that is, the seeds supplied by the original seed field are gradually promoted in the counties. The fourth year is for the purebred area, which can be planted in designated areas in each county to become a purebred area. In the fifth year, the cotton seeds can be handed over to the joint society or cotton farmers to promote planting in several areas. In the sixth year, enough seeds will be collected to supply the entire county, and the cotton quality of the entire county or province will be unified.

Guidance and Promotion

After its establishment, the institute immediately set up American cotton original seed fields and cooperative breeding fields in various cotton-producing counties. ① American cotton original seed fields were set up in five counties including Shanghe, Bin County, Gaotang, Xiajin, and Guantao. They have now reached the second year of the cotton seed improvement program. All the required cotton seeds are supplied by the cotton improvement field. ② Cooperative breeding fields are being trialled in four counties including Linqing, Qiuxian, Huimin, and Qidong. All four counties have trialled up to the third year of the cotton seed program. It is expected that in five or six years, not only will the cotton yield of farmers increase and the quality improve, but also the quality of cotton on the market will be standardized.

Cotton Insect Control

The Construction Department believes that if there is a prolonged drought in late June and early July every year, cotton seedlings are prone to aphids, so it has specially cooperated with the Central Cotton Production Improvement Society to prevent and control them. This year, trials are being conducted in ten counties including Linqing, Xiajin, Gaotang, Tangyi, Shanghe, Huimin, Bin County, Putai, and Boxing. Two to three instructors are assigned to each county, and twenty demonstration fields are set up, with instructors guiding farmers in prevention and control. Each county is also issued a certain number of sprayers by the Construction Department, and the agents are supplied by the joint societies. The application methods are divided into two types: ① spraying method, ② dipping method. The agents are also divided into two types: ① cotton oil emulsion, the composition of which is a mixture of water, alkali, and extracted oil liquid, costing about three cents per mu; ② cotton oil soap, which is a mixture of water and cotton seed oil residue, costing only two cents per mu. The prevention and control results are very good, and the future promotion will definitely be effective. (8th)

Clerk Drowned While Swimming

Wang Fengzhou, a clerk of the County Education Bureau, went to the river under the suspension bridge outside the four gates at about 6 p.m. on the 12th with four colleagues to swim and relieve the heat. However, because the water was very deep there, Wang swam to the other side after entering the water, and when he returned to the center of the river, he was exhausted and sank into the water. Although his four colleagues wanted to enter the water to rescue him, they were all not good at swimming, so he tragically drowned.

Over a hundred representatives from various industries attended. Luo Qinghua was publicly elected as chairman to report on the recent situation in North China.

The soldiers on the front lines share the same hatred and resist the war to the death, finally causing the × invaders to be defeated and our territory to remain intact.

### Ambassador Xu Decides to Depart for Japan on the 17th

Because of the Lugou Bridge Incident, He Resolves to Return to His Post for the Sake of the Country

Ambassador Xu Shiying, stationed in Japan for many years, has dedicated himself to national affairs, working tirelessly and fulfilling his mission without failing. He has become ill from overwork and suffers from acute otitis media. The illness was not mild, and he only recovered after three months of treatment. However, due to his advanced age and prolonged illness, he has not yet regained his health and is still under medical care every day. He has repeatedly and earnestly resigned to the central government, but they have repeatedly comforted him and asked him to stay. Xu felt that his physical condition was too weak to cope with the arduous work, and he reiterated his request. However, recently, the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred. Xu was deeply concerned due to his responsibilities. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, he was filled with patriotic feelings and worried day and night. He specially sent the embassy secretary, Huang Bodu, to Beijing to inquire about the recent situation in North China from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and seek instructions on everything. He received a reply from President Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang, stating that the relationship between China and Japan was tense and relied on his talents to mediate. They urged Ambassador Xu to cancel his resignation and return to his post immediately. Social opinion also hoped that he would continue to take on the difficult situation. Xu is physically weak, old, and has not yet recovered from his illness. He is truly unable to cope with the arduous work. However, considering the situation and the importance of national affairs, at this time of crisis, it is time to serve the country. He disregards his own health and resolves to obey the order to return to Japan as soon as possible. President Chiang and Minister Wang sent telegrams of praise and urged him to leave immediately on the previous two days. He originally planned to leave immediately, but the nearest ship to Japan was the President Coolidge of the Da Lai Company on the night of the 16th. He will take that ship and depart on the 17th. He plans to land in Kobe and immediately take a train to Tokyo. However, as the departure is too rushed, there are still official matters to be handled in the country. It is said that Secretary Huang will be left in the country to expedite the remaining matters and will take the next ship to Japan.

### Grain Trade Groups in This City Prevent Grain Supplies from Aiding the Enemy

Japanese Purchase Rice and Wheat for Export from Our Country's Production Areas; Also Order Two Million Dan of Foreign Rice from Siam

Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, national sentiment has been aroused throughout the country. Telegrams have been sent to the central government and various generals in North China, urging them to defend the national territory. The Grain Trade Association of this city, considering that the situation is tense, is concerned that unscrupulous members of the industry may supply the enemy with grain, affecting the people's food supply. They have scheduled a general meeting to discuss strict prevention measures. The details are as follows:

Goods Such as Dalian Products Continue to be Exported

Large quantities of grain, such as rice and wheat, are packaged and exported from this city to Dalian, Taiwan, and other places every day. Although most of it is supplied to overseas Chinese in those areas for food, a portion is still secretly purchased by the Japanese. Since the Japanese army provoked the Lugou Bridge Incident in North China, merchants from Dalian and Taiwan stationed in Shanghai have been actively ordering rice and grain in Shanghai. They are also purchasing directly from the rice-producing areas of Huzhou and Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province under the guise of experts, shipping them to Shanghai, and then transferring them to merchant ships of a certain country for export. The amount is more than it was last month.

Preventing Members of the Trade from Supplying Grain to the Enemy

The Grain Trade Association, at this critical time of national crisis, is deeply concerned that unscrupulous members of the industry may disregard national interests and seize the opportunity to make profits by supplying grain to the enemy, which is a betrayal of their patriotic duty. Therefore, they are implementing prevention measures and have scheduled a special meeting of all members and merchants in the city this week to discuss strict prevention measures. At the same time, they will handle city-wide grain statistics and re-export inspections. They have concrete plans to balance market prices during emergencies.

Siam Rice Shipments to Japan Increase Sharply

Japan's plan to implement special policies in North China is a long-standing ambition. The outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident was preceded by years of military food preparations. According to reporters from the Ta Kung Pao, the Japanese, in addition to secretly purchasing rice and wheat from rice-producing provinces in our country, have also ordered large quantities of Siam rice from Siam for shipment to Japan, amounting to more than two million dan. This grain is said to be for military purposes.

Large Shipments of Grain to the North Temporarily Suspended

Reporters for this newspaper have learned that since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the shipping industry in Shanghai has been severely affected on the Beiyang route. Last Saturday, a large amount of flour and grain was still being shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin. Since the beginning of the week (i.e., the 12th), the Beiyang gangs of various merchants in Shanghai have stopped trading due to the intermittent military conflict in the north and the obstruction of transportation. In addition to suspending the shipment of goods, the large amount of flour and huge amounts of grain that had already been reported for shipment have also been suspended as of yesterday. According to people in the Beiyang shipping business, the amount of wheat flour and grain purchased in Shanghai by Tianjin and other places is enormous. The value of the goods waiting to be shipped is estimated at 1 to 3 million yuan. Now, due to the deteriorating situation, the wheat flour and miscellaneous grains have been telegraphed to Shanghai to be temporarily stored in Shanghai until the situation improves before deciding whether to ship them. Also, the shipment of goods from Shanghai to Yantai, Qingdao, and other places has declined sharply since yesterday. The Beiyang shipping business of the six companies has been severely affected. However, the transportation of goods in the Yangtze River and South China regions has not been significantly affected at present. However, various customs declaration agencies have agreed with various merchants that, during this serious national crisis, they will agree that all goods reported for shipment by Chinese people will be loaded onto Chinese ships, regardless of whether foreign ships offer lower freight rates. It has also been agreed to persuade Chinese people to take Chinese ships in the future to show their sincerity in protecting the country.

### American Ships Dismiss Chinese Crew Members for Repatriation

First Batch Expected to Arrive Within a Week; Those Dismissed Are All from Guangdong

All the Chinese crew members on the three ships, such as cooks, servants, stokers, and sailors, totaling one hundred and dozens, have been dismissed. According to the company, the Chinese crew members of the Generals Sherman and Lee ships have been sent to Shanghai by the United States and will be transferred to Hong Kong (because most are from Guangdong) for disbandment within a week. The Chinese crew members of the General Pershing will arrive in Shanghai next month. In addition, the Chinese crew members dismissed from various ships of the Da Lai Shipping Company are said to be on their way and will also be sent to Hong Kong for disbandment.

### Kong Xiangxi and Chen Shaokuan Will Return to China Ahead of Schedule

Scheduled to Leave the United States for Europe Today for a Short Rest; Expected to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of Next Month or Early September

Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was dispatched as a special envoy for the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor. After being abroad for several months, he originally planned to return to China in November. However, in view of the outbreak of war in the north and the increasing national crisis, he has decided to return ahead of schedule. According to sources from the Central Bank, Kong is scheduled to leave the United States for Europe today. It is estimated that he will arrive in Germany in eleven days and stay there for about three or four weeks for a short rest. Then, he will return to China immediately and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of next month or early September.

### Security in This City Not a Concern

Ample Arrangements and Preparations in Place; Traffic Between Shanghai and Beiping Still Obstructed

After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people in this city is extremely high. Reporters from the Shenzhou News Agency interviewed those responsible for the security of this city. They said that amid the serious situation in North China, various aspects of this city have inevitably become slightly more tense. However, the authorities have made ample arrangements and preparations for the security of this city and can guarantee that there is no cause for concern. In addition, the traffic between this city and Beiping, the Shanghai-Beiping military and China airlines are still terminated in Tianjin. Before the situation changes, there is no certainty of reaching it in the near future. However, telecommunications and traffic are still smooth and have not been affected.

### Mass Resignation of All Workers at Hengfengyong Carpet Factory

Refusal to Resume Work Unless Arrested Workers Are Released; Wages Settled and Departure from Factory Yesterday

The Hengfengyong Carpet Factory at 2452 Jilu Road, Xuhui, is a leading name in China's handmade carpet industry, boasting top-notch internal equipment in Shanghai. The factory's hundred-plus workers, mostly apprentices, enjoyed harmonious labor-management relations and fair treatment. Not affiliated with any labor union, the workers, on the 7th of this month, used the pretext of celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government to request a day off. The factory, stating it hadn't received orders from authorities, couldn't independently grant the holiday. Management's dissuasion proved futile, and the information was reported to the business department. Assistant Manager Zhou Youliang and Director Liu Huashan rushed to the scene, declaring the holiday unnecessary and repeatedly urging workers to work. Unexpectedly, the workers used iron rulers, wooden sticks, and other implements to severely injure Zhou and Liu. The workers then guarded the front and back factory gates and the telephone. Later, an employee managed to escape and reported to the Jinjiqiao and Xuhui police stations, who dispatched officers to escort the injured to Zhongshan Hospital and detain eight workers for instigating the violence. After investigation, the court ordered bail pending trial. The Xuhui police station, led by Inspector Guan, earnestly persuaded the workers to resume work, but they stubbornly refused and remained in the factory. The nearby Garrison Command, aware of the large number of workers and fearing disruption to local order, dispatched Section Chief Li and eight soldiers to monitor the factory and instruct the workers to resume work, but they were ignored. Subsequently, workers Song Hekun, Wang Guiyuan, Zuo Cunfan, Xu Ximeng, Wang Tingzhen, Liu Xuezhi, Cao Baoling, Mao Yangui, Cheng Naigui, Qiu Yusheng, Guo Jinhai, Fang Qiandao, Liu Decheng, and Huang Yiyun, fourteen in total, were detained and sent to the Command. The afternoon before yesterday, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, Dai Jun, went to inquire about the incident. The Command also sent Deputy Officer Tan to mediate the resumption of work. The 78 workers remaining in the factory unanimously insisted that they would not resume work until the arrested workers were released on bail and applied to voluntarily leave the factory on the spot. After repeated persuasion proved fruitless, the factory settled the workers' wages at around 5 PM, paying them by name before they departed. When the reporter visited yesterday, Factory Director Wang stated that the workers' lack of knowledge made them easily manipulated, and he deeply regretted that such a minor incident had escalated into such a major disturbance. He then led a tour of the factory, where most work had ceased except for a few apprentices still working.

The Shanghai society's yarn exchange manipulation and speculation frenzy, since the order to transfer Tax Bureau Chief Wu Qiding and Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Unified Tax Bureau Chief Mai Shengxian, suspected of manipulation, to the First Special District Local Court for violating the Literary Exchange Regulations and parts of the Criminal Law, has been meticulously investigated by Prosecutor Song Genshan of the court. Initially, the court scheduled the third interrogation for this Thursday. Recently, it was heard that the court, for some reason, decided to postpone it by one day and scheduled it for 9 AM on the 16th in the court's Fifth Civil Chamber to continue the interrogation. The summonses have also been issued. It is heard that the important new witnesses summoned this time include Yu Qiaqing and four or five others, while three or four old witnesses have been re-summoned, totaling seven or eight people. The defendants Wu and Sheng will also surrender themselves. In addition, President Jiang, in order to thoroughly investigate the matter, had previously telegraphed Shanghai Local Association President Du Yuesheng, business elder Yu Qiaqing, China Farmers Bank General Manager Ye Zhuotang, and Exchange Chairman Mu Ouchu to Lushan for consultation. Now, Du and others have returned to Shanghai after completing their public duties. According to Yu, "This trip to Lushan lasted three days, and I had two meetings with President Jiang. However, due to Jiang's busy schedule, the meetings only lasted ten minutes or so. The report on the Shanghai yarn craze concluded that the focus should be on evidence, and the entire matter should be transferred to the judicial organs for investigation according to the law. However, it is not appropriate to make public statements before the investigation is completed." Currently, Mu Ouchu is still in Lushan. The news report that he returned to Shanghai with us is incorrect. As for Wu Ruiyuan and Xu Maochang being summoned to Lushan, it was to inquire about the names of the clients represented by these brokers.

### Active Implementation of Epidemic Prevention Movement in This City

Mosquitoes and Gnats Rampant, Many People Suffering from Malaria; Mosquito Eradication Work Especially Tense

The epidemic prevention movement in this city is still being actively implemented. Due to the increasing number of malaria cases caused by mosquitoes and gnats, both the Chinese and Concession health organizations have organized mosquito eradication teams to eliminate the problem. The details are as follows:

Epidemic Prevention Injections

According to a message from the Zhabei Health Office yesterday, epidemic prevention injections for residents of shantytowns in the northern district of Shanghai are being actively carried out with increased personnel. Injections in rural areas have also begun. The injections for third and fourth class train passengers are progressing satisfactorily due to the assistance of the health departments of the two railway administrations.

Inspection of Ships

The Wusong Quarantine Hospital of the Seaport Quarantine Office has also opened in anticipation of the summer season, paying particular attention to imported ships that require quarantine inspection. Therefore, both sea and land defenses can be considered thorough. According to the Seaport Quarantine Office, as of now, no cases of cholera have been discovered in any ports nationwide, and Shanghai is especially peaceful.

Mosquito Eradication Work

This summer, mosquitoes and gnats are still rampant in the Public Concession area, as evidenced by the large number of malaria patients attending the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. Therefore, the work of the Health Department's mosquito eradication team is extremely tense, but it is difficult to completely eradicate the problem. In the urban area, the Municipal Health Bureau has also organized mosquito and fly eradication teams to work in Chanchuan and other areas in western Shanghai.

### Fatal Mistake of Using Cigarette Ash to Treat Diarrhea

Huang Tianxi Dies Tragically

Huang Tianxi, a young man from Shaoxing, 21 years old, worked in the Chinese Concession and was currently employed at the Kang Yutang Chinese pharmacy at 51 Notre Dame Road in the French Concession. Recently, he suffered from diarrhea for four days. Unable to find relief after taking medicine, he felt at 10 PM on the 12th that consuming opium ash would cure his illness and stop the diarrhea. Unexpectedly, he overdosed, leading to poisoning. At 7 AM yesterday morning, a roommate, Yu Zhicheng (29 years old, from Suzhou), discovered him and informed his colleagues in the store. After deliberation, they sent him to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haige Road. However, his organs were already severely poisoned, and rescue efforts were unsuccessful. He died one hour after admission, at 8:30 AM. The hospital reported the incident to the French Concession police as usual. The Fuxu Police Station dispatched detectives to investigate and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary for autopsy, pending a request to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for examination. The deceased's family is still in their hometown of Shaoxing. The store has telegraphed them to come to Shanghai to claim the body for burial.

### Drowning While Retrieving a Jar

Tragic Death by Drowning

In Youchetou, the fourth bao of Beiqiao Town in the third district of Shanghai County, near the Zhugang River, about a mile from Yutangbei, lived Xu Ada, 37 years old, a farmer. The day before yesterday (the 9th), at 4 PM, the neighboring Weng family had immersed several pig feed jars on the stone bridge in the river to wash them. Later, the tide came and the water rose, carrying the jars northward about thirty feet away. Ada happened to see them by the river and tried to retrieve them with his hoe, but the handle was too short. Forgetting that he was not a skilled swimmer, he jumped into the water to retrieve them. The pig feed jars were swept away and sank into the river, which was deep and flowing rapidly. Ada also lost his footing and drowned. After a while, he floated up and down in the river. A grass cutter saw this and, realizing something was wrong, rushed over and jumped into the water to try to save him, but was unable to. He frantically shouted for help, and the family used a boat to pull him out from the reeds not far away. His limbs were limp like cotton. He had already died. Cries of mourning arose, a truly tragic sight. It is said that Ada's wife is only 27 years old, has no sons, and has three daughters. The family is not wealthy and depends on Ada to support them. Now he has lost his life over a pig feed jar, pitiable and lamentable.

Extremely Noteworthy to Foreigners

The Dalong Iron Factory has been established for 36 years, specializing in textile machinery. At the Municipal Government's 10th Anniversary Industrial Exhibition, Dalong also displayed its self-made textile machine. The structure is exquisite, and the operation is accurate. Compared to imported goods, it is not inferior in any way. Furthermore, the entire process from self-made spinning to finished cloth demonstrates innovation and is captivating. Smith, the head of the Ewo Yarns Factory, also visited yesterday and carefully examined each machine, paying close attention. It is truly unexpected that China's Dalong Factory has such excellent products. This proves that Dalong's various products can indeed compete with those of Europe and America, and it can dispel the long-standing prejudice of foreigners against China as an industrially backward country.

After Lin apologized verbally and dispersed, Lin went to urinate in the Hehefang alley. Cheng Tiantian, accompanied by her brother Cheng Jingfa, followed him and apprehended him, accusing Lin of being the robber in the Fu Wenhao home robbery case. They took him to the police station, who transferred him to the Second Special Court, where he was prosecuted according to law. The plaintiff Fu Wenhao entrusted lawyer Wen Chao to act as her agent and filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting recovery of the stolen goods worth over 4,000 yuan. However, the defendant Lin Chuanyao denied being the robber during the trial, stating that on the day of the robbery, he was staying at the home of Bai Wenwei, a member of the Central Committee in Nanjing, and requested that the Bai residence be investigated. The court sent a letter to the Nanjing court for investigation during the rescheduled hearing. According to the reply, Lin did indeed stay there.

### Suzhou House Selling Scam Five or Six Years Ago

Rent Uncollectible After Paying for the House; Chance Encounter with the Con Man Leads to Arrest and Prosecution

Cao Zhiji, a Ningbo native and manager of China Huacheng Tobacco Company, 50 years old, met Pan Luhe (31 years old this year), a Suzhou native, at a friend's banquet in a brothel before 1936. At the time, Pan impersonated a member of the Pan clan, a prominent family in Suzhou. Cao believed him and frequented his company, gradually becoming close friends. Later, Pan falsely claimed to have real estate in Suzhou in a certain location and intended to sell it. Cao, who was planning to buy property in Suzhou, heard that Pan had property for sale and readily agreed, willing to pay a good price. Pan then arranged for Cao to go to Suzhou to inspect the property. After agreeing on a price of over 30,000 yuan, they came to Shanghai together, booked a room at the Far Eastern Hotel, and signed a sales contract. After paying the contract price, Cao went to Suzhou a month later to collect rent from the existing tenants, but they all refused, stating that the property had never been sold. Only then did Cao realize he had been deceived. He searched for Pan Luhe in Suzhou and Shanghai to reason with him, but to no avail, and the matter dragged on for five or six years. Unexpectedly, as the saying goes, "One may search far and wide, but the answer is right under one's nose." For the past five or six years, Cao had been searching for Pan's whereabouts daily. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, at about 5 PM, Cao happened to meet Pan Luhe face to face at the intersection of the West Water and Fire Street on Avenue Edward VII. He immediately grabbed Pan, called the police, and took him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. Judge Chen Shuoying reviewed the case with the police lawyer Chen Ming, requesting a postponement of the investigation. The plaintiff Cao Zhiqing (who walks with a cane because his left foot was run over by a streetcar) also appeared in court to describe the entire process of being deceived by the defendant. The court questioned the defendant and scheduled another hearing for the 20th. The defendant was remanded into custody.

### Wife Wants to Work in a Factory, Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium

Li Changgen (46 years old), a visitor from elsewhere, lives at No. 8, Yuhou Lane, Xuegong Street, near the People's Education Center inside the Old West Gate, and his wife, Zhu (28 years old), were initially deeply in love. However, in recent years, Li Changgen lost his job, and the family was destitute. Therefore, Zhu wanted to work in a factory, but Li Changgen was stubborn and believed that if his wife entered a factory, she would be influenced by the environment and become infatuated, leading to a change of heart. Therefore, he forbade his wife from working. However, Zhu felt that rather than starve to death, she would rather find another way to survive. Li Changgen was both saddened and angered, and at 1 PM the day before yesterday, he swallowed opium and committed suicide. No one knew at the time, and he became a wronged spirit. When the roommate found out, he reported it to the Wenmiao Road Police Station. In addition to detaining and questioning Zhu, the local bailiff Jiang Pingyang was ordered yesterday to report to the local court for examination. The assigned Prosecutor Wang and others arrived at the scene to examine the body and confirmed that the death was due to poisoning. They ordered the body to be collected and await further review.

### Taxi Driver Cui Jiajun Sued by Mistress for Abduction

Cui Jiajun, a Yancheng native and driver for Xiang Sheng Taxi Company (27 years old), already had a wife at home. However, he liked to philander, and four years ago, he met Xu Jinmei (currently 22 years old), a woman from Pudong, by chance and fell in love with her. They cohabitated, and the taxi driver actually enjoyed the blessings of two wives. Unexpectedly, the beautiful scene did not last. Xu Jinmei had a falling out with him and hired a lawyer to sue Cui in local court for seduction and abuse, stating that the plaintiff was promised marriage by the defendant Cui Jiajun in 1933, seduced, and then sexually assaulted. They lived at No. 1, Lane 147, Tiantong Road, for four years. Although she had repeatedly urged him, he had not held a wedding ceremony. However, the defendant was associated with hoodlums and often extorted money and pawned clothing from the plaintiff for his own extravagance. Recently, seeing that the plaintiff's savings were exhausted, his attitude suddenly changed. If she slightly displeased him, he would resort to violence. On the night of June 26 of this year, the defendant again became angry when his demands for money from the plaintiff were not met and locked the door, physically assaulting the plaintiff. The next day, he held a hard piece of wood as a weapon and wanted to beat her again. The plaintiff, fearing for her life, had no choice but to escape through the back door and take refuge with relatives. She requested that he be punished under Article 298 of the Criminal Law. At the hearing yesterday, Judge Bai, the plaintiff Xu Jinmei stated, "I originally had a fiancé. I worked behind Huanlong Road, and he would park his taxi there every day and often flirt with me, and I got to know him. He lied to me that he didn't have a wife, so we had a relationship. Later, after moving to his house, I found out that he already had a wife. But it had already come to this, so I had no choice but to cohabitate. Unexpectedly, he used the money I earned and used it. The other day, because he wanted to ask me for my ring, and I refused, he beat me," etc. Cui Jiajun stated, "I have a wife, and she is my mistress of four years. She lives with my parents and wife and has not been abused. What she said is a lie." After hearing the arguments, the court concluded the trial and will announce the verdict on the 17th.

### Grave Robbing Defendant Feels Sentence Too Light; Original Plaintiff Files Appeal

The ancestral grave of Shi Qixiang, a local gentleman from Tieyi, Caohejing, Shanghai West, was previously dug up by Shi Baisheng from the same clan, in collusion with Yi Haiyun, Xu Wennan, and others, who privately exhumed the remains and sold the bricks. After repeated investigations by the court, they were found guilty, and Shi Baisheng was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, while Yi and Xu were each sentenced to one year imprisonment. They are currently awaiting execution. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the plaintiff, based on the law, believes the sentence is too lenient and has filed an appeal with the original court prosecutor, stating that the deceased ancestor in the case is a direct senior relative of the plaintiff and also a direct blood relative of the defendants. According to Article 249, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime carries a sentence of imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years. Furthermore, Article 250 of the same law stipulates that if the crime is committed against a direct blood senior relative, the sentence should be increased by one-half. Additionally, Article 56 of the same law stipulates that if multiple actions constitute the same crime, the sentence may also be increased by one-half. However, the Criminal Court of Your esteemed court only sentenced the defendant to the minimum of two years and six months imprisonment, which is considered too lenient in light of the circumstances. Even the one-year imprisonment imposed on Yi Haiyun and Xu Wennan is considered insufficient, etc. (omitted below)

### Forced to Sign Contract Allowing Concubine; Xu Xuetang Assaults Wife

Ignoring Fifteen Years of Marital Relationship; Police Prosecution Fines Fifty Dollars

Xu Xuetang, a native of Ningbo and the 33-year-old factory director of the Wei Yi Wool Textile Factory located at 769 Niuzhuang Road, was apprenticed to the Wansheng Chang Foreign Goods Store established by Li Yongyang on Nanxun Road in his youth. Because of his excellent performance, he gained Li Yongyang's trust, who believed that Xu had great potential and betrothed his daughter Xiuyun (now 35 years old) to Xu. They were married fifteen years ago. Xu then left Wansheng Chang and founded the Wei Yi Textile Factory, from which he prospered. The Wei Yi factory is located on Zhoujiazui Road, while Niuzhuang Road serves as the wholesale office. Xu and Li Xiuyun also resided in the wholesale office. For fifteen years, the couple lived harmoniously and peacefully, and had three sons and one daughter. However, recently, Xu began to frequent prostitutes and became entangled with Xuehua Laoer, a prostitute in Huiyao Lane. He now intends to take the prostitute as a concubine and live with her and Li. He immediately discussed this with Li, who refused. On the 20th of last month, at around 1:00 AM, Xu suddenly forced Li to sign a contract allowing him to take a concubine. When Li firmly refused, Xu became enraged and severely beat her. Around 3:00 AM, he again assaulted her. Li sustained injuries to her chest, arms, and other parts of her body. She reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station. Hua Kongmu Lang Jintang and Detective Zhang Keqin investigated the case and sent Li to Guangren Hospital for examination, which confirmed her injuries. Li then, accompanied by lawyer Liang Bohua, went to Guangren Hospital for another examination, and the hospital issued an injury certificate. The police station immediately requested a summons from the Special First Court. Xu Xuetang was summoned to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning, where the case was tried by clerk Zhan Fengqi. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case and prosecuted Xu for the crime of assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Law. Li Xiuyun then recounted the details of the assault and presented a photograph of the defendant and Xuehua Laoer as evidence. When questioned, Xu Xuetang confessed that the incident was caused by Li's gambling habit, as she did not return home until 3:00 AM that night. He questioned her, which led to the conflict, but he denied injuring her. He also attacked Li for forming sworn sisterhoods, and for worshiping "old men." He hired Fan Gang as his defense lawyer. After reviewing the testimonies, clerk Zhan sentenced Xu Xuetang to a fine of fifty dollars for injuring another person.

The rogue Li A'gen, on the day of King George VI's coronation on May 12 of this year, took advantage of the overcrowded conditions near the Yu Qiaqing Road Xiaoyao Ballroom to drag Chen Feifei, a woman traveling in a rickshaw, out of the rickshaw. He tore off Chen's clothes completely and injured her genitals and buttocks with his hands. At the same time, Chen's wallet was also stolen.

Li appealed the verdict to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, criminal judge Shan Yuhua, along with judges Xiao and Nie, presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Li vehemently protested his innocence and requested that the original verdict be overturned and that he be declared not guilty. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu argued that Li's actions were extremely vile and that the original trial had been lenient by not prosecuting him for robbery and forcible indecency. Therefore, the appellant's appeal was without merit and should be rejected. Prosecutor Lin Woming also determined that Li's actions were unforgivable. Judge Yu then declared the hearing closed and scheduled a date for the verdict to be announced.

In order to promote rural industry and develop the national economy, the Xiaoxian County Government has been using the county's surplus grapes to produce grape wine and brandy for many years. The wine was shipped to Beijing for sale during the National Handicraft Products Exhibition last month and was praised throughout the capital in one month. According to factory director Wang Xueqin, the county uses fresh, pure juice extracted from the county's abundant grapes, hires agricultural product manufacturing experts, and uses scientific equipment for processing and brewing. It has been chemically tested by academic and health organizations and found to be of excellent quality, far superior to imported products. However, during the initial sales period, in order to promote the widespread recognition of domestic grape wine by the Chinese people and to capture the market and curb outflow, although the quality is far superior to imported products, the selling price is less than one-fourth of theirs. However, due to cost considerations, it must be slightly higher than the chemically produced fake wine mixed with impurities sold on the market. In order to actively promote sales, the factory has established a Shanghai office at No. 44 Yongping Lane, Maigen Road.

### He Tianjian Returns to Shanghai with Honors

The calligrapher He Tianjian recently held an exhibition of his works in Tianjin and Beijing, which was well received by organizations in both cities. Institutions such as the National Academy of Art, the Relics Exhibition Hall, the National Calligraphy Research Institute, the Chinese Calligraphy Research Association, the Jinghua Academy of Fine Arts, as well as many celebrities, praised him unanimously, and competed to acquire his works. He returned with honors this time, reportedly reaping both fame and fortune, a rare achievement.

### Medical Community

▲ Recent Situation of Diagnosis and Treatment at the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital on Yuchai Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Hongkou District, has continued to operate since June 15, providing diagnosis, treatment, and medication day and night, and hospitalization is free of charge. In less than a month, more than 6,900 patients have sought treatment. The most common illness is enteritis, followed by indigestion and dysentery. The hospital was founded by local gentlemen and merchants such as Zhu Jing'an and has been operating diligently for ten years. The area near the hospital is mostly inhabited by the working class, who lack basic sanitation knowledge. During the summer and autumn seasons, epidemics are frequent. The hospital arose in response to the needs of the time and has greatly benefited the local community.

▲ Renowned Doctor Chen Zhongping Currently Serves as Professor at the Chinese Medical College Chen Zhongping, an expert in internal medicine and surgery from Haimen, Jiangsu, has been practicing medicine for ten years and has saved countless lives. Recently, to commemorate his tenth anniversary in Shanghai, residents such as Zhang Shaoling specially presented him with a plaque inscribed with "Penetrating Insight" by Wu Kaixian, and Ambassador Xu Shiying also presented him with the four characters "Benevolent Art Benefits the World," which is sufficient to demonstrate Chen's reputation.

▲ Branches of the Chinese Medical Journal Society are Being Established Everywhere The Chinese Medical Journal Society at No. 30, Lane 830, Beijing Road, is run by renowned doctor Tang Jifu. The Chinese Medical Monthly published by the society has been well-received by readers since its inception due to its rich content, concise language, innovative scholarship, and timely information, which are unmatched by any previous Chinese medicine publications. Subscriptions have been very popular in recent days. The annual subscription price is only two yuan, and during the anniversary period, there is still a 10% discount, with half-year subscriptions costing only one yuan. The society welcomes the establishment of branches everywhere. Branches have already been established in Suzhou, Rugao, Yuhang, Liyang, Danyang, Bengbu, and dozens of other places in Shanghai, such as Caojiadu and Nanshi. Dozens of other locations, such as Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Longyan in Southeast Asia, are actively preparing and will be established soon.

### Mr. Huang Yingbai and "Greater Shanghai" (Continued)

— Jiu Zhai

Mr. Huang was a deeply thoughtful and far-sighted statesman. His patriotism was more fervent than ordinary people, and his concern for the country was deeper and more far-reaching. He recognized the facts, did not sing empty high-sounding tunes, and strived to overcome difficulties with his own strength. This was Mr. Huang's consistent spirit throughout his life. His purpose in building Greater Shanghai gave us concrete proof. We praise Mr. Huang's Greater Shanghai plan, and we should not forget his intention and spirit. As for the municipal government organization established by Mr. Huang, what is particularly worth mentioning is the adoption of the spirit of the American manager system, and the implementation of the bureau-level administration system. The bureau-level administration system has now been promoted throughout the country. Everyone believes that it is sufficient to select talents and fully give them the benefit of administrative power, without interfering with the mayor's progress or retreat. However, at that time, it may not have been understood by the general public. The press often thought that the scale was too large and the cost was too high, and expressed expectations. However, Mr. Yingbai resolutely resisted public opinion and resolutely implemented it. In his conversation with the second mayor, Mr. Zhang Boxuan, he once said, "When we legislate and implement policies, we will exhaust our wisdom to decide on them, then we will be brave enough to go to them, and finally we will persevere to complete them. If we do what is right, what can we do with floating words? There will be facts as the answer in the future.” Yes, there are already good facts as answers now.

Regarding Mr. Yingbai's spirit of impartiality in using people and identifying true talents at that time, it is best for us to objectively cite the narratives of those who experienced it personally to replace the explanation. Mr. Huang Boqiao said, "The bureaus of the Shanghai Special Municipality were all newly created. The mayor never recommended a single person from the secretary department head down to hundreds of employees. Each bureau chief was fully authorized to select employees. My public utility bureau was like this, and so were other bureaus. This was true for bureau chiefs who had been with the gentleman for many years, and also for those who had just met him." In his article "Thinking of Mr. Yingbai When I First Met Him," Mr. Pan Gongzhan said, "I was moved by him and unconsciously offered to say, "I am willing to draft an organizational outline for Mr. Huang's Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and at the same time write a plan for handling labor administration, as a contribution to Mr. Huang's creation of my country's first special municipality.” He also smiled and encouraged me to draft it, so I said goodbye to him and started writing to fulfill this promise. However, I didn’t expect that Mr. Yingbai would later be ordered to serve as the mayor one day, and entrusted me, who had no administrative experience and had no deep friendship with him, to take charge of the affairs of the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce..."

Finally, let us quote Mr. Shen Chang’s words to prove Mr. Yingbai’s hard work and precision in handling affairs at that time. Mr. Shen said, “I have known Mr. Huang for eight years... and those who were his colleagues were only in the Shanghai Municipal Government, for less than three months. Mr. Huang was busy with government affairs, with no time to spare, and I was a subordinate, but he would personally read and approve the official documents I drafted, and even point out the errors in the copy of a word, and told me, "To handle a case, you must first carefully read the old documents to understand its origin and end; to draft a manuscript, you must be complete from beginning to end, with clear and thorough regulations...”

The above briefly describes Mr. Huang Yingbai’s creations and administration when he was the mayor of Shanghai, but it only lists a few things, and there are many omissions, but this alone is worthy of our commemoration and admiration. (The above-quoted statements from various sources, except for Mr. Huang’s own speeches, are all taken from "Remembrances of Old Friends of Mr. Huang Yingbai" (The End)

Short Biographies of Historical Figures

### A Word for the Patriotic Chinese with Blood in Their Veins

— Shou Juan

What makes a human a human is the blood coursing through their veins. Without that blood, we are merely walking corpses, no longer deserving the name of human.

I ask myself, and I ask the people of this nation: Do we have blood in our veins? Can we truly call ourselves human? When they broke one of our legs, we bore the pain, content to hobble along on crutches. When they twisted one of our arms, we endured the suffering, content to bandage it up and move on. We have always swallowed our pride, yielded ground step by step. Where is the blood in that? Where is the humanity?

And so they come again, extending their iron-fisted hands to grasp our throats, to end our very lives. We have reached the precipice of life and death; there is no more ground to yield, no more suffering to endure.

Hear me, patriotic Chinese with blood in your veins! Lugou Bridge is not only the tomb of a contingent of the Twenty-Ninth Army; it is the tomb of the entire Chinese nation. We must defend Lugou Bridge with iron and blood; we must defend all of China with iron and blood.

### Revolutionary Pioneer Shen Xingchu

— Chen Jianxia

Ever since Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Revive China Society, its revolutionary comrades secretly spread propaganda and worked to connect with one another. Though my hometown was but a small township, its enlightened citizens were active participants in the movement, and my teacher, Mr. Shen Xingchu, stood out among them. He had been inculcating revolutionary ideals since the last years of the Guangxu reign. As the Qing court first proposed abolishing the imperial examination system, Mr. Shen, though a graduate of the Imperial Academy, took the lead in establishing schools and promoting modern learning. He cut off his queue long before it became fashionable. The social atmosphere was extremely restrictive at the time, and people met his actions with mockery, but Mr. Shen paid them no mind. Whenever the school held gatherings, Mr. Shen would seize the opportunity to take the stage and deliver speeches promoting his revolutionary cause, making the overthrow of the Qing dynasty his mission. His words flowed like a river, without any regard for the consequences, and listeners were deeply moved. Mr. Shen had a limp in one leg, yet he moved with incredible speed, traveling between Shanghai and Hangzhou, befriending local comrades in order to carry out his long-held beliefs. Among those who associated with him at the time were Ye Chucang, Chen Taoyi, and Chu Fucheng, all stalwarts of the revolutionary alliance. Mr. Shen's eloquence and literary talent were especially admired by his peers. Mr. Shen's nickname was Shouping, and when someone asked him what it meant, he replied, "Don't you know that I have a limp? Those with a limp walk with unsteady steps, and it is difficult to hold a bottle steady. I wish to steadfastly guard my bottle, so that it will not break even if it is knocked over!" Those who heard it burst into laughter. Such was his sense of humor. Later, he served as director of local administration, but was resented by the ignorant populace over a trivial matter. They not only destroyed the school he had founded, but also surrounded and brutally murdered him in front of the county government office. Under the Qing legal system, the punishment for mass killings could not be reduced. Therefore, the perpetrators were not brought to justice until after the revolution. Mr. Shen, however, did not live to see the realization of the revolution, and must have carried his resentment with him to the afterlife! I imagine that among the officials in the current national government there must be no small number of Mr. Shen's old acquaintances. As they read this article, I wonder if they can still recall his life and attest to the truth of my words!

### Zhang Zhijiang Gets Up Early

— Xuewen

Mr. Zhang Zhijiang is currently in Nanjing. In addition to serving as the director of the Central Guoshu Institute, he also runs a National Physical Education School, where he serves as the principal. The school is located at the foot of Zijin Mountain, in a tranquil and picturesque environment. The school buildings and facilities are also quite "good," and there are plans for further expansion.

Although Mr. Zhang is an elder statesman, his physical strength and spirited expression are not inferior to those of strong young men. As long as you see his loud voice and lively gestures when he lectures, you can't help but admire his spirit of "getting stronger as you get older"!

No one who has heard him speak doesn't laugh. His tone is always so humorous, and he stretches his fists and bends his palms. Someone said, "Mr. Zhang is also boxing while he is lecturing"!

He gets up very early every day, reportedly at four o'clock in the morning, and practices boxing outside. Sometimes the students haven't gotten out of bed yet, and he's already in the car.

### Replacing the Nest, Luan and Phoenix

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 15 (News Inquires in the Southern City, Yun Chuang Speaks of Dreams, Elegant Farewell from the Seat, Return Carriage from the Brothel Alley)

Madam Zhang said: "Is there any mother who doesn't love her own son? Especially since my situation is quite different from others." Youmei nodded and said, "Auntie is right. But if cousin is so uncomfortable, we can't let him go on like this, can we?" Madam Zhang said: "That's true. I plan to ask him for details when he wakes up today. Liu Ma, go see if the young master is awake yet. Just say we have a guest." Youmei stood up, shook both hands with Madam Zhang, and smiled: "If cousin is still drunk and hasn't woken up, let him rest a little longer." Madam Zhang laughed and said: "Miss Li, you are very clever. You're afraid I'll scold him in front of you, which would be too embarrassing for him. Of course, I will also save him some face and not talk about him in front of guests. It's a pity he doesn't have an old friend like you, who is often around." Youmei lowered her eyelids, looked at the copper brazier under the old lady's feet, bit her lower lip, and pondered for a while. Then she smiled and said: "Cousin also has several like-minded friends in literature, right?" Madam Zhang didn't mind her demeanor and replied: "He wouldn't. If he did, he would definitely tell that like-minded friend about his troubles and ask him to find a solution. Don't think that just because he's unwilling to tell his mother, he's unwilling to tell his friends. Those are two different things. Telling me will not only fail to alleviate his worries, but may also cause me to worry along with him. As for like-minded friends, that's not the case. Even if they can't think of an idea, they won't be too anxious for their friend." Youmei took a lidded bowl of tea from the tea table, held it with both hands, took a sip, and slowly put it down. She smiled and said: "Perhaps his like-minded friends can't think of a solution either." Madam Zhang said: "Of course, he's not stupid. Just because he doesn't have a solution doesn't mean someone else will. It's just that a good friend, seeing him in this dissolute state, would definitely try to persuade him. He doesn't have anyone to advise him now, because he doesn't have any good friends." Youmei nodded: "Yes, generally speaking, cousin has become so dissolute… Ah! I'm just talking nonsense. Actually, I haven't seen him do anything terrible, so how can I say he's dissolute? Getting drunk after drinking a few cups of wine is common for scholars." Madam Zhang, hearing her words, also smiled slightly: It seemed the old lady had suddenly discovered something and was about to examine it, scrutinizing Youmei from head to toe. Youmei, seeing the old lady scrutinizing her for no reason, didn't understand the reason for her observation. She lowered her head, smiling slightly, but two patches of peach-colored blush flew onto her cheeks. She looked at the ground and drew with her toe on the floor. (196)

### National Hero "Three Rivers Good"

— Ze Cheng

Some people have become famous through newspaper publicity, making them known to everyone. But there are also heroes who have been buried because they are not good at publicity. Here, I would like to introduce a not-so-famous national hero, "Three Rivers Good," whose real name is Luo Mingxing.

Luo is from Fan County, Shandong Province. His hometown is near Liangshan. Is it possible that he received the endowment that the so-called Yan and Zhao region has many generous and tragic heroes? When he was fourteen or fifteen years old, his hometown suffered a famine, so he went outside the border to make a living, and then joined Zhang Zuoxiang's army as a soldier. By 1929, he was already a battalion commander. After the "September 18th" Incident, anyone with a bit of spirit couldn't stand the trampling of iron hooves and rose up to shout and resist. Luo then led his troops and raised the banner of revolt. Soon, many people responded to him. This would certainly provoke the hatred of traitors and enemies, so they mobilized a large army to suppress him. His resistance was really strong. It is said that he experienced more than fifty battles. Although he sometimes lost, his troops made the enemy and traitor armies exhausted.

Last year, he was seriously injured and returned to the country. On the one hand, it was for treatment, and on the other hand, to see the domestic situation. At that time, I was working as an editor at a newspaper in Shandong. Through a friend's introduction, I met this national hero. His quick wit and strong physique really made you shout, "His reputation is well-deserved!" Later, we became very good friends. Once, he cried and said to me, "Mr. ×: I have been inside the border for almost a year. Although I always think about my brothers outside the border, I can't do anything. In Nanjing and Beiping, I have met many military and political leaders, and I have also met many anti-Japanese predecessors in Shanghai, such as Li Du and Wang Delin, but… but…" Luo was choked with sobs.

Once, he suddenly ran to my house very happily and told me: "In five days, I will go to Xi'an to meet with Young Marshal Zhang and a few friends from the Northeast Army. I will probably be back in half a month, but I will not come here. I may go directly outside the border. I am here to say goodbye now. I hope we will meet again soon in the recovered lost territories." Hearing this, I was sad, but also happy.

However, things rarely go as planned. On the third day of his speech, news of the Xi'an Incident reached Shandong. Luo took a large roll of newspapers and found me at home, saying bluntly, "I didn't expect Young Marshal Zhang to cause such a stir. It's all over! Please draft a telegram for Zhang. Perhaps it may have some effect…" I was equally indignant, so I quickly picked up a pen to write. At this time, I asked him what to say. He replied very simply: "Tell Young Marshal Zhang: You have already thrown 30 million people in Guandong into the fire. Can you bear to throw 400 million people across the country into the fire?" What powerful tone was that! So I drafted the manuscript according to this meaning and sent it.

Soon after, I left Shandong. Two weeks ago, I received a letter from Luo from the Northeast, and I knew that he had gone outside the border again. In my heart, I will never forget this person. Yes, this is a national hero worthy of admiration, this is a real man who can stand up!

### Lin Zexu's Views on Foot Binding

— Hua Ling

A few days ago, I went to visit my friend Min Jun's relatives on business. At that time, Min Jun was drying books in the courtyard, among which were two exquisitely decorated volumes, titled "Lai Hong Ji," which were the letters left by his ancestors of three or four generations. Min Jun's family has been scholarly for generations, and his great-grandfathers for three generations all worked as private secretaries, so in his "Lai Hong Ji," the manuscripts of famous figures of the Qing Dynasty accounted for three or four tenths.

According to my friend, he had a glimpse of the outline of them six or seven years ago. One of the letters was from Lin Zexu to Min Jun's maternal grandfather. It is said that Min Jun's maternal grandfather happened to be working as a private secretary at Lin's place during the Opium War and was highly valued by Lin. Later, Lin was demoted, so he left to go elsewhere. The letter was written by Lin to his maternal grandfather during his demoted life after the Opium War, discussing women's foot-binding at length. The whole letter was more than 5,000 words long, written on extremely rough mulberry paper, in a cursive Ouyang style, but with three parts Liu style bones.

Although my friend was unable to see the whole picture at the time, he had secretly memorized one or two of Lin's views on foot-binding. The first paragraph stated that there must be mothers with natural feet in order to have tall and strong sons. Although it did not explicitly say that the demise of the Ming Dynasty was due to the Manchus not binding their feet, thus having strong warriors, this meaning was already clearly on the paper in the words and lines. Then, it went on to describe how the Jiangzhe soldiers were afraid of fighting to the death during the Opium War, and blamed it on the small feet of the defending generals' mothers, saying that the sons born from mothers who swayed with every step could not be entrusted with the important task of defending the country. Following this, the letter used the Japanese pirates as an example, saying that the Ming Dynasty's inability to invade the country was due to the resistance of farmers everywhere, and that the farmers were rarely born from mothers with bound feet, so they were so brave and unafraid of death.

Such remarks, when viewed today, naturally seem a bit strange, but seventy or eighty years ago, Duke Lin had already seen the need to reform the practice of foot-binding, and his outstanding vision was very admirable.

### Chairman Lin's Frugal Life

— Ya Fei

Among the important figures of the current National Government, we know that there are two with beautiful beards, one is the President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, and the other is our Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen. Although Chairman Lin is already in his seventies, his spirit is still very vigorous. The foot-long silver beard reflects his half-bald forehead, further enhancing his gentle and kind attitude. So fluttering, he really has the air of a divine immortal with crane hair and childlike face!

He was originally from Minhou, Fujian. In his early years, for the sake of revolution, he followed the late Premier, running north and south throughout his life. He has had few opportunities to return to his hometown. However, he has been to the islands of the South Seas several times, and the overseas Chinese in the South Seas have a deep faith in him. Even six or seven years ago, when he was elected as the successor Chairman of the National Government, he was still inspecting overseas Chinese affairs in the South Seas.

However, he is able to maintain such a strong physique at such an advanced age entirely due to his regular and cultivated daily life. Naturally, rich nutrition is also a major reason. For example, he drinks a cup of young chicken juice every day, which has never been interrupted for decades, because he often says: The effect of young chicken juice is great. The effect of one cup of young chicken juice is at least better than ten doses of ordinary tonics. He also firmly believes in traditional Chinese medicine, saying that it is the quintessence of the country and should be protected and improved. When the Chinese and Western medical circles were fighting a trend a few years ago, he and legislator Jiao Yitang did their best to protect Chinese medicine, so that Chinese medicine could be preserved.

Regardless of whether the weather is cold or warm, he always gets up very early every day. After getting up, he drinks a cup of young chicken juice, then goes out for a walk to breathe fresh air. Whether he is at home or abroad, he is very fond of simplicity and cleanliness: Sometimes he wears a cloth robe, puts on a pair of cloth shoes, and strolls leisurely. I believe that if people who don't know him see him, they will definitely not know that he is the current Chairman of the National Government, but will think that he is an old scholar!

People say that he is a people-oriented chairman. It's really not an exaggeration, because not only are his clothes simple, but his daily life is even more frugal. His words and deeds are especially worthy of our admiration. Logically speaking, he is the highest head of the National Government, and his life, whether it be in terms of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, should be very luxurious. But in fact, his life is not even as comfortable as that of a bureau chief or section chief.

Chairman Lin also has a private residence in Shanghai, which is in an alley on Jin Shenfu Road. It is a three-story Cantonese-style building with a monthly rent of only fifty or sixty yuan: Compared to the fact that an average person's garage could occupy three or four tenths of a floor, there is a vast difference. As for his official residence as Chairman of the National Government in Nanjing, that is naturally an exception.

When he is in Shanghai, if he occasionally goes out, he does not have his own car. Even if he is going to visit friends far away or has something to do, he calls an hourly car from a nearby car rental company.

He currently does not have a wife, and his sons and daughters-in-law are not by his side. In this mansion in Shanghai, there is only a cook couple in their forties who also take on the job of guarding the house.

In addition, the chairman also loves antiques and calligraphy and paintings. Now, in his mansion, there are many ancient books, antiques, and other curiosities. He himself has told people that he has a strong ability to identify antiques. Whether it is the Book of Han or the Book of Tang, as long as he identifies them, the authenticity can be immediately distinguished. When he arrives in Shanghai, he always likes to walk alone to the City God Temple in his spare time, pick up old books at the old book stalls, or look at curiosities in the antique shops, so he has almost become a regular customer of the antique shops in the City God Temple. Naturally, everyone recognizes him as the Chairman of the National Government, so they often raise the prices higher, but his bargaining skills are also quite good. After the price is negotiated and the goods are checked, he orders someone from the shop to send them, but he strolls home across the Nine-Turn Bridge and only pays when the boy delivers the goods.

Sometimes, if his clothes are a little damaged, he asks someone to repair them before wearing them again. And he often tells young people: "Our country has become so poor, we can only save a little to cultivate national strength…"

Now, he has served as Chairman of the National Government for the third term. Several times when he was elected, he repeatedly tried to humbly decline, but all parties believed that he was old and respected, and there was really no one more suitable than him, so in the end, he was still made the Chairman of the National Government this time.

Talk

### Oath

— Wu Cun

To gain people's trust in doing things, the best way is naturally to prove it with facts. But this requires really doing it, which is very laborious. A simpler method is to swear an oath, using a few passionate and bloody words to express one's feelings.

Village women love to curse people, and they are also good at swearing oaths. When arguing with someone, if there is something to explain, they raise one hand to the sky, point their finger, and say: "Heaven is above, if this matter is like this, I will surely be struck by lightning; otherwise, those who wrong me will not have a good death!"

But the blue sky has nothing to do with people. It never cares about right and wrong in the world. Once the oath is sworn, the matter is over.

The listeners also listen and forget. They will never believe it.

Modern men and women in love, after hugging and kissing in private, say: "My love, we must love each other forever, until the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, and the heavens collapse and the earth splits!" This is called "solemn vows." But the seas don't run dry, the rocks don't crumble, and when the excitement is over, everyone can break up and find another object to love and swear oaths to.

I once read in some notebook, probably written by a former Qing Dynasty loyalist, a story like this:

It is said that a wealthy young man was infatuated with a prostitute. The young master was determined to marry her, and the girl could not live without marrying him. The young master made up his mind and went home to "negotiate," asking his father to fulfill their marriage. Before leaving, they swore oaths to each other, and the woman even asked for an object from his body as a token. As a result, he painfully sacrificed and knocked out a tooth. Who knew that after returning home, the old master firmly refused, saying that prostitutes would not have true love, and that he might as well pretend to be poor and see how she treated him. So the young master obeyed, not shaving for three months and not washing for ten months. After making himself look embarrassed, he went to see his mistress. As a result, the prostitute ignored him. The young master was so angry that he trembled and wanted to get back the tooth he had knocked out himself. Okay, if you want it back, here it is. The prostitute brought it out. There were so many teeth in the box. She said, "That one is yours. Find it yourself."

This article is probably to advise people not to talk about love with prostitutes, or even to advise people not to visit brothels. But from this we can know that there are actually people in the world who make swearing oaths their profession.

In recent years, as I have gained more experience in life, I have less and less respect for those passionate oaths. What "swear to resist the enemy to the death," what "swear not to make a treaty under the city," it really makes the people feel cool all over, feeling that our nation is about to be saved. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, the oath-taker is smiling and drinking champagne again, signing some kind of "agreement" with others.

After the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, morale was high, and we heard the calls of "swear not to…" again. But, how disappointing. I was reminded of my experiences listening to oaths in the past.

I hope that the curse is effective, and that the soldiers fighting the enemy in North China will no longer waste their oaths under the influence of "friendly diplomacy." Amitabha!

### Old Liu's Story

— Especially

It was the deep autumn sky. Patches of cotton wool cloud streamed across the empty wilderness. The tree leaves had withered and turned yellow, and with the howling of the northern wind and sand, lashed upon the paper windows of other people. Whenever it came to times like this, Old Liu began to walk onto tragic years.

His age was beyond sixty years. His face was filled with a white beard, fluttering about, and atop his head, one could not count out one hundred to ten strands of hair. His leg was a bit crippled. A walking cane had become a constant companion. But if there were children who tumbled before his feet, he would regardless of his cripple quickly hug them. He would not be anxious. Ignorant children did not care about these things, and when happy, would casually knock twice upon his bald head. Sometimes when it was knocked heavily, he would use his left hand tightly to cover his head, and his right hand supported that walking cane tottering about as he left. He was also fond of drinking two cups, but from drinking, one could see the signs of the transition of the years. In the spring and autumn weather, two cups with every meal, and in the summer then changes to morning and night, like now this time of late autumn, the whole bottle of burning liquor becomes an unparalleled grace.

He worked as a senior clerk, (or gatekeeper), at this guild hall, sinking foot for over twenty years. At that time, he was young, with ardent feelings, and seeing injustice along the road, he could “draw out a knife to assist.” At that time, the imperial examinations had not yet been abolished, and the guild hall was specially equipped for the fellow townsmen who were taking the exams. Women were not allowed inside, and many outside vagabonds were frustrated and made squealing cries. Whenever there was any free time, they would concentrate their words in the group of women, and would not avoid it because of their own status. But what about now? The guild hall was filled with some family members, and the houses were crooked and out of shape and nothing like they once were. There were no public funds, and who would be willing to empty out their pockets to do it?

Speaking of this guild hall, it was quite a bit small, the two black lacquered doors were standing with a pair of stone lions, the gatekeeper's lodge where Old Liu lived was a continuous two large rooms, and behind that was a large courtyard with five courtyards, from the main hall of the hall that branched into two branches, to the west was the rear courtyard, where there was a small side door leading to the alley, and to the south was a passageway that led directly to the "watchtower." In the middle of the passageway, there was also a toilet, and the two large locust trees inside tightly covered the roof ridge of the hall, like a pergola. The watchtower was more than twice as high as the hall, and standing on the building could overlook the entire guild hall. In the past, it was said that guards were also stationed on the building to prevent unexpected events, but now, although the bunker-like watchtower was in disrepair and the guards were no longer present, the responsibility of striking the night watch every night has been on Old Liu's shoulders for more than twenty years.

Outside the watchtower was a desolate black kiln factory, and as soon as it got dark, traces of people were cut off. The cold weather was even more desolate and terrifying. The street lights were hung far away, and the lights were green. The police during the day had already withdrawn from their posts. Occasionally, the sharp sound of selling "fried bean noodle balls" swept across the sky, which could make you shudder and allow you to understand what a terrible scene was behind the sound. At the bottom of the watchtower was a small door that had been locked for a long time. It was said that many scholars who could not "pass the exam" committed suicide inside and were all buried inside, and therefore, the guild hall never enjoyed peace.

When nothing was happening, Old Liu also liked to chat with us nonsense. He said that due to his many years of experience, he had heard many ghost sounds, but no one had ever seen what ghosts looked like. If he really encountered one, his life would definitely not be safe. Old Liu was afraid of this, but he couldn't help but work, so he used burning liquor to ignite the flames in his stomach, drinking until his eyes turned red. In this way, braving the night wind, he scattered the cursed ghosts with a burst of liquor.

Most of the people living in the hall were honest people who did not ask about other people's affairs, nor did they allow other people's troubles to blow on their own heads. But these days it has changed. The manager of the hall, Master Zhang, did not know how two thick wool blankets went missing, which was simply a thunderbolt, turning all the families upside down. Master Zhang scolded the coachman, scolded the old woman, and also scolded Old Liu, saying that he was not careful in guarding the door, and let the thieves into the hall. From then on, the gate was closed earlier to prepare for unexpected events.

Four or five days passed in a hurry. This night, the moonlight was bright, as clear as a mirror. One watch had passed, and the wind was rustling the window paper, and the ceiling was also moving in a flurry. The fire in the brick pit was burning like spring. He poured the liquor for the second watch into his stomach, pinched two pieces of mutton head meat and stuffed them into his mouth, and walked along the familiar road into the passageway to the south. But for some reason, his heart was beating, as if he had lost his autonomy. He climbed up the watchtower, knocked the clapper a few times, and hurriedly walked down again. In the moonlight, he saw two gray-white things moving in the hall, moving, seemingly preparing to pounce on him directly. With a loud shout, he rolled a somersault to the ground.

The people living together surrounded him from all sides, shouting wildly. Some even took up weapons. Old Liu's face turned iron blue, his teeth were grinding loudly, and his fingers were pointing at the hall. So these people shouted again and rushed over, opened the hall door, and as a result, caught two people, one was Master Zhang's coachman, and the other was the young old woman from the rear courtyard. The two thick wool blankets that had been lost were padded under their bodies.

Finally, Old Liu peacefully left behind this long-term job and transferred it to a novice.

### Where to Go

— Shi Zhu

He wiped the large round stool used as a table with a piece of paper, then picked up the bowls and chopsticks, and looked down the staircase with his reading glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. His wife had not yet come. He paced heavily on the floor with his hands behind his back.

His five-year-old son, who was always stuck in this old attic room, probably smelled the aroma of rice in the pot:

"Daddy, my tummy hurts."

"This is hunger pains. There's rice today, we'll eat together when your mother gets off work. Don't cry."

Although he told his son not to cry, seeing his son hungry like a dried toad, he couldn't help but feel a lump in his throat. He had suffered three years of prison life, and although he had not died, his eyes had become half blind. He was only twenty-eight years old… It would have been better to die, but now he had to suffer this living hell… It had been two years since he left the reformatory. Old friends were suspicious, and new friends were… On the contrary, he had to rely entirely on his wife to work hard in the Japanese yarn factory to earn money to live. His son would definitely not be able to escape hunger in the future, but this small life… It was too tragic.

### War

After Abyssinia was propagandized with "civilization" by Italian troops using poison gas, the Soviet-made documentary "Abyssinia" was also "civilized" once in Shanghai by Italian sailors using wooden sticks and sulfur water. However, today (the 13th), I read a radio address by the Pope of Rome, the main purpose of which was to urge people to "pray for peace," saying, "The world is turbulent, the people are suffering, today's pain has not been removed, tomorrow's fear has arrived, we should appeal to God for peace for this world and for these people."

We should ask the Pope of Rome to explain in detail why the world is turbulent and why the people are suffering. Who does not want a peaceful world and a happy life?

But the people of Abyssinia are dying and wounded everywhere, and even the king has fled to another country. Whose fault is this? It feels too late for the Pope of Rome to "pray for peace" at this time!

The world is already turbulent, and the people have long been suffering. After "increasing troops," if you want to talk about "friendship," even "barbarians" understand the way of survival. The pipe dream of "praying for peace" is something only "civilized people" can think of.

To survive, one must fight! Repay those who strike with strikes!

Ah! He couldn't think, shook his head, wiped away the tear stains on his glasses, and forced himself to lean against the window to look at a patch of sky like a waterfall. The soft sunlight was melting on the smiling faces of pedestrians on the road. He looked back with a bitter face, unconsciously gazing at the long-dilapidated house, and remembered that the opium-smoking female landlord had already dismissed him this morning because he hadn't paid the rent for two months. He sighed helplessly, turned his head, and didn't want to look at anything anymore. But his dim vision fell on the bed made of wooden planks, and in the cotton wool on this bed slept a two-month-old son; he seemed to suddenly realize that he still had a son, and with a mournful "Oh," he sat down on the wooden stool like a log. His eldest son squatted there, staring at him blankly.

His wife came over with her head down. Her face was even paler today, intertwined with anger and sorrow. She swayed and fell on the bed, gasping for breath. The baby was awakened and cried hoarsely. She had to force herself to pick him up and breastfeed him, her rough hands trembling on the baby's body.

He quickly served rice and brought out the half-piece of moldy tofu left over from yesterday. Only then did the eldest child quietly climb onto the stool to eat.

"Qiuping, you should breastfeed and eat at the same time as before, or you'll be late for work again. Deduction of wages—you seem to be sick today!"

"Go to work? Alas, there's a general strike."

His whole body went numb, and his heart was pounding wildly. The couple looked at each other in pain, unable to say a word. Finally, finally, two teardrops glistened in his wife's sunken eyes.

"The workers shed sweat and blood, spinning yarn for the devils all day long, but they only give you three or four dimes. This should be a strike. This time, for everyone, I was actually an instigator—but, thinking for ourselves, we are already desperately poor, how can we not have work!"

The brave, thin woman shed two lines of tears deeply, deeply, dripping on the furry face of the baby in her arms.

His throat choked, and he couldn't say a word. The yellow rice in the bowl gradually cooled, and several flies flew from the baby's diaper and settled on it. He waved his hand subconsciously; he happened to see his son burying his head and eating desperately. Yes, he hadn't eaten rice for more than ten days. He stared at his son in a daze. The son drew two smile lines like an old man's wrinkles on his gray face:

"Dad, it's good to eat today!"

A chill ran down his spine. He suddenly ran over and kissed his son's face wildly. After a long while, he blurted out, "Child, you've really suffered!"

The room was temporarily silent. Several car horns came from the road, but the familiar long whistle of the factory that was heard every day was gone.

"What should we do now? Xiafu!" She looked at him with a pale face, raising her head.

He was extremely tired, but he held her hand tightly:

"The landlord dismissed us from the house today. What else can I say? You're really too pitiful.—Yesterday, Old Huang told me that a company wanted to find a copyist. He asked if I would go. My eyes are about to go blind, how can I go? I didn't agree to him. Now I think I have no choice but to go." He paused and put on the long gown:

"I'm going to find Old Huang. I don't know if it's too late."

His wife cried. She choked and said:

"Eat before you go..."

### Experiences in Driving

— By Yuan

㊀ Descending a Mountain: When driving down a steep and rugged mountain slope, do not be reckless and use low gear. Try to get extra braking power from the engine. Modern brakes are of great help in dangerous downhill situations.

㊁ Hold Firmly: In strong winds, hold the steering wheel firmly, especially on roads with houses or trees on the sides that suddenly disappear. Deal with situations carefully and do not be careless. When you are following other vehicles, a gust of wind can change the direction of the vehicle in front, unexpectedly causing an accident.

㊂ Nimbleness: When driving in narrow places, the more nimble you are with the steering wheel, the better. It is best to make this action a habit, especially for many new cars, which require more turns of the steering wheel. Many drivers waste valuable time and space because they turn the steering wheel too slowly.

㊃ Do Not Dust: People often use a dry duster to clean dust from cars. This easily damages the paint. It is best to use water to clean the car body to avoid accidental damage.

㊄ Gasoline Consumption: Unless a very long distance is traveled, tests of gasoline consumption often mislead us. Road conditions, average speed, and climate all affect the test results. If we want to get accurate figures, we cannot rely on the gasoline gauge. Even gasoline pumps are sometimes inaccurate. Therefore, it is most reliable to measure gasoline from the fuel tank with an accurate dipstick.

㊅ Easy Steering: If the pressure in the front tires is two pounds higher than usual, it will not harm the tires and can make heavy steering relatively easy.

㊆ Foggy Shadows: When following other vehicles on foggy nights, it is best to turn off our own headlights. Otherwise, a dark shadow will appear in front of the vehicle in front, making the situation doubly dangerous.

㊇ Seize Opportunities: Do not rush ourselves. If we are eager to reach our destination, do not create opportunities where there are none. Only take advantage of existing opportunities. Recklessness is a major cause of delay.

㊈ Understand the Route First: Study the map carefully if we are going to an unfamiliar place. Know the route first and then drive according to it. Hesitation along the way wastes time, and hesitant people often get lost.

㊉ Smooth Braking: The technique of smooth braking is easy to learn with frequent practice. This allows the car to be driven safely on slippery roads. The method of rapid use of the pedal is, of course, different. However, attention must be paid to the extent to which the pedal is used. Complete success also depends on whether the brake can be operated easily. Because of this, if the brake drums are scratched, they should be removed for correction, and damaged linings should be replaced.

㊉㊀ Oversized Tires: If we decide to install an oversized tire, we must consult the tire manufacturer. They have expert knowledge and experience in installing tires, so we can trust them to know all the hidden difficulties. In addition to the question of whether the oversized tire is properly installed on the wheel rim, the tire must also undergo additional clearance. Because adding some weight can sometimes cause the front wheels to wobble.

㊉㊁ Stable Parking: When changing wheels, if the car body is not equipped with a permanent jack, we must safely lift the axle off the road with a portable jack. Then apply the handbrake to prevent the car body from rotating. The force used to loosen the bolts is great. If the car body cannot be braked properly and lifted stably, it is easy to turn.

㊉㊂ Foggy Windows: When the inside of the front window is obscured by fog, open the window or vent slightly to allow the air inside the car to circulate. A feature of car heaters is to prevent the car from getting foggy.

㊉㊃ Easy Cleaning: A car body (such as gray, except for light colors) needs to be washed less often than a dark black one. In other words, dark black car bodies must be washed frequently.

㊉㊄ Comfortable Driving: Sitting in a large car body, even at a slow speed, can be more comfortable than in a small car body on rough roads.

㊉㊅ Uncovered Trunk: A luggage trunk that is outside but has no cover and can only be accessed by reaching into the back seat is not as convenient as one with a cover. Unless it is not commonly used, it will cause us unexpected trouble.

㊉㊆ Pump Lubrication: Water pumps should always be lubricated with high-melting-point lubricating grease because this type of grease does not easily mix with water. Inferior lubricating grease will not only fail to lubricate but may also get into the cooling system.

### The Serious Problem of Automobile Accidents (Continued)

— By Yun

Education is a positive method to prevent automobile accidents. Recently, various public groups have been working hard on this matter. Moreover, what they are educating is not only limited to children but also includes adults. In the past fourteen years, due to the success of education, it has been reduced by one-fifth. The American Automobile Association, school authorities, and parent-teacher groups are working hard to carry out safety campaigns in schools. Currently, the American Automobile Association's teaching materials for training young automobile drivers have been implemented in 2,500 new high schools in New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, and Abomai. In addition, the association has organized 3,000 propaganda teams in the community to specifically promote safety campaigns. In this way, many students, approximately 7,000,000, have a great deal of basic safety knowledge.

Many municipal authorities, in order to help automobile drivers not violate regulations too often, send them to driving schools after they have committed violations to help them develop good driving habits. Chicago has already built a place specifically for drivers to practice, and many other places are following suit. All driving lessons are conducted by experts. Various agencies also often post leaflets, pictures, slogans, etc., to alert drivers.

Scientists have also invented many instruments and tools to perform various tests to accurately show all the driver's problems and habits. From then on, we can try to improve without a clue. The relationship between driving and the influence of alcohol, the dangers of speed, etc., have been analyzed very clearly. Research is also being conducted on how to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition to car factories, tire factories and oil factories are also participating in the work of safety campaigns. The transportation research departments of Harvard University and Northwestern University are both beneficial and well-known.

### 1937 is an Active Year for Mid-Priced Cars

— By Yingdai

In the American automobile industry, the year 1937 is unanimously recognized as the most active year for mid-priced cars. Indeed, the facts tell us that the recession is over. All industries have stepped onto the road to recovery. The automobile industry is, of course, no exception. Moreover, it is relatively more prosperous. There are many events that symbolize that automobile sales will continue to increase in 1937, and the numbers will exceed those of 1936. We know that, according to the statistical chart, the number of cars sold by American factories in 1936 increased by 26% compared to 1935. The general increase in national income and the improvement in packaging methods all make car owners want to buy a new car in 1937. As soon as the new cars from various factories are put into the showrooms, customers flock to them. These facts, of course, convince us that automobile sales in 1937 will increase even more than in 1936. In the current situation, the automobile industry estimates that sales this year will increase by at least 10% compared to last year. Overly optimistic people even think that it will not be less than 10%. As a result, all car factories, starting from this year, are actively expanding their operations, purchasing components, and striving to increase production by millions of vehicles. Because many orders were sent to various factories before the end of the year. Every new car is sold as soon as it is made. This situation has not been seen for many years.

The increase in the income of the American people not only makes them want to buy cars but also makes them want to buy better and more comfortable cars. Therefore, when buying a new car, they do not care if the price is higher. In 1936, the number of cars priced above US$700 increased by 42% compared to 1935, but the total number only increased by 26%. The sales of cars priced from $850 to $1,200 in 1936 increased by 95% compared to 1935. The sales of cars priced from $1,200 to $2,000 increased by 63%. As for the lowest-priced cars, they only increased by 18.3%. This trend will continue in 1937 due to the increase in national purchasing power. Indeed, national income is closely related to the automobile industry. When we think back to the year 1928-29, the total national income of the entire United States was 80 billion yuan, of which 4.1% was spent on automobiles. In 1932, income fell to 40 billion yuan. That year, only 2.4% was spent on automobiles. However, after 1932, a new trend occurred in the automobile industry, that is, the manufacture of new cars focused on improving materials and reducing prices. The average cost of a car decreased from 895 yuan in the heyday to 690 yuan in 1935. This downward trend allows the American people to purchase cars with their current income of 50 billion yuan, which is equivalent to the purchasing power of 100 billion yuan in the past. The total national income in 1935 was 56 billion yuan, and in 1936 it was 60 billion yuan. Based on this calculation, it will be 65 billion yuan in 1937, and automobile sales can increase by 35% compared to last year. However, whether this goal can be achieved, we still have to wait for the facts to prove.

### The Most Needed Skoda Cars Arrive in Shanghai

— By Fu

Skoda cars, produced by the Czech Lav Skoda automobile factory, are known worldwide for their exceptional fuel economy and high performance. They have long been popular throughout Europe. Fulin Automobile Company in this city recently recognized that highway transportation in China is becoming increasingly developed, and that low-priced cars with exceptionally high performance are especially suitable for the needs of the general public. Therefore, they contacted the Skoda factory to negotiate a sales agreement. Now, the first batch of new cars has arrived here a few days ago. What is the general situation? This is something that the automobile industry wants to know. Therefore, I am specially summarizing it as follows.

The engine of the Skoda car adopts rubber suspension and is a water-cooled four-cylinder, four-stroke type with upright valves. The actual horsepower is 22, and the rated horsepower is 10.4. The cylinder jacket is excellent. Lightweight alloy precision-made automatic heat-regulating pistons. Pressure lubrication system. Down-draft carburetor with automatic spark advance control device. Battery ignition. Electric starter. Flexible and natural single-disc clutch. Transmission integrated with the rear axle housing. Three forward speeds. The second and third gears are silent harmonic types. The drive shaft is extremely balanced regardless of whether it is moving or stationary. Four-wheel independent suspension. Mechanical four-wheel brakes and independent handbrake. The steering mechanism is excellently made and is not subject to shocks. Left-hand or right-hand drive can be installed as needed. The chassis frame is specially strong and solid. Being in the streamline steel plate body makes you feel more comfortable. Not only is its appearance beautiful, moving, noble, and magnificent. It goes without saying that driving it, no matter what the road is like, is effortless and easy to handle. And its safety and reliability are therefore unparalleled.

In addition, what is particularly worth mentioning is Skoda's special economic efficiency. Skoda's mileage per gallon of gasoline is 38 miles. The mileage per pint of engine oil is 1,420 miles. Any part of the car body, chassis frame, and machinery is made of specially selected materials and precision-made and has undergone strict inspection. Therefore, they are all excellent and durable. And the minimal repair expenses are therefore a natural result. As for its selling price, it is said that it will be cheaper than similar British and American products. Then, in terms of purchase cost, Skoda will be the most economical. Skoda has these many advantages. This is why automobile industry experts in this city generally recognize it as the most needed low-priced car and predict that it will definitely cause a sensation in the entire automobile industry and be enthusiastically welcomed by the general public.

In America, the Highway Safety Movement (Y.) puts up signs that mean, "Welcome, fool. Try to die sooner." It is a wake-up call for reckless drivers.

### The Relationship Between Automobiles and Agriculture - A Farmer's Confession

— By Ying

In the past few years, a recession has been evident in rural areas of England and America. Therefore, those farmers, facing the tragic situation of imminent bankruptcy, wanted to use the power of various automobiles to reduce the cost of agricultural products. In other words, they wanted to apply machinery more widely to rural areas, so that all agricultural products could benefit from the help of machines and the cost could be reduced. The automobile is a powerful tool for transportation. Since farmers in those countries were eager to obtain the help of machines, they naturally hoped that automobiles could also help agriculture. Therefore, in response to the needs of farmers, a type of rice-harvesting automobile began to appear. If farmers collect rice using clumsy wooden or iron vehicles, it will of course be much slower than with light and convenient automobiles.

Initially, in England, there were thirteen vehicles for collecting rice. One side was nailed to the chassis, and the other side was tied to the car body. This rice-collecting vehicle was two feet high off the ground, and the front end sloped down to the ground, forming a huge fork shape. In this way, when the rice-collecting vehicle moved forward, it automatically collected rice in the fields. Wherever the vehicle passed, every grain of rice on every stalk could be picked up by this automobile. A farmer in Philadia once wrote an article that was published in Austin Magazine. He said to us: "I really want to buy a powerful agricultural automobile with a speed of about twenty miles per hour, so that I can get a lot of effect during the rice-collecting season. This problem is very difficult, because the price of this vehicle must be low, and it must not require frequent repairs."

"But I later heard that a 1921 Austin No. 20 agricultural vehicle was for sale, thirty miles away from us. Therefore, one afternoon, I went to visit. In my mind, if this vehicle was suitable, then even if the price exceeded my limit, as long as the difference was not too great, I would buy it back and give it a try. However, what I passed through was a quiet town, (to be continued)"
