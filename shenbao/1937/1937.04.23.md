### Cheng Jingsheng Cables Shanghai to Appeal for Relief for Guizhou Disaster

Disaster Area Spreads Throughout the Province, a Living Hell; At Least One Million More Yuan Needed for Relief

[Guiyang] To the esteemed gentlemen of Shen Bao, Jingsheng was dispatched by the Executive Yuan to Guizhou to supervise disaster relief. He traveled to Guizhou Province and inspected along the way. He arrived in Guiyang on the 20th. The counties he passed through have not seen rain for months. The land is cracked, and there is no hope for the spring harvest. Disaster victims are using low-quality Guanyin powder, tree leaves, and fern roots to fill their stomachs, with sallow faces and tattered clothing. It is a living hell, too horrible to bear. Moreover, there are countless cattle being transported and driven along the roads, idling and abandoned. Agricultural work has been abandoned, and the disaster area covers almost the entire province. The most severely affected areas include 41 counties, with many people on the verge of death. Although the Central Government has allocated funds and the provincial government has implemented measures, the funds are insufficient due to the severity of the disaster. Chairman Gu and Director Cao, along with the provincial government officials, are working day and night to find solutions, sighing and looking up at the roof. Guizhou Province is located in the border region, surrounded by mountains, and has always been known for its poverty and hardship. The people are simple and honest, physically strong, brave and martial, and have a spirit of self-reliance, which is unmatched by other provinces. The provincial government has given them appropriate guidance, enabling them to deeply understand patriotism. With proper training, they will become the backbone of the country. If they are allowed to wallow in ditches and ravines and sink after the great disaster, it would be a great loss to the country. It is unbearable not only from the standpoint of compassion. With the approach of the period between the end of spring reserves and the next harvest, it is a matter of life and death. Now, a concrete plan has been agreed upon with the provincial government to expedite both emergency projects and disaster relief, and to implement grain sales. However, according to rough estimates, in addition to the already allocated public bonds, at least one million yuan in cash is needed to get started. In addition to cabling the Executive Yuan to earnestly request additional allocation, I also beseech you to think of the disaster-stricken people in the border regions and appeal on their behalf to charitable organizations and righteous people at home and abroad, begging for generous assistance. This remote county is at the foot of the mountain, and the words of the petition are filled with tears. We await your good news and beg you not to ignore our earnest prayers. Cheng Jingsheng kowtows in supplication. (Telegram on the 22nd)

### Song Zheyuan Meets with Japanese Reporters to Discuss Sino-Japanese Issues

Gradual Partial Resolution is Possible; However, National Stance Must Be Considered

[Beiping] Song Zheyuan met with Japanese reporters this afternoon, stating that China and Japan are the two major countries in East Asia and should jointly maintain the overall situation in East Asia.

It is difficult to seek a complete resolution of Sino-Japanese issues, but gradual partial resolution is possible. However, each side must consider its national stance and the opinions of its people. The Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway and the Longyan mining affairs can be carried out legally within a possible range, but only to the extent that they benefit the Central Government and the people.

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Today to Review Various Cases

[Nanjing] The Judicial Yuan previously received a petition from Shanghai accountant Li Wenjie requesting amendments to the Bankruptcy Law, adding a chapter on simple bankruptcy procedures, and establishing litigation assistance measures. After reviewing the reasons stated, they were deemed to have merit and were forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review. Now, the Legislative Yuan has instructed the Civil Law Committee to review the matter. The consensus is that the reason for including simple procedures in bankruptcy laws in various countries is that ordinary procedures are complex and not suitable for handling simple bankruptcy matters, so special procedures are established for relief. However, the provisions regarding procedures in China's Bankruptcy Law are already very simple and flexible, and they can be used effectively to achieve the purpose of swift conclusion. Moreover, the characteristics of simple bankruptcy procedures in various countries have all been considered and absorbed in the articles of China's Bankruptcy Law. Therefore, it is unanimously believed that there is no need to add a special chapter. As for the provision on establishing litigation assistance measures, China's Civil Procedure Law already has articles on litigation assistance. If the circumstances are appropriate, an application can be made to the court for a ruling, and there is no need for specific assistance measures. The above review results have been submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 33rd for review. In addition, Xu Xiaochu, an alternate executive committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, submitted a petition through the Judicial Yuan to the Legislative Yuan requesting amendments to Article 27 of the Bankruptcy Law, to restrict the creditors' meeting and to make supplementary provisions with reference to the company law's provisional resolution measures. This matter has also been reviewed by the Civil Law Committee under the Yuan's instructions and has been amended appropriately. It will be submitted to the meeting on the 23rd for review. In addition, the fifth supplementary budget for the national general and temporary revenues and expenditures for the 24th year will also be submitted to the meeting on the 23rd for review. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Unified Governance of the Yellow River in Three Provinces

Principles Agreed Upon in Beiping

[Baoding] Regarding the unified governance of the Yellow River in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, the provincial government previously sent Li Yi, director of the Police Affairs Department, to Jinan to meet with Han Fuqu and exchange views. Li then returned to Beiping with Wen Chenglie to report to Zhu Zheyuan and discuss the matter in detail in Beiping.

Beiping Correspondence
— Wei Dongming

### General Fu Zuoyi at Tsinghua

On Monday, April 11th, at the memorial week meeting from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, the lecture announcement posted the day before stated "Report by the President." However, I found a very short record in the small "Jing Bao" newspaper that day about the news of a troop movement, saying that he was coming to Beiping for social engagements and would be giving a speech at Tsinghua that morning. With some doubt, I looked through other major newspapers, but none had such news. Walking out of the reading room and passing the bulletin board, the memorial week lecture clearly still said "Report by President." With a sense of bewilderment, I returned to my room and continued writing a correspondence that urgently needed to be sent out. After writing for a while, a friend came and said that the memorial week had been temporarily changed to a lecture by General Fu Zuoyi, and the announcement had just been changed. It was already 10 o'clock, less than an hour before the memorial week. Reluctantly, I stopped writing the urgent letter and went out to look at the bulletin board. Sure enough, "Speaker" had been changed to "Mr. Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government," but the "Topic" section was left blank. Looking at my watch, there was still half an hour until 11 o'clock, so I went to Mr. Zhu Peixuan's office to request a personal favor. I mentioned in passing that General Fu was coming to the school to give a lecture. Even Mr. Zhu had not heard about it beforehand. Mr. Zhu said he would go to listen, and I said that I was going not because I wanted to see what this man of the times looked like, because I had already seen him in Suiyuan. Rather, I was emotionally willing to welcome him and listen to what he had to say. At the same time, I also wanted to see the mood of the Tsinghua students welcoming him.

Arriving at the Great Auditorium a quarter of an hour early, a third of the more than 1,500 seats were already occupied, and people were still arriving continuously. I heard that many people did not know and were coming to hear the president's report, because the president was not often at the school, and the Tsinghua president was unanimously supported by the students. Some people were saying that if the news of General Fu's lecture had been spread earlier, even people from Yenching University and the city would have come to listen specifically. In any case, after the class bell rang, people poured in and occupied almost all the seats, and there were also quite a few people in the balcony seats. After the assembly signal was blown, people continued to take their seats. After a while, Dean Pan Guangdan first accompanied General Song Zheyuan and Director Lei Sishang to come in. Some people applauded to welcome them. General Song and the others did not go to the stage, but went around to the balcony seats, so some people never knew that he would accompany General Fu. Afterwards, the president accompanied General Fu in, and a burst of enthusiastic applause rang out. Some people even stood up to welcome him. When he walked onto the stage, the applause became even louder. First, the order of the memorial week was followed, and then the president came to give an introduction. The two sentences that I remember most clearly were that the president said that the term "national hero" had been overused, but this time it was the least overused and the most appropriate to call Mr. Fu a "national hero." He also said that Mr. Fu had tried his best to avoid giving public lectures on this trip to Beiping, but because Tsinghua was outside the city and the memorial week was a gathering between teachers and students, he had agreed to give a lecture.

Amidst the standing ovation and applause, General Fu approached the lectern.

Against the backdrop of the magnificent Romanesque auditorium architecture, General Fu's towering figure was presented before the crowd. Even greater was his personality and career, which shone in the hearts of everyone. In an equally loud and clear voice, he began to speak.

He began by saying that he came to Tsinghua to pay his respects and express his gratitude to Tsinghua, because first, Tsinghua was the first to launch the Support Suiyuan Movement; second, Tsinghua organized a frontline service team to go to Suiyuan during the emergency of the war; and third, Tsinghua made 20,000 gas masks and donated them to the frontline soldiers. Coming to Tsinghua, the president asked him to give a lecture. He humbly said that he was not qualified to give a lecture and would rather sit below and listen to anyone who wanted to speak. However, he could not refuse the warm invitation, so he would just talk about what he had thought of.

I must sincerely admire General Fu's appropriate words. I turned my head to look at the expressions of each member of the audience – they were all consistent, with focused attention and a look of sincere admiration on their faces. The entire high auditorium was quiet, and General Fu's words were loud and clear.

He said that "people must insult themselves before others insult them." We are bullied because we have many shortcomings. These shortcomings are:

First, selfishness. The enemy has targeted our weaknesses, so their consistent method is to buy off individuals in order to invade China. Here, General Fu used his personal experience to illustrate, saying that the enemy's steps towards him were enticement, threats, instigation, alienation, and division, using Chinese to control Chinese. First, they used money, military supplies, land, political power, and even persuaded General Fu to become emperor in order to move him. They said that they could agree to anything for his personal sake, but they could not agree if it was for China. If enticement failed, they would increase their troops with threats, and instigate the emotions of the central and local governments, alienating the confidence between local officials. If that was not successful, they would use bandits and puppets to attack the Sui border, which was using Chinese to control Chinese. General Fu said that many internal and external troubles in China are because those in power are selfish and think about their personal rights. Therefore, selfishness is the Chinese people's own biggest enemy.

The second shortcoming is a lack of perseverance. The Chinese are intelligent enough, but lack perseverance. Therefore, small gadgets and handicrafts often have exquisite and wonderful works that make foreigners admire them; however, the world's great inventions do not come from China, because great inventions require long-term research. The enemy says that we only have five minutes of enthusiasm, so they always advance in stages, taking one step forward, stimulating us, and then waiting for the enthusiasm to cool down before taking another step. If we want to resist war and defend against insults, we must have perseverance and perseverance to succeed.

Third, a lack of unity, unable to cooperate wholeheartedly, and consistent across the country. Unity is national strength, and consistency is necessary to deal with foreign countries. The enemy has repeatedly used this weakness to cut off parts of China one by one. The enemy is very willing for China to be disunited, preferably divided into many countries, such as the South China country, the Central China country, the North China country, the Mongolian country, and the Hui country, so that they can annex them one by one.

Fourth, poverty. In China, there are few who produce and many who consume, so the people are poor and the finances are depleted, which cannot be compared to the enemy, who can move tens of millions at will to buy off Chinese people and purchase weapons. However, those Chinese who are bought off return to their own country as soon as the fighting starts, because the Chinese are, after all, Chinese. (Everyone applauded at this point.) China should strive to have more who produce and fewer who consume, because manpower is military power. Generally speaking, a country is habitually described as "rich and strong." But in the process, it is first strong and then rich. If China wants to be rich, it should first eliminate the oppression of external forces and strengthen itself first.

The fifth shortcoming is that the Chinese lack a spirit of sacrifice. Because China has been a unified country for almost several thousand years, closed off from the outside world, without foreign countries competing with us. China has long had domestic affairs but no foreign affairs, and morality and education do not advocate struggle, in order to avoid conflict with the rulers. Chinese rulers have historically promoted the idea of non-struggle, which has cultivated a habit among Chinese people of bowing their heads and yielding in times of danger, unwilling to sacrifice themselves. The enemy has seen through this point. Originally, Western foreign countries secretly expanded their military preparations and military power, but our enemy publicly publicized the strength of their military preparations and military power, and even exaggerated their words to intimidate us, so that we would be afraid to resist. Therefore, they avoided wasting their strength and won without fighting.

General Fu then summarized the shortcomings of the Chinese people again and said that most Chinese people have now awakened. In the future, we must not be selfish, we must have perseverance, we must be united as a country, and we must be willing to sacrifice. Our corpses can be slaves of a fallen country, but our people will never be slaves of a fallen country! (Everyone applauded enthusiastically here.) We must be free, independent, and equal citizens! (Everyone applauded again and again.)

After General Fu finished speaking, he turned around and sat on the far left seat in the back row of chairs. The president came up to give a reply on behalf of the entire school. He said that we do not need to thank Mr. Fu for his merits, because it is his duty as a soldier to defend the country. But we cannot but admire Mr. Fu. Speaking of admiration, it is not just the people of Tsinghua, but every citizen in China will admire him. Mr. Fu thanked us for the little work we did during the anti-Japanese war in Suiyuan. This work is what we should do. The anti-Japanese war has only come to a halt for the time being. If the anti-Japanese war in Suiyuan breaks out again in the future, I think our Tsinghua will still do everything possible to participate in the work. If the entire student body agrees with what I said, everyone will stand up again as an expression of agreement.

Everyone stood up solemnly.

In the silence, the school bell on Tudishan on the edge of the auditorium rang, reporting that the time was exactly 12:00 noon.

This hour is worth commemorating, because the impression of a great man has been engraved in the hearts of a thousand Tsinghua students.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Impartial Discussion of Labor-Management Disputes

— Li

Italy's declining national industry, although hit by foreign goods dumping and smuggled goods flooding in recent years, still retains a glimmer of life. The reason for this lies in the spirit of mutual trust, mutual understanding, and diligent cooperation between labor and management. However, recently, due to low wages and high prices, workers' incomes have decreased and expenditures have increased, making them feel doubly painful in their lives. On the industrial side, due to the bumper harvests of agricultural products in various places last year and the effectiveness of the legal tender policy, the situation has slightly improved. When labor sees that capital is making even greater profits than before, it inevitably demands increased wages and improved treatment. Therefore, strike waves in Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places are spreading more and more. Shanghai is particularly serious, and the scope is also the largest. The affected industries include important light industries such as textiles, dyeing, silk weaving, and silk reeling, as well as transportation industries such as trams and automobiles. This phenomenon is really unfortunate.

Labor and management have a direct relationship in the entire production process. If the two sides cannot cooperate and serious disputes are caused, the result will not only stop production, but also cause social unrest. It will not only plunge the national industry, which is improving, into crisis again, but also shake the internal unity of the national industry and disrupt the consistent steps against foreign countries. We cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the unfortunate state of the current labor-management disputes continue. We would like to express a few ordinary opinions on this issue.

First, when demanding increased wages, labor should estimate the affordability of capital. It should be known that if the demands of labor exceed the affordability of capital, even if the goal is achieved with difficulty, it will affect the progress of industry. If it reaches the point where capital is unable to maintain its external operations, it will certainly not be a blessing for labor. As for the issue of improving treatment, most of the treatment that workers should enjoy has been summarized in the Factory Law. Now that the Factory Law has been implemented separately, workers can quietly wait for the law to resolve it. Second, capital should take into account the current difficult living conditions of workers, maintain its usual feelings for labor, and accommodate the workers' demands as much as possible. It cannot only consider its own interests and rely on the huge unemployed population in society, allowing the strike wave to spread and expand. In short, we sincerely hope that both labor and management, who have already been swept into the whirlpool of the strike wave, will immediately abandon their prejudices, make concessions to each other, and cooperate sincerely.

### Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Strongly Advocates Free Trade Policy

And Reaffirms Willingness to Participate in International Cooperation - Speech at the Farewell Banquet for the European and American Inspection Group

[Tokyo] The Japanese economic inspection group to Europe and the United States is now scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the 28th. Today, Foreign Minister Sato gave a speech at the farewell banquet for the inspection group, reiterating Japan's willingness to participate in international cooperation. When stating the necessity of free trade and international cooperation, Sato also restated the origin of economic nationalism, saying that since 1927, economic nationalism has replaced free trade. Sato said that various countries have built tariff walls and implemented import quotas in order to protect their own industries, but the benefits obtained by various countries are actually minimal. It is certainly not easy to restore absolute freedom as before. However, the trend of popular economic nationalism must be limited. After the banquet, the members of the inspection group met with Army Minister Sugiyama Gen. Sugiyama Gen emphasized the necessity of establishing economic friendship with Britain and the United States, and said that Germany's modern national fortune has been revived, so the inspection group must also pay attention to inspecting the industrial situation of that country when in Germany. (Reuter dispatch from Central News Agency on the 22nd)

[Tokyo] The economic inspection group to Europe exchanged views with the army authorities on the afternoon of the 21st. The army side explained the recent international situation and Japan's international position, and emphasized the necessity of the principle of national defense first. Finally, they hoped that the inspection group would implement the practical cooperation with Britain and the United States, and at the same time, thoroughly investigate various German systems. After Germany's defeat, it lacked resources, but in recent years it has worked hard to revive and has prepared strong military equipment. The situation of such a country is quite worthy of the inspection group's research. (Domei dispatch from the 22nd)

### Pacific Limitation of Fortifications

Britain Re-Enquires About Japan's Intentions

[London] Because the Washington Naval Treaty expired at the end of 1936, the British government inquired with the governments of Japan and the United States whether they were willing to maintain the status quo in the Pacific and continue to make Article 19 of the treaty, which restricts the fortification of Pacific island territories, effective. As a result, the goal was not achieved. It seems that the British government has not given up this claim and is waiting for an opportunity to negotiate again. According to news from London diplomatic circles on the 21st, the British government recently ordered its ambassador to Japan, Sir Clive, to negotiate the renewal of this clause. It is rumored that the British government's move is due to the fact that the recent settlement of the perpetual lease land rights case and the amicable resolution of the Keelung incident have greatly increased the friendly relations between Britain and Japan. Therefore, they seized this good opportunity to seek to establish peaceful relations in the Pacific. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 21st)

### Japanese Army Convenes Meeting of Military Medical Department Heads

Army Minister Sugiyama Delivers Instructions

[Tokyo] The meeting of the heads of the military medical departments of the army will be convened for three days starting on the 22nd. Today is the first day. The meeting was held in the First Conference Room of the Army Ministry from 8:30 AM. The attendees on the military medical department side included Lieutenant General Miki, Chief of the Medical Department of the Korean Army, and 21 others, including the chiefs of the medical departments of various divisions of the Kwantung Army in Taiwan. On the Army Ministry side were Army Minister Sugiyama, Vice Minister Umezu, Director of the Medical Affairs Bureau Koizumi, and related officials. The instructions of the Army Minister are recorded on the left. According to this plan to strengthen military preparations, when implementing the strengthening of advanced military equipment, the preparation of personnel is extremely important. Therefore, in order to cultivate elite soldiers, which is a major element, given the current state of reduced physical strength of the military and civilians, it is even more important for the Ministry of Health to make active efforts. It is hoped that the unparalleled imperial medical science of the world will be fully utilized and its characteristics will be brought into play. Broad consideration must be given to the entire national health, promoting human resources, striving to cultivate superior combat power, so as to complete the epoch-making military preparations of the imperial army, achieve a state of strengthening, and meet the requirements of combat.

### US-China Legislation

Both Houses Establish a Compromise Bill

[Washington] Regarding the new China Legislation, the Senate previously passed a proposal from Mr. Pittman, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, last month. The House of Representatives subsequently passed a proposal from Mr. McReynolds, the Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Due to differences in the content of the two bills, a joint committee was organized by both houses to make adjustments. It is now known that the members of the committee have reached an agreement and established a compromise plan based on the original bills passed by the two houses. The Senate has accepted that the President may decide the period during which belligerent countries are responsible for the risk of purchasing goods in the United States. The House of Representatives has accepted that if the President declares that a state of war exists in a certain country, it will be considered illegal for Americans to travel on ships of that belligerent country. (21st Dispatch from Havas via Central News Agency)

### US and Philippines Establish Agreement

The Question of Permanent Neutrality of the Philippines, the United States Prepares to Negotiate with Other Countries

[Washington] Officials here today confirmed that the United States and the Philippines have reached an agreement that the United States will discuss the neutrality of the Philippines with other countries at the earliest opportunity, in accordance with the provisions of the Philippine Independence Act. The officials denied rumors that the United States was already in negotiations with Japan. The agreement will serve as the basis for American and Filipino experts to study the early independence of the Philippines. Although the agreement does not specify which country will be negotiated with, the general opinion is that Japan's attitude is of particular importance, as relations between Japan and the Philippines will become closer after Philippine independence. Philippine President Quezon's visit to Japan when he came to the United States was very welcome, indicating a harmonious relationship between Japan and the Philippines. It is also noteworthy that there are no naval personnel among the expert committee members on the American side, suggesting that the United States has not yet decided on the future naval base issue for the Philippines. Japanese sources have informally indicated that Japan might agree to the neutrality of the Philippines if the United States does not retain a naval port in the Philippines. In summary, the above agreement proves that the United States' policy is to allow the independence of the Philippines, and all theories of establishing a separate protection system have been disproven.

### Egyptian Judicial Organization Plan Almost Entirely Adopted

Great Progress Made at the Montreux Conference

⊙ Montreux: The Egyptian Capitulations Conference today adopted almost the entire judicial organization plan drafted by the Egyptian side, except for Articles 2 and 3 regarding discrimination against foreigners and the length of the transitional period before the complete abolition of capitulations. Regarding the length of the transitional period, it is now proposed to be 12 years. However, it is feared that the jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts will need to be slightly extended even after the 12-year period expires. Regarding discrimination against foreigners, the Egyptian side argues that the guarantees provided are limited to the transitional period; otherwise, it would be tantamount to accepting new conditions, and the complete abolition of capitulations would never be achieved. The Egyptian delegation stated that there is no need to be overly apprehensive about the issue of discrimination. For example, if stamp duties are levied in the future, foreign merchants may be affected, but this type of discrimination is imaginary. Furthermore, the Egyptian representatives guaranteed that Egypt has no intention of levying income tax at present. The British side strongly supports Egypt's views, but the attitude of other countries is still unclear. (22nd Dispatch from Reuters via Central News Agency)

### Strong Solidarity of the Four Nordic Countries

Meeting of Foreign Ministers Concludes

⊙ Helsinki, Finland: The foreign ministers of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland held a meeting here yesterday. After the meeting concluded this evening, the foreign ministers of the four countries gave broadcast speeches in their respective languages, unanimously expressing great satisfaction with the results of the meeting. They stated that the Scandinavian countries have formed a strong group, and Finland has also joined the ranks, forming the most powerful element in northern European politics from now on. Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler declared that a satisfactory solution has been reached on the issue of increasing trade among the four countries. However, there is still no result on the issue of a Nordic defense alliance, as Danish Foreign Minister Munch declared that the four Nordic countries cannot be self-sufficient in times of emergency. From this, it can be inferred that one of the objectives of this meeting, namely, the conclusion of a complete agreement, does not appear to have been achieved.

[Vienna] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to meet with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg tomorrow to discuss several important issues. It is rumored that these discussions will not go beyond the scope of the Rome Protocols, in which case the two countries do not intend to change their policies. It is also rumored that the purpose of this meeting is to enhance economic cooperation among the signatory countries of the Rome Protocols, namely Italy, Austria, and Hungary. However, it is expected that this will lead to closer cooperation between these three countries and the Little Entente. At the same time, some speculate that Italy will grant Austria the convenience of jointly developing Abyssinia.

### Austrian Chancellor Issues Statement Before Departure

[Vienna] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, along with Foreign Minister Schmidt and Adam, the Director of the Federal Government Information Office, left for the Italian port of Venice last night. Before his departure, he issued a statement to the local political news agency, stating that he was very grateful for the repeated assistance of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The independence of his country has become a law in international politics and is in the interest of all of Europe. The Rome Protocols signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary are purely peaceful in nature and can be signed and joined by any country. This protocol has established reliable friendships for our country and has not provoked resentment from third countries. As such, the talks that the Italian and Austrian authorities should conduct this time are not to open up new paths, nor to seek new political goals. Subsequently, he expressed satisfaction with the political and economic agreement recently established between Italy and Yugoslavia, and stated that the policy set by Italy, Austria, and Hungary three years ago is very clear and unambiguous. These talks will further confirm this. (22nd Dispatch from Havas via Central News Agency)

Good Impression of Visit to Germany, Believes War Can Be Avoided

[London] Labour Party leader Lansbury, who held talks with Hitler in Berlin, returned to the port of Dover today. In a statement to the press, he said that he would soon travel to Italy to meet with Mussolini. He also said, "Since returning from Germany, I am deeply convinced that war can be avoided, that the idea of war is gradually receding. When I met with Führer Hitler, we all knew that the situation still had difficulties, but I firmly believe that if we act with sincerity, it will not be difficult to resolve them. Führer Hitler also said that the non-intervention policy in Spain is a good model, enough to encourage people, because the representatives of the major powers in London finally reached an agreement after many negotiations. As for the convening of an international conference, I think it is most appropriate for the United States to come forward and propose it." (22nd Dispatch from Havas via Central News Agency)

### Sugar Conference

Market Allocation Issues, Four Countries Fail to Reach Compromise

[London] The negotiating committee of the World Sugar Conference met with many attending representatives today and will continue to meet tomorrow. It is reported that all countries except four have accepted the allocation quantities in principle. However, these four countries have not yet compromised. Although the limits they are now requesting are 5% less than what they previously proposed, they still cause the total export volume to exceed the free market demand by about 10%. The negotiating committee has gone through considerable difficulties to get these four countries to slightly reduce their demands. It is currently uncertain whether these four countries will make further concessions in the future, or whether other countries can give up part of their quota. Therefore, tomorrow's meeting is the focus of general attention. (21st Dispatch from Reuters via Central News Agency)

### House of Commons Debate on the New Budget

Profits Levy Arouses Various Criticisms

[London] The House of Commons today began a heated examination of the proposed budget. Labour MP Lawrence wanted to know how Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain's national defense contribution plan would be made effective in various ways. He hoped the Treasury would pay attention to the mistakes made in the past with the wartime tax on excess profits. Conservative MP Sir Horne praised Chamberlain for his long tenure as Chancellor and his well-ordered handling of national finances, saying that the Chancellor proceeded along a firm and honest path, the result of which made Britain the envy of the world. Horne then criticized the proposed national defense contribution, saying its scope was too broad and feared it would create resistance. Horne also advocated for seizing the current opportunity to conclude a commercial treaty with the United States. Horne further called for clarification of the ambiguities in the "profits levy" and asked whether the national defense contribution could be calculated before or after income tax assessment. Horne's remarks were sufficient to prove that Conservative MPs harbored doubts about the tax. Liberal MP Sinclair attacked what he called Chamberlain's "protectionist policy," saying that the Liberal Party would rather strictly manage the price of armaments than have a tax scheme that would make the government a shareholder in profiteering. Conservative MP Anderson said that at a time when people all over the world were bearing the heavy burden of national defense, a plan like the national defense contribution was indeed an urgent necessity. However, the plan to levy an excess profits tax contained various difficulties and dangers and was generally unpopular, which could not be denied. Labour MP Cripps suggested that the "profits levy" could be used by future Chancellors as a valuable method during the transitional period when the current economic system was being transformed into a newer and better one. He hoped that in the coming years, Chamberlain's norms could be followed to make this tax a permanent feature, so that privately run industries could be gradually replaced by state-run and state-owned industries. Therefore, this tax could become a method to end the capitalist system sooner. The House of Commons debate is still ongoing. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)

[London] After studying the methods of the profits levy in the new budget, various sectors in London have had mixed reactions, with much debate. The detailed rules for implementing this plan are now under close review. Stock exchange operators are racking their brains to estimate the extent to which securities values will be affected by this new tax. When the exchange opened today, trading was limited. Some quarters were quite dissatisfied with the tax, believing it to be an act of bureaucratic politics using high-pressure tactics to interfere with private business, fearing that once such a tax collection mechanism was established, successive governments would use it to extract funds that were not used for current emergency defense purposes. However, other quarters believed that Chancellor Chamberlain's plan was fair, because most industries could triple their profits after Britain embarked on its armaments program, and it was indeed fair for businesses to contribute to national defense spending based on the facts. However, various technical difficulties are naturally unavoidable, such as the sufficient estimation of the tax amount and how individual businesses can be regarded as properly capitalized, all of which are sufficient to create difficulties. However, the experience gained by the Inland Revenue Department in collecting excess profits taxes in the past may be helpful. The general consensus is that excess profits from armaments should indeed be subject to this tax, but the method currently proposed by the Chancellor does not seem to be limited to industries related to armaments. Many businesses that have no connection with the arms manufacturing industry, not only have not benefited from the armaments program, but have been harmed by it are also included. Shipping companies are quite disappointed, because the combined income tax and national defense tax account for 45 percent. If they have to pay surcharges, the tax burden reaches 75 percent. New-style commercial firms feel particularly disadvantaged, so this new tax is feared to hinder the progress of the country's businesses. According to the Chancellor's estimate, this tax can generate 20 million to 25 million pounds. Based on this calculation, the nation's industries, in addition to paying 25 percent income tax, will have to forcibly contribute 20 percent. Last night, the Chancellor discussed this matter in the House of Commons, saying, "I am not saying that businesses are now reaping profits beyond what they should have. The past recession was very serious. Not only did shareholders go home empty-handed without dividends, but many lost their capital. Therefore, in the current environment, if they can recover their lost assets and reorganize their factories to cope with competition in the export market, it will benefit everyone. But we must now raise this extraordinarily large sum in a shorter period of time for national defense purposes. I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask various profitable businesses to make special contributions to national defense spending for the time being. In short, any assistance they can currently provide will greatly benefit national security. Only with national security can their prosperity be maintained." After announcing that maintaining peace is more valuable than reducing tax rates and that a strong Britain is the most reliable guarantee of maintaining peace, the Chancellor concluded his speech with the following sincere words: "Perhaps there will come a day when this madness of armaments will suddenly be cured, and my successor will be fortunate enough to have the opportunity to waive the taxes I am levying today. Let us all pray for the early arrival of this day." (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)

### Reported Landing of 50,000 Italian Soldiers in Spain

Rebel Defeat on Basque Front Government Troops Occupy Highlands in the South

⊙Anguilla City, Southern Port of Cadiz (in Nationalist Hands) Three Nationalist sailors recently deserted and swam across the Guadalquivir River to escape to this place. They claimed to have personally witnessed 50,000 Italians landing in the port of Cadiz, and that many Italian wounded were returning to their country on hospital ships for treatment. (Central News Agency, 21st, Havas)

⊙Andoain A communique was recently issued by the Bilbao authorities, stating that after the Basque military authorities received news of an imminent attack by the Nationalist forces, they ordered the soldiers at the front not to leave their trenches, nor to show any activity before the enemy's attack, when aircraft and artillery bombed them. When the enemy's vanguard was 40 yards from the trenches, they could fire their guns and cannons at them. The front lines acted accordingly, so the enemy's attack today suffered heavy losses. The exploding artillery and bombs fired by the government forces were as dense as rain. The enemy's advance was impossible, and retreat was also difficult, resulting in the abandonment of positions and the death and injury of about a thousand enemy soldiers. Among the cannons used by the enemy to bombard the Basque positions, there was a new cannon secretly manufactured in Germany, manned by Germans, with a range of 30 miles. The enemy's attack involved a total of 100 cannons and a large number of aircraft, which had never been seen before, including several German-made three-engine Junkers aircraft. There were 5,000 Italian and Falangist soldiers in the attacking army, and several Italian light bombers also participated in the battle. The Nationalist forces claimed that the attacking army had made important progress in this area and cut off the transportation line of the troops guarding Mount Udatra, but the Basque authorities denied the loss of territory.

⊙Anguilla City, Southern County of Cordoba A special dispatch from a Havas correspondent stated that after fierce fighting on the front lines in the area of this city, government troops had occupied the highlands of Cerro Blanco. In this battle, 60 Nationalist soldiers were captured, and a large number of weapons were seized. Since then, the foothills of Mount Chamesada and the highlands of Arconosilla have also been brought under the control of government troops, and the outposts of government troops are now only eight kilometers away from the city of Belmonte.

Unexpectedly, the plot was leaked and discovered by the Nationalist authorities, who immediately dispatched troops to arrest the principal offenders, resulting in a conflict. One of the leaders of the Santander militia was injured and killed in the commotion. All the rebel leaders were eventually arrested and imprisoned.

### "Dellinger" Phenomenon Reappears

Radio Communication Disrupted

[Tokyo] The so-called "Dellinger" phenomenon, a space demon that has been plaguing radio telegraph and telephone communications for a long time, suddenly reappeared this morning, causing abnormal disruptions in all radio telegraph and telephone communications to the United States and Europe. Communication was cut off for about 20 minutes. Such a long disruption is a rare occurrence in recent times, and all parties involved were shocked. This phenomenon was discovered by Professor Dellinger of the United States in 1935 and has since become an unresolved issue in the field of radio communications. In Japan, the Ministry of Communications, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, and other academic conferences have also risen up to study it in order to investigate its cause. However, its truth cannot be explored by any country. The current consensus in the academic community is that changes in the number of atoms in the air affect the ionosphere, resulting in disruptions in radio telegraph and telephone communications.

### China Pavilion at Nagoya Exposition Listed in Colonial Area

Chinese Representative Protests Being Excessively Humiliated Tianjin Business Community Indignant, Advocates Immediate Withdrawal

Tianjin News According to communications from Tianjin, Japan, the host country of the Nagoya Pan-Pacific Exposition, requested exhibits from various parts of China in advance, but they were all rejected. The two provinces and two cities of Ji-Cha-Ping-Jin were also unwilling to participate. Kobayashi, the head of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was entrusted by the Japanese government to repeatedly negotiate with the Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee, requesting to join. The Political Affairs Committee, unable to bear the constant harassment, reluctantly ordered each of Ji-Cha-Ping-Jin to establish a collection committee and set up a general assembly in Peiping to handle the collection of exhibits. Because there were not many enthusiastic participants, the collection period was extended again and again. In the middle, the National Goods Exhibition Halls of Peiping and Tianjin repeatedly convened talks with national goods manufacturers, urging them to participate enthusiastically so that they could select the best ones for transport to the east. At the end of February of this year, the collection of exhibits was completed. Ji-Cha-Ping-Jin obtained more than 2,000 categories, totaling more than 4,000 pieces. Tianjin obtained 500 categories, more than 1,400 pieces. On March 3, the products of the two leading cities of Ji-Cha-Ping-Jin gathered in Tianjin, loaded onto a train on North Binhe Road, transported to Tanggu, and transferred to a Japanese ship to cross to the east. The general representative of China who accompanied the exhibits to Japan was the former chairman of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, Ji Zhongshi. There were also four staff members from the National Goods Exhibition Halls of Peiping and Tianjin, including Chen Gongli, who escorted the goods. When they arrived in Nagoya, they learned that the exhibition halls of various countries had been designated. Independent countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Russia had adjacent sites. China was in the colonial area, adjacent to the two puppet organizations of "Manchukuo" and "Eastern Hebei." Ji Zhongshi, the general representative of China, believed that China was an independent country and that its site was adjacent to the two puppet organizations of "Manchukuo" and "Eastern Hebei," which was an insult to the dignity of the country and too difficult to bear. He protested to the mayor of Nagoya and the director of the exposition's preparatory office, but after repeated negotiations, there was no result. The other party said that the site had already been determined and it was inconvenient to re-designate it. Ji Zhongshi, the general representative of China, in addition to telegraphing the Ji-Cha authorities for instructions, never allowed the Chinese Pavilion to open. China's exhibits were not unpacked and displayed. When the Pingjin business community heard the news, they were extremely indignant. They requested the Ji-Cha authorities to summon Ji Zhongshi to declare the withdrawal from the exhibition immediately and escort China's exhibits back to the country to maintain its dignity. The Ji-Cha authorities are still considering this matter. (20th)

### Sino-Japanese Joint Venture Huitong Airlines Loses Money

Losses of 100,000 Yuan Since Opening Still Planning Air Service Between China and Japan

Tianjin News The Sino-Japanese joint venture Huitong Airlines will convene a shareholders' meeting on the 22nd to discuss the payment of the second phase of shares by both China and Japan, and to increase the share capital. Zhang Zizhong, chairman of the company, and Kodama Tsuneo, the Japanese vice chairman, arrived in Tianjin from Peiping and Dalian on the 21st to attend the meeting. The meeting will last for two days. The company's capital was originally set at 3.4 million yuan, divided into four phases. The first phase of 1.35 million yuan was collected when it opened, but due to poor business since the opening of the air routes from Tianjin to Dalian, Tianjin to Chengde, Tianjin to Zhangjiakou, and Tianjin to Jinzhou on October 17 last year, all passengers, except for Japanese soldiers, were mostly Japanese and puppet Manchukuo officials. The fares paid were only one-quarter of the amount. Although parcel and postal services were later opened, the business was still as sluggish as before. The company tried its best to attract Chinese passengers, but it was still unsuccessful. Therefore, as of recently, excluding all expenses, the losses have reached more than 100,000 yuan. The company initially planned to set up the above four routes after its establishment, and then to run the Tianjin-Taiyuan and Tianjin-Jinan-Qingdao routes to compete with China Airlines and Eurasia Airlines, in order to sweep the aviation rights of the five provinces of North China. However, the progress has not been satisfactory. Japanese military personnel and Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel stationed in Peiping and Tianjin have been warned by the local authorities when traveling between Tianjin, Taiyuan, Jinan and Qingdao by the company's planes, so the company has had to cancel its original plan and try to open the Peiping-Tianjin-Tokyo route to reap some gains. Two weeks ago, the company held a board meeting to discuss business methods. It was decided to conduct aerial sightseeing flights in the cities of Tianjin and Peiping. Tianjin held several flights, but there was not much revenue, so it stopped. In Peiping, in view of the failure in Tianjin, it was stopped before it even started. Recently, it is still planning to open joint Peiping-Tianjin sightseeing flights and summer flights from Tianjin to Beidaihe, but it will have to wait for the decision of this shareholders' meeting.

Due to the losses, the company plans to collect the second phase of capital of 1.35 million yuan immediately. At the same time, it also wants to purchase five more aircraft to add to the routes and expand its business. It is also planned to collect the third phase of capital of 1.35 million yuan in advance. Some shareholders also advocate increasing the capital to strengthen the company's foundation, so it may be discussed at this meeting.

As for the Peiping-Tianjin-Tokyo joint airline, the necessary procedures have long been agreed upon and are scheduled to be implemented on June 1. The scheduled time is 7:50 am flying out of Tianjin, arriving in Dalian at 9:05, transferring to a Japan Airlines plane, departing from Dalian at 9:25, arriving in Fukuoka Prefecture at 2 pm, arriving in Osaka at 3 pm, and arriving in Tokyo at 5:30 pm. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Sundays are for flights from Tianjin, and Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays are for flights from Tokyo. The passenger fare is about 90 yuan. Each person is allowed to carry one piece of luggage weighing 60 kilograms. The Japanese side has already shouted the slogan "Arrive in Peiping in the evening after leaving Tokyo in the morning and eat Chinese food". The speed can be imagined. However, it is still doubtful whether the company will not lose money after this event is held. (21st)

### Shantou Japanese Pier Construction Case Halted

Planned Pier Construction is to Develop Southern Advance Policy Strong Purchase of Haitan Contract Heard to be Canceled

Shantou News In Japan's southern advance policy, the maritime transport business is the current core issue. Nissin Kisen Kaisha and Osaka Shosen Kaisha have dispatched two ships to run the Shanghai-Guangdong-Shantou line and the Taiwan-Xiamen-Shantou-Hong Kong line, and their business is progressing rapidly. Ships from various countries are threatened by them. However, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company all have piers and warehouses in Shantou, but Japanese ships do not, so they have never been able to compete successfully. Japanese merchants have wanted to build piers and warehouses in Shantou for more than a day. However, the west embankment has long been occupied by British merchants, leaving no room for them to gain a foothold. What can be noted is the Qilu area of the south embankment, but the embankment has not yet been completed. The end of Shen Zhao Road near the Japanese consulate is where Japanese warships moor. Heavy objects are often transported ashore and then moved into the consulate and the Datong Ice Factory. Therefore, the Japanese side urgently needs a pier at this time. If there is a pier, foreign workers can be concentrated to transport special goods to achieve their southern advance goals. However, the matter of building a pier at the end of Shen Zhao Road has been rejected. This spring, they tried to forcibly occupy the haitan (beach) of the Commercial School. The method was that Luo Bingzhang, the owner of Sanlin Company, falsely claimed to be the owner of the haitan and sold it to Nissin Company for 10,000 yuan. Currently, the haitan is still submerged in seawater. The filling cost is about 100,000 yuan. The construction was contracted by the Japanese-owned Ohara Company. The survey was completed, and construction was about to begin. However, Luo's ownership had long been invalidated by the Chenghai District Court, and the Shantou Municipal Government refused to issue a construction permit. The requests of the Japanese consulate were also rejected by the Municipal Government one by one. Nissin Company felt that construction was not easy and has reportedly terminated the contract to buy the haitan from Luo Bingzhang. The pier construction case can be temporarily brought to an end.

### Jiangxi Native Cloth Showing Signs of Revival

Native Cloth Industry Earned Slight Profits Last Year

Nanchang News Jiangxi's industry is still in its infancy, and it is still entirely in the agricultural economic period. The problem of clothing is that all localities grow their own cotton, spin, weave, dye, and wear their own clothes. Even the larger mobile phone factories in the cities only produce goods for the province. According to a recent survey by the Provincial Government's Economic Commission on the production of native cloth in 27 counties including Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Linchuan, 9 million bolts can be produced annually. 80% is woven by farmers and rural women, which is deeply related to the rural economy. In recent years, foreign goods have been dumped like mercury, especially Japanese goods. Foreign cloth at 35 cents a foot is like entering an uninhabited area in the countryside. In the past, the sound of machines could be heard from the farmhouse, but now the farmers can only sigh at the machines. Even the Yimin dyeing and weaving factories in Nanchang City cannot be maintained. In the past, the transaction volume of native cloth in Nanchang City was several million yuan, reaching Tingzhou and Yanping in Fujian and Tunxi in Anhui. By the 24th year, the cloth production in various places decreased by two-tenths to one-third. In this city, there was only one million yuan in business, and cloth shops closed one after another. Fortunately, there was a bumper harvest in the countryside last year. Farmers have been poorly clothed for years, and the demand for cloth is now extremely high, so native cloth has gradually revived. It is estimated that the sales volume last year increased to more than 2.9 million yuan in transactions. Cloth operators such as Wang Deshun, who had been losing money for years, all earned slight profits. The only Jiujiang Lizhong Spinning Factory in the province also operated day and night last year, producing 50 packages of yarn per day, and still felt that the supply could not meet the demand. Therefore, it also made a substantial profit last year (April 19).

### Songjiang

College Student Brutally Murders Maid

Jiang Anren, a resident of Xiwai Gangpeng, is a doctor. He has a son named Changchi, 24 years old, who is a third-year student at Shanghai Law School. Anren's brother, Suixiang, serves in the county's land administration bureau. He hired a maid, Shunzhu, 21 years old. Suixiang lives in the back of the house. On the afternoon of the 22nd, both Suixiang and his wife went out and did not return. Only Shunzhu was guarding the house. At around 3:00 pm, the neighbors suddenly heard Shunzhu shout for help, suspecting that she had encountered a thief. They telephoned the detective agency and notified Suixiang and his wife. The police station immediately ordered detectives to surround and arrest the house. In the western corner of the patio behind the house, the maid Shunzhu was found with several knife wounds, lying dead in a pool of blood. In the front room of Anren, his son Changchi was arrested, naked and prostrate under the bed. He admitted that he had returned home from school in Shanghai today. He was temporarily confused and broke into his uncle's house through the window and chopped the maid with a kitchen knife, causing this tragedy. He was then taken to the bureau and transferred to the court along with the kitchen knife and evidence. The body was examined by the Shandi Court, and the family was ordered to provide a coffin for burial.

The district prosecutor's office, considering that Qiu Xiaosan was not yet 14 years old, was not punished by law. Yesterday, he applied to the criminal court for security measures.

### Changshu

Revival of Lace Industry

Dongxiang in this county was originally the birthplace of lace. Five years ago, there were many lace shops opened in the Meili area, and rural women used making lace as a sideline during the slack season. Later, due to oversupply, it declined for a time, and the wages had to be lowered. The rural women saw no remaining profits and regarded it as a chicken rib. Recently, foreign shops have had a great demand for lace and urgently need supplies from various places. Therefore, a Chen from Shiqiao Township in this area raised funds to establish a lace factory and distributed it to female workers in various places for embroidery. The wages have also increased, and bonuses are given for faster work. Therefore, women are happy to rush to make it. Therefore, the lace industry in this county is gradually reviving. However, it is expected that the slack season will only be in the spring season, and it may be slightly suppressed after the season.

### Wuxi

Attempted Rape Case Publicly Tried

Zheng Fuxi, the former director of the county's opium addiction treatment center, was transferred to inspect female opium addicts undergoing rehabilitation. The rehabilitation patient, Guo Zixin (i.e., Hua Jinglan), accused him of taking advantage of his power to attempt rape. The case was transferred by the Second District Security Command to the local court for investigation. After the investigating prosecutor completed the investigation, he filed a public prosecution with the criminal court, charging Zheng Fuxi with violating Article 222, Paragraph 1, and Paragraph 3 of the same article, and Article 134 of the same law of the criminal law. It is now known that the case will be handled by Zhang Xianxin, a criminal court judge, and will be publicly tried at 2:00 pm on May 3. In addition to the detained Zheng Fuxi and Guo Zixin, the witnesses to be examined include Shen Gengsheng, Qi Hong, Wang Lu, Fan Zhou, Zhang Zhou, Zhou Yin, Wang Sun, Wang Zhou, and Cai Wang, a total of eleven people. At that time, Zheng Fuxi will also hire lawyer Sun Zuhong to appear in court to defend him.

### Changzhou

Accomplice Arrested in Robbery Case

The home of Fei Jinshi of Sheng Lianxiang outside the North Gate of Wuyi was robbed last month. The detective team and the Taiping branch police station and the urban area police station separately arrested four bandits involved in the case, including Xu Linsheng, and handed them over to the county for interrogation. The bandits confessed that the mastermind Chen Shaoping (also known as Mu Ting, nicknamed "Little Chen from Jiangbei") was hiding with his mistress in the area west of the Suzhou Railway Station. The county magistrate immediately secretly ordered the detective team to arrest him at the address. Detective Chen Sendu led detectives and met with police officer Yu Fugeng of the urban area police station to go to Suzhou on the evening of the 19th. They met with the police station there and arrested Chen Shaoping. On the evening of the 20th, they took Chen back to Changzhou. After interrogation by Detective Chen, he confessed that he had committed multiple robberies in Changzhou and had more than 20 tickets, which were deposited at the Genglin tea room of the Zhenxing Inn on the Wuxi Road. Detective Chen immediately dispatched detectives to Wuxi to retrieve the tickets and handed over the suspect to the county for interrogation on the 21st.

### Jiaxing

Establishment of City Defense Headquarters

Jiaxing has a vast territory and frequent transportation. The Supervisory Office of the Border Region of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, in order to maintain the discipline of the military and police near the city, inspect stations and ports, and assist in the promotion of the New Life Movement, urgently needs to designate an agency to coordinate and take full responsibility. Therefore, it was specially ordered that Liu Shangzhi, commander of the 56th Division stationed in Jiaxing, concurrently serve as the commander of Jiaxing City Defense. All administrative organs below the county level, as well as the water and land police security teams in the Jiaxing urban area, are under the command and dispatch of the commander. Wang Xianqiang, Special Commissioner for Administration and Supervision of the Xiu District, was concurrently appointed as the deputy commander of Jiaxing City Defense to assist in handling affairs. After receiving the order, the commander and deputy commander assumed their posts on the 21st and established the Jiaxing City Defense Headquarters. The matter has now been reported to the Supervisory Office for record.

Gu Suming Detained in Beijing Due to a Case

Gu Suming, chairman of the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, had a large amount of entertainment expenses when the silver industry went to Beijing to petition last year. The responsible authority in Beijing has learned of this and summoned Gu to Beijing for questioning by the Garrison Headquarters. Because further questioning is needed, Gu is still in Beijing. All duties of the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce here are temporarily handled by Jiang Fuqing, a standing committee member.

### Ningbo

Japanese Fishing Vessels Invade Waters off Shengshan

In the waters off Sheshan in Dinghai, thirty to forty Japanese fishing vessels were recently discovered intruding into fishing grounds. The fishing industry in Shenjiamen has telegraphed Chairman Zhu to find a way to negotiate. Now, the same situation has been discovered in the waters off Shengshan. The Japanese fishing vessels use steel wire nets with large capacity and high speed, causing our fishermen who use old-fashioned trawl nets to drift helplessly in the waves caused by their fishing vessels, only able to sigh and look out at the ocean, unable to resist. Director Chen of the Dinghai Office of the Fishery Management Committee, upon receiving the report, urgently telegraphed the committee for instructions. He received a reply instructing him to immediately dispatch the Keqiang warship, which is currently surveying the squid trap netting areas in Dongji Huangxing, to the waters off Shengshan to conduct a thorough investigation and report back in order to propose negotiations.

Cargo Ship Sinks After Hitting Reef

The Jin Yuanbao sailing ship, on the 14th, loaded mao bamboo, native paper, fermented bean curd, matting, and other goods from Yong to Dongqingdao for sale. However, when it sailed to the Xudao area outside the Zhenhai estuary, the captain fell asleep due to fatigue, and the compass of the ship's first mate was accidentally overturned. At that time, there was a heavy fog, causing the ship to mistakenly hit a reef. They immediately raised a rescue flag to ask for help. A passing iced fish ship rescued more than twenty crew members. However, due to the heavy wind and rain, the ship had broken apart, and all the cargo had drifted into the sea, unable to be salvaged, resulting in a loss of more than 20,000 silver dollars.

### Bengbu

Flourishing River Transport on the Huai River

In northern Anhui, continuous spring rains have caused the water level of the Huai River to gradually rise. According to the water volume report from this port on the 21st, the upstream Zhengyangguan rose by about five feet, and Bengbu rose by about one foot. The regular passenger and cargo ships between Bengbu and Ying are running smoothly and unhindered. The volume of passengers and goods is gradually improving compared to last year when the river was shallow. Recently, the new tea from Lu'an and Huoshan in western Anhui will be available on the market by the end of the month. The production of chicken eggs in the spring in northern Anhui is very abundant, all transported from Zhengyangguan to Bengbu by regular passenger and cargo ships, loaded onto trains, and transshipped to Shanghai. During this season, there are approximately 300,000 baskets of tea leaves, each basket weighing ten catties, and approximately 20,000 baskets of eggs, each basket containing 800 to 900 eggs. The freight for these two items totals more than 30,000 yuan. This season is the most prosperous for the revenue of the Huai River shipping industry, and the annual balance of income and expenditure also depends on this season.

### Shanxi's National Industry (Part 2)

— Xu Yi Wu

The Connection of Transportation

The development of commerce is closely related to the transportation industry. Moreover, the development of national industry relies even more on the development of transportation. Within Shanxi, in addition to the Zhengtai Railway, the Tongpu Railway from Fenglingdu to Yangqu Beiyuan Pingzhen, a distance of more than 1,200 li, has been completed in recent years under the policy of using military labor to build roads. The majority of the earthwork for the section from Yuanpingzhen to Datong has also been completed. The completion of this railway connects to the Longhai Railway in the south and the Pingsui Railway in the north, closely linking the province with the outside world. The lack of material goods in Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, and Ningxia can be supplied through this route. Moreover, the large quantities of agricultural products from various counties in southern Shanxi and the Lu salt from Yuncheng can supply the needs of the various counties in northern Shanxi. The coal from Datong can supply the fuel for the various counties in southern Shanxi. The mountain products of the factories in Taiyuan can thus circulate smoothly throughout the various counties. In terms of military, economic, and political significance, the Tongpu Railway can almost be called the lifeline of Shanxi. The Shanxi authorities spent 30,000 troops and more than 10 million yuan to build this road, and not without reason.

A Few Words of Criticism

Shanxi's national industry has laid a foundation due to the completeness of objective conditions, such as the production of coal and iron, convenient transportation, close-knit commercial organizations, the public's habit of using local goods, and the skill in management, production, and sales techniques. Its future development is also something that can be anticipated. However, due to the development of this kind of state-run industry and commerce, privately-owned industry and commerce have suffered great losses, both directly and indirectly. I have repeatedly heard the complaints of managers from private factories in Shanxi. They say, "If you only care about the development of state-run industry, private factories will be eliminated. If you only want state-run commerce to develop, the social economy will fall into a dead end. Is a monopolistic and deformed development really good news for the people of Shanxi?" These words seem reasonable at first glance. However, the industrial objective of private capital is only to seek the expansion of capital, and the commercial objective is only to seek the increase of profits. It is not as good as the provincial-managed enterprises that possess the form of state capitalism. This is because in countries with oppressed nationalities, old-style indigenous industry and commerce are often destroyed by foreign economic aggression. It is better to concentrate all capital and resist foreign economic oppression through organized provincial management. For example, if the profits of local goods stores can provide 20% for social public undertakings as a subsidy, then that is an emphasis on the interests of the people. If the industry of the entire province of Shanxi is further coordinated with the needs of the people of the entire province for production, reaching the components of ownership and enjoyment by the people, abandoning the monopolistic economy, and eliminating the ills of the interests of a few, then I think Shanxi's national industry can develop healthily. At the same time, it can serve as a model for other provinces in the country. A business investigator from Guangdong, after inspecting the state of industry in Shanxi, made a statement, saying, "Guangdong could not successfully operate a steel mill with 1.2 million yuan, but Shanxi succeeded in operating a steel mill with 200,000 yuan. This is because the people of Shanxi have a down-to-earth, practical, and hard-working spirit." He also said, "National industry is loudly planning in Shanghai and Guangdong, but in Shanxi, we see it being carried out step by step. I think a great plan is not as good as a small-scale implementation!" Regarding the criticism of Western national industry, this Guangdong man spoke before I did.

### Chairman Chiang's Examination Results at the Hospital are Good

Two Diseased Teeth Were Extracted Yesterday - Can Be Discharged from the Hospital in a Few Days

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek remained at Zhongshan Hospital yesterday to continue his physical examination. Madam Chiang Soong Mei-ling, Director of the Adjutant's Office Qian Dajun, and Director-General of the Lixingshe Huang Renlin were all in the hospital to attend to him. Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Central Committee Member Er Tongzi, and Ling Kan, the eldest son of Special Envoy Zaite, visited the hospital one after another yesterday to inquire about his health. Other guests were generally not received. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was admitted to the hospital on the 20th, the results of the examination by Yan Fuqing, Niu Huisheng, and various specialist doctors were quite good. However, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has recently felt a slight soreness in his back. The examination results showed that it was not related to the back injury he had suffered in the past. It is thought that it was caused by the poor atmospheric conditions or related to the diseased teeth. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has several diseased teeth. After X-ray examination, it was discovered that there was pus inside. In order to prevent the diseased teeth from affecting the health of other parts of the body, Dr. Collins performed surgery yesterday (the 22nd) to extract one diseased tooth. The procedure went well, with only slight pain. There are still several diseased teeth that will continue to be extracted in the coming days. It is understood that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek can be discharged from the hospital in a few days.

### Party, Government, and Military Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday to Decide on a Policy to Deal with Labor Strikes

Acting Mayor Yu Has Ordered the Social and Police Bureaus to Comply

Acting Mayor Yu, in view of the increasingly turbulent labor strikes in this city, which are sufficient to affect the production industry, hinder local security, and impede the development of national economic construction, specially convened a joint meeting of the Party, government, and military yesterday to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that: ㊀ The labor-management disputes that have already occurred should be resolved quickly through mediation by the Social Bureau. ㊁ The regulations on labor-management disputes promulgated by the Party and government organs on April 19 should be strictly and severely enforced. That is, after any labor-management dispute occurs, it should first be submitted to the Social Bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. If mediation is unsuccessful or the mediation is not accepted, it should be submitted for arbitration. However, if there is an unauthorized strike or work slowdown before the mediation is convened or during the mediation period, or if there is an unjustified suspension of business, it should be investigated and dealt with. Those who incite labor strikes should be severely punished without leniency. Acting Mayor Yu also ordered the Social Bureau and the Police Bureau yesterday to comply with the above.

### The Yunfei Motor Company Driver Strike is Expected to be Resolved

The Party and Government Continued to Mediate This Morning

The drivers and workers of the American-owned Yunfei Motor Company, in opposition to the company's dismissal of worker Zhang Daxin, declared a strike at 8:00 p.m. the night before after mediation by Party and government organs was ineffective. More than 100 worker representatives, led by the union director Zhu Weichang, petitioned the Social Bureau again at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, demanding that the company withdraw its order. Zhu Guilin met with them and promised to negotiate with the company and be responsible for mediation. In the afternoon, Zhu Guilin from the Social Bureau, Lu Yinchu from the Party headquarters, and Zhu Weichang, a member of the union, negotiated with the American manager Bai Lihua. It was decided that negotiations would be held again at 10:00 a.m. today. All 56 buses heading to the city center were led by Party and government representatives and returned to the Daxi Road terminal last night.

In other news, the Yunfei Motor Company experienced a labor-management dispute last winter. It was resolved after mediation by Party and government organs and the signing of a labor-management contract by the company. This time, news of a driver strike suddenly spread. After inquiring with relevant parties, it was learned that the company has been in operation for 18 years, employing more than 600 people. Labor-management cooperation has been able to maintain peace and harmony. The company authorities have always been extremely concerned about the interests of employees. As for the labor strike that occurred this time, it was actually because on the 9th of this month, a driver named Wang Mo argued with a passenger about the price of wine. After the company verified the facts, he was reprimanded and punished. Unexpectedly, the next morning, another driver, Zhang Daxin, expressed dissatisfaction and smeared the glass on the announcement board. The company authorities believed that he was interfering with administration and that it was necessary to strictly ban him. The mediation of Zhu Weichang, chairman of the Drivers' Union, was ineffective, and he was dismissed. This is the situation of the labor strike.

### The Tram Strike in the Public Concession Was Resolved Yesterday

Five Measures Mediated by Du Yuesheng - Tram Services on All Routes Will Resume This Morning

Dagon Society reports that all the workers in the car and machine departments of the British-owned Shanghai Tram Company in the Public Concession jointly declared a strike on the 18th of this month due to unfulfilled demands. After the Party and government organs consulted on handling measures and Du Yuesheng, a local negotiator, took on the role of mediation, a resolution was reached. The machine department workers returned to work at 8:00 p.m. last night, and the car department workers are scheduled to return to work as usual at 6:00 a.m. this morning. Tram services on all routes should be able to resume. The details are as follows:

Mediation and Resolution

After receiving a request for assistance from the representatives of the Shanghai tram workers, Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Local Association, believed that trams were related to public transportation, so he agreed to take on the role of mediator. He visited Li Fusun, a Chinese director of the company, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss solutions. At 2:00 p.m., Zhou Funong, Lu Yinchu, and Yu Yaoqiu, representatives of the Municipal Party Committee, and Wang Xianqing, a representative of the Social Bureau, also conducted mediation. As a result, Du reached an agreement with the company on five solutions: ㊀ Drivers and workers will receive a one-day raise in pay per month, and machine department workers will receive a one-day raise in pay per month, effective August 1. ㊁ Du Yuesheng will subsidize 6,000 yuan for the strike period. A: 1,000 yuan will be used to compensate for the losses incurred by all drivers and machine department workers due to the raise (excluding ticket sellers). B: 3,000 yuan will be used as a subsidy for all workers during the strike period, which will be distributed equally by the tram workers' union. C: 2,000 yuan will be used to cover losses during the strike period and as a future business fund. ㊂ The company shall not dismiss workers on the pretext of this strike. ㊃ Car employees who are certified by a doctor as unable to work should be given a corresponding position, and their original wages should not be reduced. ㊄ All car and machine department workers will resume work immediately.

Notice of Resumption of Work

The British Tram Workers' Improvement Association issued a notice to all workers to resume work immediately, as the dispute has been resolved through mediation by the Party and government organs and Du Yuesheng. The notice reads: "Notice: This association requested improved treatment conditions from the company, but the company unreasonably refused, resulting in a serious labor-management dispute. We are grateful to Mr. Du Yuesheng for taking on the role of mediator, and to the representatives of the Municipal Party Committee, Social Bureau, and General Labor Union for their efforts to persuade, which has led to a satisfactory resolution. It has been decided that the machine department will resume work as usual on the night shift of the 22nd, and the car department will resume work as usual on the morning of the 23rd. We hereby notify everyone to follow the above regulations and report to the factory on time without delay."

Night Shift Enters the Factory

All 500 coppersmiths from the three factories on Jing'an Temple Road, Huishan Road, and Pikeer Road entered the factory at 8:00 p.m. last night to resume work as usual, washing and repairing all trams and trackless trolleys in preparation for driving this morning. The Yulin Road and Jing'an Temple Road patrol houses sent detectives to patrol the factory gates to protect them. By 8:20 p.m., all the night shift workers had entered the factory to work, and the order was very good.

Driving This Morning

All the workers in the car department need to wait for the five days that the trams were out of service to be sorted out. The scheduled six o'clock admittance of the car department workers happened and so all trams and trackless trolleys in the Public Concession will fully restore traffic from six o'clock this morning. The routes 5, 17, and 18 in the French Concession can also drive into the Public Concession, and the trams in the Public Concession can also drive into the French Concession as usual.

### Upgrade of Sino-Belgian Envoys

Belgian Ambassador Still Being Selected

Central News Agency reports that with regard to the issue of upgrading Sino-Belgian envoys, according to Tan Erfu, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Belgian Embassy in China, the relations between China and Belgium have always been extremely cordial. Because the relations between the two countries are becoming increasingly close, it has been decided to upgrade the envoys. After consultations between the two parties, a decision has been made. It is not yet known when it will be realized. As for the selection of the first Belgian ambassador to China, it is still in progress. According to reporters' inquiries with relevant parties, before the Belgian Minister to China Ji Youmu returned to China, he had consulted with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs several times on the issue of upgrading Sino-Belgian envoys, and achieved considerable results. Subsequently, Ji returned home on leave, and the matter was temporarily suspended. Now, after our Minister to Belgium Zhu Hexiang continued to discuss with the Belgian government, it was decided that it would be realized in the shortest possible time.

### Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Arrived in Shanghai Last Night

Decided to Depart for Home on the 2nd of Next Month

Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru, accompanied by his wife, son, Chinese Counselor of the Embassy Shimizu, and Secretary Hoshida, left Beijing by express train at 7:50 a.m. yesterday. He got off the train in Suzhou at 12:07 p.m. for a few hours of sightseeing. At about 5:00 p.m., he transferred to a private car that had been sent to greet him and followed the Xihu Highway. He arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 p.m. and went directly to his official residence on Bixun Road to rest. He then summoned Yoshioka, the Acting Consul General in Shanghai, to inquire about everything. It was decided that after meeting with Hidakane Shintaro, the new Counselor of the Embassy and Consul General in Beijing, he would set off for home on the Nagasaki Maru on the 2nd of next month. Hidaka will depart for China on the Shanghai Maru the day after tomorrow and arrive in Shanghai on the 27th.

### Xu Shiying Remains in Hospital for Recuperation

Guests Declined on Doctor's Advice

Minister to Japan Xu Shiying came to Shanghai from Beijing due to an ear infection and asked the German doctor Mi Aili to diagnose him. He was immediately admitted to the Hongqiao Sanatorium for rest. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency inquired at Xu's residence and learned that Xu's ear inflammation had not changed after treatment. Only yellow water flowed from his ear from time to time. Due to extreme fatigue, guests were declined on the doctor's advice so that he could recuperate in peace. The cause of the ear inflammation may be that when washing his face, due to his old age and weak breathing, water stains were absorbed from the nostrils and invaded the ear. Once he was overworked, it led to inflammation. According to the doctor's diagnosis, if there is no change within a week, and after two or three weeks of recuperation, he will gradually recover. However, the return to Japan to resume his post may be delayed by a month.

### People's Whereabouts

Zhang Qun, Zeng Zhongming, and Xu Kan left Beijing by night train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Zhang Daofan and Lin Baisheng went to Beijing by night train yesterday.

The meeting proceeded as scheduled. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, the secretary Yan Esheng read the resolutions of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly of this term and reported that the residents of the shanty towns in the Yangshupu area were panicked because the Public Works Department ordered all of them to be demolished before May 1. Tang Anping and others were selected as representatives to come to the meeting to petition, etc. Then, in accordance with the agenda, one chairman and one vice chairman, and five standing committee members were elected by ballot.

Resolutions on Various Cases

(A) Discuss the case handed over by the resolution of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly of this term, that Chinese taxpayers should have the same status and rights as Western taxpayers. If the two associations cannot agree, an arbitration mechanism should be established to achieve effective cooperation. It was resolved to submit it to the government and ask the Chinese directors to negotiate and proceed. (B) Discuss the case handed over by the resolution of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly of this term, that various committees should be organized among the representatives to study various municipal matters in the Public Concession separately. It was resolved to hand it over to the Standing Committee to draft a grouping plan and submit it to the next meeting for discussion. (C) Discuss the case handed over by the resolution of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly of this term, that a letter should be sent to the Public Works Department requesting improvement of public bus facilities. It was resolved to send a letter to the Public Works Department to instruct the public bus company to handle it. (D) Discuss the following cases handed over by the resolution of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly of this term, to study and handle them in groups: 1. Strive to abolish consular jurisdiction (a telegram has been sent to the Minister of Foreign Affairs before the assembly). 2. Increase the number of Chinese directors according to the population ratio. 3. Review the accounts of the Public Works Department, economize on waste, and reduce the budget. 4. The Public Works Department's various organs and anti-patrol houses should be supervised and assisted by the association's elected members. 5. Improve the treatment of the Chinese directors of the Public Works Department to increase the work rate. 6. Protect the property rights of the poor, avoid demolishing shanties, and ensure the residence of civilians. It was resolved to handle the above six cases separately according to their urgency. (E) Discuss the following six cases suggested by the Shanghai First Special District Private School Association, which were handed over by the resolution of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly of this term: 1. Increase subsidies for Chinese schools and stipulate that Chinese and Western schools should be equal within three years. 2. Private schools established with the approval of the Social Bureau should be exempt from property tax. 3. The funds required for fire protection renovation should be raised separately by the Public Works Department in principle (if it is necessary to use subsidies designated for other purposes, the amount should not exceed one-sixth of the total amount of subsidies), and the fire protection standards should be reduced. Schools without boarders do not need to be restricted. 4. Subsidized schools have already reported the use of subsidy funds on a regular basis, so the Public Works Department does not need to review the accounts of private schools again and send people to check the accounts. This is an interference in the administration of the schools and should be canceled. 5. Subsidies for each school this year should not be withheld due to fire protection. 6. For schools with special circumstances, such as expiring leases or imminent relocation, the Public Works Department should be accommodating. It was resolved to hand it over to the Education Research Association for discussion and handling.

### City Chamber of Commerce Again Telegraphed Yesterday for Tax Exemption on Foreign Rice

Grain Merchants in Bengbu and Guild Sent Letters to Shanghai in Support

The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry again yesterday, saying: "Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry: The Xiao telegram has been received. The content of the coordinated deliberations of the Executive Yuan and the ministries is only seen in the newspapers and has not been officially approved. The rice merchants in six provinces are waiting expectantly, which only increases their anxiety. If the largest sales market in Guangdong Province is blocked by the tax exemption of foreign rice, the revitalization of the rural areas in the six provinces will be aborted halfway. The so-called rural revival will be nothing more than a flash in the pan, and the turning point of the hundred industries will also be implicated and fall. This is related to the interests of the southeastern provinces and is also related to the national economy. We beseech you to make a wise decision and issue a clear order quickly. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows and prays."

The Shanghai Grain Industry Guild received a letter from the Bengbu Grain Transportation Industry Guild yesterday, saying: "We are writing to inform you that our guild has recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, asking them to carefully consider the case to prevent problems before they happen. Since your guild has already appealed for this case, our guild should support it. We hope to work together, persevere to the end, and achieve the goal of stopping it. Then the national economy and the people's livelihood will both benefit. Although our guild is located in the hinterland, we are closely related. We should follow your guild's lead and wait for your instructions. We are writing to inform you of this and hope you will take care of us. Sincerely, Bengbu Grain Transportation Industry Guild to the Shanghai Grain Industry Guild."

The inaugural flight departed from the United States the day before yesterday (the 21st), carrying mail and cargo, and is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 28th. Thereafter, there will be one round trip per week, with passenger service commencing next month. A Central News Agency reporter obtained the following details from both companies:

Long-Term Planning

China National Aviation Corporation, with the aim of developing international aviation, had been planning the Sino-American air service since the establishment of its Shanghai-Guangdong route. Negotiations were held with Pan American Airways, and after a long period of preparation, the Pan American's Chinese Clipper flew from the United States across the Pacific to Hong Kong, and after a successful trial flight, schedules, fares, postal rates, etc. were finalized, and a contract was signed by both parties before the service commenced.

Flight Schedule

The flight schedule stipulates one round trip per week, using one or two large aircraft for the flights, with Hong Kong as the connecting station. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to the United States will take the Shanghai-Guangdong southbound flight on Tuesday, stay in Hong Kong for two nights, and then transfer to the Clipper flying boat on Thursday. It will arrive in Manila that day, Guam on Friday, Wake Island on Saturday, Midway Island on Sunday, and Honolulu in the Philippine Islands on Monday. The flight will depart the Philippine Islands on Tuesday, flying non-stop for a day and a night, arriving in San Francisco on Tuesday. From the United States to China, the flight will land at each station every Wednesday and arrive in Hong Kong on the second Wednesday. The first flight departed from San Francisco the day before yesterday and will arrive in Hong Kong on the 29th. For the initial flights, only mail will be transported, with a rate of $1.45 per five-gram letter. Passenger service will begin on the fourth of next month. The fare from Shanghai to the United States is US$980. The Sikorsky aircraft used from Shanghai to Hong Kong can carry 17 passengers, while the Clipper flying boat from Hong Kong to the United States can carry 40 passengers. The entire journey is 10,000 miles long, and the section from the Philippine Islands to San Francisco is over 2,000 miles long, requiring non-stop flight for a day and a night. The aircraft carries over 20,000 gallons of fuel, so passenger capacity will be reduced on this segment.

### Taibei Ocean "Ascending Peace" Runs Aground

Fourth Hold Pierced; Engine Room Flooded

The "Shengping" (Ascending Peace) steamship, owned by the Minxin Shipping Company of this port, is one of its newly purchased large vessels. Built in 1907, it has a deadweight of 4,434.20 tons, a length of 368 feet and 7 inches, a beam of 51 feet, a draft of 24 feet and 6 inches, and a speed of 11 knots per hour. It can carry 7,040 tons of cargo. It is currently leased out for voyages among the South Sea Islands and Japan. Yesterday at noon, the company received an urgent telegram from the ship's master in Shanghai, reporting that the ship was en route to Keelung to load coal, and at approximately 1:00 AM on the 22nd, the ship arrived north of Taiwan in waters near the Pukikaki lighthouse. Due to another ship having an accident, the "Shengping" went to assist, but due to poor weather conditions, it

Mistakenly Entered a Channel

and ran aground on a submerged reef. The ship's fourth hold, which is a water tank, was immediately pierced by the reef and began to flood. In a second telegram received in the afternoon, it was reported that the main hold and engine room were also flooding, and the water level in each hold had reached 12 feet. The company was asked to send assistance as soon as possible. The company immediately reported this to the Ship Insurance Joint Association and discussed rescue methods, first requesting a Japanese salvage company to send a ship. However, since that company had no ships available, the "Shengping" sent a third telegram in the afternoon, stating that

The Situation Is Stable

but urgently needed several divers to be sent to inspect the damage to the ship's bottom. By 6:00 PM, a telegram had been sent to the Keelung agent requesting them to hire several divers as soon as possible and bring pumps, cement, cotton plugs, etc. to the site of the accident to inspect the damage to the ship. It is essential to pump out the water from the engine room before rescue operations can proceed. It is understood that a rescue ship will be hired and dispatched from Shanghai. The "Shengping" is valued at 300,000 yuan and has 170,000 yuan of insurance coverage with the Ship Insurance Joint Association. Fortunately, the ship was empty at the time of the accident and had not yet loaded cargo in Singapore.

### Li Guochin Travels to Beiping Yesterday

### The Problem of Extraterritorial Road Construction and Taxation Is Difficult to Solve for the Time Being

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the problem of extraterritorial road construction and taxation in the Public Settlement has been discussed by Acting Mayor Yu of the Municipal Government and Director-General Fessenden of the Municipal Council many times and is about to be resolved. However, the Japanese side has created obstacles, demanding that the area of North Sichuan Road be excluded. The Municipal Council held a second board meeting the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss this matter. As a result of the meeting, it was generally agreed that this problem is difficult to solve for the time being and it was decided to postpone it for two weeks, requesting the Japanese side to submit a plan for further discussion.

### Mr. Pierson, General Manager of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, Arrived in Beiping Yesterday Morning

Said to Have No Special Significance; Guarantee Loans to China Not Yet Possible

According to the Continental Daily, Mr. Pierson, General Manager of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 21st) at noon on the President Hoover from Washington. His aim is to investigate China's economic situation in order to expand Sino-American trade. Mr. Pierson said that his trip has no special significance and it is a routine practice of his bank to send people to foreign countries to investigate every year. Last year he went to Europe for investigation. When asked if the United States was considering organizing an export loan syndicate to provide long-term debt guarantees for trade with China, as represented by Sir Kirkpatrick of the British institution, Mr. Pierson replied that such a plan is not yet possible. His trip is not related to such plans. Mr. Pierson was originally the Chief Counsel of the bank and was elected General Manager in 1936. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Pierson visited the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai and had several hours of talks with U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson and U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Gauss. Mr. Pierson plans to stay in China for six weeks to travel around and is scheduled to return to Shanghai around next Sunday. According to Mr. Franze, retired Vice President of Andersen, Meyer & Co., the work of the United States to imitate countries such as Britain and Germany to organize a credit guarantee agency for trade with China has been going on for a long time. When he returned to the United States a year ago, he invited two leaders of major American industries to a meeting in a large hotel in New York to discuss raising funds and jointly organizing a banking company in China with Chinese banks to establish factories. It was proposed to issue bonds worth US$150 million, 80% of which would be underwritten by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and it was decided to elect a standing committee from the industrial community and set up a general office in New York. The purpose of this plan is to make long-term loans in order to expand American export trade to China and invite all manufacturers to join. The percentage of distribution will be determined later. It was later learned that the law under which the U.S. Export-Import Bank was established could not provide guarantees for such large-scale long-term loans, but only for individual operating projects. This plan was therefore suspended and not immediately implemented. However, the Standing Committee continued to carry out all work in the past year. He is planning to go to Europe to investigate the methods used by European governments to promote trade. If he cannot start early, he plans to present the matter to President Roosevelt for assistance. According to supporters of this proposal, China currently imports machinery and other goods worth approximately US$50 million each year, of which the United States accounts for approximately US$6 million. If a loan agreement can be reached with Chinese banks, this number can be increased fourfold. In recent years, American heavy industrial goods imported to China have decreased compared to other countries. In the past, the United States exported steel machinery and other goods to all countries for 500 million, which has now been reduced to 150 million, it is said that it is due to other governments subsidizing merchants and competing with the United States.

Mr. Franze has been in the Far East for 40 years and is a well-known American in Shanghai. He and his wife took the President Grant ship to Europe for a pleasure cruise on Thursday night and will then return to the United States. Mr. Franze has served as President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai for six terms.

### Suiyuan's War of Resistance Commemorative Special Performance at the New Shanghai Theater Today

Filmed by the Film Division of the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission; Extremely Heroic Content; Soon to Transfer to Other Cities

The newsreel short film produced by the Film Division of the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission was praised after its initial screening at the Grand Theatre in Shanghai. After the recent films were well received, the Nanjing Grand Theatre first screened the first series of Guangzhou specials, which featured the beautiful scenery of Guangzhou, historical relics of the revolution, and implied the themes of unification and national salvation, which was deeply moving. The cartoon "Machine Language" which was co-featured with the "Secret Telegram Code" at the Grand Theatre on the 18th, was particularly popular with the public. Premier Sun Yat-sen and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek have given instructions to our people in hundreds of thousands of words, and it is not easy to represent all the clear logic of instructions within a few minutes. Therefore, when the film was shown, at important places such as "Don't seek a way out for individuals, but seek a way out for the whole country," "Modern education is specialized education," "We are not afraid that unequal treaties cannot be abolished, but only afraid that we are not competitive," and "The means of national recovery are to work hard, work fast, and work practically," the audience applauded thunderously. This is indeed a new record for the Grand Theatre, where the audience actually applauded on the spot. Currently, the military news is being screened at the New Shanghai Theatre with the Lianhua Giant Film "The Pearl of Humanity", which clearly demonstrates the new spirit of our country's military and praises Chairman Chiang's hard work and instruction of the soldiers. Therefore, when Chairman Chiang appeared on the screen, some audience members stood up to pay tribute or applauded.

Xi'an Incident Shown at the Great Shanghai Theater

The Xi'an Incident, which was previously filmed on-site by the Film Division, is now scheduled to be shown at the Great Shanghai Theatre on May 5th, at the same time as the Tianyi Company's "Wealth and Glory". It is also heard that in order to enhance the audience's interest, another film produced by the Film Division that has not yet been shown in Shanghai, Chairman Chiang's instructions to the Boy Scouts, will be added. The film was first publicly screened in the National Assembly Hall in the capital for seven consecutive days, all to entertain the military organs and school faculty and students of the capital. When Chairman Chiang addressed the Boy Scouts, he said, "You must take on the responsibility of unifying our China and revitalizing our nation" and "To make our country the first-class country in the world and your nation the first-class nation in the world." His words were earnest and touching. The various performances of the Boy Scouts and the tense and enthusiastic situation during the air defense exercises imply that the future of the new China is limitless.

Suiyuan's War of Resistance Premieres Today

The Suiyuan's War of Resistance Commemoration and National Mourning Service held in Suiyuan last month was also photographed on the spot by the Film Division's photographers who traveled thousands of miles. In order not to lose time, it is now being screened simultaneously at the Dahua and Guomin Theaters in the capital and at the New Shanghai Theater in this port today (the 23rd). After the screening, it will be transported to other places with the Lianhua Giant Film "The Pearl of Humanity". The film features tens of thousands of cavalry and special forces participating in the recovery of Baiyun Temple and the bloody battle of Honggetu. When the memorial service was held, the yellow sand flew, the sky was dark, and the situation was very tragic. In addition, the Film Division used special film-making techniques, when the graves of the martyrs who died in this war of resistance appeared on the screen, the martyrs were resurrected, riding on horses, and rushing forward. Representatives of all the participating parties and the Mengqi princes appeared on the screen, and the first brave soldier to enter Baiyun Temple, Zhang Yangxian, and the unbribable villager Zhang Ziqing, were able to meet the audience in this port. At this time, when the pseudo-bandits are committing crimes again in Suiyuan, the simultaneous performance of this film in Shanghai is of great significance.

Films Reduced for National Screening

It is now reported that the films recently completed by the Film Division, such as slogan cartoons, military news, construction news, and Bofors anti-aircraft guns, have been recommended by the China Film Education Association and reduced to 16mm small films by the China Film Education Supplies Company for the purpose of supplying the public education halls and education departments throughout the country to show educational films. Anyone with a small projector in various places can contact the company.

### The Municipal Council Approves Lenient Licensing for Dumpling and Dim Sum Shops

The dumpling and dim sum shops of the members of the Dumpling Industry Association in this city are all small businesses with simple store installations. Therefore, when they previously applied to the Public Concession Municipal Council for a business license, they were not approved because they did not meet the sanitary regulations. Later, the chairman of the association, Luo Haitao, reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and requested the Municipal Council to deal with it leniently. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has now received a reply from the Municipal Council, agreeing to list the dumpling industry of the association as fourth-class dim sum shops, and the licensing regulations can be looser than those of large-scale restaurants. They can directly apply for a license. The chairman of the association, Luo Haitao, in addition to notifying the members of this situation, also specifically instructed the members to pay attention to sanitation.

### The Cattle and Sheep Industry Association Appeals for Hawkers

Jin Atang, Chen Jinsheng, and others who have been setting up beef stalls in the Hongkou Market purchased several kilograms of slaughtered beef from the French Concession Slaughterhouse on March 2 this year and transported them to the Hongkou Market for sale. Unexpectedly, the upper section of the meat was mistakenly stamped with a water buffalo stamp by the Slaughterhouse, and Jin and others did not notice it because they did not know French. The matter was discovered by officials from the Public Concession Municipal Council Health Department, who pointed out that Jin and others were selling water buffalo meat without authorization, which violated the market regulations. They confiscated the meat and sued Jin and Chen in the First Special District Court. After Jin and others tried their best to defend themselves, the result was that each was fined five yuan and the beef was returned. After Jin and others were sentenced, they immediately paid the fine and went to the Health Department on April 13 to retrieve the beef. However, not only was the beef not retrieved, but the stalls of Jin Atang and Chen Jinsheng were removed by the Health Department at that time, and it was stated that because Jin and others sold water buffalo meat, the stalls should be confiscated. After Jin Atang and Chen Ajin received this punishment, their livelihoods were on the verge of collapse and they suffered an injustice. Therefore, they recently wrote to the Cattle and Sheep Industry Association, requesting assistance. After learning the situation, the association immediately sent representatives to meet with the Public Concession Municipal Council Health Department and requested the return of the beef. However, the Health Department initially stated that the meat was beef and was indeed mistakenly stamped by the French Concession and should be returned after inspection. If it was water buffalo, it should be sent to the court for punishment according to the regulations. It never followed the procedure described above and even removed the business stalls, declaring them confiscated. When the matter was raised again, they replied that they would wait for investigation. The association believed that the authorities were deliberately delaying and damaging the dignity of our country's judiciary. In order to protect the livelihoods of more than one hundred other members, on the 21st of this month, the Cattle and Sheep Industry Association submitted appeals to the Shanghai Special City Party Department, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting assistance.

### The Theft of Fine Sandalwood from the Kinshu Maru

After Investigation by the Water Police Station, the Case Has Been Solved; All Arrested Criminals, Along With the Recovered Loot, Have Been Sent to the District Court; The Recovered Stolen Goods Await Collection by the Owner

Liu Jiang Kee Sandalwood Shop of this port recently purchased 272 tons of sandalwood from Australia and entrusted it to the Japanese ship Kinshu Maru for transport back to Shanghai. The value of this cargo, including freight, amounted to a substantial sum of over 2.6 million yuan. According to usual practice, sandalwood

passes through the tropics

by sea. After the water evaporates, the weight must decrease. Therefore, the owner usually does not pursue any weight loss from the previous voyage until the goods are unloaded. After the Kinshu Maru arrived in Shanghai on the 8th of this month, it stopped between buoys number 5 and 6 of the Shanghai Customs outer harbor in Hongkou, awaiting unloading. Unexpectedly, the ship's foreman, Chen Rongbiao, a native of Jiangbei (also known as Chen Tieniu, a fierce man with considerable strength in the Pujiang area), took advantage of this opportunity and colluded with dockworkers in two or three groups. On the evening of the 9th, they first hired rowboats, mooring alongside the ship and collaborating from

inside and out

to steal several thousand catties of sandalwood, secretly transporting it away and selling it in various locations. Unfortunately, their scheme was discovered by Hu Changqing, an investigator from the Customs Police Station, who reported the matter to the police chief. The chief ordered Huang Songsheng, Cheng Yongnian, and other investigators to conduct a thorough secret investigation. On the afternoon of the 10th, they first arrested Yang Erbao, one of the first group of criminals involved in the case, at the Weisaigong Wharf in East Shanghai. Yang confessed to the involvement of Zhang Xiaoxiang and several other accomplices. Subsequently, Zhang was apprehended on Qichangzhan Street in Pudong,

confessing to the sale

of the stolen goods at the Hu Yuan opium paper shop at number 248 Qichangzhan Street. The investigators, together with the Pudong Branch Bureau, took the shop owner Hu Yuanli into custody, along with more than 90 catties of the recovered stolen goods, for interrogation. The investigators then proceeded to pursue the second group of criminals involved in the case. After investigating for ten days, on the morning of the 19th, they arrested Yuan Akun (nicknamed Yuan Shikai) and Ren Zhengtang, two thieves, at the Huishan Wharf in Pudong. They also apprehended Yin Yuandao at the Zhaoshang Hua Warehouse in Pudong,

bringing them to the police station

where they confessed, along with other accomplices, including Gu Liangjia, who was still at large, to conspiring with Chen Tieniu to transport more than 1,200 catties of stolen goods to a secret location on the wasteland of the Tai Tong Warehouse in Pudong. Five or six days ago, under the direction of someone, they transported the entire stash of stolen goods through the gate of the Weisheng Qi incense workshop in the Lujiazui port of Pudong for weighing. The investigators immediately took Yuan, along with the Pudong Branch Bureau, to search the Weisheng Qi incense shop, but found nothing. Chen Xiyu, the shop's accountant, stated that the stolen goods had been hired by Ge Qingyuan

to transport and sell

to the nearby Bingchang Tiandong Changxing store at number 21, the Shao Jin Kee incense workshop, and the Jin Yong Yu incense workshop at number 72 in the same neighborhood. Ge lived in the Yangjing area, and so on. The investigators then rushed to Yangjing, led by the accountant, and identified and arrested Ge. They also took the owners of the two incense workshops, Shao Jinxing and Jin Awei, along with the branch bureau, to the bureau. ㊄ According to Ge's interrogation by the director, the sandalwood was forcefully pushed by Cai Yiren, a partner in the Yuan Rongsheng store at number 90, 18 Jian, Pudong, who claimed to be unaware that it was stolen goods. According to the confession, the bureau continued to pursue and apprehend Cai, who confessed that he had bought the stolen goods from the thief Yuan Akun and entrusted Ge to sell them. The branch director ordered that Ge be handed back to the investigators, and the two incense workshop owners were

released on bail pending further investigation

Cai was sent directly to the headquarters for disposal. At this point, the Water Police Station had solved the two major theft cases. However, the principal offender, Chen Rongbiao, was still hiding without a trace. After an extensive search, Chen was finally arrested at 11:00 am yesterday. He confessed to the detailed plans for stealing and selling the stolen sandalwood. The police chief immediately prepared a document yesterday afternoon and sent all the arrested criminals, along with the recovered loot, to the District Court for trial. The recovered stolen goods await collection by the owner.

### Where is Yang Qingchang, Whom Yang Zheng Fengying is Seeking from Tang Xiangying?

Zheng Seeks Compensation for Emotional and Reputational Damages; Tang Xiangying Claims to Know Nothing

Yang Qingchang, the son of the late Zhejiang Military Governor Yang Shande, a native of Anhui, was living with Tang Xiangying, a Viennese dancer he was passionately in love with, at number 41 Gao Fuli, Shengmuyuan Road. On the 19th of last month, Yang's wife, Yang Zheng Fengying, discovered the address and reported it to the French police, who arrested both Yang and Tang and handed them over to the Special Second Court. The police department prosecuted them for adultery, and the court sentenced each of them to two months' imprisonment, commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. However, after Yang regained his freedom, he

has not returned home

Yang Zheng Fengying, believing that Tang Xiangying intentionally enticed her husband, Yang Qingchang, to leave his family, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the criminal division of the Special Second Court, accusing Tang Xiangying of disrupting the family. She also filed a civil suit, seeking one million yuan in compensation for emotional and reputational damages, and requesting the court to order the defendant to pay the compensation. After presiding Judge Liao 𡎑 opened the court for a hearing on the 15th of this month, the case was postponed because the defendant did not appear. Yesterday, another subpoena was issued for a continued hearing. Both parties arrived with their lawyers, but the person concerned, Yang Qingchang, received the subpoena, but

still did not appear

The court questioned Tang Xiangying, who stated that she was 20 years old, a native of Shanghai, and had given up dancing. She currently resided at number 43 Gao Fuli, Shengmuyuan Road. She had not previously been subject to criminal punishment. She did not appear at the last hearing due to illness. The court asked the plaintiff where Yang Qingchang was now. She replied that he was with the defendant. She continued to state her case, saying that after Yang Qingchang met Tang Xiangying in August of last year, he rarely came home, taking a week or so off and then returning once for three or four days,

then leaving again

When asked, he always said he was at a friend's house or had gone to an outer wharf. This time, he left on January 4th of this year and has not returned. He is infatuated with Tang Xiangying and does not want to come back. My husband and I used to have a very good relationship. Now, in addition to accusing her of disrupting the family, I am seeking compensation for one million yuan because my husband has been enticed away, and my emotional and reputational status has been affected, and also I lost a child as well. The court questioned the defendant, Tang Xiangying, who said that she had been dancing in Vienna for three years. She met Yang Qingchang at the dance hall in early February of this year, but they had no relationship. He was a dance patron. On March 19th at 2:00 am, after the dance hall closed, he accompanied me to Haigarden for refreshments and then sent me home. It happened to be raining, and he stepped through the mud. He was sitting on the sofa in my house, warming himself by the stove, when someone

knocked on the door and caught us in adultery

We were not in bed, and our clothes were properly put on. Later, I was fined 120 yuan. If I appealed, I would have to hire a lawyer and spend more than 100 yuan, so I did not appeal. On March 30th, I did not ride in a car with Yang Qingchang. That day, around 1:00 am, I went to the home of my little sister, Li Lijuan, at number 14 Yong'anli, Baer Road, for a Qingming meal and then played mahjong until 6:00 pm when I went home. On the 14th of this month, the First Special District Court opened a hearing, and my father did not accompany Yang Qingchang. I changed my surname from Qiu because my

dancing was not good

to listen to. My father's name is Qiu Linfang. I really don't know where Yang Qingchang is now, and he is not in my house. According to the plaintiff Yang Zheng Fengying, Tang's father accompanied Yang Qingchang to the First Special District Court on the 14th. I did not recognize him, but a constable, Li Amao, saw him and told me. Tang's father also came to eavesdrop today. When he heard me mention it, he left because he felt guilty. If I saw him, I would recognize him. Now, his father and daughter are asking Yang Qingchang

for two thousand yuan

Once they get the money, they will let Yang Qingchang go home. Tang again claimed that this was not true. The court then summoned the witnesses Li Amao and Li Lijuan from both parties for questioning. The court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to 2:00 pm on the 29th for further questioning. The defendant was ordered to deposit 300 yuan as a guarantee to appear when summoned and was temporarily entrusted to her lawyer to take away. The occurrence of this case has attracted considerable attention, and the spectators' seats yesterday were quite crowded.

### Yao Guisheng's Two Cases of Red Pills are Tried Concurrently

The Debate on the Red Pill Case Concludes; The Fraud Case is Pronounced on the Same Day

Yao Guisheng, a native of Changzhou, was detained by the French police and brought to the Special Second Court for prosecution for manufacturing red pills. He was sentenced to four years and four months imprisonment and fined 4,000 yuan. Yao refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court, but the appeal was rejected. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which has now revoked the original judgment and remanded the case to the Higher Third Branch Court for retrial. Yao was also sued by his nephew, Yao Fulin, who accused Yao, his wife Ge, and their son Dehua of embezzling jointly owned property. The Special Second Court initially ruled that the Yao couple and their son were not guilty, and the ancillary civil suit was dismissed. Later, Yao Fulin also appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court. The Higher Third Branch Court repeatedly opened hearings, summoned witnesses, and concluded the investigation. Yesterday, a collegial panel was opened at the same time for trial. Presiding Judge Wu, along with Judges Chen and Zhang, and Prosecutor Dong, were present in the Criminal Third Court. First, the red pill case was tried. Lawyer Fei Xizhen from the police department appeared in court. The court first questioned Yao Guisheng about the reasons for his appeal, and then summoned the witness Huo Shousheng, a red pill trafficker brought by the headquarters. Witnesses Wang Weigeng and Xu Jinrong, and Yao's nephews Fulin and Fukang, were questioned. Yao's two nephews stated in detail the process of Yao's establishment of the Longxing Company to manufacture red pills. The court then reviewed the accounts, and the debate was declared concluded, with the sentence scheduled to be pronounced on the 24th of this month. Then, the court questioned the appellant Wan Fulin, the appellees Yao Guisheng, Aunt Ge, and Yao Dehua in the self-accusation case of embezzlement of property. After more than an hour of debate, the proceedings were also declared concluded, with the sentence scheduled to be pronounced on the same day as the previous case. Yao Guisheng was still sent back to the detention center.

### The Wet Nurse Abducts the Young Master; the Paramour is Arrested

The Ji family, whose surname is Ji, residing at 208 Kanghua Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, and working for the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, had their fifteen-month-old young master, named Genfu, abducted by the wet nurse Shen Chen on the morning of the 4th of this month. It has been almost twenty days since then, and there is still no news of the young hostage. Details of the case were published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the General Investigation Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau, Sixth Division, has arrested the wet nurse Shen Chen's paramour for interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Zhang Guisheng, also known as Wang Asi, 39 years old, from Taixing. He used to be a partner in the Jinchengyu clothing store at number 8 Hexing Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. Last summer, when the Ji family across the street in Hexing Lane married off a daughter, he was hired to make the wedding clothes for more than six months. During this time, he had an affair with the wet nurse. They often went to hotels for secret rendezvous. The Ji family worked in the PWD model workshop and could earn two or three hundred yuan per month. He has three wives, three sons, and two daughters. I made the wedding clothes for the second daughter, who was seventeen years old when she married last year. There is also an older daughter who is waiting to be married, and an older son who has already married a wife. A baby boy was born in January of this year, so the Ji family is now three generations under one roof. There is also a son who is fifteen years old and is in school. The one taken away by Chen is the youngest one. On the 3rd of this month, Chen came to me and said that his family (referring to the Ji family) was about to wean him, and she decided to take the child away. I told him that this was illegal. She said it didn't matter and asked me to open room number 9 in the New Shanghai Hotel on Robert Road in the concession in advance, using the alias Wang Asi. Chen taught me this. The next morning (that is, the 4th), around 7:00 or 8:00 am, Chen brought the young master Genfu to the hotel and told me to quickly find a good house. I went to the Hu family at number 90 Rongqing Lane, Jisifei Road, Caojiadu, and found a good room for three yuan and five cents a month. That afternoon, I returned to the New Shanghai Hotel and went to Rongqing Lane number 9 with Chen to see the house. She also asked me to write a note with the address of number 9 Rongqing Lane, Jisifei Road, Caojiadu. She then took the young master away. She said that after everything was settled, she would definitely send me a letter in about ten days, but until now, there has been no letter. When she left, she said she was going to her hometown in Gaoyou, but I really don't know where she went. I also heard that the Ji family had previously received a letter from Chen demanding a ransom, but when they sent the money to negotiate, the woman's father was too afraid to show up, so they are currently waiting for her whereabouts in order to prepare the money to redeem the young hostage and settle the matter.

### The Police Seize Evidence of a Russian Forging Passports

Luo Ganqinggu is an Artist; the Czech Consulate Certifies the Forgery

The Public Concession Police Department has recently received secret reports that someone is specializing in forging passports for bridge residents of various countries. They began investigating and, at approximately 7:00 am on the morning before yesterday, by the Chief Investigation Office, Sergeant Bibeining, Detective Ke Qiangsi Gai, discovered that Luo Ganqinggu, a Russian residing at number 26, Lane 47, Chengdu Road, was suspected of involvement in this case. They then requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant to arrest the Russian. 　A Czech Slav passport, a sample seal, a printer, a Persian passport, all of which were forged, six aviation lottery tickets, three of which had their numbers washed off, four date seals, and a slip of paper with the name and age of a certain Western woman were found and taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to Criminal Court 8 of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him under Articles 212 and 218 of the Criminal Law for forging documents and seals, and stated the case, saying that after the police learned that the defendant was suspected of forging passports, they requested the court to issue a warrant to search and seize the above-mentioned items. It was discovered that the defendant was an artist who specializes in manufacturing wax figures for display in store windows and is proficient in printing, photography, carving, chemistry, etc. He had previously been punished for forging passports, so the court was requested to order him to confess truthfully so that the police could start an investigation. Then the seized items were presented to the court. The secretary of the Czech Slav Consulate then testified that the passport and seal seized by the police were all forged. When questioned, the defendant made evasive statements, saying that the passport and seal were purchased from someone else for his own use when he left Shanghai. Judge Huang verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained and re-examined after seven days in the afternoon farewell court.

### Wu Longhe Wants to Divide Li Boxun's Estate

The Plaintiff Claims to be the Adopted Son of Boxun's Third Daughter; Succession by Representation is Limited to Lineal Relatives

Li Boxun, the former Qing Dynasty envoy to England, was the son of Prime Minister Li Hongzhang. After retiring from his post, he lived as a recluse in Dalian. He had three sons and five daughters. The eldest son was Li Guodao, the second son had died early, the third son was Li Guoxiao, the eldest daughter married Yang Yunshi, a talented scholar from Jiangnan, the second daughter married Pan, the third daughter

married Wu 　Yuchang of Anhui, the fourth daughter Li Guohua married Liu, and the fifth daughter Li Guoyun was still underage. Li Boxun died in Dalian on September 23rd of the Republic of China's 23rd year, leaving a very large estate, which was jointly inherited by his children. Last year, Yang Yunshi's children Yang Wei, Yang Yin, Yang Jinyin, Ruan Yang Chongyin, Hu Yang Ruiyin, Zhu Yang Yiyin, etc., based on the current Civil Code's provision that nephews and nieces can inherit their maternal grandfather's estate in place of their mothers, filed a lawsuit against Li Guodao's siblings, etc., to divide the property. In the Special First Court, the Yang family won. Now, Wu Longhe, the adopted son of Li Boxun's third daughter, also follows

after the Yangs etc

Suing Li Guodao, Li Guoxiao, Li Guohua, Li Guoyun, Li Jiaji (adopted son of Boxun's second son), Pan Yaorong (son of Boxun's second daughter), and others, a total of twelve people against the Yang siblings, in the First Special District Court, to divide Boxun's estate. The reasons are roughly as follows: the plaintiff's father was the husband of Boxun's third daughter. The plaintiff's father died in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign without any children. The plaintiff was originally the brother's nephew of his father, born in the third year of the Xuantong reign,

just an infant

He was adopted by his late mother as her adopted son. His late mother died in the 7th year of the Republic of China, while his maternal grandfather died in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. According to Article 1140 of the Civil Code, nephews and nieces can inherit their maternal grandfather's estate in place of their mothers. Furthermore, according to Article 7 of the Implementation Law of the Inheritance Chapter of the Civil Code, those who were adopted before the implementation of the Civil Code are treated the same as children born in marriage. Therefore, according to law, the plaintiff can inherit Boxun's estate. The list of Boxun's estate includes dozens of properties in Wuhu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, as well as 103,000 yuan in Taiping Bank stocks, 40,000 yuan in Huaan Insurance Company stocks, 30,000 yuan in Taicang Litai Textile Company stocks, and 70,000 taels in Taiping Bank deposits, totaling approximately 400,000 yuan. However, because he is unable to pay the litigation fees, he is requesting

legal aid

and using the Yu Kang Hardware Store on North Suzhou Road as collateral. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Luo Can in the Civil Court Four. Except for Li Guoxiao and Pan Yaorong, whose summonses were delivered to Song Ceng, the other defendants all hired lawyers such as He Shimei to appear in court as agents. First, Wu Longhe clarified the facts of the lawsuit, and then said that he has been unemployed for a long time and is extremely poor. In law and in sentiment, he has the right to inherit by representation. Then, lawyer He Shimei rose to reply, saying that the current law

adopts the bloodline system

Therefore, the succession by representation in Article 1140 of the Civil Code is also limited to direct blood relatives. According to Interpretation No. 744 of the Judicial Yuan in the 21st year of the Yuanzi, the children of the stepmother cannot inherit in place of the former daughter. This also proves that succession by representation must be limited to direct blood relatives. However, in this case, the plaintiff is only an adopted son and has no right to compete for inheritance according to the law. He also cited various interpretations and precedents as the basis, requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit and ordering him to bear the litigation costs. After Judge Luo verified and analyzed the arguments, he ordered the case to be postponed for further hearing.

### Shen Junya and Cai Xuzhou are in Litigation Over Pregnancy

Shen Sues Cai for Causing an Abortion; Cai Completely Denies the Pregnancy; Because the Court Recognizes Spouses, It Cannot Accept the Case

Cai Xuzhou (also known as Cai Huhuh), the owner of the Cai Xuji Construction Factory on Xiaoshadu Road, is a local who is 57 years old. He started his business with construction and accumulated a considerable fortune. He has multiple wives and concubines at home. Recently, Cai was suddenly sued by his wife, Shen Junya, who hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Special First Court, accusing him of fraud, bigamy, assault, and abortion, claiming that the plaintiff, Shen Junya, was approached by the defendant's step-wife, Zhao Meizhen, who falsely claimed that he was not yet 30 years old, his original wife had died, and he wanted to marry her. They married on August 23rd of the lunar calendar in the 23rd year of the Republic of China at the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Soon after, the defendant took Wang Jindi, a 16-year-old girl, as a concubine, treating the plaintiff as an eyesore and frequently abusing her. Later, Wang Jindi died after being forced to have an abortion, and Wang's father sued the defendant in the District Court. As a result, the defendant was sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment. Recently, the defendant, seeing that the plaintiff was pregnant, forced her to have an abortion again. The plaintiff, seeing Wang Jindi's death, did not dare to obey, resulting in another beating, hence the lawsuit. This case has already been heard once by the Special Court, and a postponement was ordered. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Fu Lin presided over the hearing in the Criminal Court Eight. The defendant hired lawyers Chen Tingshuo, Fan Gang, and Li Binsen to appear in court, while the plaintiff Shen Junya, who is only 22 years old, also arrived with lawyer Shen Xingxia. White hair and red faces, they faced each other in court. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Shen Xingxia, first stated that the complaint in this case was not written by this lawyer. This lawyer only received the commission today, and after reading the complaint in detail, found that there were discrepancies, specifically regarding the point of fraudulent marriage, for which a lawsuit to confirm identity has been filed separately in the civil court, so the court should stop the trial. As for the other three parts of bigamy, assault, and abortion, according to the law, spouses cannot file a private prosecution, so the court should rule accordingly. Then, the plaintiff Shen Junya stated that she was 22 years old, a local, and lived at her mother's home at number 4, Lane 4, Fahua New Village. She is currently three months pregnant, and the defendant, relying on his wealth, is having an affair with someone else and wants to bring her home, so he ordered me to have an abortion, promising to give me 10,000 yuan. But considering the actual situation, the defendant does not actually dislike infants, but really wants to cause me to have an abortion and die, so that his paramour can enter his house. When questioned, the defendant denied that the plaintiff's pregnancy was his. Since the plaintiff left in September of last year, she has not often stayed at my place. The trial judge ruled that since the plaintiff herself recognized herself as the defendant's spouse, she could not file a private prosecution according to the law, and immediately ruled that this case was not accepted.

### Stealing Deeds Worth Hundreds of Thousands is Discovered From the Signature

Zhou Huilin Knows She Has No Status; White Discovers Various Flaws

Xi Lanjing, a native of Hangzhou, is 72 years old and started his business by managing commerce. He owns a lot of real estate in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qingdao, and other places. In addition to a residence at 21 Mashi Street, Hangzhou, his residence is also at 30, Lane 549, Seward Road, Shanghai. Xi's first wife had four sons, Deshen, Furen, Fukang, and Fuquan, all of whom live in Shanghai. Ten years ago, he took Zhou Huilin (also known as Zhiru, 42 years old), a woman from Ningbo, as a concubine. Recently, Xi has been old and ill, so he often lives in Hangzhou. He died on February 23rd of this year. Zhou, knowing that she has no legal status herself, and that it will be difficult to share in the property of Qilanqing in the future, colluded with the accountant Hu Shulin (also known as Jinlin), and Fu Jiapu (also known as Chunqi), etc., to steal the deeds of all movable and immovable property of Xi Lanjing worth about hundreds of thousands, hiding them in a silver box stored in Fu Jiapu's home at 10 Jingyun Village, Hangzhou. However, Xi's sons, Deshen, etc., were unaware. However, Xi had purchased 770 shares of Shanghai Water and Electricity Company stock during his lifetime (worth about 8,000 yuan). This stock certificate also fell into Zhou's hands. In order to avoid future disputes, on March 16th of this year, he ordered Hu Shulin and Fu Jiapu to come to the Water and Electricity Company on Yuqiaqing Road, Shanghai, to apply for the transfer of the shares to Zhou Huilin's name. However, after the company's secretary, White, examined Xi Lanjing's signature on the transfer application, he found that although it was consistent, it was old and worn, while the three characters "Zhou Huilin" written above were very new, so he suspected something was amiss. For caution's sake, he sent letters to Xi's residences in Hangzhou and Shanghai to inquire, which caused this secret to be discovered by Xi Deshen and others. He immediately declared to the Water and Electricity Company that his father had died on February 23rd, and that the application for transfer was made on March 16th, when his father was already dead, so how could he apply for the transfer again? He was ordered to pay attention. Then, on April 14th, when Hu Shulin, accompanied by Peng Ren from Sichuan, went to the company to collect the new stock certificate, White notified Xi Deshen's agent lawyer Zhao Chuanding, who reported it to the Laozha Police Station, ordering detective Chen Shanji to arrest Hu and Peng. A copy of the general list of immovable property placed by Xi Lanjing in Qingniao was found on Peng's body, and they were escorted to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. However, Xi Deshen and others, having discovered that Zhou had put the stolen goods in a silver box and the location where the box was hidden, requested the Hangzhou Municipal Government to impound it. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing of this case in the Criminal Court One. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted Hu under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and requested an extension of detention for Peng, and said that Zhou Zhilin and Fu Jiapu, who were arrested by detectives in Hangzhou, had both fled. The police went to the Hangzhou Police Bureau to retrieve the impounded silver box, but the bureau stated that it had been impounded by order of the municipal government, so it had to be notified by the municipal government before it could be retrieved. The court should write to the Hangzhou Municipal Government separately, allowing the silver box to be brought to Shanghai. Then, White testified about the circumstances of the defendants' application for the transfer. Judge Feng Shide briefly questioned the two defendants, Hu and Peng, and then ordered that the case be adjourned for a week for further hearing.

### Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank 1936 Business Report (Continued)

5. Progress in Economic Construction. Finally, another factor contributing to prosperity is that, despite the tensions in Sino-Japanese negotiations and the Liangguang Incident during the year, the government continued to make unremitting efforts in economic construction. The number of highways in various provinces increased daily, and railway construction also progressed rapidly. With the convenience of transportation, the sales of goods became smoother, which greatly benefited industry and commerce. Among the major construction projects, the completion of the Aohan Railway, which runs through the central part of our country, has significant commercial and military implications. In addition, the Sujia branch line of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Huainan Railway were opened to traffic. Furthermore, the southern sections of the Jinggan and Zhegan Railways, as well as the Chuanxiang and Chuanqian Railways, are also under active construction. The consolidation of old debts on various railways has been particularly successful. Therefore, the price of overseas railway public bonds has remained stable, which shows that the Chinese government's foreign credit is becoming stronger and stronger. This is also something for us to celebrate.

The factors of prosperity this year are generally as follows. A diagram is attached to illustrate the economic trends after the currency system reform.

### Income Tax Collection Guidelines for All Categories

Issued by the Ministry of Finance

Income Tax Collection Guidelines for Category II: Salaries and Remuneration (Continued)

(10) Labor insurance expenses for workers may be deducted from salaries and remuneration.

(11) Freelancers and others engaged in various businesses who have joint business premises should calculate their income and expenses separately based on their allocated share.

(12) For income from salaries and remuneration calculated on a monthly basis, income for less than one month should be taxed based on the actual amount of income and the original salary rate. For example, if Mr. A's fixed monthly salary is 400 yuan and he leaves after half a month with an actual payment of 200 yuan, he should be taxed at the original salary rate of 400 yuan, which is 4.8 yuan. If the actual income is less than 30 yuan, it is tax-exempt.

(13) For income from salaries and remuneration calculated on a daily, hourly, or piecework basis, the actual amount of income for that month should be used to calculate the tax.

(14) If government agencies or employers fail to pay full salaries on a monthly basis, the tax should be calculated and levied according to the following regulations:

1. For those who receive discounted salaries, the tax should first be calculated and levied based on the actual amount paid. When the balance is paid, the balance should be combined with the amount already paid to calculate the supplemental tax. For example, if Mr. A's monthly salary is 300 yuan and he first receives 60%, or 180 yuan, the tax should be calculated and levied temporarily based on the salary rate for the amount already paid, which is 2.2 yuan. When the remaining 40%, or 120 yuan, is paid, it should be combined with the amount already paid to calculate the total tax, which is 5.6 yuan per month based on the salary rate for 300 yuan. After deducting the 2.2 yuan already paid, 2.4 yuan should be supplemented each month.

2. If salaries are paid through advances, the tax should be calculated and levied based on the actual amount borrowed in each month, according to the calculation method in the previous clause.

(15) For income from salaries and remuneration calculated on an annual basis, the total amount of income for the year should be divided by the number of months in a year. The result is the average amount per month. For example, if Mr. A's annual salary is 1,200 yuan, dividing by 12 gives an average of 100 yuan per month, with a tax of 0.6 yuan. The total tax for the twelve months is 7.2 yuan, which should be withheld and paid at the same time.

(16) If income is paid periodically, such as salaries and remuneration calculated on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, or if bonuses are paid periodically, the amount of income should be divided by the number of months in the period, according to the method in the previous clause.

(17) If income from salaries and remuneration includes both monthly and annual income, or other periodic income, the income should be combined and averaged. For example, if Mr. A's monthly salary is 300 yuan and he pays 5.6 yuan in income tax each month, and he also receives an annual bonus of 1,200 yuan at the end of the year, the amount of the annual bonus should be divided by the number of months in a year. The average amount of income per month is 100 yuan. Adding this to the monthly salary of 300 yuan, Mr. A's average monthly income is 400 yuan, which should be taxed at 5.6 yuan per month. After deducting the 5.6 yuan already withheld each month, an additional tax of 4 yuan is required each month, for a total supplemental tax of 48 yuan for the entire year. This should be paid together with the annual bonus. If Mr. A's monthly salary increases or decreases during the year, the calculation should be made in accordance with the methods listed above when supplementing the tax.

(18) The amount of income tax for salaries and remuneration should be calculated according to the attached table.

(19) When paying salaries and remuneration each month, the heads of various agencies or employers should deduct the income tax payable by their direct public officials or employees, and pay it directly to other central banks or tax collection agencies entrusted by them, obtain receipts, and fill out Category II, Form A or C income reports, along with a withholding list, and report to the local competent collection agency. If there are any circumstances mentioned in items 13 to 16 of this notice, the withholding agency should provide a separate explanation when reporting.

(20) Freelancers and others engaged in various businesses who do not have business premises should submit a Category II, Form B report at the end of each year, with the average amount of income for each month. If expenses need to be deducted, a statement of income and expenses should also be submitted to the local competent collection agency for verification of the amount of income and the amount of tax payable on the settlement date, and the tax payable should be paid to the local central bank or tax collection agency entrusted by it within ten days from the date of the report, and receipts should be obtained.

(21) Freelancers and others engaged in various businesses who do not have fixed business premises or fixed employers should report and pay their income tax within fifteen days from the settlement date, following the procedures in the previous item.

(22) If freelancers and others engaged in various businesses fail to provide supporting documents or books when the competent collection agency investigates or reviews, the competent collection agency may directly determine the amount of their income based on the status of their business.

### Our Newspaper's Worker, Dai Xingeng, Passed Away Yesterday

Dedicated Service for Over Twenty Years, Succumbed to Overwork, Lamentable

Mr. Dai Xingeng, a worker at our newspaper, served our establishment for over twenty years. He was always diligent in his duties and was amiable and friendly with his colleagues. In 1927, when the workers in the entire newspaper industry organized the Newspaper Workers' Union, Mr. Dai was one of the initiators from our newspaper. Since then, he has spared no effort in promoting the labor movement and has gained the trust of all the workers. Mr. Dai's health was weak, and he succumbed to overwork, falling ill for only a little over ten days, which led to him being bedridden. He passed away on the morning of the 21st of this month at his home in Yiqing Lane, Yiqing Street, Fangbang Road, Nanshi. Mr. Dai is survived by his elderly mother, wife, and children. His family is in dire straits, and there are many children to feed, making their future life difficult to sustain. It is deeply lamentable.

### The Misfortune of Pornographic Magazines

— Yiren

There was a time when picture magazines specializing in photographs of female celebrities were all the rage; this was truly a good business. By "good business" I mean that the capital investment was small, the profit was high, and it was a triple win, with not only a hefty sum in one's pocket, but also the subject of the photograph benefiting from the publicity.

At this time, there were quite a few "artists" who made a living by relying on the beauty of female celebrities. But good times don't last forever. I don't know if it's because readers have become more sophisticated, or because they are tired of looking at these celebrities' faces, or because there is profit to be made and there are too many magazines of this kind. Later, it seemed that there was gradually no profit to be made. A good business that is no longer profitable, and sometimes even loses some capital, is naturally abandoned by those who see the signs. Others feel that continuing in this way is "not a good business strategy," so they can only turn their attention to the clothes of the female celebrities, hanging the sign of "sacrifice for art" in front, as a "tacit understanding" target. After that, business did improve. However, readers' desires are hard to fill, and female celebrities ultimately have their status and "dignity." It seems inconvenient to undress again and again, and to undress more and more. Under such circumstances, the clever "artists" also "changed their style." The jade photos of female celebrities gradually decreased, and were replaced by some "stark naked" photos. The readers' desire to "eat ice cream with their eyes" was achieved, so it was "quite profitable." And since the money was bought, it was naturally considered to be saving the day, and it looked "very good."

As a result, the book and newspaper business was very promising again, so those who had closed down before have now "made a comeback." However, the names have all been changed. Those that were previously called something like "movie," or "movie something," are now called something like "beauty" or "health," etc. In the inaugural speeches, they also put away the previous signboard of discovering "film art" and instead hung up a new signboard that said, "Promote fitness."

Promoting fitness, this name is much more resonant than promoting any film art. It seems to have the burden of reviving the nation, and the material is also easy to obtain. Just spend three or five yuan and hire a "woman" casually. If even this is too much trouble, then buy a few foreign pornographic magazines, flip through a version, and it's enough for readers to have their "souls sit on a sofa."

However, now it seems that these "fitness" magazines are about to be in trouble. In addition to searching bookstores, the police are also preparing to file a public prosecution on the grounds of "offending good morals." As for what the result will be, let the facts unfold. But in my opinion, it cannot be completely banned, because it can be "renamed" and come back again. These "artists" basically only have this "signature skill."

Then will it always be like this? Not necessarily: readers are progressing; as for those who "sink down," they will also want something more "sunken," unless erotic books and sex books can be sold openly. But even if they can be sold openly, that time will definitely not be the same as the current "ice cream eaten by the eyes," and that is also predictable.

### On the Frontier

— He Qi

It is the season when the accumulated snow is just beginning to melt. The vast plains beyond the Great Wall have just shed their white coats and are once again revealing a distant expanse of yellow sand.

The weather is exceptionally fine. The morning sun shines warmly, and there is not a single wisp of cloud in the sky. The strong winds that used to blow all day long have also become so gentle today, brushing against the face and giving one the exhilarating feeling of having drunk a small amount of wine. The air is filled with the atmosphere of late spring in the south. Yes, the weather today is really good. The Xiongnu chieftain is going to send the group of Han envoys who have been staying beyond the Great Wall for more than ten years back to their country this morning.

A dozen or so camps are sparsely scattered on the desert. The yellow military flags waving on the tents flutter gently in the breeze. Near a camp in the distance, the sound of horns wailing can be heard, and the Xiongnu soldiers from all sides are running towards the place where the horns are being blown. The time is approaching, they are going to escort the Han envoys on their journey and prepare to depart.

Inside the camp where the horns are being blown, a sumptuous feast is laid out. Li Ling and Su Wu are sitting face to face. Su Wu is silent and speechless. After nineteen years of torment, his beard and hair have turned white, his eye sockets are deeply sunken, and his face appears so melancholy and somber. Today he is about to set off to return to his country. The honor after returning to his country fills his heart with joy, but when he thinks of having to say goodbye forever to his Xiongnu wife, with whom he has been loving and intimate for several years, when he remembers the miserable scene of his wife just having given birth, when he thinks that he will have to abandon his baby forever on this desolate frontier, the joy in his heart is quickly driven away by extremely heavy melancholy.

Sitting opposite him, Li Ling's hair has also turned gray. A sense of the tragedy of a hero in his twilight years is projected from his eyes. He is pouring wine and drinking wildly non-stop. The wailing sound of the horns outside the tent, urging them to leave, strikes his heart like a hammer. The parting is imminent. His old friend will return safely, while he himself will wander on this desolate desert until his last day.

"Ziqing, have another drink! We are parting forever. I wish you a safe journey back! ..."

"Don't be too sad. Haven't I said it again and again? We may meet again. I advise you to take care of your health. Drinking wine like this every day will ruin yourself. Besides, there are still many opportunities to serve the Emperor, as long as you are willing to work hard." Su Wu tried his best to suppress his grief and pretended to be calm.

"A defeated general who has surrendered, still wants to return to his homeland? Mother, wife, home, nothing is left, what is there to go back for? The Emperor, the Emperor is too cruel to me, Li. Ziqing, don't you think so?" Li Ling was a little indignant. He drank another full cup.

Su Wu could not think of any words to comfort this heartbroken companion. He thought of how this companion would have to spend his remaining years, until his death, in the icy and snowy wilderness. He also thought of the Xiongnu chieftain's recent cold attitude towards him. His fate is not difficult to imagine. However, what could he do to reverse this already tragic fact?

After a brief silence, Li Ling excitedly spoke again.

"I never expected that I would actually become someone who has a country but cannot return. At that time, my surrender was originally a temporary measure, but who knew that it would become the situation it is now. The Emperor forced me to be unable to make amends for my sins, and those petty officials forced me to live in a foreign land for a long time. Ziqing, only you can understand my heart, only you!" His voice gradually choked up.

The horns outside the tent sounded again. Su Wu and Li Ling both stood up and slowly walked out of the tent. More than a hundred Xiongnu warriors were already lined up neatly. Chang Hui, Xu Sheng, and the other nine Han envoys were also standing in front of their respective horses, ready to depart. Li Ling greeted them one by one and wished them a safe journey back. Then he carefully helped Su Wu onto his horse, his eyes filled with tears.

"Farewell forever. When you meet old friends in Chang'an, tell them that I, Li, am still well, and ask them to put their minds at ease." Tears rolled down Li Ling's cheeks.

"Please take good care of yourself. We'll see you again. Please take care of my wife and children. I entrust you with everything!" Su Wu said in a hoarse voice, his eyes filled with tears, and everything in front of him became blurred.

"Please rest assured, I wish you a safe journey! If you have the time, please give me a few words in a letter. This old friend on the frontier will be very grateful."

The horns sounded again, and Su Wu and the others' horses finally left. Li Ling stood in front of the tent, staring blankly. The people and horses gradually became smaller and blurred. A cloud of yellow sand followed behind their team. They were returning to their homeland. Li Ling was indignant. Suddenly, he wanted to catch up with them and go with them. However, he did not do so. He did not return to the tent until the yellow sand was no longer visible in the distance.

What lies before him is a vast expanse of yellow sand, and what lies ahead are long and lonely years. The desolation of the frontier is bleak, and our general's heart is heavy.

The breeze continues to blow, the sun gradually rises in the sky, and the air is filled with the atmosphere of late spring in the Central Plains!

### Thinking of "Burning Black People Alive"

— Majia

Mr. Lu Xun has a novel called "A Madman's Diary," which depicts the morbid psychology of a "persecution mania" sufferer. Not only did the "madman" suspect that the people around him wanted to eat him, but he even suspected Zhao's dog, thinking that it was in collusion with the "people" who "eat people" to conspire against him. Chekhov's "Ward No. 6" also wrote about a "madman" who, because he saw a policeman escorting a prisoner, suddenly suspected that he would one day be arrested by the police and charged with a crime, on the grounds that he was a clerk in the post office, and people said he was "embezzling." With just a word like that, he would be thrown into a dark prison. Because of this, he was taken into the disguised prison "madhouse." Undoubtedly, these are all descriptions of "morbid psychology," but to say that all such novels "will have a bad influence on young people" is really unreasonable. Why? Because there is this "morbid society," so this "morbid psychology" occurs. Who can say that the world now is not a "man-eating world"? It's just that the methods of eating are slightly different: some eat you alive, like eating a pig, while others eat you invisibly.

For example, in Grenada, Missouri, USA, several black people were arrested and imprisoned for murdering a white merchant. Later, more than a hundred "white" people stormed the prison and took the black people out, subjected them to lynching, tied them to a pillar, piled firewood and burned them to death, so that all the black people died tragically! This is also a way of eating people. White merchants have long been eating black people, but they eat them a little more invisibly. However, the black people were ignorant, wanting to grab something from them to fill their hunger, wanting to fatten themselves up and then be eaten, but unexpectedly they were burned and eaten directly.

In famine-stricken areas of China, there is a phenomenon of "exchanging children to eat," which can be said to be truly "eating people." In the land seized by the enemy, there are those who are "buried alive" and those who are "fed to dogs." Even in land that has not been seized, as soon as an "incident" occurs, the residents around the area will have the possibility of being "eaten," and everyone is "trembling with fear." Don't you see, the Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia was only slightly injured by a bomb, and more than a thousand Abyssinians were taken as the price for the Governor-General's injury! Aren't all these phenomena of "eating people"? Of course, the examples listed here are not "exhaustive"!

However, being in such a "man-eating world," and we are qualified to be "eaten," once we understand that our position is so terrible, how can those with a little less courage not develop a "persecution mania"?

Please, good people, do not laugh at the terrifying actions of madmen. Quickly shed a few tears of sympathy, sharpen your fists, and step forward to open that invisible "madhouse" for yourself and for the poor people!
