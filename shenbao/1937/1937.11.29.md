### A Rumor in New York: China and Russia Conclude a Secret Agreement

The Soviet Union Acknowledges China's Sovereignty over Outer Mongolia.  Wai-pu [Vladivostok] Enters a State of War, Rushing to Build Defenses

[New York] Mr. Colbert, a New York importer, arrived in San Francisco this morning aboard the "China Clipper" from Hong Kong. According to his statement to reporters, he received information from the most reliable sources while in China, stating that China has concluded a secret agreement with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union can indirectly assist China's military activities. The content of the agreement is said to be that the Soviet Union recognizes the Chinese government's sovereignty over Outer Mongolia. Currently, a large number of Soviet troops and aircraft are concentrated there. Mr. Colbert also stated that the agreement also allows Outer Mongolia to assist China in its war of resistance against Japan, without hindering Soviet-Japanese relations. It is said that if the Outer Mongolian military authorities join the Sino-Japanese War, the future of the Sino-Japanese War will inevitably be prolonged and cannot be concluded before next spring. The Chinese government has now signed a contract with the Soviet Union to purchase a large amount of gasoline to supply the aircraft in Outer Mongolia. (Guomin News Agency, 28th)

▲ The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported that, according to intelligence from Moscow and Paris, the entire city of Vladivostok has been built into a large trench. Currently, the city is almost in the same state as wartime alert. Anyone entering the city, not to mention foreigners, even our own citizens must undergo strict inspection before being allowed to enter the city. Regardless of day or night, guard soldiers are stationed and patrol the entire city. There are more people wearing military uniforms than civilian clothes in the city. The surrounding areas are busy building underground defense works. Excellent workers even work in three shifts, rotating day and night. The underground equipment is all made of steel-reinforced long-range gun mounts and power plants. There are bomb shelters everywhere in the city and port. The largest one is an underground hangar that can accommodate 150 aircraft. Several military roads are also under construction. It is estimated that the city's military strength, including the navy, is currently 85,000, and it is continuing to increase.

### The Soviet Union Refuses to Sign the Russo-Japanese Fisheries Agreement

Suggests Reopening Negotiations

[Tokyo] According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Stomonyakov recently stated during a conversation with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru that the Soviet government could not agree to formally sign the revised Russo-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, which was initially signed last October, because the overall situation had already developed. He suggested that negotiations be reopened on the current overall situation to further revise the agreement. He also stated that the Soviet government was rapidly drafting proposals and would be able to submit them in the near future. Japanese trading companies involved in Soviet fisheries are all dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's attitude and are currently holding meetings to discuss the steps to be taken to deal with the new situation. It is reported that the two fisheries agreements were based on the Treaty of Portsmouth and expired last year. After lengthy negotiations, a new agreement was reached. The Soviet government then refused to sign the new fisheries agreement because Japan had concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, and only agreed to extend the old agreement for twelve months. Many believe that the Soviet Union may be unwilling to extend Japan's fishing rights indefinitely because Japan, Germany, and Italy have now formed the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact.

### The Soviet Union Strictly Prevents Espionage Activities

Kalinin's Election Speech

[Moscow] Mikhail Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, recently participated in a meeting in Leningrad for the election of the Federal Council (according to the new constitution, the parliament adopts a bicameral system, one being the Federal Council and the other being the Council of Nationalities). He delivered a speech stating that espionage and sabotage by enemies must be intensified with vigilance. "The city of Leningrad is not only our window to Europe, but also the gateway for a large number of enemies to enter the country. These enemies are colluding with the international bourgeoisie, the most aggressive, namely the fascist reactionaries. We must strengthen our military preparations so that we will not be caught off guard in the event of an emergency." He concluded by saying, "The enthusiasm of the national working masses for supporting the Communist Party and the Soviet system can be seen in this election." (Havas, 28th)

### Koreans in the Maritime Province are Forced to Leave

Japan's Protest to Russia is Rejected

[Moscow] In the Maritime Provinces of eastern Siberia, there were many Koreans who had been naturalized as Soviet citizens. The Soviet government recently ordered them to move inland. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru therefore lodged a protest with the Soviet government, which was rejected. The government stated that these Koreans were Soviet citizens, and the Japanese Embassy had no right to interfere. (Havas, 27th)

### Konoe's Remarks

An Interpretation by the Tokyo Press

[Tokyo] The English edition of the "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun" reported that in a speech by Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro to members of the press last Friday, he stated that Japan might have to resort to force, and that everything depended on the attitude of the Public Concession authorities. Translators now regard this as a serious distortion of the Prime Minister's true intentions. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" today published an editorial commenting on the matter, saying that the Prime Minister's remarks were extremely frank and clear, with very little ambiguity. This move to make Japan's attitude clear to the world is of great significance. The Prime Minister, in briefly outlining the possible developments of Japan's actions in China, stated that if the authorities of the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession do not fulfill the Japanese authorities' requests to suppress anti-Japanese activities, then Japan may be forced to take action. (Reuters, 28th)

### Japan Publicizes the Objectives of its Military Operations to Italy

[Rome] Baron Okura, a Japanese goodwill ambassador, recently delivered a speech at the Italian Institute for the Near and Far East, expressing his gratitude in the name of the Japanese people for Italy's sympathy towards Japan. He said that the main reasons for the current dispute between China and Japan were two: first, China's anti-Japanese propaganda, and second, the continued growth of communist forces within China. "Japan has resolved to do its utmost to fight against communism." In 1936, Japan invited China to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, but the Chinese government not only refused to ratify it but instead concluded a non-aggression pact with Soviet Russia. Currently, Japan's goals in China are no more than: ㊀ joint anti-communism, ㊁ mutual economic cooperation, and ㊂ maintaining peace in the Far East. In terms of economic cooperation, Japan feels a lack of natural resources and seeks raw materials from China and opens up sales channels for its own goods, which is only natural. After the speech, Italian Senator and President of the Institute for the Near and Far East, Chantier, responded, and then many musicians performed ancient and modern Japanese music to entertain the guests.

### Japan Covets Our Customs.  The United States and France, Following Britain, Submit Representations to Japan

Request Respect for Foreign Interests in China.  The Two Countries Negotiate Joint Action

[London] According to sources here, Britain has an investment of 180 million pounds in China, so it is determined to ask Japan to respect foreign interests in response to Japan's coveting of the Chinese customs in Shanghai. The British ambassador to Japan has been instructed to negotiate with the Japanese government, and the financial community here is also putting pressure on Chamberlain to take concrete action. It is now heard that the United Kingdom, the United States and France have a unanimous attitude on this position, and believe that unless a tough stance is taken, the Japanese will completely seize everything in Shanghai. (Guomin News Agency, 27th)

[Washington] US Secretary of State Hull recently instructed Ambassador Grew to notify the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the US government is very concerned about the future of the Chinese customs system, and hopes that Japan will not change the working conditions of the Chinese customs and the distribution of tax revenues. According to reports, this US negotiation was submitted at the same time as other countries concerned. Since Japan expressed its intention to take over the Chinese customs, the British and American governments have conducted formal talks. British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, visited State Department Assistant Wilson yesterday, and the talks were related to this matter. Generally speaking, the US authorities have not considered taking joint action with the United Kingdom and the United States, but if the negotiation submitted by Ambassador Grew does not receive a satisfactory answer, then another discussion will be held. (Havas, 27th) Hull also stated that the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, will be responsible for dealing with all incidents in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession caused by Japanese interference. (Guomin News Agency, 27th)

[Paris] It is heard that the French ambassador to Japan has been instructed to notify the Japanese government that any measures concerning Chinese customs must first be discussed with the French government. This request is the same as the one that the United Kingdom has submitted to Japan. (Reuters, 28th)

[Rome] Regarding the Chinese customs system, the British government recently submitted a representation to Japan. At the same time, a British newspaper reported, "The Shanghai Public Concession is one of the most honorable jewels in the crown of the British Empire." This record has aroused enthusiastic repercussions in the Italian newspapers. Among them, an article by famous reporter Gaida in the "Italian People's Voice" strongly opposed Britain's monopoly on the Shanghai Concession, saying that Britain's rights in the Shanghai Public Concession are only equal to those of other countries concerned. If Britain makes claims on the Shanghai issue alone, it is close to exclusively estimating the Public Concession and cannot be tolerated. (Havas, 28th)

### Staff of the British Embassy Arrive in Hankou

[Hankou] British Chargé d'Affaires He Wu, accompanied by many members of the British Embassy, arrived in Hankou yesterday afternoon on the British gunboat Bee. US Ambassador Johnson and most of the staff of the US Embassy also arrived here at the same time on the US gunboat Luzon. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now temporarily located in the Third Special Zone, that is, the administrative office of the former British Concession. Minister Wang is currently in Changsha and plans to stay for a few days before coming to Hankou. It is heard that if Hankou is attacked in the future, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will move to Sichuan Province and will probably work in Chongqing. (Reuters, 28th)

### Floods in Vietnam

Our Country Sends Remittances for Relief

[Paris] The Chinese government yesterday sent a donation of 500,000 francs to the Governor of Vietnam in French Indochina as relief for the floods there. The Governor of Vietnam telegraphed General Chiang Kai-shek to express his gratitude. (Havas, 28th)

### The Soviet Trade Unions Join the International Trade Union

Joint Resistance to Fascism.  A Major Achievement for the World's Labor Movement

[Moscow] A group led by Pierre Monatte, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), came here from Paris some time ago to negotiate with the Soviet All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU) to join the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), which belongs to the Second International. After five days of negotiations, an agreement was signed, stipulating various conditions for the establishment of a unified organization between the Soviet AUCCTU and the IFTU. The main point is based on the joint resistance to fascism, but the detailed content is kept strictly confidential to avoid early disclosure and cause problems. (Havas, 27th)

[Moscow] Regarding the Soviet AUCCTU's joining the IFTU, it is generally believed that this is a major achievement for the world's labor movement. Most of the world's large-scale labor organizations, except for those belonging to fascist countries, have joined the IFTU. Only the Soviet AUCCTU, with about 20 million members, has remained outside. Now, after Monatte's contact, it has decided to join again. In addition, the Mexican Confederation of Labor, with a total of 4 million members, joined the IFTU last year. The Irish Free State General Confederation of Labor has applied to join, but has not paid its dues, and the IFTU has not formally recognized it. Other organizations, such as the Australian Commonwealth, the South African Union, and the New Zealand General Confederation of Labor, have not joined, but their relationship with the IFTU is still very good, and it will not be difficult to join one after another in the future. Regarding the international labor movement, someone recently asked Pierre Monatte, Secretary-General of the French CGT, whether the world's working class can take unified action in politics. He replied that this was beyond his ability to answer and that the trip was limited to trade union organizational issues. (Havas, 28th)

### Another Big Fire in the Southern District Yesterday

In the Southern District, near Xiaonanmen, Lin Yin Road, and Lao Ximen, a fire suddenly broke out at about 2 pm yesterday. For a time, black smoke billowed into the sky and flames spread in all directions, creating a tragic scene. It was still burning until evening. At about 8 am yesterday, a sudden fire broke out in a residential area behind the Gonghe Soy Sauce Garden in the Wujiaochang area of Zili South Road in western Shanghai. For a time, the fire was extremely fierce. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire in about half an hour. More than a dozen houses were destroyed, but the cause of the fire is unknown.

### Wang Faqin and Others Arrive in Hong Kong by Ship

[Hong Kong] Wang Faqin, Ye Gongchuo, Li Dingan, and Wu Liande arrived in Hong Kong on the Candeloro Russell on the 28th. Dozens of senior staff members of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Central Trust Bureau also came to Hong Kong on the same ship to transfer to Hankou. (Special Dispatch, 28th)

### The Changxing Front is Breached, Fierce Fighting Erupts in Si'an Town

Japanese Troops Attempt to Invade Guangde in Southern Anhui.  Guerrilla Warfare Continues to Unfold on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line.  Artillery Battles Near Jingjiang are Extremely Fierce.

Due to telegraphic delays, detailed news on the battles on both sides of Taihu Lake and on the East Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines is scarce. According to foreign sources, Wuxi and Changxing have fallen. The war news obtained by this newspaper is listed below: ㊀ Although the county seat of Wuxi has been breached by the Japanese army and our army has moved west, fierce fighting continues in the vicinity of the suburbs. After the Japanese army arrived in Wuxi, it divided its troops along the Xicheng Highway to attack our Jiangyin Fortress. Fierce fighting has broken out between the railway line and the Yangtze River coast. Our army in the fortress has solid defenses and is still engaged in fierce artillery battles with Japanese warships in the river. The Japanese army is taking the path of least resistance. Japanese warships east of Jiangyin are moving to concentrate their forces to capture Jingjiang first. The artillery battle near Jingjiang is also extremely fierce. The Japanese army, attempting to advance head-on along the railway line to attack Wujin, is still encountering fierce resistance from our army in the suburbs of Wuxi. ㊁ The Japanese army in Wuxing on the south bank of Taihu Lake continues to advance along the highway. Changxing has also been breached. After occupying Changxing, the Japanese army has divided its troops to invade Guangde in southern Anhui, attempting to threaten Wuhu in the north and make Nanjing vulnerable to attack from both the front and rear. There has been fierce fighting in Si'an Town between Changxing and Guangde. Our army has deployed strong defensive works in the mountainous area near Guangde. The Japanese army will inevitably encounter fierce resistance as it advances. At the same time, the Japanese army in Changxing is also invading Yixing in the north, attempting to echo the Japanese army advancing along the railway line. Therefore, a tense situation has emerged in Yixing. ㊂ The front and left and right wings of the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line have not changed because they are not the main forces of both sides. The guerrilla warfare waged by our army near Suzhou on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line is still unfolding.

Changxing Road is a key point leading directly to Guangde, and fierce fighting is now unfolding. According to foreign sources, the county seat is still in the hands of our army, but a point on the front has been breached. Fierce fighting has been going on for days. Under the cover of fierce artillery fire, the Japanese army is still advancing westward, attempting to cross into Guangde in Anhui Province, turn to Wuhu, and attack Nanjing from both sides. However, we have deployed heavy troops layer by layer and will do our best to defend to prevent the Japanese army from advancing deep. In recent days, large teams of Japanese aircraft have been flying to bomb the highway between Changxing and Guangde. In addition, a certain guild in this city received a telegram from Hangzhou stating that the war on the Huchang Highway has shifted from Lijiaxiang, Santianmen, and the west to the Qingshan area near Zhonghengtang. There are mountains and natural dangers in that area, which is about ten kilometers from Changxing County.

According to various intelligence sources, the Japanese side has concentrated its naval, land, and air forces to attack our Jiangyin Fortress for days. Fierce fighting is still going on in Maozhugang and Duanshan at the western end of Changyinsha. Our army there has strong forces and extremely solid fortifications. The troops stationed there are determined to coexist with the city and defend it to the death. Therefore, after many days of fierce fighting, the position has remained immovable. The Japanese army has changed its strategy and is fiercely bombing Jingjiang on the opposite bank, and there is a tendency to land on the north bank. It is heard that we have long built fortifications along the river and have powerful troops preparing to fight. We can ensure that there is no danger, and the first line of defense has also been strengthened. It is not easy for the Japanese army to try to destroy it. Although there is a saying that Wuxi has fallen, our army has close contact from Jiangyin to Changzhou, which is enough to block its conspiracy to encircle us.

The French Concession at Xujiahui in western Shanghai discovered more than 400 Japanese wounded soldiers last night. It is also heard that the Japanese have transported many wounded soldiers from there to Shanghai.

[Nanjing] It is heard that the Chinese army in Wuxi City has abandoned Wuxi and retreated to Changzhou because all defensive works have been destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. However, there were still battles in the suburbs of Wuxi last night. (Fast News, 28th)

[Nanjing] According to Chinese sources, fierce fighting is still going on in Changxing on the south bank of Taihu Lake. The rumor that the Chinese army has abandoned Changxing is still difficult to confirm, but the situation there is indeed very critical. The war in Wuxi has shifted to a certain place 15 kilometers east of Changzhou, and the war is still going on fiercely. (Fast News, 28th)

[Nantong] Japanese warships on the Langshan River surface sailed to Shanghai on the 27th and invaded Chengxi to the west. More than 30 ships are still anchored, still firing south. (Special Dispatch, 27th)

[Nantong] Japanese warships on the Langfu River surface sailed west to invade Chengxi. 41 ships were anchored on the 26th and had no action. (Special Dispatch, 26th)

### Tang Shengzhi Declares to Foreigners that the Capital is Inevitably Becoming a Battlefield

The Capital is Now Guarded by Well-Organized Troops. Once the Situation Turns Critical, All City Gates Will Be Closed.

[Nanjing] General Tang Shengzhi, Commander of the Garrison of the Capital, stated last night when he met with a group of foreigners representing the consulates, churches, newspapers, and large commercial firms of various countries that the Capital may become a battlefield in the near future. Tang also stated the Supreme Military Authority's will to defend the Capital to the death. Tang also said that the Chinese people must sacrifice. Now there are two things to be decided: first, I am a Chinese soldier and intend to sacrifice myself for the country; second, our sacrifice will cause the enemy to suffer more losses. Tang advised foreigners who could leave Nanjing to do so, but the central government would do its best to guarantee the safety of foreigners in Nanjing. Tang continued, "After a long war, chaos is inevitable. Even a drunkard will do things that he would not do when sober. So, what is so strange about an army that is bombarded by shells and bombs and is in difficult and distressful situations sometimes behaving in an out-of-bounds way?" The Capital is now guarded by well-organized troops, and the rest of the troops are withdrawing one after another, and it is difficult to expect them to strictly abide by discipline. If foreigners have any complaints, we will correct them as soon as we hear about them. I am a responsible officer and intend to do everything I can to curb chaos. In the next few days, the situation will not suddenly become serious, but once the situation turns critical, all city gates will be closed and other actions will be taken, but in any case, I will do my best to protect foreign nationals. After Tang finished speaking, they were all greeted with sincere cheers. Tang also replied to questions that the authorities have deployed troops in various places to maintain discipline, not only paying attention to this city, but also paying attention to the area within 50 kilometers of this city. Those who allow other troops to enter the city must state that they are willing to live and die together. (Reuters, 28th)

[Nanjing] Today, the authorities issued a statement ordering all ships to sail to the Capital upstream before November 30 to avoid being trapped under the blockade near Zhenjiang. (Reuters, 28th)

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Zhenjiang Fiercely

About 140 Bombs Were Dropped. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Was Also Bombed.

[Nanjing] Yesterday, several Japanese aircraft fiercely bombed Zhenjiang, dropping about 140 bombs. The purpose of this bombing was probably to hinder the efforts of the Chinese army to strengthen the blockade. There are now hundreds of coolies transporting stones, filling civilian ships and sinking them in the river. The number of casualties from yesterday's attack has not yet been received. There are still four or five British nationals in Zhenjiang, and the British gunboat Affix will remain there to protect them, even if the outlet is blocked. (Reuters, 28th)

[Guangzhou] Several Japanese aircraft bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway again this morning, causing the telegraphic communication between Hong Kong and Guangdong to be blocked. Japanese aircraft also dropped bombs in the northern and eastern suburbs of Guangzhou City. The number of losses and casualties is currently unknown. (Reuters, 28th)

[Hong Kong] The repair of the Shek-ku Railway Bridge on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will take time, and it will not be open to traffic until a week later. (Special Dispatch, 28th)

### All Fronts in North China are Silent

Only Japanese Aircraft Harass Railway Traffic.  There Will Be No Development in the Near Future.

[Beiping] A Japanese military spokesman stated today that all fronts in North China remain silent, and only Japanese aircraft bombed the railway between Jinan and Tai'an yesterday to harass railway traffic. Public opinion here generally believes that there will be no development in North China until the Japanese army occupies Nanjing. (Reuters, 28th)

[Jinan] ㊀ After our army recovered Liaocheng and Tangyi on the 26th, they took advantage of the victory to attack and completely eliminated the Japanese troops in Renping, Boping, Xiazhen, and Wucheng. ㊁ After the Japanese troops in Putai were driven away by our attack, they were ambushed and intercepted by our troops. Some of them still entered the city and were trapped. We are besieging them. In this battle, dozens of people were killed, including two team leaders, and more than 20 guns were seized. One of our team leaders was also slightly injured. ㊂ The Japanese artillery position that fired at us this morning was on the northwest side of Queshan, and its observation post was on the top of Queshan. At noon, our artillery concentrated its firepower to suppress it and destroyed its observation post. The artillery lost its ears and eyes and became silent. (Special Dispatch, 28th)

### Bank of China Plans to Establish a Guilin Branch

The Exchange Rate Between Guilin Currency and Legal Tender is Approved

The exchange rate between Guilin currency and legal tender has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, and one yuan of Guilin currency is converted into 5 jiao of legal tender. The whole country has now followed it. Therefore, the circulation of Guilin currency in various places is no longer a problem. At the same time, the Bank of China has decided to establish a branch in Wuzhou, Guangxi, and has sent personnel to prepare for it. It can be formally established in the short term.

### A Mother and Three Children are Destitute

Renewed Plea for Assistance from All Sectors

A news item was published in this newspaper the other day, pleading for assistance for Ms. Zeng Zhiying, a refugee, whose husband died, whose family is poor, who is pregnant, and who has three children. No one is relying on her. We sincerely ask readers for assistance. It is learned that since the news was published, it has had a considerable effect. However, according to the woman's reply yesterday, she is pregnant and in great pain, and there is a risk of miscarriage. In addition, at this time of severe cold, she is destitute. We dare to ask kind-hearted people to donate a few more yuan to maintain the lives of her and her three children. Those who are willing to help, please send the money directly to Ms. Cao Zhiying, Zhuan Nüshi, Teentze Room, upstairs on the back door of Quanyuli No. 12 Annakin Road, French Concession.

### The Jiangxi Provincial Authorities Welcome Refugees to Cultivate Land

The most recent news on the issue of transferring refugees to cultivate land, according to the office in charge, is that there are many households in various places who are responsible for recruiting and registering. Because this matter is large and costly, it has now been decided that the first batch will first transfer 100 households to Liyang, Gaochun, and other places to settle down. However, there is very little open space there and cannot accommodate them. Now, the Jiangxi provincial authorities welcome immigrants to cultivate land, because the population of the province has decreased sharply since the bandits were suppressed, and there is a lot of arable land.

### A Desolate Hangzhou

— Peng

In normal times, transportation between Shanghai and Hangzhou was extremely swift. One could depart from Shanghai in the morning and savor the famous tea of West Lake by noon, then spend half the afternoon leisurely exploring the scenic spots around the lake. In the evening, one could take the stable and fast Shanghai-Hangzhou train, arriving safely back in Shanghai before eleven o'clock at night.

Even sending letters was incredibly efficient. A special delivery letter sent out in the morning could often receive a reply by midnight. Long-distance phone calls, needless to say, transmitted voices instantaneously, with no sense of distance. And there was the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, where friends who loved driving would constantly speed along. My friend, Mr. Shi, once drove at high speed, covering the distance from the inner West Lake to Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai in just two and a half hours.

But what about now? News from Hangzhou is completely cut off. People who care about the West Lake can only rely on fragmented rumors. Some say Hangzhou is extremely chaotic, while others say West Lake has become as desolate as a dead city.

Yesterday at dusk, a friend from Hangzhou suddenly arrived, and from him, I learned about the recent situation in Hangzhou.

He traveled from Hangzhou to Ningbo, then took a ship to Shanghai, passing safely through the Wusongkou and reaching the relatively safer Shanghai concessions. He said, "Hangzhou is indeed a dead city now! Nearly two-thirds of the people have fled to the countryside. Since the fall of Jiaxing, the people of Hangzhou have been truly terrified. Important government agencies have all moved to Jinhua. Even the outspoken Southeast Daily newspaper has relocated to Jinhua to publish. The streets are deserted; you can't find a single car, and even the rickshaws have disappeared. The only residents left in Hangzhou are the poor and needy. Although they know their lives are at stake and that temporarily fleeing is necessary for safety, they are trapped by their financial circumstances and cannot leave. They can only resign themselves to fate!

"After the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, the wealthy families of Hangzhou considered Mogan Mountain a safe haven. They brought their wives and children and climbed the mountain in an endless stream. Deep within the bamboo forests, it was like a hidden paradise. But recently, as Huzhou has become critical, the people in the mountains have been rushing back to Hangzhou. The most difficult thing is that military transport is frequent on this route, and there are no cars available. They have to take waterways from Sanqiaobu to Hangzhou, slowly and anxiously, in a truly miserable state.

"Judging from the overall situation, Hangzhou is not in immediate danger at the moment. However, the fear felt by the people of Hangzhou is as if a large army is pressing down upon them, which is truly inexplicable. The tourists on the lake have disappeared, and the cold electric lights at night sway in the strong autumn wind, creating an especially desolate and bleak scene.

"Suzhou, which is also considered a paradise like Hangzhou, has already met a tragic fate. I can't bear to imagine the future fate of Hangzhou!"

### Anglo-French Talks Begin Today, First Discussing Far East Issues

The results of the talks will be notified to the United States and efforts will be made to achieve peace in Europe.

[London] When French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos meet with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden tomorrow morning, the main issue they will discuss will likely not be the European situation but the Shanghai question. It is expected that this meeting will lead to the formation of a joint Anglo-French action in the Far East. According to reliable sources, Britain and France will fully inform the United States of the results of their talks. The recent talks between British Lord Privy Seal Halifax and German leader Hitler will also be one of the issues discussed by the Anglo-French politicians tomorrow. French sources in London believe that French policy may not change immediately because France is unwilling to make any concessions to Germany's demands unless Germany takes action to raise hopes for a general resolution of the European problem. (Reuter, 28th)

[Paris] Prime Minister Chautemps recently visited President Lebrun to discuss the fact that he will be going to London tomorrow with Foreign Minister Delbos to hold talks with the British authorities. The French responsible parties refused to comment on the future Anglo-French talks, only saying that the British government's invitation to the French authorities to go to London is to prove that the two sides' ties are extremely sincere, and the French authorities' acceptance of the invitation is even more proof that France is committed to peace and is eager to assist in easing the international situation. In particular, France's consistent foreign policy will not be affected by this spirit of compromise. Regarding this, French diplomatic circles also said that Foreign Minister Delbos will visit Central European countries to promote friendship with those countries after the Anglo-French talks are over, which is very gratifying. (Havas, 27th)

[London] Regarding the Anglo-French talks, the Observer stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain will assure the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister that Britain has no objections to the Franco-Russian and Franco-Czech mutual assistance agreements. The Anglo-French general staffs can also refer to this agreement and discuss defense plans. In any case, the British side must re-mention the Western European Treaty. The Times stated that if France does not have alliance treaties in Eastern Europe, the situation of peace in Western Europe can be maintained for a long time. In addition, the territorial clauses of the Treaty of Versailles should also be revised. (Havas, 28th)

### A Pro-German Movement Has Emerged in Britain

Conflicting opinions within the government

[London] The Labour Party's newspaper, Reynolds's Weekly, recently issued a shocking news item, claiming that a powerful pro-German movement has emerged in Britain for the past eighteen months. Its center is in Cliveden, the villa of Lord Astor and his wife (the Lady is a Conservative MP). Lord and Lady Astor, along with the powerful Lord Halifax, former Air Minister Londonderry, and Times editor Dawson, drafted a plan between September and October of this year advocating that Halifax go to Germany, which was immediately supported by German Aviation Minister Goering. The content of this plan is not much different from what was revealed by the Manchester Guardian. The main point is to allow Germany to take actions in Central Europe in exchange for temporarily delaying the recovery of its old colonies. Upon hearing this, Foreign Secretary Eden was very dissatisfied and tendered his resignation because Prime Minister Chamberlain agreed with this plan (this was reported by various New York newspapers). After Prime Minister Chamberlain persuaded him to stay, he agreed to remain in office temporarily. In short, now that this secret plan has been revealed by various newspapers, the British government is in trouble, and the conflicting opinions within the government are difficult to reconcile. (Havas, 28th)

### Former Belgian Prime Minister Theunis to Visit the Far East

Economic Survey Report Drafted

⊙Brussels: Former Prime Minister Theunis is scheduled to depart within days to visit various countries in the Far East. According to Theunis, he was commissioned by the British and French governments to investigate the world economic situation, and his report has been drafted and will be sent to the British and French Foreign Ministers in his private capacity soon.

### Italian Newspapers Vigorously Attack France

France Lodges Strong Protest

[Paris] Recently, Italian newspapers have said that French High Commissioner for Maritime Affairs Gargas had given a speech in Toulon on the 23rd of last month, opposing Italy, and therefore attacked him in succession. Regarding this speech, Gargas himself has firmly denied it, but Gazzetta del Popolo turned a deaf ear and continued to attack as before. As a result, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Reury met with the Italian Chargé d'Affaires today to lodge a protest, saying that since Italian newspapers are controlled by the government, they are now publishing articles attacking France based on fabricated facts, even after the French side has officially denied them. This is very astonishing. Regarding this matter, French political figures believe that even if the so-called speech given by Gargas is true, it happened a month ago. It is difficult to understand why Italian newspapers have only started to attack it at this time. What is noteworthy is that this behavior of these newspapers happened precisely when the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were about to go to London to discuss the issue of reconciliation with Germany with the British authorities, and the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera" recently published an article by its correspondent in Paris, advocating that after Italy and France reconcile, the Italian authorities ordered the detention of the newspaper and recalled the correspondent to the country. At that time, it also coincided with the British Lord Privy Seal's visit to Berlin. All these things are mutually referenced, and there are indeed clues to be found. (Havas, 27th)

### German Ministry of Economics Merged into the Four-Year Plan

Schacht Sends Letter of Thanks to Colleagues

[Berlin] The change of German Minister of Economics is the focus of discussion among political figures here today. These people believe that apart from the changes announced by the leader yesterday, there will be no other changes in the German cabinet and various economic and financial institutions. General Goering will temporarily take charge of the Ministry of Economics until January 15 next year. The purpose is not to make other changes, but to establish a new Ministry of Economics that implements the Four-Year Plan in terms of personnel and activities, because the Four-Year Plan was not interested in the Ministry of Economics before. The new minister, Funk, is scheduled to take office on January 15 next year. These people also pointed out that the merger of the Ministry of Economics and the Four-Year Plan is enough to guarantee the elimination of friction, because General Goering has the right to request the cooperation of other departments, such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Food, all of which are closely related to the Four-Year Plan, because the plan dominates the entire German economic and financial policy. (Haitong, 27th)

[Berlin] Schacht, who resigned as Minister of Economics and Speaker, sent a letter to the staff of the ministry, saying that when he was in office, he had worked hard to increase the domestic production of raw materials and the import of foreign raw materials in order to complete the military expansion plan, and that he had always put the interests of the country first. (Havas, 28th)

### Germany Widely Establishes Schools

To Train Party Leaders

⊙Berlin: Germany will establish 32 "Hitler Schools" in the near future, specializing in training cadres for the National Socialist Party. The stipulated age for admission is 12 years old. Students can apply for admission regardless of their family background or family circumstances, but they must have a strong physique. The study period is six years, and they leave the school at the age of 18 to learn a specialized profession for a period of seven years. During these seven years, they must also receive National Socialist Party military training, national military training, and labor service. Those with excellent results will eventually be promoted to the National Socialist Party University for further studies. Students in these Hitler Schools must receive extremely strict physical and intellectual education. It is expected that 4,000 new students can be enrolled each year, and 1,000 National Socialist Party leaders can be trained each year. (Havas, 28th)

### France Conducts Air Defense Exercises in the Eastern Border

The scale is unprecedented

⊙Metz: France conducted a large-scale air defense exercise last night along the Maginot Line, stretching from Batz to Strasbourg. This is the first time France has conducted such an exercise on the Franco-German border. During the exercise, all lights in the area were turned off. (Reuter, 28th)

### Japanese Military Attaché Discusses Recent Battles

The battle line is extended, and transportation is difficult

[Berlin] The Japanese military attaché in Shanghai, Mr. Hara, met with a reporter from the Berlin Daily stationed in Shanghai and declared that the resistance of the Chinese army has not weakened and has not yet been defeated. The military attaché claimed that even when the Chinese army completely withdraws from Nanjing and is occupied by the Japanese army, the continuation of the war is not only possible but also probable. He also pointed out that the progress of the Japanese army has been halted due to the extreme difficulty of supplying and transporting supplies due to geographical reasons. Therefore, the Chinese side can take this opportunity to replenish its troops and regroup its forces, but the Japanese army is prepared to fight to the end. The reporter added his personal impression that the Japanese army has no intention of negotiating and that international figures in Shanghai are becoming more pessimistic about the situation as the danger of international involvement increases. (Haitong, 28th)

### Train Accident on the Harbin-Shenyang Line

Many Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed or injured

[Harbin] A passenger train on the Harbin-Shenyang line derailed near Changchun on the 26th. It is reported that a total of 68 people were injured, including many puppet Manchu soldiers and Japanese officers. There are various rumors about the cause of the accident. The railway authorities are currently investigating it. (Express News Agency, 28th)

### A Large Batch of Gold Arrives

⊙Le Havre: The mail ship "Chamberlain" recently carried gold worth a total of 300 million francs, which was landed here and sent to the Bank of France for storage. (Havas, 28th)

### Pudong Gaoqiao to be Garrisoned by Puppet Police

Since the westward shift of the battle lines, the Zhaoshang Police Sub-Bureau in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, also plans to disband on the 10th of this month, and local public security is to be maintained by the local business community. Although Japanese troops have landed in small groups for inspections, they have never interfered. Recently, foreign companies have opened ferries to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Gaoqiao, and the number of passengers traveling to and from the ferries is unusually crowded. As a result, the Bai-fang have attracted attention and are actively proceeding with the restoration of the puppet police sub-bureau and recruiting dozens of puppet police officers, with a plan to continue the sub-bureau's return to duty tomorrow morning.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Refugee and Food Problem

According to a survey by the Chinese Child Welfare Association, the total number of refugees is as follows: The urban area has 118 large and small shelters, housing over 88,000 refugees. The number of households requesting relief: Over 38,000 have registered, and over 60,000 have not registered. Approximately 3,000 are still living outdoors, not yet admitted to shelters. The total number is no less than 200,000 people. Among them, children aged one to four years old number approximately 30,000, and children aged four to fourteen years old number approximately 50,000. The numbers are truly alarming.

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the China Southern Rice Company had previously purchased foreign rice and transported it to Shanghai for relief. However, the French company Dafu has ordered foreign rice from Saigon, and one, two, or three batches have arrived in Shanghai in succession as scattered grains. However, the large population of the two concessions means that the rice that has arrived is truly insufficient for the people's food needs. The food panic has now reached its extreme.

We hope that charitable organizations and international relief agencies will work hard to appeal to all sectors of society in order to alleviate this dire situation. On the one hand, they should find ways to send people back to their hometowns to reduce difficulties. As for food, whether foreign or domestic rice, they should continue to order it and transport it to Shanghai in a steady stream for relief. Only in this way can social order be permanently maintained.

### Japanese Side Takes Over Telecommunications Agencies

Since 10 PM Last Night, Bi-Directional Communications Have Been Completely Cut Off

At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, personnel dispatched by the Japanese side, accompanied by police officers belonging to the Public Works Department, went to the wireless telegraph room of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications at No. 591, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road, to post a notice stating that it had been taken over. Telegraphs must be inspected by the Japanese side before they can be sent or received. Similar incidents occurred at the bureau's broadcasting stations at Maigen Road, Xinwen Road, the Sassoon Building, Xieqiao Lane, and elsewhere. The bureau was forced to stop work, and since 10 PM last night, all public telecommunications traffic between the city and all parts of the country has been completely cut off. This bureau was established in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty and has a history of fifty or sixty years. It is truly regrettable that it has been forced to close, severely affecting the interests of Chinese and foreign businesses and the public.

The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese authorities have stated that they intend to take over all transportation agencies of the Chinese government in Shanghai, and yesterday they implemented part of it. However, only the Chinese government's wireless telegraph office was affected, and other agencies have not yet been taken over. Yesterday morning, several Japanese personnel, accompanied by two Japanese police officers from the Public Works Department and one Western police chief, went to the Sassoon Building to discuss the status of the Chinese government's wireless telegraph office with foreign staff indirectly related to the company. Seeing the arrival of the Japanese personnel, the staff of the wireless telegraph office immediately met them in the reception room and then led them into the office for consultations. One of the foreign staff members replied to the Japanese personnel's questions, saying that the senior staff of the Chinese government's wireless telegraph office are currently nowhere to be found, so there is no way to contact them. He asked the Japanese personnel to explain their intentions and invited them into the inner office. A certain foreign staff member stated that he was ordered to manage the Chinese government's wireless telegraph office, and he felt that the Japanese consul general had already been notified of this matter. All matters that do not interfere with the affairs of the wireless telegraph office or reduce its income can be discussed and carried out. It is reported that the Japanese personnel and the foreign staff of the wireless telegraph office did not reach an agreement yesterday, but both sides were able to mention their opinions without any unnecessary conflicts. Yesterday, a Japanese spokesperson met with news reporters and answered many questions, explaining the meaning of the word "management" regarding the actions taken by the Japanese authorities regarding various agencies of the Chinese government in Shanghai. He said that the Japanese authorities hope that the existing staff of the agencies will cooperate fully so that their duties can continue smoothly. The future actions regarding this matter cannot be predicted, but he believes that the Japanese authorities are eager not to be forced to implement strict management. Many small problems will continue to be studied until the situation is completely clear, but because everything depends on the degree of cooperation that the staff gives to the Japanese authorities, he cannot be sure whether the telegraph service from Shanghai to the mainland can continue to be maintained. The Japanese authorities will take countermeasures depending on the development of the situation. The spokesperson did not reaffirm that the Japanese authorities are eager for all relevant parties to cooperate in the transfer of management rights. He believes that mail inspection is not likely to be implemented at present, and unless there is a military emergency that makes it necessary to implement this measure, it will not be implemented in the future.

As of yesterday evening, the Japanese authorities had not yet met with the manager of the Shanghai Sanhai Electric Company. According to company staff, there has been no formal indication from the Japanese authorities that they will take action. The manager of a certain company said that the three Shanghai Hai Dian companies are run by British, American, and Danish people, so they are all owned by foreigners. If the Japanese authorities take action, the company must consult with its national consul general to decide on countermeasures. It is reported that the three companies will take unified action regarding this matter. It is reported that the Chinese government had previously taken over the receiving and dispatching departments of the three companies, thus being able to implement inspections. Recently, Chinese inspectors have resigned and left, so there is no inspection of any kind in Shanghai from now on.

A representative of the Shanghai Times visited Postmaster Chaplain yesterday, who reportedly said that he had not received any formal or private news from the Japanese authorities that they intended to take over the post office. There is no benefit for the Japanese side to take over, as the post office is a money-losing business. If the Japanese side takes over, they will have to subsidize its expenses. If the Chinese post office in Shanghai is forcibly occupied, it will lose its existing value, because the post offices in other parts of China will inevitably stop sending and receiving Shanghai mail. In the past few weeks, the post office and Japanese personnel have never had any disagreements. The post office now has branches in the concession areas occupied by the Japanese army, and Japanese civilians still buy Chinese stamps as usual to send their letters. Japanese ships have regularly transported mail from Shanghai to the United States and Canada. The postal offices on board the ships follow the current postal regulations when entering Shanghai and Hong Kong ports, and stop receiving mail. Foreign stamps cannot be purchased on ships in Shanghai and Hong Kong in peacetime because of respect for Chinese postal sovereignty. However, Shanghai residents can board the ships to send letters with Chinese stamps, and add a special mark to the stamps when the ships sail into the sea to invalidate them. A representative of the Shanghai Times also visited many merchants in this port yesterday, who expressed their panic about the Japanese authorities' plan to set up inspectors in the Shanghai post office, saying that if the Japanese authorities do this, the post office will lose its true nature as an administrative agency serving the public, and the directly affected countries will inevitably set up their own post offices, which will eventually form the situation before China recovered its postal rights in 1922, when each country would set up its own post office in Shanghai. The Americans have now advocated that all mail transported to Shanghai should be transported by ships flying the American flag, except for airmail transported to Hong Kong by British ships.

As for the Chinese customs, it was learned yesterday that the Japanese authorities have not yet planned to send inspectors to the Pudong areas of the Public Concession and the French Concession. At present, there are several aspects to consider whether Japanese personnel can enter the French Concession or send inspectors to the two concessions after arriving at the customs office in this port.

Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese army towed away twelve small ships of the China Inland Water Navigation Company from Suzhou Creek. At that time, many people watched from both banks. Before the Japanese army occupied the ships, they distributed the rice on the ships to the boatmen on both banks. The various ship companies had recently tried to transfer the ships to a Portuguese merchant for management but were unsuccessful. The ships mostly traveled between Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Huzhou during the Shanghai war. Since they were occupied by the Japanese army yesterday, there are no Chinese ships in Suzhou Creek.

### Ms. Liu Manhua Dedicates Herself to Theater: An Interesting Purpose

The booming cannons stirred patriotic aspirations; earnest appeals penned true passion.

Ms. Liu Manhua, barely seventeen years old, is usually a diligent student with the spirit of a man. This time, with our government resisting the war, Ms. Liu felt that women are also part of the nation. Therefore, without first informing her parents, she left home alone and went to Ms. Shi Ji’s home. Her words were sincere and worthy of bringing honor to our female community. We have specially obtained the original letter and published it below to inform patriotic compatriots. The original letter is as follows:

Dear Mom and Dad,

I was very happy to receive your letter, clothes, and food on the afternoon of the fourth. Those two thick letters, nearly ten pages of paper, Dad, I know you didn't write it clearly enough because of various reasons. However, Mom and Dad, your love for your children vividly leaps between the lines. I read each word and swallowed strings of hot tears. Mother has been crying for me all day, and her eyes are swollen. Mom and Dad, your daughter is a sinner, your daughter knows she is guilty, but besides asking for your forgiveness, I can only repay you with work.

It was wrong to go out privately. I feel deeply that my departure has caused family unrest. The night before I left, I didn't sleep at all. I thought about this matter repeatedly, but I couldn't come up with a proper solution. I also thought about explaining it to you clearly, but I knew you would stop me out of love for me. Finally, without a better solution, I did this.

Mom and Dad, no one used patriotic rhetoric to instigate me, and it is impossible. What excites me is the blood history of the past and the booming cannons I recently heard in the deformed concessions, the sky-reaching flames I saw, and the war reports recorded in the newspapers every day. The facts revealed by the environment make me unbearable and unable to live in peace anymore. In addition, I feel that staying at home only consumes resources, which is not good for the family, while coming out, although I am young and cannot do much, I will still do my best.

Now what can put your minds at ease is that the path I have taken this time is not wrong at all. This group is led by Mr. ×××. Mr. × is a famous general. Needless to say, in our team, there are more than 30 people, men and women, old and young, including university professors, students studying abroad, and well-known literary artists, all here to practice their work. Everyone is like fathers, sons, and brothers. Being here is like being in school. It can also be said that it is better than school to learn from reality.

Propaganda with words is simply useless. They are illiterate. Propaganda by word of mouth doesn't interest them, and they are unwilling to listen attentively. Therefore, we must use drama to show them all the facts and convey the meaning of the war of resistance to them. Only then will it have an effect in their minds. Although your daughter is young and not very useful, this group needs me very much. Think of this group as a machine. It has important large parts, but it is useless if a difficult-to-find part is missing. It cannot drive the machine, so I am very willing to stay here. Mom and Dad, since your daughter was born in this great era, being able to adapt to this great era and do a little bit of work, I think that once explained, you two elders will also be happy. It can also be said that this is the result of Mom and Dad's education of youth. To put it bluntly, coming back in a week or a month is not what I originally intended to say.

University professors, students studying abroad... could it be said that my life is more precious than theirs? Furthermore, what is the point of living a muddled life? Moreover, what Mom and Dad call the front line is not the front line under gunfire. It is sixty or seventy miles away from the fire. It is just the rear of the front line, the front of the very back. In short, we only go to places where there are people. Without people, without targets, we will not go. On this point, you can rest assured about safety.

Mom and Dad, you want me to send a diary every other day, but when the work is very tight, I'm afraid I can't do it. This is something I must ask you to forgive. But when I have free time, I will definitely do it. There seems to be a lot to write, but I can't finish it all at once. I wish you both good health. Manhua, November 5th.

### Fourth Batch of Foreign Rice Delayed Several Days to Arrive in Shanghai

The Rice Merchants' Association is handling the third batch of foreign rice, and dispatched personnel to purchase 300,000 dan of Zhejiang rice.

After the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession cooperated with the South China Rice Industry Company to purchase and transport foreign rice to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply, the fourth batch of 30,000 packages loaded on the Zhejiang wheel arrived in Shanghai. Due to bad weather along the way, it was delayed until December 2nd before it could arrive in Shanghai. The Rice Merchants' Association is handling the third batch of rice distribution, and the grain and bean industries are purchasing domestic rice. The details are recorded as follows:

Fourth Batch Delayed

The Comma D'affaires Foreign Firm ordered 115,000 packages of foreign rice from Saigon, which were transported to Shanghai in four batches. The first, second, and third batches have arrived in Shanghai one after another. The fourth batch of 30,000 packages was loaded on the British Swire Company's Zhejiang wheel. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai last night. Today, the foreign firm received a telegram from the owner of the Zhejiang wheel, stating that due to bad weather along the way, the estimated voyage is that the wheel will not pass Hong Kong until November 29th, and will not be able to arrive in Shanghai until December 2nd. It has already notified the South China Rice Industry Company.

Rice Distribution by the Rice Merchants' Association

500 rice shops, members of the Rice Merchants' Association, receive rice for retail sales. The first and second batches have been distributed. The third batch (i.e., the second batch transported to Shanghai by the Fusheng wheel) has been stored in the Bank of China warehouse. Yesterday, the procedures for paying and receiving rice were handled. By 4:00 p.m. on the 29th, the association will ship the goods from the warehouse and distribute them to the rice shops. However, because the warehouse charges an additional 30 cents per package in addition to the handling fee of 25 cents per package, i.e., 16 yuan and 45 cents, yesterday the association issued an emergency notice to handle the registration for the third batch of rice distribution, stipulating that: ㊀ 10 yuan must be prepaid for vehicle and miscellaneous expenses at the time of registration, and a rice purchase application will be issued after review; ㊁ from the 20th to the 29th, sufficient payment must be prepared with the official store chop and paid to the Bank of China Office at 276 Sichuan Road to await rice distribution. After receiving the notice, 500 rice shops in the two concessions registered with the association to receive rice, still 40 packages per rice shop, specializing in retail sales and not allowed to raise prices and sell whole packages. If found, they will be prosecuted.

Separate Purchases

Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired about the bean, rice, and miscellaneous grain industries. After the above two groups were ordered to be responsible for regulating the food supply of Shanghai citizens, they now, in view of the fact that this year's harvests have been reported in various parts of our country, and the price of rice in each rice-producing area is only about 10 yuan per dan, decided to purchase 300,000 dan of domestic rice from the three places of Wentai and Yong in Zhejiang Province. With the approval of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the certification of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, each industry has dispatched personnel to the above three places to purchase directly. They have decided to load the ships of the British Swire and Jardine Matheson companies to transport them to Shanghai, and with the assistance of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, they will soon be loaded on ships and transported to Shanghai.

No Need to Worry About Food Supply

After the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession assisted various trade associations in purchasing and transporting food to Shanghai, the market price has tended to fall back, and there is no need to worry about a shortage. According to the reporter's inquiry, ㊀ members of the Vegetable and Local Goods Industry Association purchase from Gaoqiao, Nantong, and Tianshenggang in Pudong. Laborers hired for Gaoqiao vegetables transport them to Shanghai by ferry every day. Tianshenggang vegetables are loaded on foreign wheels of the Shanghai-Nantong line and transported to Shanghai. Wuhu, Wuxue, Pinghe, Tonghe, Ende, and other five vessels all bring large quantities of vegetables from Tong to Shanghai each time. At the same time, each wheel of the Shanghai-Tianjin line also brings huge amounts of gelatinous vegetables from Tianjin to Shanghai each time. ㊁ Fresh pork for meat is purchased from Tianshenggang by the Pig Industry Association, certified by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The first batch of 2,000 heads has been transported to Shanghai by the ships of Jardine Matheson and Moller companies. Personnel have been dispatched to purchase the second batch of 3,000 heads at that place, and they will soon be loaded on ships and transported to Shanghai. As for cattle and sheep, the Cattle and Sheep Industry Association has asked the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to certify their purchase from various counties in northern Jiangsu, and barges have been chartered to transport them from Tianshenggang to Shanghai.

Supply Cannot Meet Demand

Several batches of foreign rice have arrived in Shanghai, and there is still a large amount that can arrive soon. On the domestic rice side, we are also trying to purchase it separately. Therefore, there is no need to worry about a shortage of food for Shanghai citizens. However, the current situation is still difficult to supply abundantly. Therefore, each rice shop still limits the time for retail sales. Women and children who buy rice still inevitably miss out on the opportunity. Therefore, some residents easily switch to wheat, which has caused the market price of flour to soar. At the same time, restaurants that specialize in serving the common people have still suspended business and have not opened. In particular, the situation of families with a large number of mouths and no ability to store food for the next day is truly unimaginable. In addition, children are not accustomed to wheat food, and over time, it will have a particularly harmful effect on their health. The bao fan (meal plan) operations are even more caught in a ridiculous situation. Not only has the price of rice and vegetables risen, resulting in losses, but also customers refuse to pay the meal bill on the pretext that it is difficult to supply customer meals as usual. This kind of dispute has been seen frequently.

### Although the Nanshi District is a Civilian Area, Measures are Becoming More Perfect

Food and tea are well prepared; cotton clothes and quilts are urgently needed for donation; Mrs. Niu Huisheng generously donated 30,000 sets of cotton clothes.

Under the leadership and planning of Father Zhao in the Nanshi Refugee District, all measures are becoming more and more perfect. Recently, in order to promote work, the entire area has been divided into nine districts. All the candidates for district chiefs have been appointed yesterday. At the same time, important staff of the general office in the district have also been officially announced. The details are recorded as follows: Chairman of the general office Pan Zhijie, Deputy Director Jiang Zhiqing, Refugee Group Sheng Shaoming, Resident Group Jiang Zhaowu, Security Group Dai Changling, Sanitation Group Jin Qinglin, Supply Group Xu Hongkang, District Chiefs First District Chief Jiang Zhaowu, Second District Chief Sheng Shaoming, Third District Chief Xue Lisheng, Fourth District Chief Dai Changling, Fifth District Chief Jiang Zhiqing, Sixth District Chief Jin Qinglin, Seventh District Chief Ren Xipeng, Eighth District Chief Jin Qinglin, Ninth District Chief Jin Wenxiu. Under each district chief, there are general affairs, documents, training, design, supply, general affairs, sanitation, cleaning, registration, investigation, medical affairs, and other sections, which handle various tasks separately.

Supplying Food and Handling Fair Sales

Since the establishment of the refugee district, the source of rice and grain has not been smooth, and noodles have been supplied until now. Now a batch of foreign rice has been purchased, and 4,200 packages have been sent in. At the same time, fuel and cooking utensils have also been prepared. It is scheduled to start supplying rice tomorrow, planning to distribute five he (升合) per refugee per day. It is estimated that 400 packages are needed every day. At the same time, the association will also set up several fair sales outlets in the district, scheduled to start sales on the 30th of this month, to prepare for the purchase of residents in the district who still have financial resources. According to the International Relief Committee, although cooking has started now, in order to maintain it for a long time, it is still hoped that all sectors will continue to donate various foods needed. It would be especially welcome if they could donate salty foods and vegetables.

Setting up 24 Boiled Water Stoves

The hot water problem in the district has also been resolved. Starting today, 24 boiled water stoves will be set up first, including 3 stoves each on Danfeng Road, Anren Street, Tongchuan Road, Houjiabang, Yanhai Road, Haicang Street, Luxiangyuan Road, and Qinglian Street, specializing in supplying water for residents and refugees in the district. The refugees will be supplied separately by each district.

Shops in the District Have Resumed Business

There are currently a total of 104 shelters in the district. More than 4,000 households, about 30,000 people, have registered as poor households with no food. Most of the refugees are those who used to live on flat land, followed by those from Pudong, Jiangbei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces. As for the situation in the district, it used to be dirty and messy, but now it has changed. All streets are extremely clean, and the trend of theft has also been suppressed. Therefore, refugees and residents are very peaceful. Now shops in the district have resumed business, with noodle shops being the most open. For example, Wumudi also has pork and vegetables for sale, and there are even more vendors selling tea along the street.

Mrs. Niu Donates 30,000 Sets of Clothes

Refugees in the refugee district still lack clothes, and deaths continue. It is now learned that Mrs. Niu Huisheng has generously donated 30,000 sets of cotton clothes, which have been selected into the district by the International Relief Committee. Together with the more than 6,000 sets prepared by the association itself, they will be distributed together, but it is still far from enough. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to donate.

Actively Providing Medication and Treatment

In addition to the two temporary hospitals already set up in Wanzhu Elementary School and the circulating library, which accommodate seriously ill refugees, 12 outpatient clinics have been newly set up to provide free diagnosis and treatment for poor residents and refugees. Now there are also many Chinese medicine practitioners assisting in the work. In addition, because children suffer from measles and there are also many refugees suffering from other infectious diseases, it is also planned to set up two or three isolation hospitals. In addition, the International Relief Committee sent out a large number of medicines such as dysentery powder and Tiandan yesterday.

Transporting a Large Quantity: Requiring Trucks

The International Relief Committee's daily transportation of supplies to refugee districts and various shelters is extremely complicated. The vehicles originally borrowed from Renjitang and Jinfeng Dyeing Factory have now been taken back for their own use. Therefore, transportation is extremely difficult. It is hoped that those with such trucks will lend them for application, and the association will be responsible for compensation for any damage.

Lack of Clothing and Bedding: Hoping for Quick Donations

The refugee district accommodates a total of 200,000 refugees. Now that it is winter, the number of those who are not covered and those who have no cotton clothes reaches one-third. At the same time, due to the large number of people and the large amount of supplies, dozens of people die of cold and starvation every day. The scene is miserable, like a hell on earth. Therefore, the International Relief Committee, which is in charge of the district, is now appealing to all parties to promote the "One Dime a Day" donation campaign and hopes that people from all walks of life in the concession will, in the spirit of caring for the hungry and the drowning, donate large quantities of cotton clothes and quilts to save these 200,000 compatriots. This is a great merit.

### Small Wheelboats Towed Away from Suzhou Creek Will Be Negotiated for Release by the Portuguese

Inland Navigation Difficult to Achieve in the Short Term

According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Deqi Inland Water Transport Company, organized by Portuguese merchants, has purchased ships from various inland river shipping bureaus and plans to restore inland navigation and dredge passenger and cargo. Currently, the plan has been abruptly frustrated because the small wheelboats such as Lining, Lian, Shenxing, Liheng, Yuanfeng, and Xinningzhou, which were moored on Suzhou Creek by various shipping bureaus, have all been towed away by the Japanese. It is learned that the Portuguese side has already negotiated with the various shipping bureaus and has assumed responsibility. Therefore, it is determined to negotiate with the Japanese consulate to demand their immediate release. However, according to the situation, it seems difficult to restore a part of inland navigation in the short term.

### Newly Assigned Japanese Customs Officers Are All Transferred

Regarding the changes of important personnel at the Jianghai Customs, the news that Japanese national Mr. Akatani Tasuke has been appointed to the important position of Deputy Customs Commissioner, and at the same time, a Tax Collection Director has been added, and Mr. Kato Keiichi has been appointed by the Japanese to fill the position, has been officially received and taken over the matter. After a reporter conducted a thorough investigation with the Customs, the so-called Deputy Customs Commissioner Akatani Tasuke has not yet taken over the matter. The position is still held by a British officer. As for Akatani Tasuke, he was originally the Deputy Customs Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs, and has now been transferred to Shanghai to concurrently serve as the Director of the General Affairs Department. His father, Kato Keiichi, was originally a Shanghai Customs officer and has now been promoted to Director of the Tax Assessment Office and has indeed taken office (actually not the Tax Collection Director). However, the original Tax Assessment Director, surnamed Yang, assists in handling the matter.

### Water Transportation in Pudong West

Donggou and Gaoqiao Still Accessible

The temporary ferry service established by a foreign shipping company in this port to maintain water transportation on the west side of Pudong has been attracting quite a few passengers in recent days. The ferry crossing at Jiajiajiao in Pudong was first blocked on the morning of the day before yesterday. In the afternoon, the two places, Donggou and Gaoqiao, continued to be disallowed to dock. The ferry company believes that the passengers are all ordinary civilians and vegetable vendors, which does not hinder the security of Pudong. After various parties made efforts to dredge, the two places, Gaoqiao and Yangjing Port (i.e., Jiajiajiao moved to that place), were opened yesterday (28th) morning. Therefore, at 7:00 a.m., there were two shifts of Yangjing and Xingaoqiao, carrying passengers back and forth once. However, the Donggou line was delayed until noon and was not resolved. After exhausting efforts to find a solution, after the Donggou ferry crossing was dredged, the Yangjing ferry crossing was blocked again, causing a shift to Yangjing at 11:00 a.m. to be blocked for a long time, until about 2:00 p.m. before a way was found to land near Gao Temple. At the same time, a batch of passengers returning to Shanghai, about 200 people, was carried back, and it was not until 5:00 p.m. that they arrived at the Xinguang Wharf. Yesterday, the reporter investigated the ferry situation in the morning and afternoon, and learned that south of Yangjing Port in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, passengers are now absolutely prohibited from getting on and off due to the situation. In the future, the only transportation between Pudong and the west side will be Donggou and Gaoqiao in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River. As for the reason why the traffic at various wharves in Pudong was blocked this time, it was because after the food and vegetables in Pudong were transported to Shanghai, the local people felt a shortage, so they temporarily blocked the transportation to Shanghai. Single passengers can come and go, but it is very inconvenient to carry items.

### De Ping Wheel Sailed to Ningbo Yesterday Afternoon

Returned Overseas Chinese from Japan Also Took the Ship to Return to Their Hometowns

The Huayi Company's De Feng Wheel, which operates the Shanghai-Ningbo route, was originally scheduled to make its third voyage to Ningbo yesterday afternoon after resuming navigation. However, when it sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai a few days ago, it was discovered that passengers were smuggling 100 dan of rice for export, and the wheel was detained for questioning by the Ningbo City Defense Commander. After it was proven that it was carried by passengers, the wheel was allowed to leave, but it was delayed for one day. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th, but it was delayed until the night before yesterday before arriving in this port. Therefore, the third shift was changed to leave yesterday afternoon. Fourteen returned overseas Chinese from Japan, including He Yuanshan, who arrived in Shanghai by French mail ship on the (27th) day before yesterday, were all entertained by a certain fellow villager group in this port and temporarily settled in hostels. Except for two of the overseas Chinese, one from Shandong and one from Jiangsu, the rest were all from Zhejiang. Therefore, at noon yesterday, a member of the original entertaining fellow villager group was specially dispatched to accompany them to the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund, boarded the De Ping Wheel, which sailed to Ningbo in the afternoon, and sent them to Ningbo.

The fifth bishop, Pastor Guo Feifei, took office on June 14, 1893, and has now resigned and retired due to old age. The new bishop, Pastor Roberto, graduated from Yale University in the United States in 1909 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and from Cambridge Divinity School in Massachusetts in 1914 with a Bachelor of Theology degree. A few months later, he packed his bags and came to China. From 1914 to 1923, he served as a professor at St. John's University in Shanghai. In 1922, he served as the General Secretary of the National Christian Conference and the Acting President of St. John's University. In 1923, he went to Nanjing to preside over St. Paul's Church until today. During this period, he only returned to China for vacation once from 1927 to 1929. This year, in April, the Chinese Holy Communion Board of Directors held a meeting in Fuzhou and elected Pastor Luo as the Bishop. By October, it was formally elected and confirmed by the American General Assembly. When Bishop Luo lived in Shanghai, he participated in tennis and golf matches.

### Treating Stomach Ailments and Encouraging Abortion

No fetus was aborted, and the person suffered severe injuries - Liu Huizhen is charged with assault.

Qu Yihe, from Jining, Shandong Province, is thirty years old. He and his wife, Qu Bi Yunxia (also thirty years old), lived in Zhabei. Due to the outbreak of the Shanghai war, they resided in a room at the back of Huizhen Hospital, number 173 Route du Père Froc, French Concession, which was run by Liu Huizhen (age 34), a female Western-trained doctor from Hunan. In late August, Qu's wife, Bi Yunxia, suffered from stomach problems and was unable to eat. They sought treatment from their landlady, Dr. Liu Huizhen. After examination, Liu diagnosed Bi with a stomach upset caused by pregnancy, stating that the fetus needed to be aborted for her to recover. Qu and his wife believed this to be true and paid a registration fee of two dollars and five dollars for medicine. Liu Huizhen then placed the medicine inside Bi's uterus. Unexpectedly, two or three days after the medication, not only was there no sign of an aborted fetus, but the medicine caused continuous bleeding and worsened her condition. After Qu negotiated with Liu, Liu introduced Bi to Kwong Tze Hospital for treatment. She has been there for over a month and has only now recovered, but is unable to move her legs and has suffered greatly. Qu Yihe, on behalf of his wife Bi Yunxia, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Court, accusing Liu Huizhen of intentional bodily harm in the course of her profession, requesting legal action. The court accepted the complaint and, on the morning of the previous day at about 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the second criminal court to summon the parties. The plaintiff, Bi Yunxia, was assisted into the court by her husband, Qu Yihe. She stated that she had sought treatment from the defendant for a stomach ailment. The defendant falsely claimed she was pregnant and prescribed medication, causing her illness, and requested a thorough investigation. The defendant, Liu Huizhen, stated that she graduated from Nanyang Hospital in 1929. When the plaintiffs lived in the spare room of my hospital, they were already ill, and the room was filled with foul odors and was extremely unhygienic. When I inquired and advised them to seek treatment, they replied that they were too poor to afford it and asked me for help. Therefore, I referred them to the Health Bureau for introduction to Kwong Tze Hospital. I never treated her and never said she was pregnant. After reviewing the testimonies, the court ordered the defendant to post a five-hundred-dollar bail for future appearances and adjourned the hearing to December 2nd. In the meantime, the plaintiff was ordered to undergo a medical examination at the court's forensic department.
