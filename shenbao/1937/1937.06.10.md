In the evening, Mr. Schacht hosted a lavish banquet for the Chinese guests at his official residence, which was festively decorated. In addition to Mr. Kong, those invited to attend included Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao, Lieutenant General Gui Yongqing, Rear Admiral Lin Xianxin, Secretary of the Executive Yuan Wu Jingchao, and Mr. Jiang Weiguo, son of Chairman Jiang.

Schacht delivered a welcoming speech, first mentioning the remarkable progress China has made under the leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and General Chiang Kai-shek since the overthrow of the Qing government in 1911. He then strongly emphasized Minister Kong's contributions during Chairman Chiang's Xi'an Incident, saying that the situation was perilous at the time, and Mr. Kong presided over the central government, maintaining national order and tranquility. Therefore, Mr. Kong played a significant role in Chairman Chiang's safe return. Schacht went on to praise Mr. Kong's currency reform, saying that it resulted in the Chinese currency becoming one of the most stable currencies in the world. He then discussed Sino-German relations, stating that there is great potential for mutual assistance between China and Germany. Germany, as an industrially developed country, can greatly assist in the implementation of China's reform and construction plans. He further discussed Sino-German cultural and scientific relations, stating that the Berlin University of Technology awarded Mr. Kong an honorary doctorate this afternoon, in recognition of Mr. Kong's scientific and technological achievements in China, which are greatly admired by the Germans.

Minister Kong then delivered a response, saying that he felt particularly pleased during this visit to Germany. Firstly, because he was able to reunite with many old friends, and secondly, because the German people have extremely friendly feelings towards China. He then stated that he felt this honor of receiving a doctorate from the University of Technology was entirely due to Germany's respect for China. Mr. Kong continued, saying that China, like Germany, follows a leader, so Chairman Chiang and other leaders are all dedicated to realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles based on his teachings. China regards Germany as its closest friend, not only because of cultural relations but also because of economic cooperation. "I deeply hope that Germany will participate in and assist China's development, especially in the exploitation of raw materials and the construction of industries and transportation." He continued, saying, "Germany has overcome all post-war difficulties and has once again risen to the ranks of world powers. Germany's main goal is to strive for peace. I solemnly declare that China will give Germany honest and sincere cooperation in realizing this goal." After Mr. Kong finished speaking, he asked all Chinese friends to raise their glasses to the health of Führer Hitler and the German people. (National Maritime Telegram, 9th)

He plans to stay in Wuhan for two days and return to Ping by Ping-Han (Beiping-Hankou) express train on the evening of the 11th. When a reporter met Dr. Monroe on the 10th, he said that he had come to China once six years ago, and again two years ago, making this his third visit. He recently inspected the general situation of education in various parts of China and found that progress is very rapid. For example, the spirit and cleanliness of students, as well as the organization and training of students, have made considerable progress compared with previous years. The Chinese government has also attached great importance to education in recent years, so the quality and quantity of education have greatly improved compared with previous years, and the development is very rapid. Speaking of the problem of secondary education in China, Dr. Monroe expressed his personal opinion that the curriculum of Chinese middle schools has too many subjects and students spend too much time in class, which needs to be studied.

Current Commentary

### Trial of Shen Junru and Seven Others Opens

— Appropriate

Shen Junru and the other seven responsible persons of the National Salvation Association of All Circles were prosecuted by the Jiangsu Higher Court Procuratorate for the crime of jointly violating Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China. The trial formally opens today. More than 20 famous lawyers are appearing in court to defend this case. The indictment and the defense statement are widely published in national newspapers. Therefore, it is attracting great attention from Chinese and foreign people. Under this situation of worldwide attention, the court should be able to make a fair judgment in the spirit of judicial dignity. There is no need for the opinion circles to comment on it. However, we believe that the defendants are all well-known figures in society. The emergence of their criminal suspicions stems from patriotic motives, which cannot be completely ignored. Even if they should be punished to some extent from a legal point of view in this case, they can also be greatly forgiven from a political point of view. After all, the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China cited in this case is a product of the political environment. The political situation cannot be ignored in the trial.

Since the arrest of Shen Junru and others, there have been many obvious changes in the domestic situation. Before last winter, the government's painstaking efforts to prudently deal with the national crisis were not well known to the people. Due to the separation of will and the lack of mutual trust, events that hindered unification often occurred. Since the Sui War and the Shaanxi Incident, the government's determination to safeguard territorial sovereignty has been made clear to the world. The enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to support the government has been unprecedented. The foundation of unification has been laid, and the government is advancing to plan the implementation of constitutional government. The past claims and actions of Shen Junru and others may have been somewhat biased, but their intentions are in line with the government's current declared policy of uniting to resist foreign aggression. If they are still convicted today for this reason, is it not regrettable from a political point of view?

Moreover, after the closing of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made a speech on pardoning political prisoners, saying, "The country is in a critical state now, and the work of national construction is so urgent. The central government must be lenient and forgiving domestically to summon peace and seek all stability... For political prisoners, if they are truly awakened and no longer take advantage of this serious domestic situation to engage in actions that disrupt the country and undermine unification, as long as they repent and reform and have a guarantor, they can of course be pardoned individually." This speech is enough to express the magnanimous spirit of the government. The authorities, and what it reveals should be valued by the presiding officers of this case. If Shen Junru and others have engaged in actions that disrupted the country and undermined unification in the past, then in accordance with this speech, ordering them to repent and reform and pardoning them would indeed be magnanimous. However, if the facts of this case are as stated in the defense statement, there is absolutely no disruption or undermining, and because of being constrained by the conditions mentioned in Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech, innocent people are made to sit on the guilt in the same way, then it is far from the government's original intention of benevolence and kindness.

The above is a little bit of our feelings about the Shen case outside the scope of the law. On this day of the opening of the trial, in view of the importance of the case, we dare to state it frankly. We hope that the judicial authorities will not think that its intention is to influence the judgment of this case.

### Roosevelt Asks Congress to Allocate Funds to Add to the Merchant Ship Fleet

### Germany and Italy Decide to Participate in the Spanish Maritime Surveillance Plan Again

The Non-Intervention Committee is scheduled to meet within days - Soviet Russia Protests the Four-Power Talks

[London] German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop had a long talk with Foreign Secretary Eden this morning. Well-informed sources said that as a result of the talks, Germany will announce its return to the Non-Intervention Committee in the near future. It is expected that Eden will hold talks with the French and Italian ambassadors within days. It is believed that the British proposal on the safety guarantees for the warships of the countries undertaking surveillance work and the prevention of similar incidents of attacking warships will be accepted by the other three countries. A plenary meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee will be held next week, and it is said that representatives of Germany and Italy will also attend. The note submitted by Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky was the topic of conversation between Eden and Eire. (10th National Maritime News Agency Dispatch)

[London] Germany, Italy, and France have all accepted the British proposal, so the resumption of surveillance by the four countries' warships in Spanish waters has now been virtually determined. It is expected that the final draft submitted to the two warring parties in Spain will be passed by the four countries today or tomorrow. After the Non-Intervention Committee received the Soviet Union's protest against the four-power discussion, the acting chairman, Sinclair, informed Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky that, in the British government's view, the procedures currently being followed do not infringe upon the functions of the Non-Intervention Committee. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)

[London] Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky sent an official letter to Wallace, the acting chairman of the Committee for Adjusting Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War, yesterday, stating that all member states of the Adjustment Committee should have the opportunity to participate in the content of the negotiations currently being conducted by various countries in charge of surveillance work in Spanish waters. Wallace immediately replied and, at the request of Ambassador Maisky, distributed the correspondence to all member states. With regard to this, the British responsible party stated that the negotiations currently being conducted by the countries undertaking surveillance work began in accordance with the unanimous wishes expressed by the Adjustment Committee after the German cruiser "Deutschland" was bombed. Wallace, the deputy chairman of the Adjustment Committee, repeatedly stated that the four countries, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, should obtain security guarantees from both parties involved in the Spanish civil war. At that time, Soviet Ambassador Maisky did not raise any objections, and Wallace also made a guarantee to Maisky. The negotiations conducted by the four countries, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, are limited to security guarantees, so that the countries can continue to implement surveillance work. (Central News Agency 10th Havas Dispatch)

[London] British diplomatic circles believe that the British government is currently planning various procedures to ensure the final success of the negotiations on security guarantees for the warships of the countries undertaking surveillance work and to enable Germany and Italy to rejoin the work of the Adjustment Committee. This procedure should not be changed by the official letter sent by Maisky. The main points of the procedures planned by the British are as follows: The first step is for the four countries, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, to establish an agreement on the security guarantees for the warships of the countries undertaking surveillance work. The second step is for the British government to issue a solemn recommendation, requesting the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war to respect the safe areas of Spanish ports, so as to avoid the recurrence of incidents similar to the bombing of the Italian warship "Barletta" and the German warship "Deutschland," and to take all necessary measures to expand the safe areas of Spanish ports. It is heard that some delegation members of the Adjustment Committee advocate that the Adjustment Committee should issue a recommendation to the two sides of the Spanish civil war, rather than the British government doing so, but the British government believes that this method is difficult to implement because Germany and Italy are not currently participating in the Adjustment Committee. As for the question asked in the Soviet ambassador's letter as to whether the "Deutschland" had participated in surveillance work, responsible people believe that it is not a problem, because the Adjustment Committee had previously decided that all countries participating in naval surveillance may at any time use any warships they deem necessary to carry out surveillance. (Central News Agency 9th Havas Dispatch)

[London] Britain, France, Germany, and Italy are negotiating to restore the Spanish maritime surveillance plan and are about to reach an agreement, but Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky suddenly submitted a note to the Non-Intervention Committee, protesting the four-power talks. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)

[Moscow] Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky sent the following official letter to the acting chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee yesterday, which stated, "The Soviet government has carefully studied the minutes of the meeting of the Subcommittee of your chairman on May 31, and now orders me to raise the following points of doubt and respectfully ask for a reply: Since the implementation of the maritime surveillance measures, has the German government ever notified your committee that the German warship 'Deutschland' had been authorized to perform surveillance duties in Spanish waters? If the German government has not notified so far, and we have sufficient reasons to believe that this is indeed the case, then how can we know that the 'Deutschland' was stationed in Spanish waters to perform maritime surveillance, rather than for a completely different task? Moreover, the 'Deutschland' and other German warships had already been stationed in Spanish waters before the implementation of the maritime surveillance measures, which further proves the correctness of the aforementioned second hypothesis. Therefore, Germany and Italy's excuse to participate in the maritime surveillance of various ships is not guaranteed, and therefore withdrawing from the Non-Intervention Committee is unreasonable. Furthermore, even assuming that the 'Deutschland' had ever participated in surveillance duties at any time, it can in no way be considered that it was carrying out surveillance while stationed in the Balearic Islands, because the maritime surveillance mission in that area does not belong to the German Navy. What is even more important is that, according to the maritime surveillance measures approved by the plenary meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee on March 8, maritime surveillance can in no way be carried out in Spanish ports or locations adjacent to the west coast. From this point of view, even if the 'Deutschland' had actually been sent to perform surveillance duties, it was definitely not engaged in that task when it was bombed. This point can be considered absolutely true. Regarding the more general issue caused by the bombing of the 'Deutschland,' I must ask your chairman to pay attention to the following facts: In the past, the rebels have repeatedly taken aggressive actions against British ships and French aircraft within French territory, but the Non-Intervention Committee has not yet discussed this incident. It should also be stated that in the past six or seven months, the rebels have systematically illegally detained many Soviet, Scandinavian, and other countries' merchant ships, and these types of incidents were only put on the agenda by the committee after repeated and firm requests from the countries concerned, and after many delays, they were very generally and obviously unsatisfactorily discussed by the committee recently. 'In principle, I do not oppose the Non-Intervention Committee taking measures to protect various ships participating in maritime surveillance from accidents caused by military actions, but I must state that, in my opinion, negotiations on these measures must be conducted after the entire issue has been discussed by the committee and on the condition that the representatives of all countries participating in the committee have been notified in detail and in full. 'The above full letter, I hope to forward it to all members of the committee for review." (9th TASS Dispatch)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden attended the House of Commons today and answered various questions raised by members of parliament, stating that "the British government recognizes the legitimate right of self-defense of the warships of the countries participating in Spanish maritime surveillance, but absolutely does not advocate the right to implement retaliation." He also stated that since the implementation of the surveillance plan, there have been no reports of Italian volunteers arriving in Spain. As for the British people captured by the Spanish rebels, 23 have been released, and the other 5 have not yet been released. (Central News Agency 9th Havas Dispatch)

[Rome] According to a report in the semi-official Italian Daily, regarding the British government's suggestion on security guarantees for the warships of the countries undertaking surveillance in Spanish waters, the four countries, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, will hold a meeting in order to draft a final agreement, which has been accepted by the governments of Germany and Italy.

### Ethiopian Emperor Files Lawsuit Against Italy

Regarding Railway Shares

[Paris] Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia is suing the Italian government in a Paris court over the ownership of 30,000,000 French francs worth of shares in the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company. Selassie originally intended to sell his shares, but the Italian government prevented him from doing so. The Italian government protested to the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company in Paris, claiming that the shares belonged to the Ethiopian government and not to the Emperor's private property. Therefore, the ownership of the shares belongs to the current Ethiopian government. However, Selassie believes that France has not recognized the Italian annexation of Ethiopia, so France should recognize the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company as representing the Ethiopian government. The Emperor has retained several lawyers to conduct the lawsuit, and it is expected that the case will be heard in the near future. (National Maritime Telegram, 9th)

The Third Branch Bureau, upon receiving the report, sent a patrol officer to advise him to comply with the regulations, but Yu also refused to listen. While they were arguing, a Taiwanese man named Chen led more than a dozen people from an opium den and refused even more forcefully. Soon, more than twenty people came again, forcibly loading the furniture into three cargo trucks, surrounding and escorting them, and moving directly to Delin Lane. After these three cases occurred in succession in two days, the police station reported to the municipal government, requesting negotiations with the Japanese Consulate General in Xiamen, so that Japanese residents would follow police regulations when moving. In addition, since the oil case occurred, there have been rumors. From morning to noon on the 6th, the police station ordered all police detectives in the city to mobilize and conduct a trial martial law. As a result, the preparedness and communication were thorough, and it was expected that the response would be foolproof.

It is investigated that the Japanese residents have continuously moved without being willing to comply with the regulations, and on the second day, they even used dozens of ruffians with weapons as cover. Fortunately, the police station did not prevent them and did not force them to complete the procedures. Otherwise, if any of the three were sanctioned, it would undoubtedly create a second oil case. The martial law on the 6th was to prevent the other party from taking the opportunity to cause trouble, and the situation was even more serious on the 7th. During the dispute in Fangnan Chou Lane, the Police Headquarters immediately telegraphed the Japanese Police Department to report, and it was reported that the Japanese residents said that it was not necessary to complete the procedures when moving. The Police Headquarters later saw that the situation was critical, so it ordered the Branch Bureau not to interfere temporarily and to let them pass along the way, so that no incident occurred. Although the municipal government negotiated with the Japanese Consulate General, it is feared that it will not be easy to achieve results. There are more than 10,000 Taiwanese residents in Xiamen who are formally registered with household registrations, and there are no less than 20,000 including those who are not registered, distributed and living throughout the city, divided into districts and sections, with a strict Baojia organization (four districts in Xiamen and two districts in Gulangyu). They have their own household registrations and nail the household registration plates of the Taiwanese People's Association on the door (in the past, Japanese residents who moved reported to the Japanese Police Department, and the Japanese Police Department notified our police station by telephone, and the transfer certificate was sent to the moving household; this time, there was no notification). They are all under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Police Department, which is subordinate to the Japanese Consulate, and the Xiamen Municipal Government Police Department is no less than two administrations standing in the same place, and it is no less than a part of the Japanese national people within Chinese territory. This situation has been formed for a long time, so the Japanese Police Department believes that it should not be interfered with by us. As for Shantou, the Japanese have long been trying to expand their power. Two years ago, the Japanese transferred 400 of the most evil Taiwanese ruffians from Xiamen to Shantou to use as shock troops. The Shantou case that occurred this time should not be ignored. Also, after the Shantou case, the Taiwanese residents in Xiamen wanted to respond to their counterparts, so they often tried to create trouble. (9th)

### Ling Shifen Returns to Guangzhou to Report on the Investigation of the Shantou Case

The Key to Negotiations Lies in the Issue of Responsibility; Japanese Warships Move Freely Outside Shantou Port

Guangzhou Correspondence: After Ling Shifen, Secretary of the Liangguang Diplomatic Office, and Teiji Yoshitake, Japanese Vice-Consul stationed in Guangzhou, conducted an on-site investigation of the Shantou Aoyama case, the two sides exchanged their findings in Shantou and planned to negotiate on the spot, but as a result, the two sides still held their own views. Kiyoshi Aoyama clearly admitted to beating the Shantou police, while Yamazaki, the Japanese Consul stationed in Shantou, made extraneous issues, believing that the Shantou police's arrest of Aoyama was an insult. Therefore, the negotiations in Shantou were still deadlocked. Ling Shifen and Yoshitake then returned to Guangzhou by ship from Shantou on the 4th and arrived in Guangzhou on the 6th. Yoshitake immediately reported everything to Toyoichi Nakamura, the Japanese Consul stationed in Guangzhou. Ling also reported the details of the Shantou case to Zuoqian Diao, the Special Envoy of the Liangguang Diplomatic Office. Diao immediately ordered Ling to draft a detailed report and telegraph it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to await instructions from the Ministry on the negotiation direction. According to Ling, "The Aoyama incident was originally a small local matter, and it would be best to resolve it locally. Otherwise, it will be transferred to the province for handling. The Diplomatic Office is prepared to negotiate with the other party. The key to the conclusion of this matter lies in the issue of responsibility. As for the content of the case, our side has obtained detailed and true information. Nakamura Toyoichi, the Japanese Consul in Guangzhou, intends to negotiate. This Office will negotiate reasonably. As for the four Japanese warships, they are still outside Shantou Port. When I left Shantou, the Japanese warships had not yet withdrawn, but according to the Japanese side, the Japanese warships' arrival in Shantou has nothing to do with the Aoyama incident."

In addition to the original four Japanese warships, two more flagships arrived in Shantou on the 6th, with unfathomable intentions. Our side has verbally protested to the Japanese Consul, saying that the continuous increase of Japanese warships seems to be making a big deal out of the Shantou case. If the Japanese warships have a misunderstanding with the local area, the Japanese side should bear full responsibility. It was also recently heard that the Japanese ruffians secretly established a naval special service agency in Shantou. The agency's staff are all Japanese naval officers, and it is expected to start operations next month. The agency's expenses are fixed at 10,000 yuan per month. Its duties seem to be closely related to the Japanese Navy, so that it can echo the Japanese Navy in case of an emergency. In view of this, the actions of the Japanese in Shantou are even more worthy of attention. (June 8th)

### Tianjin Customs Decides to Thoroughly Eliminate Smuggled Goods

Reaches a Compromise with the Concession Authorities and Formulates Measures for Inspecting Smuggled Goods

Tianjin Correspondence: At dusk on the 7th, the patrol boat police of the Wuhe River Maritime Public Security Bureau intercepted five civilian boats carrying smuggled goods sailing south from Tianjin along the Ziya River. Each boat was loaded with 30 to 40 bags of flour, and the cabin contained more than 130 bags of smuggled currency, worth tens of thousands of yuan. They were immediately detained and reported to the Tianjin Customs. The Tianjin Customs sent personnel to pick them up on the 8th, confiscated them and stored them in warehouses. The boatmen and escorts were handed over to the police station for transfer to the court for punishment. Recently, because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, there is a greater demand for materials in foreign towns, so smugglers have used various methods to transport them out. Although the customs has tried its best to block and arrest them, it still cannot completely prevent them. According to customs statistics, from January to the present, smuggled goods shipped from eastern Hebei to Tianjin have averaged about 2 million customs taels of tax evasion per month. If five months are counted together, the loss is more than 10 million taels. This week is less than the first half of last year, but if the anti-smuggling defenses are not actively repaired, the quality of smuggling in the second half of the year may still return to its rampant period. As a result, the total annual loss may exceed last year. Therefore, in order to take care of the future, the customs has to do its best to focus on the elimination of smuggled goods stored in Tianjin.

The registration of smuggled goods in Tianjin has been repeatedly postponed. Recently, after consultation between the Chamber of Commerce and the Customs, it was agreed that the deadline would be extended from June 1st to the end of July. During this period, all merchants and private associations must register as soon as possible. After the deadline, the customs will cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce to carry out inspections and sell those who go to other places. Pay taxes according to regulations, not punished as smuggled goods. Those who sell in the city will first pay 30% of the tax. From July 1st to the end of this year, it is the registration period for the sale of smuggled goods. If this deadline is exceeded, regardless of whether they are sold or not, the remaining 70% of customs duties will be supplemented. The Chamber of Commerce had originally accepted this method, but a few industry associations still held objections, watched each other, and delayed registration. To date, only about fifty or sixty households have been registered with the Chamber of Commerce. Most of them used the excuse that Chinese merchants in the concessions could not follow this method, and believed that the customs was no different from a mob beating the prince, and insisted that all Chinese circles must comply at the same time. Wei Liang Mei, the Customs Tax Division, therefore visited the authorities of various concessions last week (except for the Japanese concession) to discuss the registration methods for smuggled goods by Chinese merchants in each concession. The following was agreed on the 8th: ㊀ All Chinese merchants in the Tianjin concessions should list all the smuggled goods in stock in a clear form and register with the Customs. The registration form will be sent to the Customs by the Chamber of Commerce for inspection. ㊁ The handling of the registered smuggled goods this time is purely for the merchants concerned to discuss and implement with the Chamber of Commerce and the Customs. The merchants must also comply with the following five regulations: (A) Once the registration form of each merchant's smuggled goods is submitted to the Customs by the Chamber of Commerce, all shops, warehouses, and account books of each merchant will be subject to free inspection by customs officers at any time. (B) The Customs should inspect and verify the various smuggled goods stored in the registered merchants and levy taxes in accordance with regulations. (C) The Customs will send the Customs import tax payment certificate to the merchants concerned within an appropriate period and order them to pay 30% of the customs duties in cash first. For the remaining 70%, each merchant should prepare a guarantee separately, stating that it will be responsible for paying the full amount when the six-month deadline expires from July 1st of this year. If the registered smuggled goods have been sold locally in this city within the six-month deadline, all unpaid 70% of customs duties should be paid clearly. The guarantee prepared should be registered by the Chamber of Commerce and forwarded to the Supervisory Office for submission to the Customs for filing. (D) Regarding the registered smuggled goods, if you want to transport them to the interior for sale, you should pay the full 10% of the returned money when applying for the sales license before the Customs issues the license. Otherwise, once they are seized, regardless of whether 30% of the tax has been paid, they will all be confiscated in accordance with the regulations. (E) The relevant merchants must not engage in smuggled goods after this registration to show restrictions. If the customs finds more smuggled goods in the registered merchants, it will be confiscated immediately in accordance with the regulations and will never be lenient. From July 1st, if any merchant is still engaged in smuggled goods, the Customs will take decisive measures at any time to stop it. As for the registration deadline, it will never be extended again. (8th)

### Uses of Treasury Bills Issued by the Nanjing Municipal Government

—Total Amount is 960,000 Yuan—

Nanjing Correspondence: In order to subsidize the needs of various constructions within the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Nanjing Municipal Government has prepared a method to request the central government to approve the issuance of treasury bills. The amount is tentatively set at 960,000 yuan, which is being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance and will soon be issued. The following is a record of Mayor Chaojun Ma's discussion of the issuance method, the use and distribution, and the collection of land price tax and the construction of the rice market.

House Rent as Mortgage

Regarding the use of treasury bills, it is an expedient measure to subsidize the funds needed for various constructions. The interest rate is lower than that of public bonds, and there is no complexity of public bond procedures. The treasury bills are guaranteed by house rent, which is only a pre-overdraft and bears a slight interest. The original amount was 3 million yuan, which was based on the principle of issuing it in three years, 1 million each year, and 250,000 each quarter. This time, it was changed to 960,000 yuan, which is also issued in four seasons within this year, so although the amount is reduced, the principle remains the same. The issuance period for each quarter is three months, and the principal and interest will be fully repaid upon maturity. Issuance and repayment will be completed within six months, so that the funds needed can be implemented and the construction can be promoted.

Use of Treasury Bills

The use of these treasury bills is to subsidize road construction, build affordable housing, and expand municipal hospitals. Part of the road construction has already started, such as extending Jiankang Road to the Dazhong Bridge. Those that will be started soon are Jianye Road, Baixia Road East Road, Beijing Road, and the eastern section of Zhujiang Road, all of which are scheduled to be completed this year. In addition, the construction of Gulou Square, the reconstruction of Yixian Bridge, and the construction of the road from Zhongshan Gate to Xiaolingwei must be completed before the National Games on Double Ten Day to facilitate transportation for the games. Affordable housing is an urgent need to meet actual needs and cannot be delayed any longer. The municipal government has long planned to expand municipal hospitals. The population of Nanjing has increased sharply, and public health is of utmost importance, so the 26th year will be expanded as much as possible. Once the issuance of treasury bills begins, it is expected that the above plans will be implemented in the 26th year.

Land Price Tax Collection

Since the land price tax in Nanjing started in November of the 25th year, because the matter was newly created, citizens have not been eager to pay. The deadline for the collection of this land price tax expires this month. Now, in order to pay attention to tax revenue and consider the interests of citizens, the municipal government has extended part of it for one year, until the end of the 26th year as the deadline. At the same time, the tax rate has been reduced to 90% to lighten the burden on citizens. The municipal government has carefully considered the estimated land price and has not raised it. For example, the land price in Xinjiekou is currently worth 600 yuan to 1,000 yuan per square foot, and the municipal government estimates it at 400 yuan. The original budget for the land price tax was about 800,000 yuan, but now it is roughly 700,000 yuan after reducing the tax rate. However, less than half of those who have been paid have paid so far, so it is hoped that citizens can respect government tax revenue and pay as scheduled.

Trackless Trolley

The construction of the rice market is purely for Nanjing to regulate food supply and demand. The planning committee branch is preparing and proceeding very quickly. China Southern Rice Industry Company is very interested in building warehouses in Nanjing to assist the establishment of the Nanjing rice market. In addition, the city's traffic facilities seem to be insufficient to cope with the situation. The municipal government once planned to create a trackless trolley. The plan has been prepared, but the cost is too large, and several million yuan is not enough to cope with it. The Shanghai banking community is extremely willing to invest, but in the end, because the scope is quite large, it still requires a long period of negotiation. Although there is a discussion about holding it in the 26th year, in fact, I am afraid that it may still be insufficient.

In short, the construction of the first department should be carried out under the principle of not increasing the burden on citizens. The foundation of success lies in the perfection of the plan and the spirit of hard work and practical work. The Nanjing Municipal Government has been established for ten years, and the scale of the group is available. All facilities hope to be completed quickly, but due to financial problems, the preparation of expenses has been delayed, and the progress is inevitably slower. The municipal government's tenth anniversary celebration this time has received many good opinions from all parties, and it is now studying them in detail as a reference for future facilities. Regarding the administrative plan for the 26th year, it has now been prepared but is still under review.

### Songjiang

Fire Destroys Homes Outside the East Gate

About two li north of Huayang Bridge outside the East Gate, the family of Jiang Baosheng of Yinjia Bang, District 17, was of modest means. They had four rows of houses built, with family members living separately within. On the 9th, at 3:00 AM, a fire broke out carelessly in the front row of the main room and side rooms. Despite neighbors' attempts to extinguish it, three rooms were burned down. Household items and over 3,000 kilograms of stored grain were destroyed, with losses estimated at over ten gold dollars.

Prohibition of Dismissals During the Dragon Boat Festival

On the 10th, the County Chamber of Commerce received an instruction from the County Government, stating that according to a submission from the General Labor Union, all industries must not dismiss employees without cause during the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival in order to maintain their livelihoods and avoid disputes. Upon receiving the submission, the Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded it to the various industry trade unions, instructing them to inform all businesses to take note.

Unemployed Man Commits Suicide by Poison

Huang Jianhua, who had previously worked for the Great Northern Telegraph Company in Shanghai and resided in the Old West Gate of Shanghai, was recently dismissed from the company due to illness, leading to financial difficulties. He came to Suzhou the other day and checked into room 218 of the Dadong Hotel outside Chang Gate. He left a note and committed suicide by taking poison. After being discovered, he was immediately sent to Shuyong Hospital for treatment, but due to the excessive amount of poison, his life was in danger. His wife, Yang Lizhen, learned of the situation and has come to Suzhou to take care of him.

### Yangzhou

Outbreak of "Locked Jaw" Illness in Zhaoguan

Due to the fluctuating temperatures and untimely wind and rain, a dangerous epidemic has broken out in the Zhaoguan Township area of the Seventh District of Jiangdu. The initial symptom is the inability to speak, with the jaw locked shut. Treatment is often too late, followed by dizziness, blurred vision, and unconsciousness. Death occurs within minutes, commonly referred to as "locked jaw". Local residents are currently planning preventative measures.

Urgent Action to Eradicate Locust Nymphs in the Eighth District

Locust nymphs have been discovered in the lakeside and滩田 fields of Chian Township in the Eighth District of the county. The county sent personnel to investigate and convened a meeting of township and baojia leaders to discuss eradication measures, stipulating the conscription of able-bodied men from each household to cooperate with tools, digging ditches to drive the locust nymphs into them, and setting them on fire. On the 6th and 7th of this month, heavy rains fell, washing away and drowning the locust nymphs. Unexpectedly, after days of sunny weather, the locust nymphs suddenly increased again. The county government, upon receiving the news, specially dispatched personnel to the countryside yesterday to urge eradication, to prevent the plague from spreading and affecting the crops.

### Changzhou

Weicun Town Looted by Bandits

Weicun Town, located in the Fourth District about five or six li from the Yangtze River, was suddenly attacked by a large group of bandits numbering over fifty around 3:00 PM on the 9th. They entered the town and looted for about two hours. The bandit leader was physically robust and wore a red cloth around his waist. The other bandits had red cloths wrapped around their arms. They spoke in a mix of northern accents, Jiangbei accents, and local dialects. After entering the town, they opened fire and killed people, set fires, looted firearms, and stole over 20,000 yuan in cash. They also exchanged fire with tax police along the way, but the tax police were outnumbered and had to retreat. However, the three people kidnapped by the bandits were later released. The bandits escaped by boat towards Qin Xing. The county government has dispatched a team by boat to pursue and suppress them.

### Wuxi

Implementation of Interest Collection on Unregistered Land

In order to actively promote land administration and encourage property owners to quickly declare and register their land, the Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Bureau has specifically implemented measures to collect interest on temporarily managed land. The interest rate is calculated at 6% per annum, or 5% per month, based on the assessed land value or the declared land value. If the land is still not registered after three years, it will be considered ownerless. These measures have been submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation. The Wuxi County Land Administration Bureau has been ordered to comply. Furthermore, the Wuxi Bureau has set a deadline of the end of June for the completion of land registration throughout the county. However, 30% of the land in the county has not yet been registered. The bureau has decided to establish additional registration offices in each district to handle supplementary registrations, with a total of 33 offices throughout the county, to ensure that all land, whether public or private, is registered according to the law, with no land hidden.

### Jiaxing

Attempted Pawn of Fake Gold Bracelet Foiled

On the morning of the 9th, three people brought a fake gold bracelet to the Dingyuan Pawnshop in Tanghui Town, Jiaxing, to pawn it. The pawnshop clerk discovered the deception. Realizing the situation was bad, the three immediately tried to escape. Clerk Lu Liusheng and others followed them and kept watch. In front of the police station, two of the men ran away. Only one man was caught and taken to the station. He identified himself as Wu Shenglin, 27 years old, from Yangzhou, residing in Shanghai. He claimed to have come from Shuanglin today to visit a friend but had not found him. He denied trying to pawn the fake gold bracelet. The patrol officer has handed the man over to the Chengguan Public Security Bureau for disposal.

### Hangzhou

Planning the Sanmen Bay Railway

The Provincial Government has received instructions to develop Sanmen Bay, to create a prosperous commercial port and a good fishing harbor. The Construction Department was immediately ordered to actively proceed, starting with the construction of a highway, which has now been surveyed and is about to begin construction. It has recently been learned that the Provincial Government has also received instructions to plan the construction of a railway to facilitate transportation. The railway will connect to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, starting from Yiwu, passing through Dongyang and Tiantai, and extending directly to Sanmen Bay, a total of 170 kilometers, requiring an estimated investment of over 10 million yuan. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau has been requested to survey the route on behalf of the government, and the bureau has dispatched engineer Xiong Zhenghu to conduct the survey. It is expected to be completed in about a month.

Summer Silkworm Seeds to be Distributed Soon

The spring silkworm harvest in Zhejiang Province was poor, so silkworm farmers are competing to raise summer silkworms to compensate for the losses of the spring silkworm season. According to the overall needs of the various counties, about 100,000 sheets are required. Zhejiang Province does not manufacture summer seeds, so orders were placed with various seed production centers in Jiangsu Province, but the number could not be fully met, with only 70,000 sheets available. This amount will be allocated proportionally. The summer seeds have now arrived and will soon be distributed to silkworm farmers in Wuxing, Deqing, Hangxian, Haining, Shengxian, Xiaoshan, and other counties for raising.

### Haizhou

Japanese Fishing Boat Intrude into Gan Sea

A Japanese fishing boat was suddenly discovered off the coast of Zhupeng, Ganyu County, the other day, casting nets and fishing. The fishermen of the coastal sailing boats believed that Zhupeng Port was Chinese territorial waters and a conflict ensued, and the situation was quite serious. The fishermen reported the event to Shi Yunzhang, the third squad leader of the third district of the Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Police. After Captain Shi reported the news, he immediately led a gunboat from Xiangshui Port to negotiate. The Japanese fishing boat then left.

### Dangtu

Zhaofeng Silk Factory Robbed

The Zhaofeng Silk Factory in Bowang Town, Dongxiang, Dangtu County, had a better business year this year than in the past. On the 6th, a large sum of money was transported from a certain bank in Nandong, ready to be paid out the next day. Unexpectedly, around 2:00 AM that night, armed soldiers climbed over the wall into the factory and went to the accounting room, threatening the accountants with guns and demanding that the money be handed over. The accountants were forced to hand over all the deposited money, totaling 18,497 yuan. The soldiers carried the money out of the factory and fled to the southeast. The factory did not dare to make an immediate announcement. The security team responsible for prevention, the second detachment of the eighth company of the second battalion of the garrison in Bo, were stationed extremely near the factory. The team leader, having received news of the robbery, took role call and discovered that seven soldiers were missing. Then he knew there was a mutiny and robbery. They pursued the bandits but they were nowhere to be seen. It is said that they changed their clothes and fled to the border of Jiangsu. The factory is now closed, and the money for the hanging Zhuang is being raised again.

### Exchange Confrontation Between Bulls and Bears, Chaotic Market Situation, Request for Mediation by Yu Lin Wang

Bears Propose a Compromise to the Bulls, Over 40 Brokers Lose Over 10 Million Yuan, Market Price Agreed Upon, Red Card and Below to Open for Auction as Usual This Morning

Since the soaring price of auction yarn on June 8th, trading markets have been chaotic.

The exchange proceeded with the morning and afternoon auctions yesterday as usual, but neither the bulls nor the bears engaged in trading, and both still displayed black cards. The Brokers Association held a general meeting to discuss countermeasures and delegated four representatives to request mediation from Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and others. The bears proposed a compromise based on the market prices of the 7th and negotiated with the bulls, but no results were achieved. Several brokerage firms in the exchange, burdened by unsuccessful margin calls, are said to be considering bankruptcy. The remaining brokerage firms have suffered losses of over ten million yuan. Trading will resume as usual this morning, with market prices set at red card and below, but it is uncertain whether this will avert the crisis. There was no trading in the flour market either, and it was decided to suspend new transactions. The details are reported by the Dagongshe reporter as follows.

No Transactions at Opening Yesterday Morning

The soaring price of yarn trading in the city is due to the yarn shortage and the manipulation by the bulls, a situation even worse than during the "January 28th" incident. The market was even more chaotic yesterday morning, with crowds packed together and disorganized. Auctions, usually scheduled to start at 9:30 AM, were delayed until 10:50 AM due to the Brokers Association's meeting. From the first lot to the closing bell, the auction of near and far-term auction yarns for June, July, August, September, and October only heard the sound of the gavel, but no one raised their hand, and no transactions took place. Black cards were displayed, and the session ended in just five minutes. The auction procedure was repeated after 2:00 PM in the afternoon, but there were still no transactions, and everyone dispersed.

Brokers Request Mediation by Yu and Du

At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Brokers Association convened a general meeting of over 60 yarn and flower brokerage firms in the conference hall to discuss countermeasures. Due to the severity of the situation, each brokerage firm was only allowed to send one ticket to attend. After about two hours of discussion, it was decided to send four representatives—Zhu Wenqi, Sun Yufeng, Shao Wenmei, and Zhou Shaokang—to request mediation from Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and others. After the meeting, the representatives visited Du at his residence at 11:10 AM. Du accepted the representatives' request and agreed to do his best to communicate with the bulls. He felt that resolving the settlement issue would be difficult but was willing to guarantee that the exchange would resume as usual tomorrow (today), with market prices guaranteed to be lowered below the red card from the highest peak of auction yarn on the 8th. In the afternoon, the representatives also visited Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai to ask for their strong mediation in order to maintain market operations. Yu and Wang both expressed their willingness to assist and seek a solution as soon as possible.

Negotiations for a Compromise

According to the majority opinion of the brokers, it was advocated that the bulls, bears, and the exchange authorities should independently agree on the market price fluctuation percentage and open for auction as usual, without using a settlement form, but adopting the essence of settlement. After a long period of research, it was thought that the customers on both the buying and selling sides would certainly not agree to this principle, so the plan was abandoned. Another group advocated that the transaction values of the bulls and bears on June 8th should be settled in full, and after settlement, trading should resume. However, this was also stopped due to dissenting opinions. However, the brokers and customers standing on the bear side, after 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, automatically gathered again and proposed a compromise: all near and far-term auction yarns traded on June 8th should be settled at the closing price on June 7th: (June) 284.9 yuan, (July) 279.5 yuan, (August) 276.5 yuan, and (September) 275.1 yuan. If calculated according to the highest closing price on August 8th, the near-term is reduced by more than 10 yuan, and the far-term is reduced by more than 8 yuan. After asking the bulls, the bulls did not agree because this compromise would damage their own interests too much. The bears are still trying to persuade them to avoid a stalemate. As of late at night, no concrete decision had been made.

Yarn Inventory in the Market is Less Than 40,000

The biggest reasons for the unprecedented surge in auction yarn this time are: ㊀ shortage of available yarn, ㊁ bulls hoarding and refusing to sell, and ㊂ rumors of borrowing and currency reform. In order to clarify the amount of yarn inventory in the market, the Dagongshe reporter conducted a detailed investigation with the yarn industry. As a result, the current inventory in the market is only about 40,000 pieces, and the amount received by the bulls has reached more than 20,000 pieces. The remaining available inventory is limited and not enough to be distributed. Therefore, the bears cannot buy in, so the bulls rely on this strong strength to control the market as they please. Small-capital operators are facing raw material shortages due to the inability to purchase goods, and work stoppages are imminent. The market is full of pessimism, and a sense of infinite anxiety is revealed between expressions.

Bear Losses Reach 10 Million

The Dagongshe reporter investigated the losses of the bears in the recent auction yarn surge with the exchange. After inquiring from all parties, it was found that there are more than 70 brokerage firms in the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, including flower firms. There are also three or four empty firms with no name, so the actual number is less than 70. About 40 of them have more short positions than long positions. The total number of losses this time is about 10 million yuan or more.

Trading to Resume as Usual This Morning

Since the Broker Association's general meeting delegated representatives to request mediation from Du Yuesheng, and Du expressed that the future auction price would be guaranteed to be lowered below the red card, in order to ease the atmosphere between the buying and selling sides, the exchange immediately posted a notice last night, setting the date for trading to resume as usual this morning. However, judging from the mentality of the market, the panic has not improved. The bulls are unwilling to sell, and the bears are unwilling to trade due to the high price. Therefore, there is no definite certainty as to whether there will be trading after the opening this morning.

According to Shenzhou News, Du summoned the bull magnates Xu Maochang and others for talks, advising them to maintain the market and not absorb such huge quantities again. Xu and others, trusting Du's sincere mediation, have agreed to maintain the market. It is expected that some of the bulls will sell off today, so that black cards will not be displayed again. However, it seems that this bull group has organized actions and expressed dissatisfaction with the current minority of directors.

Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Investigate

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 10th - The Ministry of Industry believes that speculation in the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been rampant in recent years, leading to repeated disturbances, which is extremely regrettable. Recently, it was heard that someone was manipulating the market, intending to suspend trading. The ministry also received a telegram from the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange Brokers Association requesting that personnel be sent to investigate. The ministry, considering that the exchange's trading has repeatedly caused disturbances and that the current situation is particularly serious, with someone obviously using tricks to manipulate market prices, violating Article 52 of the Exchange Law, as well as obstructing the market for agricultural and industrial goods with fraudulent techniques, violating Article 251, Paragraph 1, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, specifically dispatched Cheng Tiangu, the political deputy of the ministry, to Shanghai on the 10th to supervise the exchange supervisor in handling the matter strictly according to the law. At the same time, in accordance with Article 43, Paragraph 3 of the Exchange Law, a letter was sent to the Control Yuan requesting that personnel be sent to investigate. Cheng Tiangu, after receiving the order, has already departed for Shanghai by night train on the 10th.

### Over Twenty Orphanages Have Been Established to Accommodate Gansu Province Disaster Orphans

Chen Tiesheng Scheduled to Fly to Sichuan on the 15th, Planning to Establish Orphanages in Various Counties of the Province

Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, inspected the disaster areas of Sichuan, Gansu, and other provinces and deeply felt the suffering of the disaster victims, especially the disaster orphans. Therefore, he had the idea of running orphanages. The details are as follows:

Gansu Has Established Over Twenty

When Chairman Zhu went to Gansu Province, he saw that the disaster orphans in the province were often abandoned by their parents on the road, unable to beg for food. Their tragic situation was unbearable. He immediately had the idea of setting up orphanages. More than 20 have now been opened, accommodating more than 12,000 male disaster orphans and more than 1,000 female disaster orphans. Plans are being made to expand in the future.

Chen Tiesheng to Fly to Sichuan

Chen Tiesheng of the China Child Welfare Association will fly to Sichuan Province on the 15th of this month to inspect the situation of the disaster orphans in the province and provide relief. Chen also expressed his agreement with the orphanage's approach. Therefore, he plans to establish such orphanages in the provinces.

Brief Rules of the Orphanage

The brief rules of the orphanage run by Zhu are as follows: ㊀ Disaster-stricken counties should set up orphanages in cities and branch orphanages in towns and villages to accommodate male and female disaster orphans who have fled the famine and those who have no parents, no clothing, and no food. In addition to food, they should be taught the basic knowledge that citizens should have, such as literacy. The term is tentatively set at one year. ㊁ There is no fixed quota for disaster orphans received by the orphanages and branch orphanages, but strict investigations must be carried out first, and no one should be admitted falsely. ㊂ The cost of food for each child per month is limited to one and a half yuan. All eat thin porridge. ㊃ Disaster orphans who have fled the famine are housed in the institute. Those from the place should go to the institute every morning and live in their homes in the evening. ㊄ Each child is given clothing as appropriate, and bedding is provided for those who stay in the institute. (Clothing is raised through donations.) ㊅ The director of each county orphanage is appointed by the county magistrate or by the province. The director of the branch orphanage is selected by the director. Each member receives a monthly allowance of ten yuan, except for those who are concurrently held by the county magistrate. ㊆ Each orphanage or branch orphanage is equipped with one instructor, with a monthly allowance of ten yuan. Except for those who are concurrently appointed by the county magistrate, the director or branch director can also be兼任, and an additional five yuan will be paid in addition to this allowance. ㊇ The food for the director of the institute, the director of the branch, and the instructor is the same as that of the disaster orphans. ㊈ Each institute or branch institutes employs two handyman, who are responsible for cooking rice, boiling water, and other grains. In addition to the same food, each pays a monthly salary of元. ㊉ Disaster orphans’ mothers can take turns to come to the institute to wash and sew clothes for the disaster orphans, and are given the same food for one day. ㊉㊀ All tasks such as drawing water, washing dishes, and moving firewood, charcoal, and cleaning are performed by disaster orphans. ㊉㊁ In addition to working and sleeping, disaster orphans are given a proper time to teach the above-mentioned daily lessons. ㊆㊂ Each institute and each branch is paid 100 yuan as start-up expenses for repairing houses, providing pots, bowls, bedding, books, pens, ink, paper, etc. ㊉㊃ Each institute and each branch institute first pay 300 yuan in expenses. ㊉㊄ The above-mentioned expenses are raised locally as much as possible, and the insufficient amount is subsidized by the money raised from various provinces. Ten ㊅ If any disaster orphan is sick, please ask the local doctor to diagnose and treat it, and do your best to fulfill your obligations.

### Li Tiande Passes Through Shanghai

Li Tiande, an old member of the Kuomintang, is already 60 years old. He recently passed through Shanghai from Guangdong on the President Jackson liner to go to Beijing to pay respects to key figures in the party and the country. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he said, "Last year in Guangdong, I advocated protecting the central government, unifying the country, and resisting foreign aggression, which aroused Chen Jitang's jealousy and was accused of reaction and was arrested. I was almost put to death. Later, I was rescued by people at home and abroad. I have not been to Nanjing for more than ten years. I heard that the construction in recent years has been great, so I want to see the prosperity. My goal is to sightsee. I was engaged in the revolution and led the Iron Blood Corps of the Chinese Revolutionary Party. However, after years of poetry campaigns, many comrades have been martyred. From the second year of the Republic of China to the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, only those who reported and can be verified in various battles are more than 80 dead. The martyred martyrs have not been reported to the government for commendation before the unification of Ning and Guangdong. Now, taking advantage of the trip to Beijing, I also want to handle it to clear the procedures."

### The Public Offices of Tai, Jia, and Bao Counties Request the Construction of the Liuhe Yunzao Sluice Gate

Joint Survey of Location with the Shanghai Municipal Government to Benefit Agricultural Irrigation and Prevent Flooding

The public offices of the various districts of Tai, Jia, and Bao counties, in order to request the provincial government to jointly cooperate with the South Shanghai Municipal Government to plan and construct the Liuhe Qipu Yunzao Sluice Gate to benefit farmers and prevent flooding, yesterday specially jointly submitted a petition to the three county governments, stating: the petition is for requesting the swift construction of the sluice gate once its location is determined, and if the location is not yet determined, urgently requesting its establishment, humbly requesting transmission of the matter. The three counties of Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan are located on the coast of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The agricultural irrigation relies on drainage channels, which suffer daily from the rapid influx and slow outflow of turbid tides. Sediment easily accumulates and dredging cannot keep up. Fertile land is turning into wasteland. Recently, the Jiangsu Construction Department planned to construct sluice gates along the river. It shows the provincial department's concern for the people's suffering, for which we are deeply grateful. Investigation shows that the most important locations for setting up sluice gates below Baimao are Liuhe, Qipu, and Yunzao. We previously heard that the provincial department planned to continue construction of the Liuhe and Qipu sluice gates after the completion of the Baimao sluice gate project. The Baimao project has already been completed. Farmers in the three counties, having witnessed the conversion of poor harvests to abundant harvests in the Baimao farmland area after the sluice gate was built last autumn, are all eagerly hoping that the Liuhe and Qipu sluice gates will be swiftly constructed. The Liuhe sluice gate, in particular, as the river has been dredged not long ago, should be set up as soon as possible to avoid the need for dredging after the gate is set up. As for the Yunzao sluice gate, it not only runs through the center of Jiading and Baoshan counties, but also has a significant impact on farmland. If it is not planned and constructed, all the sediment will accumulate. If there is a day when the water level of Lake Taihu rises, the drainage of the counties surrounding the lake will be difficult and disasters will inevitably occur. Since it only concerns the territory of Jiangsu Province, and the location is in the Shanghai urban area, we also earnestly request that the matter be forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to consult with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission to swiftly determine the location, estimate the construction costs, and start construction to benefit agricultural land and prevent flooding. We humbly request approval for forwarding this petition, and are filled with utmost anticipation. We respectfully submit this petition.

### Ministry of Railways Approves Three-Year Improvement Plan for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway

Total Cost Requires 23.3 Million Yuan; Aiming to Complete Five Out of Six Projects Within Three Years

The Beijing-Shanghai Railway is the only transportation route between Nanjing, where the capital of our country is located, and Shanghai, a crucial international commercial port. At this time of rapid national construction and the increasing development of industry and commerce, the antiquated equipment from thirty years ago is no longer able to meet the demands. The two railway administrations, therefore, formulated a three-year equipment plan, which has been submitted to and approved by the Ministry of Railways. The required expenses reach over 20 million yuan. It is quite difficult to raise such a large sum of money at once, so it was decided to proceed gradually, prioritizing based on urgency. The outlines of the plan are extracted below:

Plan Outline

The two railway administration's plan to improve the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's equipment dates back to August of last year, and the general outline was finalized in the middle of this year and reported to the Ministry of Railways. It was approved in mid-May. The originally planned projects include the following ten items: (1) Replace with 100-pound rails; (2) Reinforce bridges; (3) Convert level crossings to grade-separated crossings; (4) Upgrade to new-style electric signals; (5) Improve and expand marshalling yards; (6) Improve various train stations; (7) Purchase new-style locomotives; (8) Add new-style steel-skinned passenger cars; (9) Add new-style railcars (i.e., steam locomotives); (10) Supplement freight cars. The Ministry of Railways believes that implementing such a large-scale plan in a short period of time is beyond the current financial capacity of the railway, so after review and instruction, it was revised to the following six items: (1) Improve dispatching equipment; (2) Install automatic block electric signals; (3) Supplement locomotives and rolling stock; (4) Complete the double track between Shanghai and Wuxian; (5) Add new-style railcars; (6) Reinforce the main line tracks and bridges.

Improvement Costs

The expenses required for the aforementioned plan are as follows: (1) Adding sidings and switches, and laying out yards, will require approximately 1.5 million yuan. (2) Installing automatic block electric signals will cost within 2.5 million yuan. (3) Supplementing locomotives and passenger cars, totaling 252 units, will require a total of 8.7 million yuan. (4) Laying double tracks between Nanxiang and Wuxian will require approximately 2.42 million yuan. (5) Adding steam railcars will require a total of 1 million yuan. (6) Replacing 43 kg steel rails and adding sleepers and ballast will require approximately 6.5 million yuan. Replacing bridges will require approximately 460,000 yuan. Reconstructing level crossings and warning signals will require approximately 300,000 yuan. The entire improvement plan will require a total of 23.3 million yuan.

Starting Implementation

The railway administration has already begun implementing the various projects, but plans to complete the first five items within three years. The last item will be considered and implemented after the former are realized. It has also been decided to complete the double-track traffic between Shanghai and Suzhou this year, to increase the number of train services and operate steam railcars. It has already borrowed 800,000 pounds from the China and British Corporation Bank, equivalent to over 13 million yuan, and has already placed orders for various materials. The railway colleagues' welfare fund management committee has also agreed to lend 2 million yuan for the purchase of vehicles. It is estimated that the 12 passenger locomotives, 10 freight locomotives, 30 passenger cars, and 200 40-ton freight cars that have been ordered will be delivered by the end of January next year. It is estimated that the completion of the three-year plan will require over 14 million yuan, and the funds already borrowed are sufficient for the application. Furthermore, the current annual operating revenue of the bureau is over 14 million yuan, and it is estimated that the operating revenue will increase by approximately 3.5% in the second year after the equipment is improved, approximately 10.4% in the second year, and approximately 27.6% in the following years.

### Preparations and Publicity for the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement

Pudong Native Association to Invite Leaders from All Sectors to Speak on the 13th

The Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association has scheduled a Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Anniversary Assembly to be held at the Pudong Native Association on Fuxu Road on the 13th of this month. Preparatory committee members have been appointed to be responsible for the preparations. In recent days, the preparatory committee members have been in contact regarding all publicity and the publication of special editions for the assembly. The details are summarized below:

Review of Documents

Solicitation of opinions on the issue of wrongful imprisonment compensation from committee members and all members is set to end on the 10th (i.e., yesterday). Several committee members, such as Jiang Yong, Ma Shouhua, Chen Zhigao, Cai Zhaohuang, Lu Dingkui, Li Wenwu, and Xu Zuoliang, have submitted documents to the association. However, few members have expressed their opinions. The association has decided to convene the editorial committee today (the 11th) to review the documents to be published in the special edition. After the decision is made, it is planned to deliver the task to the original committee members in contact with major newspapers, Zhai Yue, Wang Weizhen, Cai Zhaohuang, Zheng Jiankui, He Jia, and Sun Zuji, to print the special edition in various newspapers, and to ask the editors of various newspapers to issue publicity texts on the 13th to spread publicity.

Radio Broadcasting Speeches

Regarding the radio broadcasting issue, Committee Member Chen Zhifeng and Committee Member Wu Zhengque have been appointed to contact various radio stations. It is planned that each radio station will send one or two speaking committee members to various radio stations to broadcast the important significance of the wrongful imprisonment compensation issue. It has now been decided that in addition to asking the speaking committee members from the previous session to undertake the speeches, several members elected in this session will be re-elected and will go to various radio stations to take on the speaking duties at that time.

Showing Slides

When the assembly is held at 1:00 p.m. on the 13th of this month, in addition to sending invitations to the municipal party, government, military, legal, academic, agricultural, commercial, industrial, and women's organizations to participate, it is also planned to invite leaders from all sectors to come to the meeting to give speeches, and to open slides (regarding the issue of wrongful imprisonment compensation) at the venue during the meeting. The movie theaters have also been contacted separately to show the slides before the movies are shown in the various movie theaters on the 13th, so that people from all walks of life will know the importance of wrongful imprisonment compensation and spread the publicity.

### Sichuan Disaster Research Association Requests Abolition of Harsh Policies

Yesterday's Board of Directors Issued Three Important Telegrams: Implementing Epidemic Prevention and Prohibiting Hoarding

The Sichuan Disaster Relief Research Association, organized by Sichuan natives in Shanghai, held a standing board meeting at the association's office on Lafayette Road yesterday. More than ten people, including Lu Jizeng, Tan Yigong, Pan Dada, Li Fushi, Du Gangbai, Lei Renbai, and Wen Zhiyuan, attended. Tan Yigong presided over the meeting. The following important cases were passed:

Telegram to the Central Government

A telegram was submitted to various organs of the central government, saying: (abbreviated title) For the purpose of submitting a request for an order to abolish various harsh policies in Sichuan Province, Sichuan was originally a region of wealth. A year of abundant harvest is sufficient to feed the people for two years. However, after being subjected to heavy taxes and levies by the military and political authorities of the province, the people have no savings for even half a year. Taking the land tax as an example, the number of pre-collections exceeds even one hundred years after the founding of the Republic of China. The people have long been drained of their flesh and bones, and their blood and tears have dried up. Even without natural disasters, it has already become a great calamity. Since last autumn, the entire province has been suffering from drought. The granaries have been empty for a long time, and famine is imminent. The disaster area covers as many as 141 counties, and the number of victims exceeds 35 million. Grass roots and tree bark have been dug up and exhausted. Some compete for white mud, while others cook and eat dead corpses. People are dying in piles, thousands every day. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. However, the authorities in Sichuan, in addition to continuing to increase the land tax and collect harsh taxes, have also been forcibly allocating opium taxes on a monthly basis in each county, and forcibly collecting taxes such as contract verification taxes. The opium tax, in particular, has already been a harsh disturbance. Each county must share a certain number of thousands of taels per month, at 2.65 yuan per tael, with layers of demand and pressure, implicated and linked, exceeding the regular amount, and is more than double the amount. The strangest thing is that even those who do not smoke must pay the tax. Even disaster areas are still subject to forced allocations, forcing starving people on the verge of death to pay taxes to quench their thirst. If there is any humanity, how can they bear to do this? As for the four collections of land tax in one year, it is even more contrary to the central government's laws. All belong to the nation, and Sichuan is not an uncivilized area. All provinces collect once a year, so why is Sichuan made to pay four times a year? At a time when famine is happening, it is already too late to reduce or exempt land taxes, let alone increase taxes to burden them and harsh policies to abuse them. How can the people of Sichuan survive? We earnestly hope that the central authorities, based on their original intention of caring for the people of Sichuan, will resolutely order the Sichuan Provincial Government to immediately abolish the three major harsh policies of contract verification, forced allocation of opium taxes, and four collections of land tax in one year in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. If the Sichuan Provincial Government uses the excuse of financial difficulties and the inability to promote general administration, the members of the association believe that the abolition of contract verification, the suspension of opium tax allocation, and the collection of land tax once a year in Sichuan Province, as well as the income from other statutory regular supplies, are sufficient for use. The troops prepared by Sichuan Province have already been the best in the country, and according to rumors, there are no less than sixty additional regiments. Every year, 80% to 90% of the province's income is used for military expenses, and only 10% to 20% is used for education and construction. If troops can be effectively reduced and the expenses used for the huge military expenses can be used for education and construction, would it not be more than sufficient? Other measures, such as streamlining redundant organs, stopping redundant administrative expenses, and striving to save income and expenditure from the province, should not be difficult to offset. All members of the association are from Sichuan, and because they are concerned about the safety of their hometown, which is of great importance to the overall national situation, at this time of severe disaster, if we do not find ways to provide relief as soon as possible, so that the more than 30 million victims can have a chance to recover, the disaster of the roving bandits and the Ji Ji Sect in the late Ming Dynasty will be repeated in our Sichuan. What we call dangerous, we dare not fail to express. We appeal to the above, hoping to be adopted. We are full of urgency and await orders. Tan Yigong, Lu Jizeng, Pan Dada, Du Gangbai, and Li Fushi, standing directors of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Research Association, kowtow.

Telegram to the Executive Yuan

Another telegram was submitted to the Executive Yuan, saying: For the purpose of requesting an order to the Ministry of Health to send medical personnel to Sichuan as soon as possible to implement epidemic prevention, Sichuan has suffered from natural disasters on top of harsh policies. We have repeatedly received your court's multiple plans and efforts to rescue us, and we are all deeply grateful. However, the victims throughout the province often compete for food such as tree bark, grass roots, white mud, and dead bodies. They originally wanted to prolong their lives, but in the end they died because of eating their fill. Rotten corpses are piled up, and it is difficult to bury them all. Recently, the hot summer is approaching, and toxic gases are fumigating, leading to the proliferation of epidemics in various places. For the sake of the people of Sichuan, if there is no way to prevent it, how can there be any hope of survival? We humbly beg Your Court to quickly order the Ministry of Health to send medical personnel to Sichuan as soon as possible to implement epidemic prevention work, so that the survivors of the disaster will not die from the epidemic again. The whole of Sichuan will be grateful beyond measure. We specially telegraph this to Your Court, and we are full of anticipation.

Telegram to the Sichuan Provincial Government

Another telegram was sent to the Sichuan Provincial Government, saying: The disaster in our Sichuan is severe, and it is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. All members of our association are from Sichuan, and we are concerned about our hometown and are burning with anxiety. At this time of wailing and hunger everywhere, our government authorities, compatriots at home and abroad, and foreign nationals are all able to act with the will to feed the hungry and drowning, and are working together to rescue us, but we are still worried that it is not enough. We have heard that in Chengdu and Chongqing, there are classes who hoard rice and grain in large quantities, manipulate market prices, and treat the misery as if they do not see it, putting the victims in a desperate situation. There is no one more unscrupulous than this. We respectfully request that you immediately order the local government offices to cooperate with various legal groups to strictly prohibit hoarding of grain and speculation, and to order the sale of grain at flat prices to help the disaster victims and alleviate the people's difficulties. We are full of anticipation.

### Ambassador Xu to Visit Chiang in Lushan Soon

Mr. Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance, accompanied Mr. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission and Chairman of the Bank of China, from Xun to Shanghai at noon on the 9th on Chairman Chiang's Junkers plane. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, he went to the Central Bank to handle important financial and monetary matters. Because there were still important matters to declare, he had to ask Chairman Chiang for instructions, so he still flew to Xun on the original plane at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to visit Lushan. It is said that Mr. Xu will stay in Lushan for at most one or two days before returning to Shanghai.

### Liu Duoquan's Arm Injury Gradually Recovering

Mr. Liu Duoquan, commander of the 49th Army, came to Shanghai for medical treatment this time. The gunshot wound has long healed, but the arm bone injury has not yet fully recovered. Since moving to the private residence of Yang Hu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, Liu has continued to seek medical treatment. According to Commander Yang's statement to the Central News Agency reporter yesterday, Liu's arm injury is gradually recovering and is currently undergoing electrotherapy. It should be fully recovered in about a week.

### French Aviator Doumergue to Pass Through Shanghai Today

Returning Home on the Original Ship

French aviators Dourand and Micheletti made a 100-hour record flight between Paris and Tokyo last month. Unfortunately, they encountered danger in Kochi Prefecture, Japan, where the journey was about to end. The plane crashed and people were injured, resulting in the failure of their effort. After the two men were injured, they stayed in Japan for medical treatment and have now recovered. They departed from Kobe, Japan, on the French mail ship Rosie on the 8th of this month to return to France, and will pass through Shanghai at 5:00 p.m. today. The ship will be berthed at the No. 1023 pontoon in the Huangpu River. At that time, French Consul General Baodansi and others will go to the ship to welcome them.

### Charitable Organizations' Disaster Relief Association Held Sixth Standing Meeting Yesterday

Resolved on Many Important Cases

The Disaster Relief Association of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation held its sixth standing meeting at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.

Zhu then reported on his investigation and relief process, which greatly moved the audience. The discussion then began: (1) Vice Chairman Zhu sent a letter with thirty-three photos and twelve forms of the Gansu disaster, saying that the disaster was extremely severe and requested a large sum of money to save the survivors. How should relief be provided? (2) Zhangye, Wuwei, Yongchang, Gaoming, Shandan, Linze, Minle, Yongcha, and other counties in Gansu reported the situation of bandit disasters and requested relief funds for relief. How should it be handled? It was resolved that the association would handle it in a unified manner. (3) The Zheng and Deputy Directors of Henan Chafang sent letters reporting the tragic situation in various counties in western Henan, begging for a large sum of money to continue to be raised for rescue. How should it be handled? It was resolved that Chairman Zhu, Director Lu, and Director Miao would call Minister Kong to allocate 200,000 yuan for relief. (4) The association will provide unified relief regardless of provincial boundaries. Sichuan and Guizhou have already formed separate relief branches.

Finally, He DeKui of the Public Concession Chinese Association requested that the association allocate funds to support the Boy Scout Corps in accordance with the Boy Scout Flood Relief Association's precedent, and it was resolved to pass. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 p.m.

Sales are Very Strong, and Flour Prices are High

Since the abundant harvest last year, the rural economy has greatly improved. The wheat harvest this summer is even better than in previous years, especially in Jiangsu Province. The sales have been very strong recently, so even though it is the time when new wheat is on the market, market prices have not fallen. Therefore, farmers in general are cheering and rejoicing. Flour manufacturers in Shanghai are also seeing strong sales and high flour prices, and they are currently processing and rushing to produce new goods that are coming onto the market.

### Joint Meeting of Various Native Place Associations Yesterday

Exemption of Native Place Association Funds from Income Tax; Requesting the Municipal Government to Exempt Property Tax

Various native place associations in the city held a joint meeting at the Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association on Ayerjin Road at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the issue of income tax. The attendees included Dong Xinqin of the Ningbo Native Place Association, Chen Qifang of the Guangdong Native Place Association, Yu Yaoqiu of the Baoshan Native Place Association, Chen Peide of the Zhenjiang Native Place Association, Hu Shouqi of the Changzhou Native Place Association, Jiang Wenxiang of the Pudong Native Place Association, Shen Tianxin of the Hu Society, Zeng Guanghuai of the Hubei Native Place Association, Wang Jingdong of the Xianju Native Place Association, Chen Jiufeng of the Shangyu Native Place Association, Li Aokui of the Zhuji Native Place Association, Song Shixiang of the Yangshu Native Place Association, Chen Zhonggao of the Fenghua Native Place Association, Wu Qishou of the Ninghai Native Place Association, Yang Shaozhi of the Taizhou Native Place Association, Shi Boyan of the Dongtai Native Place Association, Hu Zifang of the Shaoxing Native Place Association, Wei Zixiang of the Yuyao Native Place Association, and other organizations, more than thirty in total. He Wuliang, chairman of the Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association, reported that Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax stipulates that the following types of income are exempt from income tax: Clause 1, "Income of legal persons that do not aim to make a profit;" Clause 3, Yinzi "Funds and deposits of charitable organizations or groups." Currently, the Shanghai office still needs to collect income tax, so the discussion on measures should be held. During the start of the discussion, Secretary Huang of the Income Tax Office was sent to explain, briefly saying that the income tax of native place associations cannot be exempted based on the fact that they are not for profit, but the regulations for charitable organizations to be exempt from income tax require that the deposit of funds must be a fixed deposit and must have a permanent nature, with the interest used without moving the principal. However, those with a specific purpose and approved by the competent authority to use the principal and current deposits are not subject to this restriction. After discussion, (1) it was resolved that the various native place associations should jointly send a letter to the Income Tax Office requesting that the fixed-term fund deposits of the native place associations be changed to current deposits to exempt them from income tax. (2) It was resolved that the real estate industry of the various native place associations should be exempted from donations and taxes, and a joint submission should be made to the municipal government for clear exemption, and the five native place associations of Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Zhuji, Shangyu, and Shaoxing Seven Counties were elected to draft the submission. (3) It was resolved to organize the Shanghai Native Place Association Group Federation: 1. The attending representatives are the initiators; 2. Those who wish to join should register with the Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association; 3. The various native place association dinners should be held regularly. The meeting was adjourned after discussion at 4:30 p.m.

### Improved Family Exhibition to Host Press Today

The Improved Family and Chinese Industrial Exhibition, because the exhibits displayed are mostly foreign goods, has not seen enthusiastic visits from Chinese people. 10,000 free admission tickets have been issued specifically to facilitate the use of Chinese people, and 600 admission badges have been added to be given to the press and manufacturers, so they can freely enter and exit. In order to facilitate contact from all sectors, the Chinese organizer has designated the Zhen Dan Fire Extinguisher Factory, Yantai Beer Company, and Yuanlai Paint Company as senior Chinese staff to assist the venue manager. Since the opening of the exhibition two weeks ago, there has been some distance from all sectors, so it has been decided to hold a banquet today at 7:00 p.m. to host the press, where Qian Chengxu will report on the process of cooperation.

### Fujian Native Place Association Cables for Swift Collection of Provincial Subsidiary Currency Notes

Letters Sent to Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank to Discuss Methods for Exchanging Subsidiary Currency Notes

The Fujian Native Place Association in Shanghai held an emergency standing committee and supervisor joint meeting yesterday. It was agreed that Chairman Chiang and the central government's competent ministries and courts have separately approved and handled the issue of the Fujian Provincial Bank's indiscriminate issuance of subsidiary currency notes. Recently, it was reported that the Fujian authorities are intensifying the three policies of promoting the provincial subsidiary currency notes without redemption. It has been decided to send another telegram to the central government, urgently requesting an order to be issued as soon as possible to collect the notes within a time limit, and to send letters to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to discuss methods for exchanging subsidiary currency notes.

### Lake Society Telegram Reply Regarding Zhejiang Provincial Government's Xin Yong'an Resumption of Sailing

The Lake Society of this city received a telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government stating that Wen Jingchu, manager of the Yong'an Steamship Bureau, reported that the Yong'an Steamship Bureau was organized with capital from merchants and others, and the Xin Yong'an steamer belongs to the commercial bureau. The Yongxin steamer, which caused the accident, belongs to the Yongshun Company. The organizational entities of the ship bureaus are absolutely different. It should not be mistaken that the Xin Yong'an, owned by the commercial bureau, also belongs to the Yongshun Company, and therefore ordered to suspend sailing together, suffering unexpected losses innocently. For this reason, a factual report was submitted requesting approval for the Xin Yong'an steamer of the commercial bureau to resume sailing as usual to facilitate transportation and other matters. Whether this is true or not should be quickly investigated and replied. After receiving the telegram, the society investigated and found that the Yong'an Steamship Bureau had already ceased operations, and its Xin Yong'an steamer was merged into the Yongshun Bureau for sailing. It was published in the Shen Xin dual newspapers on March 15th of the 25th year, declaring shipping cooperation and should be jointly responsible. Before the Yongxin case is resolved, it is definitely impossible to resume sailing alone. A newspaper clipping is attached to the telegram for inspection and handling.

### Zhu Qinglan's Report on the Investigation of Disaster Relief in Sichuan and Gansu (Continued)

On the 21st of the month, they traveled from Yongdeng to Xining, also accompanied by Secretary Rao and Du Yannian, who concurrently served as Qinghai Relief Funds Supervisor. The rivers in the vicinity of Qinghai, and the counties east of the Xining provincial capital, such as Ledu, Minhe, Huzhu, Hualong, Xunhua, etc., are very smooth, and the plains are sufficient for irrigation. However, the plateau initially felt very dry, but recently it has rained, and agriculture and forestry are still safe. However, the counties north of Dieyuan, Huangyuan, and the counties west and south of Gonghe, Dulan, Guide, Tongren, Tongde, Nangqian, Yushu, etc., are remote and distant from the provincial capital, often more than twenty stations away. The Mongolian and Tibetan people living in each county total more than ninety banners and tribes, all of whom live by nomadic grazing. Last year, livestock were affected by epidemics, and nine out of ten died. It is impossible to breed them temporarily. It is estimated that the number of sheep per household that have died from the epidemic in their entirety or that only have ten or twenty left is extremely poor, totaling more than 80,100 households. The Han Chinese people in the counties near the provincial capital suffered from hail disasters in the early stages of farming, and later suffered damage due to military affairs. It is difficult to restore their vitality, and relief is urgently needed. More than 200,000 border residents of all ethnic groups in the province are waiting for relief. They have rarely received central government assistance in the past, and their desire for assistance is extremely strong. The central government has allocated 100,000 yuan in relief funds, which is distributed to the disaster victims, but the amount received by each person is too small, and it is difficult to cover the round-trip food expenses for those who travel long distances to receive relief. It is appropriate to telegraph a request for additional relief funds to show benevolence. At the same time, Director Du will discuss with the provincial government to select investigators to set off in different directions to check households and issue tickets, and supervise the release of funds in accordance with regulations. This is the general outline of Qinghai disaster relief. On May 26th, he traveled from Lanzhou to Ningxia to meet Sun Xianqing, the Relief Funds Supervisor, and Ma Hongda, the Provincial Chairman, and inquired about the bandit disasters in Yuwang and Yanchi counties, the hail disasters in Ningxia, Ningshuo, and Jinji counties, the water and hail disasters in Lingwu County, and the drought disasters in Pingluo County. The central government's first allocation of 10,000 yuan has already been used to provide emergency relief to Yiwang and Yanchi counties. The second allocation of 50,000 yuan will be used to set up porridge factories and shelters in the five counties of Ningning, Jin, Ping and Ling, and to establish temporary educational institutions in the three counties of Ningshuo, Jinji and Pingluo to provide disaster victims with food and clothing, and teach them crafts such as weaving, clothing, spinning, and woolen yarn. The relief efforts have generally been put in place. However, in the Ningxia Yellow River basin, the land is flat between the north and south for thousands of miles, and the rivers are interconnected. Since the Han and Tang dynasties until the Qing dynasty, the remaining ditches crisscross and are extremely convenient for irrigation. Spring planting and autumn harvesting celebrate a prosperous year. However, due to repeated wars between the Hui and Han people, and the battle of Sun Dianying's troops, more than half of the people died, and nineteen out of ten fields are barren. Immigration and reclamation are extremely important. According to Chairman Ma, he hopes that immigrants from neighboring provinces will come to reclaim the land. He has ordered engineers to build three new villages in advance, and store 300,000 yuan. It is estimated that each household will be granted 50 acres of barren land, a house, and a loan of 300 yuan for living and equipment expenses. After three to five years, the tax will be increased gradually and the principal will be repaid in installments. Qinglan intends to discuss and plan with officials and gentry in the interior and charitable organizations to resettle refugees, reclaim barren land, and provide disaster relief. This is another general outline of disaster relief and land reclamation investigation in Ningxia. On May 27th, he arrived in Xi'an to meet Chairman Sun and the members of the Provincial Relief Association, and rushed to Fufeng County in western Shaanxi to inspect the disaster relief nursery and rural soybean and fruit trees set up in Shaanxi during the disaster relief efforts in the 19th and 20th years, as well as the workshops of the Xi'an Disaster Relief Nursery. Along the way, he inspected the wheat seedlings in the counties belonging to the old Guanzhong Road. Due to different amounts of rainfall, the amount of harvest also varied. Most of them were poor harvests. He inquired and learned that there were also many places with poor harvests in southern Shaanxi. Northern Shaanxi has been robbed by bandits for a long time. In addition to the fact that the central government has allocated funds last year and sent He Changwei Shaonan of this association to supervise the implementation of relief, there are still Bao'an, Anzhai, Dingbian, and Anbian counties, which were stationed by the Communist Party at that time, and have not been able to distribute relief. Now the central government has allocated 100,000 yuan to Shaanxi Province. The provincial government should be instructed to raise an equal amount of funds to be handed over to the Provincial Relief Association for proper overall distribution. Commissioner He is currently serving concurrently as the Administrative Commissioner of the Second District, and is also handling the equalization of prices and urging the Farmers Bank to provide loans for relief. This is also the current situation of Shaanxi's relief efforts.

On May 31st, he arrived in Luoyang from Tongguan, and found that in the counties along the way in western Henan, the fields were dry and the wheat was withered, and nineteen out of ten were unharvested. He also met Tang Zongguo, the Henan Relief Funds Supervisor, Yang Mingsheng, the Special Commissioner of this association who purchased relief grain, Li Huanying, a member of this association, Guo Fangwu, the chairman of the Western Henan Disaster Relief Association, Feng Junyangshan, who distributed voluntary relief in Dengfeng on behalf of the Shanghai Jisheng Society, and Li Shaoduo, the deputy director of the Shanghai Charity Federation's investigation and distribution. They all said that in more than 20 counties in western Henan, there was no harvest in the spring due to drought. Although there have been rains recently, sowing must wait until after March to hope for a harvest in the autumn. During these hundred or so days, it is the time when the old and new crops are not yet available. Without food, it is impossible to release emergency relief. Those who have received relief before still find it difficult to survive. The next day, he went to Bian Province to meet with Chairman Shang and the members of the Provincial Relief Association, as well as representatives from 20 counties in western Henan. What they said was the same. The Provincial Reserve Conference has planned to raise 200,000 yuan and requested the central government to quickly allocate funds for relief at the same time. It is appropriate to truthfully report this and request a quick allocation to help with the emergency. At the same time, representatives from the counties in Hedong, Shanxi Province, and gentry in Beijing and Shanghai also telegraphed their requests, because the counties in southern Shanxi and Hedong and the counties of Lingbao and Shixiang in western Henan and Shaanxi are only separated by the Yellow River. The south of the river is dry, and the north of the river is also the same. It is impossible not to provide simultaneous and equal relief. This is a real situation that requires both relief for western Henan and relief for southern Shanxi and Hedong. (End)

### Suspicious Travelers Detained at Shanghai North Station This Morning

A total of six people were arrested, all of whom purchased through tickets to Xi'an

At about 11:40 pm yesterday, when the supervisor of the police sub-bureau stationed at the Shanghai North Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway went to the North Station for inspection, he caught sight of a middle-aged man in the third-class waiting room of the station, wearing glasses and a suit, sitting alone in the waiting room with a small handbag beside him. However, his expression was flustered and not without suspicion. The supervisor and others went to inquire, and he claimed to be Zhang Huisheng, from Guangxi, 28 years old, and planned to take the Shanghai-Ping Through Train at zero o'clock this morning from Shanghai to Xi'an. However, observing his language, it seemed close to the north. When asked what his business was, his words were evasive and did not match what he was asked. The supervisor and others became suspicious, and immediately checked his ticket, which was indeed a third-class through ticket from Shanghai North Station to Xi'an. Then, after searching his handbag, they found a letter inside, in which the words were all to instruct him to go to Xi'an to plot changes. The truth began to dawn. Then, a diary was copied from his side, in which many of the contents were codes. At the same time, there was also a luggage ticket, so he immediately notified the stationmaster to detain and retrieve the luggage, which was a rattan box and bedding. There was a lot of food in the rattan box. At that time, the supervisor and others immediately reported to the chief of the North Station sub-bureau, and Liang Fuchu, the chief of the sub-bureau, personally went to the station to interrogate him. Then, according to the man's confession, there were five other companions traveling with him, all in the third-class waiting room. Therefore, Chief Liang immediately ordered the police to take him to the waiting room to identify them and arrest them separately. As of this morning when the reporter was filing the report, they were still being interrogated separately. All the tickets have also been requested from the railway bureau to refund the fare.

### Passenger Jumps into River from Xinpu Steamer

Wearing military uniform. Details have not yet been verified

The Xinpu steamer of the Sanbei Steamship Company, with a total tonnage of 2,039 tons, is currently running on the Yangtze River route. On Monday night of this week, at 2:00 am, it loaded cargo in Shanghai to go to Wuhan. There were also many passengers boarding the steamer upstream from Shanghai, especially in the third-class and general cabins. At 8:35 pm on the 8th, when the ship reached the Baoshouwei area on the river above Wuhu, it was getting dark. Most of the passengers in the ship were asleep, when suddenly a passenger in the third-class cabin, taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the crowd, went up to the deck. At that time, the crew members were also busy with their own affairs in the room. The passenger crossed the railing and jumped into the river, committing suicide. When people on the ship heard the sound of someone falling into the water, they rushed out to inspect and saw water splashes and swirls in the river in the darkness. They knew that someone had jumped into the river and immediately reported to the shipowner, who immediately stopped the ship and released a sampan, sending crew members to rescue the person quickly. However, the water flow was very turbulent, and after a long time of searching, the body was gone. The Xinpu steamer then continued to sail as usual, and the crew members went to the cabin to investigate, and learned that the person who jumped into the river was wearing a military uniform and had left a suicide note. His name, address, occupation, age, and reasons for suicide were all detailed in the letter. Yesterday, the shipowner of the Xinpu steamer sent a telegram to Shanghai to report. The telegram was very simple. The details must be clarified when the captain's letter arrives in Shanghai. The company has telegraphed the shipowner to quickly report the details to Shanghai so that the lost items can be notified to his family for collection.

### Widow Killed by Knife and Body Hanging High on Beam

Officials came to examine the body and handed it over to the family for burial. The surrogate husband was detained for interrogation to clarify the matter for further review.

The case of a local widow, Shen Zhang, being suddenly stabbed to death in house number 114, Xicun, Zhoujiadu, Pudong, at 8:00 am the day before yesterday, has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now found that the circumstances of the case are quite bizarre. The late former husband of Zhang was named Shen Zhouxing, who used to make a living by rowing a ferry. He died of illness a year ago. Her uncle, Zhang Shaoxiang, recently saw that his niece was only 24 years old and had no surviving children. Remaining a widow was not the best policy. Therefore, he came forward and asked a matchmaker to introduce Cheng Liezhong from Tongzhou (26 years old) to be a surrogate husband. Cheng changed his surname to Shen and has been living with her ever since, for only fifteen days. Cheng used to work in the Huafeng Enamel Factory in the town. At 7:00 am yesterday, Cheng had finished breakfast and escaped from the factory to work. Not long after, the tragedy suddenly occurred in the house. Zhang's head was injured by a knife in three or four places, from the forehead to the center of the top of her head. The wounds were three or four inches long, and the force of the cut was fierce, causing the skull to shatter, the brain to flow out, and a lot of hair to be cut off. The body was also hanging high on the beam. There was also a bloody kitchen knife on the ground, and an overturned bench, with blood flowing all over the ground. However, because the door was tightly closed, it was difficult to believe that she had been stabbed to death. Therefore, it is assumed that the cause of death must have been self-inflicted with a knife and self-strangulation with a rope at the same time. Otherwise, it would be impossible. Later, a neighbor's young girl saw the tragedy through a crack in the board and screamed in horror. Cheng's mother, Song, rushed to the factory and called Cheng back, opened the door, and together with the deceased's aunt, Xue, lowered the body. At the same time, she reported to the local police station, which reported to the Tangqiao police station. After sending officers to the scene for investigation, yesterday, she summoned the local bail to report to the local court. After officials came to examine the body at 3:00 pm, they ordered the family to collect the body. The surrogate husband, Cheng Liezhong, was detained for interrogation by the police station, and the case will be reviewed after the circumstances are clarified.

### Iron Gate Falls and Kills Boy

At about 3:00 pm yesterday, at the entrance of Yude Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei, Xu Jinsheng, a blacksmith from Changzhou who lived at No. 27 Jixing, had a 15-year-old son named Fugeng, who was playing there. An iron gate (about five or six feet long and weighing about one thousand catties), made of cement and wrapped in iron sheet, was placed next to the wall of the lane entrance. Suddenly, it fell and broke the boy's left foot bone, and blood flowed from the seven orifices of his head, killing him instantly. He fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Later, Tao Yunting, a police officer from post No. 13, who was informed, arrived and arrested the gatekeeper of the lane. According to the report to the Xinzha Police Sub-bureau, the gatekeeper's name is Fang Ayou, 52 years old, from Zhenhai. The local bail, Shen Xiaowu, was instructed to report to the Shanghai Local Court today for inspection. It is also learned that the parents of the dead boy went out for business and have not returned today (yesterday). The body is currently being guarded by the bail.

### Masseuse Sues for Abandonment

Demands more than 20,000 yuan in living expenses. Fu Zhengcai did not arrive, and the hearing was rescheduled.

Fu Zhengcai, the owner of the Caojiadu Bathhouse, previously had a secret affair with Dong Miaoying, a masseuse from No. 1, Huaxing Massage Parlor, Yunnan Road, Guizhou Road. It was a heaven-made match. Miaoying left her ex-husband and married Fu with her eight-year-old son, Amao, also known as Guisheng. Unexpectedly, the beautiful scene did not last long. Recently, the love broke down. Dong Miaoying hired lawyer Yao Yunbo to sue Fu Zhengcai in the local court for abandonment. The petition stated that in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the defendant coveted the plaintiff's beauty, flattered her in every possible way, falsely claimed to be unmarried, and vowed to love her. He also boasted of being rich and promised to fly together one day, with endless joy. She was temporarily deceived and agreed to his proposal. The defendant once held a banquet to publicly marry her to show that he was not deceiving her. They lived at No. 19, Xiaocaichang, Kade Road, for two months, and then moved to No. 6, Yongping Lane, Maigen Road. Their relationship was extremely loving, and he paid her 30 to 40 yuan per month. On December 19th of that year, she gave birth to a son named Xiaobao. They lived in harmony for several years. However, once a month, he would occasionally stay out all night. When asked, he would always evade the question. Thinking that men must have social engagements, she never investigated deeply. Unexpectedly, since last year, he stayed out more and more often, and gradually neglected daily life. He owed a huge amount of rent, reaching 191 yuan. On December 25th of last year, his father died in his hometown, and obituaries were sent everywhere. Only then did she know that he had another residence, wife, and children. When asked, he claimed that he would divorce soon. Months passed, and she repeatedly urged him to fulfill his promise. At first, he still made vague promises, but then he became strangers, and from then on, he would not come for several days. On the 26th day of the first lunar month of this year, the plaintiff gave birth to another daughter. She had to pawn everything during childbirth, and her life was in danger. Her livelihood was cut off from then on. The defendant committed the crimes of fraudulent marriage and abandonment under Articles 229 and 293 of the Criminal Law, and requested that he be ordered to pay 22,960 yuan in living expenses. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing opened the court. The defendant did not arrive, and a retained lawyer arrived on his behalf and requested an extension. The court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled.

### Shen Junru and Others' Case to Be Heard in Suzhou Today

### Hongqiao in Western Shanghai is Flourishing

The Hongqiao area in western Shanghai is relatively far away and has always been desolate. Since the operation of public buses, transportation has become convenient and the market is flourishing. Recently, people have been building houses and factories in the area one after another. For example, the Shengsheng Art Company on Hongqiao Road has recently been completed, and a paper mill is being built opposite the Hongqiao Road bus station. The foundation is currently being laid, and construction has begun. It is expected to be completed around autumn. It is heard that a wealthy businessman plans to organize a large-scale printing house and has entrusted Yang Xincai, a local gentry, to find a base of 50 to 60 mu to build a factory building. After Mr. Yang contacted several times, he invited the factory to accompany him to view the location on the day of the lunar New Year's Eve. Once agreed, the plan can be carried out.

### Buddhist Dharma Treasure Library Recruits Staff to Raise Funds

And solicit exhibits

Ye Yufu and other famous Buddhist figures in this city previously initiated the construction of the Dharma Treasure Library in the Buddhist Pure Land Society of Jueyuan, as a special institution for the collection and exhibition of Buddhist scriptures and Dharma objects. The library has been completed, but the internal construction and maintenance costs are huge.

### Li Guojie Embezzlement Case Court Takes Possession of Stock Pledge with Questionable Rights

Siming Bank Sues, Requests Objection to Execution

Li Guojie, the former general manager of the State-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was found to have mortgaged his 50,000 yuan in stocks to Siming Bank in the incidental civil suit of the embezzlement case. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company then asked the court to take possession of the stocks ex officio. Jin Shangsui, the legal representative of Siming Bank, filed a lawsuit against Li Guojie and Cai Zengji, the legal representative of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting payment of overdue debts and confirming the pledge rights, objecting to the execution, and seeking to remove obstacles. The petition stated that the defendant Li Guojie mortgaged the Changhua Iron Mine Company's No. 41 to 45 stocks with a face value of 50,000 yuan and a Faberge inlaid treasure British horse watch to the petitioner on November 25th of the 21st year of the Republic of China for a loan of 30,000 yuan, with an agreed monthly interest of 1%, for a period of six months. Later, when it expired, it was extended again and again due to his inability to repay. There is a mortgage certificate signed by Li himself, as well as a voucher. Unexpectedly, Li Guojie was found to have embezzled public funds and was sentenced by the Supreme Court to a final judgment and execution began. The State-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company checked and found that he had opened a ticket and requested the court to order him to pay. The petitioner believed that he had legally obtained the pledge rights to the stocks and filed an appeal to the Jiangsu High Court. According to Article 962 of the Civil Law, a possessor may request the removal of any obstruction to his possession, and a third party who has a pledge right over the object of execution may exclude the compulsory execution by means of a lawsuit of objection. Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Execution also stipulates clearly. Therefore, he especially requests the court to order ㊀ the defendant Li Guojie to repay 30,000 yuan, and the monthly interest of 1% from November 25th of the 24th year of the Republic of China until the end of the execution; ㊁ to confirm that the petitioner has the pledge rights to the Changhua Iron Mine Company's No. 41 to 45 stocks of 50,000 yuan and the Faberge inlaid treasure British horse watch; ㊂ the defendant State-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shall not forcibly execute the Changhua Iron Mine Company's No. 41 to 45 stocks; ㊃ to order the defendants to bear the litigation costs, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian Guocheng opened the court. The plaintiff's lawyers, Zhu Ren and Shi Naixiu, stated the process. The lawyer Jiang Hechun, the agent of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requested to uphold the research pledge rights and dismiss the original lawsuit. However, Li Guojie was neither present nor had an agent. Therefore, the court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for summons.

### Social Affairs Bureau Orders All Schools to Read Xi'an Half-Month Record

Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, believes that the Xi'an Half-Month Record written by Chairman Chiang has detailed content and brilliant writing. It is not only the most valuable direct historical material in modern history, but also the best reading material for the spiritual education of young people across the country. He has separately sent letters to the teachers and students of large, medium, and small schools in this city, asking them to purchase, study, and research in detail, and especially pay attention to the students' aspect as a summer supplementary reading material to improve their studies and conduct for assessment. Yesterday (the 10th), Chen Jicheng, the principal of the private Shanghai Middle School, Wang Peisun, the principal of Nanyang Middle School, Gu Yinming, the director of academic affairs, and Ji Yisheng, the principal of Aiguo Girls' Middle School, all issued notices in their schools, ordering students to purchase one copy each as summer supplementary reading material for Chinese. The four supplementary schools run by the China Vocational Education Society have a total of more than 3,000 students. Jiang Wenyu, the principal of the school, and Yao Huiquan, the director, have decided to adopt the Xi'an Half-Month Record as a Chinese textbook. What is particularly noteworthy is that Shen Tongyi, the principal of the Nanyang Model Middle School, said that there are very few fine books on spiritual education in the market. The Xi'an Half-Month Record is most suitable as a souvenir for young people. He has now purchased hundreds of books and distributed them to his high school and junior high school graduates. Principal Ji of Aiguo and Principal Chen of Shanghai Normal School also said that observing female students, due to their similar nature, especially like to flip through Madam Chiang's Xi'an Special Change Memoirs first, admire female heroes, and are especially interested.

### Young Woman Chen Amei Escapes Danger at Hotel

Lured by Sweet Talk, Fortunately Cried for Help

Zhao Amei, a young woman from Suzhou (18 years old), recently came to Shanghai from her hometown and worked as a maid at the Zhongxing Hotel on Hankou Road. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, around 2:00 PM, the woman encountered Yang Shenshi (23 years old), a maid from the Songjiang Hotel across the alley. Yang Shenshi asked Zhao Amei about her work at the Zhongxing Hotel, how much her salary was, and she replied two yuan, with small tips totaling three or four yuan at most. Seeing that the woman was young and easily deceived, Yang Shenshi falsely claimed that she could introduce Zhao to a place to work with a salary of more than ten yuan. Zhao was swayed by her sweet talk, and Yang Shenshi immediately took her to Hongkou to contact the introducer. While passing near the Hanbury Road Bridge, two men suddenly arrived, talked to Yang Shenshi, scrutinized Zhao Amei, and joined them. Yang Shenshi pointed out that the two men were surnamed Wang and Li. Zhao, unaware of the sinister plot, was tricked into going to the Hongkou Grand Travel Hotel on Xi'an Road, in room number twenty. The two men, Wang and Li, sat for a short time and then left. In the evening, Yang Shenshi took Zhao Amei to a restaurant next to the hotel to eat, spending ninety-five copper coins. After the meal, they returned to room number twenty. Around ten o'clock, Yang Shenshi slept with Zhao Amei in the same bed, saying that she would find a good job the next day, leaving the woman in a daze. Zhao Amei slept soundly until about one o'clock when she suddenly felt someone stripping her clothes off. Greatly alarmed, she opened her eyes and saw that it was not Yang Shenshi but one of the young men she had met on the way. Knowing that he intended to commit indecent acts, she jumped up and tried to run out of the room, but he blocked her. The woman cried out for help, and the tea servers heard the noise and entered the room to rescue her. She hired a rickshaw to return to the Zhongxing Hotel, and the man took the opportunity to escape. Zhao Amei told her fellow maid Wang Zhou about the situation. Unexpectedly, the next afternoon at half past seven, Yang Shenshi went to the Zhongxing Hotel to ask if Zhao Amei had returned. She was immediately seized and handed over to the Chinese constables, taken to the Lao Zha Station, and then transferred to the Hongkou Station. Yesterday morning, the case was brought before the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, described the case and filed charges of obstructing marriage and indecency according to Articles 240 and 3 of the Criminal Law, followed by charges of abduction. When the evidence was presented, Yang Shenshi's testimony was evasive. At that time, two young men, one wearing a blue coarse cloth short shirt and pants and the other wearing a silk shirt and pants, were seen in the courtroom. The detectives asked the woman to identify if they were Wang and Li, but she said they were not. Judge Fu Lin ordered them to be remanded and scheduled for further verification. Later, detectives arrested the man wearing blue shirt and pants outside the courtroom, whom the woman identified as the person who had sneaked into the Hongkou Hotel late at night and stripped her clothes off. He was taken to the police station for investigation and interrogation.

### Early Discovery of Abortion Saves Fetus

Female Worker Qian Yueying Claims She Did Not Want an Abortion; Paramour and Midwife Both Offer Evasive Testimony

Qian Yueying, a local woman who used to be a worker at the Dafeng Cotton Mill, 22 years old, had an affair with Gong Yousheng, a member of the Pengpu Township Security Corps from Shanghai, last November. They secretly engaged in illicit relations, and without realizing it, she became pregnant. However, Qian was an unmarried woman and deeply feared that her swelling abdomen would be discovered by her family, so she discussed a remedy with Gong. On the 2nd of this month, Qian and Gong went together to rent room 23 at the Yongan Hotel on Shunde Road. Gong then hired Tang Tangshi, an elderly midwife in her sixties who had previously practiced midwifery in Zhabei, to perform an operation using Tongjing grass as an abortifacient. Unexpectedly, this secret was discovered by Shen Asan, a tea server at the hotel, who reported it to the accounting office, which in turn reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. The police station dispatched Chinese Detective Li Shizhong and Detective Wang Shilian, who arrested Qian Yueying, Tang Tangshi, and Gong Yousheng one after another. Qian was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, while Gong and Tang Tangshi were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing of the case in the Eighth Court. Qian Yueying had also recovered and was brought from the hospital. The police lawyer Li Zhishan immediately filed charges according to Articles 288, 290, 289 and 30 of the Criminal Law and presented the above circumstances, saying that according to the Guangren Hospital doctor's report, because the abortion was discovered early, the hospital managed to remove the Tongjing grass, and the fetus had fortunately not descended and was still in the uterus, so there should be no hindrance. When questioned, the defendants all gave evasive testimony. According to Qian Yueying, her real name is Zhang Yueying, and she is only 19 years old. She and Gong Yousheng began their affair last November. This abortion was not only without my prior knowledge but also without my consent. On the 2nd of this month, Gong tricked me into going to the hotel under the pretext of watching a play, and then he brought Tang Tangshi to perform the operation. I did not want an abortion at all, so I cried out in pain for help, which led the tea server to report to the police. Now I am one month pregnant, she claimed. Gong Yousheng admitted to having an affair with Qian. Because Qian's period suddenly stopped and she often felt pain in her abdomen, it was inconvenient to diagnose and treat her at home, so he discussed with Qian opening a room at the Yongan Hotel and hiring Tang Tangshi to treat her illness. He gave her one yuan for transportation and did not intend for abortion. Besides, although I have a wife, we have been childless for many years. Now that Qian is pregnant, why would I want her to have an abortion? Tang Tangshi testified that Gong came to ask her to see a patient at the hotel, saying that Qian was vomiting frequently, had not had her period for two months, and often had pain in her abdomen. She was wondering whether she was pregnant or sick, so I went to examine her and only used the Tongjing grass I brought with me as medicine; I did not perform an abortion. Detective Wang Shidong testified that he went to investigate immediately after receiving the hotel's report. At that time, only Qian and Tang Tangshi were in the room. When asked, they initially denied it, but Qian later admitted to the abortion and said that she had agreed to it beforehand. When she was sent to the hospital, Qian even stated that she voluntarily wanted an abortion, which the nurse heard. There was also no crying for help at that time. Judge Huang said that the case still required supplementary witnesses and ordered the defendants to be remanded for a later hearing, which will be held again this Saturday.

### Arrested for Creating Trouble, Counter-Accused of False Accusation and Insult

Lawyer Chen Xingmin Threatens a Young Woman; Judge Finds Truth, Ms. Li Found Not Guilty

Lawyer Chen Xingmin rented the downstairs side room of No. 21 Sandeli, Maibeger Road, as his office. On the 19th of last month, Chen's dog damaged the carpet of the second landlord's young wife, Ms. Li. She instructed Chen's maid to restrain the dog from damaging objects. Unexpectedly, when Lawyer Chen returned home that evening, he scolded Ms. Li and threatened her loudly. When the woman's younger brother, Wang Longquan, stepped forward to dissuade him, Chen became even more angry. On that day, twenty to thirty people gathered to make trouble. Ms. Li and her brother reported to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest more than a dozen troublemakers. After questioning, the police chief lightly reprimanded and released them. Afterwards, Ke Mei, Hu Chunshan, and Fang Zhenmin, who had been arrested, jointly filed a private lawsuit against Ms. Li and Wang Longquan with the First Special District Court for false accusation and insult. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao opened the court for interrogation. According to Ke Mei, on the evening of May 20, while we were talking at Lawyer Chen's office, we were suddenly arrested by detectives. It was because the defendant falsely accused us to the police station, causing us to suffer this insult. The court then ordered the police station to provide the records of that day, which only stated that Ms. Li had asked Lawyer Chen to move, and Chen refused, leading to a dispute. It did not mention any illegal activities by you. Ms. Li testified that Chen's dog damaged my carpet on the 19th. That evening, Chen returned and started scolding me, declaring, "I can do it by law or by force, forcing me to go to the Changle Tea House the next day." He even threatened to harm me with nitric acid. Because I am a woman, I told my brother Longquan the next day. My brother came forward to persuade, saying that if we didn't get along, we could move. Unexpectedly, Chen became angry at my brother. In the afternoon, he brought twenty to thirty people, making a lot of noise. I had to go to the police station with my brother and ask for protection. At eight or nine o'clock in the evening, those people came again, some holding studded leather belts. These weapons, the studded leather belts, are still detained at the police station. After those people were taken to the police station, I requested that they not be investigated further because I had not suffered any injuries. I don't know any of the plaintiffs. In short, the whole thing was instigated by Lawyer Chen, and Chen moved out yesterday. Longquan's description of the situation that day was similar to Ms. Li's. After the defendant's lawyer argued, Judge Xiao reviewed the testimony and stated that the defendant's report to the police station at that time was purely a request for legitimate protection, and the plaintiff's accusations were unreasonable. He immediately ruled that both defendants were not guilty.

### Wusong Estuary Turns Out to Be a Haven for Escapists

Following Each Other, Two More Passengers Jump into the Sea from the Xinjiangtian, Xinning and Shaoshao Ships

Recently, the ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route have seen passengers jumping into the sea to commit suicide almost every day. The ship authorities seem to need to take precautions urgently. Another suicide occurred on the Shanghai-bound Xinjiangtian, Xinning, and Shao ships. The details are as follows:

One Passenger Jumps into the Sea from the Xinjiangtian Ship

On the 4th, at half past four in the afternoon, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinjiangtian ship set off from Ningbo to Shanghai. There was a male passenger in the first-class cabin, about forty years old, wearing a black woolen long gown and Zhigong cloth shoes, who was greeted by the attendant Li Shiyuan. The passenger's demeanor was calm, so the attendant did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, around half past one that night, when the ship was passing through the Dajiyang Sea, the passenger suddenly jumped into the sea to commit suicide while the ship was moving at high speed. Although the crew noticed it at the time, they were unable to rescue him in the dark sea. Later, the attendant searched the passenger's cabin and found a long gown left by the passenger, with two and a half dimes in change and seven copper coins in his pocket, as well as a pair of shoes. These items were then handed over to the ship's accounting office for safekeeping, awaiting collection.

Another Suicide on the Xinning Shao Ship

On the 7th of this month, the Ning Shao Company's Xinning Shao ship, which sails on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, set off from Shanghai to Ningbo. There were a father and daughter passenger in the rear cargo hold. The father's name was Ma Yuansheng, 47 years old, from Fangqiao, Fenghua. He used to be a coppersmith at the Gaochangmu Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai. The daughter's name was Qiaoying, 15 years old. They had five pieces of luggage, and were greeted by the tea attendant Yu Chang. After 12 o'clock noon, Ma Yuansheng and his daughter went together to the second deck, each going to the men's and women's toilets to relieve themselves. Unexpectedly, Ma Yuansheng suddenly crossed the railing outside the toilet and jumped into the sea to commit suicide. At that time, the ship was sailing at high speed in the Yangshan Sea. A male passenger in the men's toilet caught a glimpse of it and shouted that someone had jumped into the sea. Qiaoying then came out of the women's toilet. Hearing that her father had jumped into the sea, she cried out in extreme shock. The ship's affairs officer, Li Ruiting, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the tea attendant to take care of the girl until they reached Ningbo, and no further accidents occurred.

### Shanghai Municipal Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Urging Correction of Rude Actions by Collection Staff

Requesting the Assignment of Chinese Staff to Avoid Misunderstandings

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council the day before yesterday, stating that according to a joint letter from the 15th and 36th District Branches of the Association, the address of the affiliated association is at No. 135 Beishanxi Road. It is a customary practice to send someone to the tax office after the patrol donation has been received, which can be verified by records. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 27th of last month, a European collection staff member of the Municipal Council came to the affiliated association to collect the quarterly donation. As the person in charge was out, the collection staff member suddenly entered the inner room, behaving aggressively, and forcibly made an unrelated person sign the donation receipt. Such a situation is detrimental to the reputation of the Municipal Council. Furthermore, the affiliated association has repeatedly received reports from member stores and residents that the collection staff members also frequently engage in such barbaric behavior. Now that the collection staff member treats group organizations in this way, it is impossible to imagine how violent they are to other residents. Furthermore, in the midst of the economic downturn, there are bound to be stores and residents who owe donations for several seasons. Why is it so harsh for the affiliated association, which does not owe donations? It is truly incomprehensible. Therefore, this letter is submitted to urge your council to forward it to the Municipal Council, so that all collection staff members are Chinese to avoid misunderstandings, and should be strictly trained so that residents can have faith in the administrative staff. The above is reported to the association for your consideration.

### Shen Junru and Others' Response (4)

㊂ The indictment, in its third section, haphazardly quotes a few words from the small booklet "Unite to Resist Insults" and some Q&A from the investigation, claiming that it intentionally advocates for the Communist Party, equates the Kuomintang and the government with various other parties and factions, disrespects the current government, and promotes the Communist Party. However, (A) the indictment has not fundamentally studied the contents of the booklet, leading to conclusions that are exactly the opposite of the original intent. This booklet was jointly published by Shen Junru, Nai Qitao, Tao Fen, and Tao Xingzhi, so it is not a document of the National Salvation Association. However, its main purpose is still to hope that the entire nation will unite, as stated on page six: "We believe that, first, the War of Resistance against Japan is a major issue concerning the survival of the entire nation, so only by gathering all manpower, financial resources, intelligence, and material resources, and implementing a national general mobilization, can we achieve the final victory. In other words, the great cause of the War of Resistance against Japan cannot be initiated by any party or any individual. Separated from the masses, merely relying on the government to resist Japan will inevitably fail. But without the leadership of a government, relying solely on the masses to fight spontaneously will never lead to victory." The hope that Chairman Chiang would personally lead more than two million troops to launch a sacred national liberation war, as stated on pages one and two of the booklet, has been detailed in the first paragraph of the above response. Page fourteen also states: "We believe that the authorities in the Southwest should push the central government to send troops to resist Japan and avoid taking a position of opposition to the central government." The booklet clearly hopes that the Kuomintang can lead the nation in devoting itself to the great cause of national revolution, as stated on page fifteen: "We have always considered the Chinese Kuomintang to be a protagonist in the history of the Chinese nation." Page sixteen states: "What we hope for is that the Kuomintang, which has a glorious history of national revolution and holds the ruling power in China, should quickly rise up and promote the establishment of a united front for national salvation." Calling them a "protagonist" and saying "the Kuomintang, which holds the ruling power, should quickly rise up," it is undoubtedly clear that the Kuomintang has the responsibility and power to lead all parties and factions in the country to save the nation, and is not on par with other parties and factions. Since the above points are clear, then the conclusions made by the indictment based on the various phrases quoted from the booklet are far-fetched and self-evident. For example, the indictment quotes "Here, 'various parties and factions' mainly refers to the Chinese Communist Party," but the preceding text is: "The Kuomintang, which holds the ruling power in China, should quickly rise up, promote the establishment of a united front for national salvation, quickly eliminate past prejudices, and unite with various parties and factions to fight together for national salvation" (see page sixteen), clearly hoping that the Kuomintang will take the initiative to unite various parties and factions, while the Communist Party is only the main one among the united parties and factions, with the Kuomintang clearly in a proactive leadership position. How can the indictment claim that it equates them with various parties and factions, and even advocate for the Communist Party? As for the indictment's quotation from page seventeen, "Now the Communist Party has put forward the proposal of uniting to resist Japan, but the Kuomintang has not expressed it. This will make the general public believe that the Communist Party is able to consider the overall situation and eliminate prejudices," it is clear that after the above-mentioned statements on page sixteen, it still hopes that the Kuomintang will lead the resistance against Japan without a doubt. Further evidence is provided on page eighteen of the booklet: "What we hope for is that the Chinese Communist Party should show its sincerity in concrete actions in advocating uniting with various parties and factions to resist Japan and save the nation. Therefore, the Red Army should immediately stop attacking the Central Army to facilitate the peace negotiations. In the Red Army-occupied areas, it should adopt a tolerant attitude towards rich peasants, landlords, and merchants. In major cities, it should try to avoid labor-capital conflicts that could weaken the strength of the resistance against Japan. In this way, the development of the united front for national salvation will not be hindered." It is clearly a warning to the Communist Party, how can it be said to advocate for them? As for why we hope the Communist Party will participate in the resistance against Japan, it is nothing more than because the enemy has invaded deeply, and we should use all our strength to fight against external enemies. Every drop of blood, every bullet, should be reserved for external use. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said in the last paragraph of the third lecture on nationalism: "To promote nationalism, we must first unite ourselves." The declaration of the National Crisis Conference in April of the twenty-first year also stated: "We deeply hope that the people of the whole country, regardless of party affiliation or class, will unite sincerely, sacrifice all prejudices, and jointly devise a strategy for resistance, and break the past pattern of cyclical civil wars based on the principle of popular armed forces, which is the only path for the Chinese people to strive for in the future." The letter to the people of the country from the Central Executive Committee commemorating "September 18th" in the twenty-first year also stated: "The different political views and the complexity of political groups of the people of the country today are undeniable, just like the lengths of fingers and the preferences for salty and sour tastes. However, even with differences in length, they will help each other in times of crisis to seek self-defense. Even with different tastes, they will put aside their preferences when hungry or thirsty to seek survival first. The current national situation is like a lonely boat in the sea, repeatedly attacked by violent winds. The boatmen at this time have no time to do anything but cooperate and help each other. How can they bear to sacrifice the safety of the whole situation for the sake of personal feelings? Therefore, today this party is willing to endure everything in order to seek the survival of the country." Premier Chiang's remarks to the Central News Agency reporters after the Third Plenary Session in February of this year even more clearly stated: "In fact, there has long been no discrimination or exclusion against various parties and factions before the twelfth year of the Republic." The defendants' suggestion that the entire nation, regardless of party affiliation or class, unite to resist Japan is in fact a consistent political view of our country since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The indictment has not been widely read and hastily made accusations against the defendants, which is truly inappropriate. (B) As for the prosecutor's questioning of the defendants about whether the Communist Party is stateless and embraces cosmopolitanism, how can they save the country," this is clearly a question directed at the Communist Party, how can the defendants be ordered to answer it? And asking "The Red Army used to counterattack in the rear, what method can be used to guarantee that it will not cause future troubles," then investigating violations of military discipline, there are natural national and popular sanctions. On what grounds does the indictment believe that the defendants' answers are insufficient? If it is said that without a guarantee of no future troubles, we should not hope that the government will lead the Red Army to resist the enemy, then it is like saying that if we cannot ensure that there will be no mutiny in the rear, we should not hope to resist foreign aggression, abandoning food because of choking, its unreasonableness is exactly the same. The third section of the indictment distorts the meaning of the booklet "Unite to Resist Insults," which hopes that the Kuomintang will be in a leading position to take the initiative to unite various parties and factions to resist foreign insults, completely obliterating the meaning of the entire booklet, attributing the inappropriateness of the questions asked in the investigation to the defendants' non-compliance with the answers, and believing that the defendants are advocating for the Communist Party, weakening the people's faith in the government and the Kuomintang, equating the Kuomintang with various parties and factions, disrespecting the current government, and engaging in propaganda that is favorable to the Communist Party. It is undoubtedly an intentional fabrication.

### Tobacco and Snuff

— Special

Tobacco, known in the West as "tambaku," is now a commonly smoked substance. Its initial origin has been investigated by many people in the past. Recently, London newspapers have revisited the topic, publishing correspondences about the initial smoking (tobacco) facts in Britain and other European countries. There are quite a few interesting materials, and smoking comrades will definitely want to know. The fact that the knowledge of tobacco smoking in various parts of the world originated in the Americas is undeniable. In the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages, the world did not know about tobacco. It was not until November 1492, when Columbus's first expedition ships arrived in the Americas, that he sent a small team of crew members to Cuba to investigate the island's conditions. These people later reported back to the ship that they had seen many gentlemen holding small burning sticks, taking out a kind of dried grass leaf from their bodies, burning it with fire, and emitting a fragrant smell. When Columbus explored the Americas for the second time (1494-1496), a Frenchman named Bain in the team saw the natives sniffing snuff. In 1502, the Spanish saw natives chewing tobacco on the coast of South America. In 1558, King Philip II of Spain sent the physician Fernandez to investigate the native products of Mexico, and he brought the tobacco plant back to Europe. Later, the French ambassador to Portugal, Nicot, presented the tobacco seeds from the peninsula to the Medici king, so tobacco still has the name nicotine today. In 1586, the first governor of the British colony in America, Virginia, Lane, and Sir Drake, transported the equipment and materials for smoking tobacco from the British territories in America to the United States and gave them to Sir Raleigh. The British pioneer of smoking tobacco was Lane. Thanks to the influence of Sir Raleigh, the close attendants in the court of the British Elizabethan dynasty were all infected with the habit of smoking. Sir Raleigh even took a puff of tobacco from his pipe before his execution. In 1604, King James I of England issued an edict saying that he believed that the habit of smoking was harmful to health and should be prohibited. Mr. Wall, the archivist of the Pharmaceutical Society of England, wrote to the newspaper, saying that after consulting the society's documents at the time, it was proved that in the early seventeenth century, tobacco was sold by grocers, and several of them regarded it as a major trade. In 1615, the pharmacists petitioned King James to allow them to establish a separate company. Their reason was that the sale of medicinal materials required special training, and at this time they were affiliated with the grocers' company. The grocers, who were willing to continue the medicinal materials trade, also petitioned the King to not allow the pharmacists' request, saying that this was just a few dissatisfied pharmacists and tobacco sellers who wanted to establish their own banner to seek private gain. The grocers deliberately mentioned tobacco in their letter because they knew that the King hated smoking. In fact, the pharmacists' request to establish a separate company was not to compete with the grocers for the profit of selling tobacco. In 1617, the pharmacists were allowed to establish their own society. In 1619, the scope of business of grocers and pharmacists was defined, and tobacco was sold by grocers. It is not possible to determine from the documents of the Pharmaceutical Society when members were allowed to smoke at meetings, but the current account contained:

1656 Paid for one pound of tobacco and one glass, twelve shillings and three pence.

1657 Paid for one tobacco pipe, one shilling and six pence.

1660 Paid for Spanish tobacco, ten shillings and one tobacco pipe (quantity not recorded).

1662 Paid for Virginia tobacco, one shilling and six pence (quantity not recorded).

Hooke's diary (1672-1680) repeatedly records smoking with his friend Sir Wren and others. In 1677, he bought a quarter of a pound of Virginia tobacco for nine pence, and in 1679 he bought a pound of Spanish tobacco for eight shillings. He did not specify what kind of pipe he used to smoke, but he often said that Wright used clay pipes at his Fulham factory. He was clearly very interested in this kind of pipe. The 1680 diary mentions a "tobacco stopper." In 1675, it was recorded that a servant, Marie, was sent to give Meerschaum to his old friend Hark, who often played chess. This was probably a kind of pipe. Hooke had tried "sneezing tobacco" (1673) and praised the pleasure of snuff, but later abandoned it, apparently because Hark told him that most Spaniards who snuffed too much snuff lost their sense of smell.

Speaking of snuff, it used to be a common habit in England, seemingly originating with Sir Rooke's expedition to Cadiz, Spain, in 1702. Before this, only a limited number of extravagant foreigners and British people who had traveled abroad sniffed this thing. They took out something the size of an eagle feather tube filled with snuff from a small box, poured a little on the back of their hand, sniffed it into their nostrils, sneezed, and said that there was endless pleasure. After the failure of the British fleet's expedition to Cadiz, it sailed to Vigo Bay, wanting to cut off the route of French ships. On the way, it looted the Port of Santa Maria and the surrounding areas. Among the looted items were thousands of wooden barrels, each containing four tin cans of the finest Spanish snuff. Later, a huge amount of raw snuff was obtained in the Port of Vigo, either bundled or packed in cloth bags or leather bags, all of which were transported from Havana to various parts of Spain for manufacturing. This time, the British fleet returned home, and the officers and sailors' spoils included a total of fifty tons of snuff. That coarse snuff, called Vigo Snuff, was distributed to the sailors, who sold it in the ports of Portsmouth and other places for less than three or four pence per pound. Most of it was bought by Spanish Jews, who made a great profit from it. The fine snuff obtained in the Port of Santa Maria was distributed to the officers. Some sold it immediately at a low price, while others kept it. Later, this kind of snuff became popular in British society, and they sold it at a very high price. At that time, even women had to carry snuff boxes, which were a fashionable item. On August 8, 1711, the "Tatler" published an interesting advertisement teaching how to use a snuff box, and someone even wrote "The Etiquette of the Snuff Box" and "The Rules for Respecting the Snuff Box," which shows the respect that snuff received at that time. However, it was only after the prevalence of cigarettes that few people in various countries now sniff snuff. In the early Qing Dynasty in China, many high officials and nobles sniffed snuff, which was extremely expensive and divided into several categories. The expensive ones were worth thousands of dollars for a small bottle, and it was not easy to buy them. But today, this habit has also diminished, but there are still many snuff bottles of various shapes and colors displayed in antique shops, which have been used as a kind of antique.
