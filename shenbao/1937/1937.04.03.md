### Chiang Kai-shek to Return Home for Quiet Recuperation

Frequent Social Engagements During Leave Harmful to Health - Doctors Advise Absolute Rest

(Local News) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's request for an additional two months of sick leave has been approved by the Central Government. Yesterday afternoon, a Central News Agency reporter visited staff in the Adjutant's Office to inquire about the Chairman's health. According to them, the Chairman underwent medical examinations in Hangzhou, and his weight has increased compared to before, and his back pain is gradually improving. However, he tires easily, and progress is slow. After arriving in Shanghai, doctors Niu Huisheng and Zheng Zumu jointly conducted a detailed examination. After research, they believe that the reason for the slow progress is that he has not been able to rest completely. In particular, the constant stream of visitors, frequent social engagements, and excessive talking mean that even during his sick leave, he has not truly rested, which has prevented him from achieving the expected results. To increase the efficiency of treatment during this extended leave, his daily life cannot continue as it has in the past few months. Looking back on the past, when he went from Nanjing to Guling, his health greatly improved because he was able to shut out everything. Since arriving in Nanjing and Hangzhou, more social engagements have led to mental fatigue, and progress has slowed. Therefore, the doctors have earnestly advised the Chairman to take absolute rest and to stop receiving guests. The Chairman has accepted this advice and has decided to return home for quiet recuperation within the next few days. Everyone earnestly hopes that the Chairman will recover fully as soon as possible and will surely respect the opinions of his attending physicians.

[Tianjin] A business community in Tianjin opposes the measures for registering private goods at the customs, believing that all goods purchased by businesses are sent by 洋行 (foreign firms), and the delivery note has always been used as the basis.

Moreover, while private goods in the Chinese 界 (district) are registered, the 租界 (concessions) are still allowed to dump goods, which will inevitably affect businesses in the Chinese 界 (district). Therefore, they insist on this as a reason and ask the Chamber of Commerce to convey it to the customs.

### Resolutions of the Legislative Yuan

Three Water Conservancy Committee Organization Regulations: No Amendments Needed After Review

[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its 97th meeting on the morning of the 2nd, with 66 members including Chen Changheng in attendance, chaired by Sun Ke, with Secretary-General Liang Hancao. Matters discussed: ㊀ The Military Affairs Committee reported on the review of the epaulettes for Generals of the Army and the colors for the Transportation Corps. Resolved and passed that the circles on the epaulettes of Army Generals should be changed to "slip-on" style, and the color for the Transportation Corps should be silver-gray. ㊁ The Legislative Affairs Committee reported on the review of amendments to the organization regulations of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and North China Water Conservancy Committees. Resolved that the review report be adopted, and no amendments were needed for the three cases. It is noted that the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee originally intended to abolish the position of Deputy Chairman, establish a Secretary-General instead, and add two or three secretaries; the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee originally intended to add four senior technical experts, one intermediate technical expert, eight junior clerks, four technicians, and thirty-four technical assistants; the North China Water Conservancy Committee originally intended to add three senior technical experts, two intermediate technicians, three clerks, and two junior technicians. Therefore, requests were made to amend the respective regulations. During the review of the three cases, the Yuan meeting generally believed that during this time of national crisis, even if various agencies could not fully comply with the central government's resolution to implement austerity measures, it was not appropriate to expand unnecessarily. Moreover, the amended organization regulations of the Yangtze River and North China Water Conservancy Committees had not been promulgated for long, and the organization law of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee had also just been amended and promulgated. Making amendments so soon would not show respect for the law. Furthermore, considering the content of the original proposals, although the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee had many tasks, its organization had already been expanded, and the number of personnel had also increased. The North China Water Conservancy Committee was smaller in scale, and its personnel quota was already larger than that of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee. It seemed that there was no need to increase personnel. As for the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, since it already had a Director of General Affairs, who could handle the sorting of documents and auditing of drafts, and other water conservancy committees had no precedent for establishing a Secretary-General, it seemed unnecessary to establish a Secretary-General and secretaries. Therefore, it was resolved that the organization law of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee and the organization regulations of the Yangtze River and North China Water Conservancy Committees should not be amended. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

### The Issue of Egypt Abolishing Consular Jurisdiction

Various Nations to Meet in Montreux for Discussions; Egyptian Delegation Proposes Four Measures

⊙ Montreux, Switzerland. The United Kingdom and Egypt established a Treaty of Friendly Alliance in August of last year. In addition to the United Kingdom recognizing Egypt's independent sovereignty, there is also the issue of abolishing the current consular jurisdiction system in Egypt, which should be resolved through a conference between Egypt and the countries enjoying extraterritorial rights in the country. This conference is now scheduled to be held here on the 12th of this month. In addition to the countries enjoying consular jurisdiction, namely the UK, US, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden, Germany, Austria, and the Soviet Union, although they have lost these rights, are still invited by the Egyptian government to participate. Switzerland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia have also been invited to attend. Other countries will send observers to attend. It is generally believed that the Egyptian delegation will propose the following four measures to replace the current system: ㊀ Egypt will negotiate treaties with the relevant countries to guarantee the freedom of foreigners to conduct business, practice religion, and establish educational institutions. ㊁ The Egyptian government will establish a police force to effectively protect the safety of foreigners. ㊂ The tax exemption privileges currently enjoyed by foreigners will be abolished, and an administrative court will be established to hear lawsuits related to tax issues. ㊃ A transition period will be determined, during which the Mixed Court will still exist.

### A Glimpse of Customs in Xikang

"Sichuan is born foolish, Hanzhong is lost to Long'an, whether you like it or not, another Guangyuan County is added." This is a very popular folk song in Sichuan, a folk song full of irredentist sentiment.

After staying in Chengdu for several days, in banquets or when talking with farmers, they would ask about the sights seen on the road. Upon hearing about the lush green mountains and forests of Shu Han and the beautiful scenery of fertile fields of beans and wheat in the plains, they would all sing the above folk song in unison. It is said that Shu Han was connected, and according to the division of the natural environment, it was originally governed by Sichuan Province. In the early Qing Dynasty (?), when dividing the provinces, in view of the drought in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province and the barrenness of the Shaanbei area, Long'an (now Pingwu County) and Guangyuan were used to exchange for Hanzhong in Sichuan Province. Whether the products of Long'an and Guangyuan are far inferior to those of Hanzhong has not been actually investigated. However, Long'an is an important passage from Sichuan to Gansu, and Guangyuan is a passage to Qin, both of which are historically important places of military contention. Its value is probably not less than "exchanging sheep for cattle." Moreover, as they all belong to the Chinese territory, dividing them to Shaanxi or Sichuan is nothing more than "the Chu bow, the Chu man gets it." However, people still remember Hanzhong, which shows how deeply the Chinese people care about the gains and losses of their homeland. Today, with the territory tens or hundreds of times larger than Hanzhong, and the resources, wealth, and people tens or hundreds of times greater than Hanzhong, the four northeastern provinces were lost at the turn of a hand, and seized by a "friendly nation." Moreover, we are asked to smile obsequiously, and even want to "drag us into the water" and ask us to share their likes and dislikes and their kin and hatred. The hearts of the Chinese people are not all dead. Where in the world is there such an unreasonable bargain?

Wang Baixing, the president of the Chengdu Huaxi Daily, hosted a banquet. Most of the attendees were people in the same industry. In addition to discussing the current situation in general, there was a lot of talk about border issues. Various imperialists spare no effort to use all kinds of aggressive means, military, political, economic, and cultural, to nibble away at our borders, piece by piece, and spare no effort to use despicable and insidious tricks to sow discord among our ethnic groups. If we do not "mend the fold after the sheep are lost" and pay attention to border issues, and even, as in the September 18th Incident, offer entire provinces of our great country, this is no joke. I am afraid that in a few years, these few provinces in mainland China will soon be stripped bare.

The frequent disputes in Kangzang are obviously caused by "shadowy figures." If the problem is not completely resolved, not only will Kangzang waste its limited national strength at any time, but also the so-called "Kamchatka" land of abundance, Sichuan, will not be able to sit back and relax. Liu Jiahui, the chief writer of the Xin Xin News Agency, has traveled to the heart of Xikang. According to him, the situation there is indeed a matter that deserves everyone's attention.

The Xikang Provincial Construction Committee is located in Kangding. Kangding was formerly known as Dajianlu. It is said that Zhuge Wuhou, when conquering the southern barbarians, ordered General Guo Da to build a furnace and make arrows here, hence the name Dajianlu. It is surrounded by mountains as a city, with a small river in the middle. Han and Yi merchants live along the river, and business is booming. The Shanghai-Chengdu newspaper has a considerable circulation, which shows that the culture is quite developed. However, Kangding is only the center of commerce and politics. The cultural center of Xikang is still far away in Dege, east of the Jinsha River in the northwest. The political and religious culture there occupies an important position. Han people account for 60% of the population in Kangding, and Yi people account for 40%. However, from here to the west, especially west of Ba'an, it is all the world of the Yi people. The central government's border management law entrusts most of the administrative orders to the local special classes. They mostly have short-sightedness, are concerned about personal gains and losses, and conceal the central government in everything, which is not easy to detect and causes no small delay.

The whole territory of Xikang originally had thirty-nine counties, but the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee's efforts are only on the east bank of the Jinsha River. Jiangxi Province is fully invested in areas controlled by the local overlords, the Jiangxi faction. The ceasefire treaty of the Kangzang dispute uses the Jinsha River as the boundary. Therefore, although the map of Xikang is large, the places where actual administrative orders can reach are only a dozen or so counties. When the Shaanxi Incident was at its peak, Tibetan troops once violated the agreement and crossed the river. Now, with the wave of the situation stabilizing, they are withdrawing to the west.

Going to Xikang, you have to cross very large and high snow-capped mountains. The ideal is still nothing more than towering mountains and ridges. Who knows that it is a vast plain. You can grow wheat and highland barley. That kind of scene of thousands of miles is really moving. Liu Jun once had a… then turned the road to be open and bright, the vast plain is boundless, men come here with wide open, what should you do when galloped and sing happily, a song sentence to record the reality.

Han people used to call the natives of Xikang "Kangba wa" and the Tibetans "Zangba wa." As time went on, they also called themselves or each other Kangba wa or Zangba wa. Kangba wa have mostly married Han Chinese. The old chieftainships that were sealed in the Ming Dynasty have now been abolished, but they still have their own hereditary titles. The chieftain classes are divided into pacification commissioners, comforting commissioners, chiefs, thousand households, and hundred households. The locals uniformly call them chieftains, or large chieftains and small chieftains. The so-called Hutuktu (Living Buddha) chieftains have even greater power and are extremely easy to develop tyrannical, cruel, and arbitrary habits of exploiting the people. For example, the Muli chieftain in the Kang border was granted a title in the Ming Dynasty and was placed under the jurisdiction of Yanyuan County in Sichuan. He only paid more than twenty taels of grain silver every year, which is still the case today. This is the only relationship between the chieftain and the government. However, the area under his jurisdiction has an administrative area, with a population of more than 20,000 households, estimated at more than 100,000 people. According to the population, it can be changed to two and a half counties. According to the resources, it is more than enough to establish an administrative region. The power is a combination of politics and religion, that is, the lama is also the chieftain. There are three major temples, and the regulations imitate the three major temples of Tibet. Each owns 770, 550, and 330 monks, respectively. The temple properties are very rich. The Hutuktu chieftain rotates to live in a temple every year. At that time, it is the season when wheat and highland barley are ripe and cattle and sheep are growing strong. When the Buddha's throne passes by, the people must pave the road with soil, burn Tibetan incense, and exhaust everything to welcome the Buddha. Some are favored by himself, and some are favored by his entourage, the more the better, and all are swept away. The so-called "entourage" is the fully mobilized welcoming and sending monks of those "seven hundred and seventy" or "five hundred and fifty" "three hundred and thirty." See how the people can resist.

Every year, people are also sent to collect taxes once, no different from imperial envoys, extorting and harassing everywhere, arbitrarily taking and demanding. When entering people's homes, they must sit on Pulu (made of deer hair, a precious item in Kangzang). If they force wives and daughters to serve in bed, they happily agree, hoping to reduce or exempt grain taxes and collect more from other households to compensate. The miners of the Longda gold mine once discovered a gold mine weighing more than thirty catties. They wanted to hide the tax, but were later discovered by the lama. More than ten people were executed. Gold can only be mined in broken gold. If a large gold mine is discovered, they must rush to offer it to the temple to recite scriptures and exhaust everything to repent. Therefore, the miners all regard the discovery of a large gold mine as a great disaster.

Han merchants doing business, for example, selling tobacco pouches, must first offer a tribute to the Grand Lama as soon as they enter his territory, and ask him to set the price. The amount of the tribute is the standard for determining the level of the price. If the Grand Lama sets the price of a bamboo tobacco pouch at one yuan each, the buyer must pay one yuan. If you do not know to pay tribute first, no one will dare to accept it even if it is given away for free.

When questioning civil lawsuits, Pulu is layered on the main hall. The Grand Lama sits upright on it, with monks arranged on both sides, deliberately making all kinds of solemn and mysterious appearances, to intimidate the plaintiffs and defendants standing far outside the temple gate. The victory or defeat of the verdict does not depend on what law can be followed, but on the litigation products that the plaintiffs and defendants compete to offer on the spot, such as deer antlers, musk, woolen fabrics, etc. Whoever offers more will win. The reason is that he is originally upright, so he does not hesitate to contribute heavy products, and must prove his integrity.

The chieftain system has mostly been abolished. The reason why the chieftain in this town is not abolished is because he pays that twenty-odd taels of grain silver to Yanyuan County, as if it is only a small special village in Yanyuan County. In fact, he is still a political and religious leader who is as rich as a prince and as noble as an administrative region. If this old feudal force is not eradicated, I am afraid that the government's new forces and administrative orders will never easily benefit the people in this type of area.

Current Commentary

### The Turning Point in the Spanish War

— Hua

The Spanish civil war between the two armies, which broke out in mid-July of last year, has now lasted eight and a half months. For the past eight and a half months, the rebel army has been in a dominant position. The occupation of the Balearic Islands, the fall of Irún and San Sebastián, the rebel army in the south directly threatening Madrid, and the capture of the southern port of Málaga last month, all show the magnitude of the rebel army's momentum and the severity of the threat to the government forces. However, starting at the end of last month, the rebel army in the north launched a fierce attack on Guadalajara but failed to take it down, and suffered heavy losses. The government forces took advantage of the victory and advanced. On the Burgos, Oviedo, and Lao Dubai fronts, they have gained the upper hand. Many Italian troops have been captured, and large-scale mutinies have occurred in the rear of the army. All of this shows that there has been a major turning point in the Spanish war, and that it will enter a new stage in which the government forces will achieve complete victory.

The Spanish rebel army's inability to maintain its initial victory is not accidental. In the early stages of the war, the rebel army's victory was due to several reasons. First, the rebel army possessed superior weapons and was mostly composed of trained troops, while the government forces were mostly composed of people who had been temporarily organized into teams, who had enthusiasm but no experience. In the initial clashes, they were naturally at a disadvantage. Second, the passive non-intervention advocated by Britain and France created an opportunity for active intervention by Germany and Italy. Since the beginning of the war, according to the lowest estimate, the number of German and Italian troops who entered Spain was more than 60,000. Other military supplies and weapons were countless. This external assistance naturally increased the rebel army's chances of victory.

However, precisely because of the above two situations, the rebel army, although it gained the upper hand in the early stages, could not maintain the situation of victory for long. Regarding the first situation, the rebel army relied only on the strength of the army, but did not gain the support of the people. Relying solely on force, without winning the hearts of the people, this destined them to ultimate failure. The biggest difference between modern warfare and the past is that the decisive factor in war lies not in pure military strength, but in the entire national strength. Civilian assets are the foundation of wartime material resources, civilian industry is the foundation of military technology, and the direction of popular sentiment is the foundation of morale in war. Since the Spanish rebel army launched the civil war, the enthusiasm of the people who have joined the government is beyond description. The miners of the Austuria province have transformed into experts in throwing bombs. The factories of Catalonia have been quickly converted into arms factories. All of this cannot be achieved without the support of the people. Therefore, in the current war in Spain, one side is the rebel army that indulges in cruelty to the people, and the other side is the force composed of the people. It is not difficult to judge the victory or defeat between the two.

Regarding the second situation, the Spanish rebel army relied on German and Italian troops as reinforcements, which is like letting a wolf into the house. Even if they are lucky enough to win, the final result will only be to make the peaceful Iberian Peninsula a new territory for international fascism. However, those who are bombed and massacred by German and Italian planes and tanks are the civilians, women, and children of Spain. This inhumane behavior not only increases the hatred of the Spanish people, but is also unanimously rejected by just people all over the world. Therefore, the Spanish poet Unamuno, who originally sympathized with the rebel army, died resentfully after seeing the arrogance and despotism of the German army. Because of the continuous supply of the Spanish rebel army by German and Italian troops, the movement of people around the world to aid the Spanish people has also sprung up, gradually surpassing the rebel army in combat power and gaining a comprehensive advantage.

In the world history since the Great War, the Spanish bloody battle will be the most important event. The significance of the victory, defeat, and changes in this war is worthy of our attention.

### Japan General Election Prediction: New Party Unlikely to Materialize

Most Party Candidates Remain the Same; Newcomers Number Only Over Twenty

[Tokyo] The general election, in which the Hayashi Cabinet seeks the confidence of the people, is scheduled for the 30th of this month. The nationwide political campaign has begun simultaneously. The Minseito Party held an election committee meeting on the afternoon of the 1st, announcing the first list of officially endorsed candidates, totaling nineteen. The Social Masses Party acted proactively, having already decided on forty-eight officially endorsed candidates on the 31st. As for the Kokumin Domei and other smaller factions, they are also steadily proceeding with election preparations. The government is also preparing for a clean election by planning to convene meetings of local governors, police chiefs, and judicial officials. On the 1st, the total number of candidates registered by various parties was fifty-eight, of which thirty-two were incumbent Diet members, four had previously served as Diet members, and the number of newcomers was only twenty-two, as the dissolution was implemented suddenly, leaving newcomers with no opportunity to prepare. If this situation continues, whether the government's intended reform of the Diet can be realized is highly questionable. This sudden election has only caused panic among established political parties, and the majority of Diet members elected in the general election will still be from the Minseito and Seiyukai parties. The only progress will be a slight advancement for the proletarian parties centered on the Social Masses Party. From this perspective, the issue of a new party emerging after the general election seems unlikely to achieve the government's ideal. (2nd, Domei News)

[Tokyo] Three days after the dissolution of the Japanese Diet, the general election campaign has begun actively throughout the country. The Minseito and Seiyukai parties' adoption of a method of mutual compromise in the upcoming election is quite noteworthy, as it foreshadows the establishment of a united front in the new Diet. The disintegration of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties is easily achieved due to the mutual agitation of many internal forces, but Prime Minister Hayashi's sudden dissolution of the Diet has instead prompted various centrifugal forces to further unite. As for the smaller parties such as the Toho Kai, Kokumin Domei, and Showakai, although they intend to support the cabinet, their stances are permanently different, making unity very difficult. For this reason, although the clamor for the formation of a new party is loud, no active action has yet been manifested. Generally, direct actions may be realized when the progress of a powerful movement guarantees them. Fumimaro Konoe is absolutely unwilling to organize a political party, so even if the new party can have a certain number of members, the lack of a leader remains the biggest obstacle. Extreme right-wing groups such as the Shikyoku Kyogikai, Dai Nippon Seiji Toso Domei, Dai Nippon Seinen-to, and Seisan-to, etc., are also unable to form a single party due to serious differences of opinion. Therefore, their fighting power is very weak. The Toho Kai, Kokumin Domei, and Showakai should be satisfied if they can maintain their current position. Although we cannot expect the Social Masses Party to be in a dominant position in the House of Representatives, its future development is very promising. Therefore, there is no doubt that the outcome of the future election will be that the Minseito and Seiyukai parties will continue to be in a superior position. The key to the future political situation lies in whether the Minseito and Seiyukai parties can maintain a united force without conflict, and whether they can be brave and united, as they did in 1924 when they attacked the Kiyoura ultratranscendental cabinet to attack the Hayashi cabinet. The Japanese political situation will then develop in a fierce struggle between liberalism and statism. As for which side the Japanese people support, the upcoming election is the first opportunity to answer this question. (3rd, Central News Agency)

### Prime Minister Explains Reasons for Dissolving the Diet

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi invited 150 government committee members from various provinces to the Prime Minister's official residence at 6 p.m. on the 1st, holding a dinner party. The Prime Minister explained the government's intention in dissolving the Diet this time, which is to refresh the Diet. The Prime Minister's speech was as follows: "Among you, some may think that if the Diet were not dissolved, bills related to your own affairs would surely be passed within a few hours, and regret the dissolution. However, neglecting coordination and clinging to self-interest are the sources of long-standing problems that should be strictly avoided. The government, at the cost of sacrificing important bills that are about to be passed, resolutely dissolved the Diet because there is a more important reason than the passage of two or three bills. We earnestly hope for the development of constitutional politics and the self-awareness of political parties. To seek the refreshment of the Diet, there is no other way than to request dissolution. If the people use this dissolution to elect true virtuous people who reduce selfishness and serve the public to the Diet, then the purification of the political world can be expected. Therefore, we hope that in the general election, many fair and selfless people will be elected," he said. (2nd, Domei News)

### The Times of London on the Japanese Political Situation

[London] After the sudden dissolution of the Japanese House of Representatives, The Times commented, "Some say that Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro is moving towards fascism. There is no sufficient reason to prove this statement. Hayashi Senjuro's desire may not be so great, and it may not have such a revolutionary nature. Looking at his intentions, he probably wants to consolidate the victory that the military previously gained when it overthrew the Hirota Cabinet. As for the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, the dissolution of the House of Representatives was not something they were happy to hear. According to past experience, after each time the government dissolves the House of Representatives, if it wants to continue to govern, it can always win the re-election. Moreover, Prime Minister Hayashi knows that as a prime minister who did not come from a political party, it will not be easy for him to form a compromise with established political parties in the future, so they will definitely compete with all their strength to achieve their goals," it said.

### Kodama Compiles Report in Nagasaki

And Discusses Chinese Issues with Domestic Business Circles

[Tokyo] Kenji Kodama, chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association, after returning to Japan from attending the Japan-China Trade Association conference in China, is resting at his hot spring near Nagasaki, while compiling a general report on his recent visit to China. It is reported that Kodama will depart for Osaka, Nagoya, and other places today or tomorrow to solicit reports from the members of the Kodama group and discuss Chinese issues with local business circles. It is expected that Kodama will return to Tokyo around the 10th of this month, at which time he will report the results of his investigation and opinions to the Japanese government authorities, along with concrete suggestions. Whether the government authorities will accept Kodama's suggestions as a compass for Japan's future China policy is still difficult to predict. However, it is clear that the cabinet is now devoting all its efforts to seeking victory in the general election this month, so a concrete decision on China policy can only be made after the general election. (2nd, Central News Agency)

### US-Philippine Conference

Will Proceed Actively

[Washington] Philippine President Quezon returned here from New York today. As the US-Philippine Economic Conference is about to proceed actively, he does not intend to go to England to attend the coronation ceremony of George VI. According to State Department officials, the US-Philippine Mixed Committee hopes to be organized and established in the next few days, so that Quezon can go to Mexico on the 5th of this month. As for the committee's mission, it will still be based on Quezon's proposal, specializing in studying the impact of the early independence of the Philippines on adjusting US-Philippine economic relations. Quezon has spared no effort in attacking the current independence law, saying that the status of the Philippines is like that of a person whose hands and feet are bound. He also said that the purpose of the current independence law was to make the Philippines prepare for independence, but the result was the opposite, as the law prohibits the Philippine autonomous government from setting its own currency laws, concluding commercial agreements with other countries, or setting its own national policies.

### Radio Telephone Communication Between Tokyo and Argentina to Begin Tomorrow

Charge of 150 Yuan per Three Minutes

[Tokyo] April 4th is the date for the start of radio telephone communication between Tokyo and Argentina. From then on, Japan's one million telephone users will be able to talk to 92% of the world's thirty million telephone users. Those in Japan who wish to talk to countries in South America can be transferred through the capital of Argentina to cities in Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay. The radio telephone circuit between Tokyo and Argentina is 18,500 kilometers long, the longest in the world. The telephone fee is 150 Japanese yen per three minutes.

### World Textile Conference

Discussing Working Hours

[Washington] The World Textile Conference, sponsored by the International Labor Office, will open here tomorrow. The purpose of the conference is to shorten the working hours of the world's 11 million textile workers. If successful, most of the beneficiaries will be female workers. Representatives from 20 countries, including governments, labor, and management, will attend the conference, totaling about 200 people. The International Labor Office will also send nine directors to attend. The US delegation aims to have all countries in the world conclude an agreement to abide by the 40-hour work week system. Leaders who support this movement believe that the competition among textile-producing countries in the world is too fierce, and that the mechanization of the industry has progressed so much that many textile workers in various countries have lost their jobs, so an agreement on working hours is necessary to remedy this. According to this proposal, it has been proposed before, but the British representatives believed that the situations in various countries were different, and they were not fully aware of it at the time, making it difficult to reach a definite conclusion, so they expressed opposition. At this conference, representatives from various countries will exchange views so that a resolution may be passed at the next conference in Geneva. A spokesman for the International Labor Office also said that this conference is only preparatory and may not have any formal recommendations regarding the 40-hour work week system.

### Asahi's Europe-Bound Aircraft "Kamikaze" Departs but Returns Midway

[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun's own aircraft "Kamikaze" departed from Tachikawa Airfield at 1:44:14 AM this morning for a long-distance Asia-Europe flight. The aircraft circled the airfield once under the moonlight, saluting the people who came to see it off, and then headed south towards Taiwan. While flying to Okinawa Prefecture, the weather deteriorated, so it returned midway, returning to Tachikawa Airfield at 8:50 AM this morning. (2nd, Domei News Agency)

### Train Collision Outside London

Forty to Fifty Dead and Injured

[London] This morning, a train collision occurred outside Pethercy Station outside London, killing twelve people and injuring about thirty to fifty people. Among them, many were seriously injured and could not be saved. At the time, a train was parked on a suspension bridge outside Pethercy Park. Before long, another train arrived and crashed violently from behind. Many cars on the front train derailed, and one car almost fell from the sixty-foot-high county bridge. At the same time, the train caught fire due to electric shock. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived after hearing the alarm and erected a cloud ladder on the suspension bridge, allowing doctors and nurses to climb to the top of the suspension bridge to rescue the injured in the car. An eyewitness said that after the incident, passengers crawled out of the car and walked on the green edge of the suspension bridge, swaying like walking on a tightrope. Not only were those who experienced it in person frightened, but even those who witnessed it were terrified. (2nd, Central News Agency, Reuters)

### Italian Armed Intervention in Civil War is No Different from Aggression Against Spain

Spanish Government Enumerates Facts, Sends Notes to Britain and France Urging Attention

⊙Valencia The Spanish Republican government issued a note today signed by Foreign Minister Vayot, stating that in the recent battle in the Guadalajara province northeast of Madrid, the Republican army seized many military orders and documents issued by senior Italian generals commanding the front lines there. Therefore, there is conclusive evidence of Italian armed intervention in the Spanish civil war, and there is no doubt about it. The Spanish government submitted an application to the League of Nations regarding the Italian armed intervention in the civil war on November 27 last year. On March 13 this year, the Spanish government again notified League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol of the fact of Italian intervention in the civil war. Now, Italy's actions not only violate Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, which stipulates that "Member States shall respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of all other Member States," but also prolong the Spanish war.

In addition, the note also attached various documents proving the following facts beyond any doubt: (1) There is an entire Italian army unit in Spain, and all of its soldiers, weapons, and commanders are dispatched by Italy; (2) Italian troops are fighting in several designated positions, which is equivalent to forcibly occupying those positions; (3) The Italian government has established various Italian government agencies in Spanish territory for the use of its troops; (4) Many important Italian government figures are actively involved in the activities of the Italian army in Spain, either assuming command or providing encouragement. The nature of the above facts is completely equivalent to Italy's formal aggression against Spain, which is the most serious blow to Western European security and general peace. The note concludes by saying, "The above evidence is too numerous to list, and it is sufficient to prove the fact that Italy has intervened in the Spanish civil war. The Spanish Republican government hereby notifies the British and French governments to pay attention." (1st, Central News Agency, Havas News)

[London] The Spanish government today sent a note to Britain, stating that Italy's military actions in Spain are a formal military invasion of the country. The note is accompanied by thirty documents and photographs, which are said to belong to the Italian General Staff in Spain. One of them is a telegram from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini congratulating the Italian army on its victory, and another is a telegram from the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party congratulating "50,000 Comrades on their victory in Spain," which was intercepted on the Guadalajara front. Political circles here are eagerly awaiting Mr. M.'s reaction to this note. However, one spokesman said that although Italy and Germany will continue to provide moral support to Spain, they will probably not increase their troop strength. (1st, Kokumin News)

### Rebels Launch Offensive on the Northern Front of Spain

Heavy Artillery Fire Supported by Aircraft; Basque Army Fights Bravely

⊙Bayonne, France Yesterday, the Spanish Nationalist Army resumed its offensive and seized the key town of Albetia and surrounding villages with a rapid encirclement. Therefore, the Basque army on the government side has conscripted all men of age to prevent this new advance by the rebels. However, according to the Nationalists, this new advance is only the initial step in a grand plan, the contents of which are still kept secret. The Basque army has now admitted that after yesterday's setback, the army has retreated to the second line of defense south of Bilbao, but claims that the new line of defense is more solid than the first line of defense, and that there is a natural barrier of towering mountains in the rear, into which they can retreat at any time to hold firm. The Nationalists claimed that in yesterday's battle, the attacks on both sides were extremely fierce, with hundreds of Basque soldiers killed and thousands injured. The weather was clear that day, and the Nationalists were blessed with favorable conditions, so they were able to bombard the government army's defenses with heavy artillery fire. At the same time, tanks, armored vehicles, and 20 bombers were all dispatched, making it impossible for the Basque army to cope. However, the government army claimed that the rebels' losses were also more than 2,500. (2nd, Central News Agency, Reuters)

⊙Bilbao Port (in the hands of the government army) The government army authorities recently issued a communiqué stating that the Basque Autonomous Region front line and the Navarre Province front line were fiercely attacked by rebel air force artillery yesterday in an attempt to break through them, but were repelled by our army. However, some rebel troops still managed to infiltrate the town of Elgorriaga at dusk. In addition, the rebels launched an offensive in the Aramayona area, coming on strongly. Our army's advance troops immediately stopped them. There was only rifle fire in the Legutiano area. On the Oviedo front, rebel aircraft also dropped bombs, but there were no casualties or damage. (2nd, Central News Agency, Havas News)

⊙Vitoria According to the Nationalists, the Nationalists took Albetia yesterday in a swift encirclement movement, killing hundreds of Basque soldiers and injuring thousands more. The Nationalists also captured three villages and captured fifty enemy soldiers. There was fierce fighting in the Vilarreal area today. The weather was clear today, and the Nationalists fiercely bombarded the mountain semi-circular positions held by the Basque soldiers with artillery. The enemy army had launched an offensive against Vitoria two months ago, but was stopped due to a lack of reserves. Therefore, they defended this mountain position to threaten Vilarreal. The Nationalists' offensive this time had thick troops and abundant supplies, including tanks and armored vehicles, and was aided by 20 bombers. The Basque soldiers only used stone and sandbag fortifications as barriers. Because the mountain terrain was rocky, they could not dig trenches. The characteristic of this battle was the continuous advance of light artillery units, often with artillery vehicles pulling to the positions behind the infantry. The Basque mountain soldiers resisted fiercely, and several positions were occupied only after hand-to-hand combat. The Nationalists claimed to have captured two cannons, sixteen machine guns, and two hundred rifles. A Reuters reporter received information from Bilbao about the government army's description of the Nationalist offensive on the Basque front, saying that the Nationalists suddenly attacked the government army's position in La Peruja near Trubia, several miles east of Oviedo, last night. After the government army retreated slightly, it then counterattacked with bayonets. The enemy army was panicked and retreated, with many dead. A telegram from the Basque government to the Valencia government stated that the enemy army launched a dense attack in the Eibar area, suffering more than 2,500 casualties. The number of enemy troops participating in the battle in that area was more than 20,000, and the result was a chaotic rout. The government army is still in pursuit. At the same time, according to news from Andaya, the Nationalists there said that the government army's attempt to penetrate southward on the Burgos front was completely defeated by bombing.

### Rebel Aircraft Bombards Durango

⊙Valencia The town of Durango in the Basque Province of northern Spain was attacked twice by Nationalist aircraft today. The initial report of deaths was 61, but it is now known to be a total of 100. Such a large number of civilians have died in a government-controlled town in one day, which is unprecedented. The Church of Santa Maria was hit by a bomb, killing 45 people on the spot, including one priest. At a nearby monastery, 20 nuns were killed, of whom 15 were killed. When residents fled the town to the suburbs, enemy aircraft shot at them with machine guns. (1st, Central News Agency, Reuters)

### Small Entente Conference

Recognition of Hungary's Right to Rearmament; Military Mutual Assistance Plan Abandoned

⊙Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Responsible sources recently announced that the Small Entente political conference continued its meeting this morning and has decided on three measures: ㊀ Recognizing Hungary's right to rearmament, but on the condition that Hungary provides security guarantees; ㊁ Opposing the restoration of the Habsburg former royal family in either Austria or Hungary; ㊂ The collective security system, which applies not only to a corner of Western Europe (i.e., the military mutual assistance method that should be applied to any country subjected to any aggressive action from any source), should be abandoned. (According to this plan, it was formulated by the Standing Political Conference of the Small Entente at a meeting held in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, in September last year.) In addition, well-informed sources also stated that during this morning's meeting, the Yugoslav representative opposed this plan for fear that it would arouse suspicion from Germany and Italy, so the political conference decided to abandon it. The Standing Political Conference of the Small Entente will hold its final meeting in the afternoon, and then issue a communique to conclude it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Belgrade, 2nd)

⊙Belgrade, Yugoslavia: According to well-informed sources, the most important achievement of the Small Entente conference so far is the rejection of the proposal by France and Czechoslovakia to expand the Small Entente into a mutual assistance pact. This rejection was apparently at the initiative of Yugoslavia, as it deeply fears that the mutual assistance pact would turn Czechoslovakia into part of a Czech-Soviet alliance or a Franco-Russian pact. Yugoslavia has always been extremely opposed to Soviet Russia and naturally does not want to establish such a relationship. It is reported that the Italo-Yugoslav agreement has been approved by the Small Entente. As for the issue of Habsburg restoration, all countries have firmly expressed their opposition and agreed that any future political negotiations with Hungary must be conducted by the Small Entente as a whole, and no single country can negotiate directly. (National Maritime Telegraph, 2nd)

⊙Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The Standing Political Conference of the Small Entente held two meetings this morning and afternoon, jointly discussed by Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, Czech Foreign Minister Krofta, and Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu. It is reported that Stojadinović explained the significance of the political and economic treaties between Italy and Yugoslavia, stating that the treaty provides formal guarantees that Yugoslavia's previous obligations will not be harmed in any way, and that Yugoslavia's relationship with the League of Nations will not be affected by this treaty. In addition, well-informed sources said that Prime Minister Stojadinović also mentioned the relationship between Yugoslavia and Hungary, stating that Yugoslavia will never negotiate with the Hungarian government alone, and will strictly respect the obligations stipulated in the Small Entente treaty. It is reported that at tomorrow's meeting, the proposal to conclude a collective security pact among the Small Entente countries will be discussed. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 1st)

Observers believe that this plan is actually a threat to British hegemony in the Mediterranean. (National Telegraph, 2nd)

### Rumor That the U.S. President Will Propose Convening a Disarmament Conference

Hull Declares That Davis's Trip to Europe Does Not Carry Any Concrete Plans

[New York] The New York Times recently reported that "according to reliable sources, President Roosevelt will propose to the major powers on the 6th of this month to convene a disarmament conference in the capital of Denmark this summer." Some members of Congress deeply believe that this news is true, and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee intends to issue a statement in the House today to commend it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 1st)

[Washington] Regarding the matter of Davis, the former U.S. representative to the disarmament conference, going to Europe, Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the press, saying, "Davis's trip is solely to represent the United States at the International Sugar Conference. It is not true that he is carrying plans to convene an economic conference or limit armaments, etc., and intends to propose them to European countries. As for whether Davis will go to Geneva, it has not yet been decided." Hull continued, "What the United States hopes for is that the main principles established at the Pan-American Conference in the capital of Argentina last year will be maintained. What are these principles? Respect for international laws and regulations is one. Restoring the world economy to normal is two. Mutual non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries is three. If other countries feel interested in and express something about the above three principles in the future, then the matter of convening an international conference will be possible to consider," (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 1st)

[London] U.S. special envoy Davis will hold talks with the British government next week. It is reported that the discussion will be about the issue of the United States assisting in maintaining peace in Europe, or studying the disarmament plan for European countries proposed by France.

[London] Since the European War, world sugar prices have continued to fall. Although sugar-producing countries have concluded international agreements to adjust sugar production in the hope of raising market prices, the effect has been minimal. Among the various agreements, the Chadbourne Plan is particularly important. The plan was implemented from 1931 to 1935, but because most sugar-producing countries refused to participate, it only achieved partial benefits. The International Sugar Conference is scheduled to open on the 5th of this month, and its purpose is to raise sugar prices. The conference is scheduled for three weeks, and there are as many as 23 participating countries. The conference often respects the existing tax systems of all related countries within a wide range, so that the interests of sugar producers in various countries can be harmonized. According to recent statistics, the world's consumption of sugar has increased and exceeded the amount in 1929. Therefore, the timing of the current attempt to raise sugar prices seems extremely favorable. However, opinions on the hope of success of this conference are still divided.

### American Labor Strikes

Two More Factories in the Auto Industry Strike; Coal Mine Labor-Management Negotiations Fail

⊙Detroit: Today, two more factories that manufacture car bodies have experienced sit-down strikes. The workers in these two factories total about 18,000. Union personnel have gone to the two factories to advise them not to occupy the factory buildings and to work as usual, pending a meeting of labor and management leaders. At the same time, the president of the Auto Workers Union, Martin, and the vice president of General Motors have agreed to meet tomorrow. Therefore, the strikers of General Motors are now continuously leaving the factory and will resume work pending a resolution. Some auto factories have stopped part of their work due to a severe shortage of bodies. One of the Yellow Motor Company's factories has therefore caused 6,555 people to be out of work. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 1st)

⊙Detroit: The labor strike in the auto industry in this city has not yet ended, and 12,000 workers at the Chrysler plant in Flint stopped work yesterday afternoon. In Michigan alone, the number of auto industry strikers has reached as many as 120,000. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 2nd)

[New York] Since the dispute between labor and management in the bituminous coal industry in this state, Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, rushed here from Lansing, Michigan, to negotiate with the factory, but without success. All 400,000 workers then declared a strike today in accordance with Lewis's order. The general public believes that labor and management are still negotiating and will soon reach a satisfactory conclusion. President Roosevelt is also closely watching it, so the strike will not last long. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Japan's Xingzhong Company Establishes a North China Salt Industry Company

Capital of 9 Million Yuan, Developing 9,000 Mu of Salt Fields; Manufacturing Salt for Chemical Use and Producing Raw Salt

Tianjin Correspondent: The Salt Industry Department of the Japanese Xingzhong Company, with the head of the office, Zensaburo Nakayama, arrived in Tianjin in late March. The department began independent operations from April 1st. In addition to handling the export of Lu salt, the newly established Tanggu Transportation Company is also under its supervision. According to the company's plan, in order to solve the fundamental problem of Lu salt exports, it has long intended to establish a "North China Salt Industry Company" in our Lu salt producing area (now planned to be renamed North China Electrolytic Soda Factory) to produce and dry Lu salt on the spot, and to produce salt for chemical use, which will be transported back to Japan to supply various soda factories and general factories. The matter is currently being discussed by the Salt Industry Department. The first step is to acquire the Jiuda Refined Salt Company, offering a price of 2 to 3 million yuan. It is reported that there have been several contacts, but the person in charge of Jiuda Company formally declared last month that it would never be sold. Since this method is difficult to realize, it is planned to carry out the second step: to purchase abandoned tidal flats in Changlu by itself, and make and dry salt by itself, as a source of raw salt. Shao Hanqing, a beach owner in Hangu, has 80,000 mu of abandoned tidal land, which was entirely purchased by the Japanese side through the introduction of Yin Ni Rugeng. The negotiations are now nearing completion. Xingzhong Company is preparing a capital of 8 to 9 million yuan. In order to enable the North China Salt Industry Company to complete its independent operation, if necessary, it will pull in several Japanese companies such as Tokuyama Soda Co., Ltd., Dai Nippon Salt Industry Co., Ltd., Asahi Glass Co., Ltd., and Japan Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. to invest capital. After the company purchases the Hangu abandoned tidal flats, it must undergo development and excavation work. Therefore, it plans to first allocate 9,000 mu as salt fields. The cost of organizing and developing each 100 mu is set at 1,300 to 1,500 yuan. Because the company's main aim is to manufacture salt for the chemical industry, the factory needs electricity. For the sake of convenience, the factory will be built between Tianjin and Tanggu, and the Tianjin Power Plant, jointly run by China and Japan, will supply electricity. The daily production of chemical salt will be about 50 tons. However, if 9,000 mu of Hangu salt fields are developed, at least 360,000 tons of raw salt can be produced annually. In addition to supplying factories in Japan, the Tianjin factory will have about 270,000 to 280,000 tons of raw salt, which will be used to manufacture various chemical industrial decomposition products. Xingzhong Company feels that if this matter is successfully held, it will no longer be necessary to negotiate with Changlu salt households to purchase Lu salt for export in the future. Therefore, it is now operating with great effort, hoping that it will be held as desired. As for the Changlu salt households, they do not pay much attention to the North China Salt Industry Company's plan. What they are most concerned about is that the abandoned salt beaches in Hangu will be purchased by the Japanese side, and in the future, they will develop, dry, and sell themselves. Not only will this disrupt the salt administration system in North China, but they are also afraid that smuggled salt will be sold everywhere, and the livelihood of the beach salt households will be increasingly threatened. Recently, a large number of beach salt households have jointly presented a petition to the Changlu Salt Transport Envoy, requesting that measures be taken to prevent the Xingzhong Company's plan from being realized.

The first batch of 100,000 tons of Lu salt for export this year, the draft contract, was signed in Tianjin on February 11, but the governments of both sides have not yet approved it. Xingzhong Company originally planned to ship a batch for export on April 1st, but it has not yet been done. Although very anxious, there is nothing that can be done. The Tanggu Transportation Company, which is related to the export of Lu salt, was established on the 22nd of last month. Three barges have been berthed at the Tanggu Wharf. When the Lu salt is approved for loading, six more will be opened from Yingkou and Andong. In the future, in addition to barging Lu salt to load large ships, it is expected to barge import and export cargo ships from Tianjin to Tanggu. This section of the waterway has been included in the company's business scope. General Manager Eiji Yokota recently told people, "The number of barges will be increased one after another, and will reach 25 this year, and will increase to 30 next year. Each ship is about 800 tons. Other barge companies in the Hai River will gradually be absorbed, so that the transportation company will become the only barge business between the Hai River and Dagu," (2nd)

The common people really cannot afford this huge amount of harsh taxes. We are entrusted to request the Ministry of Finance and all related parties to stop the levy immediately in order to save the people's strength and protect the merchant's capital, etc. In addition to having separately requested the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Affairs Administration, and the Salt Affairs Audit General Office to stop the levy immediately, we are replying to you for your information. To Nanjing Refined Salt Industry Association, Chairman of Nanjing Chamber of Commerce Wang Shumei, Standing Committee Wang Duozao, Hao Liangchou, Zhang Jingping, Duanmu Shenqing"

Locking Up and Showing Off the Tax-Evasion Criminal Who Changed the Deed

The Jiangdu County Government, based on a receipt for altered tax deed submitted by Wu Deluan, the head of Huangtie Township in the Seventh District, specifically ordered Zheng Jingchang Wang Dongchen to arrest the person who altered the deed, Fang Kaitai, and bring him to court for interrogation. He was locked up in front of the granary of the main hall and a white cloth was used to write "Fang Kaitai, who forged the deed, altered the receipt, and defrauded tax funds" on the back of the locked person to show off his case.

Fang then changed the receipt of one yuan and a little more to more than sixty yuan, and sent a letter to Shen asking for thirty-five yuan and six jiao. After Shen sent thirty yuan, after more than a year, Fang finally sent the receipt to Shanghai. When Shen saw the alteration, he sent it to the head of the township for inspection, and Wu Deluan reported it to the county for prosecution.

### Special Envoy Kong and Deputy Envoy Chen Take a Group Photo

Visiting Chiang to Take Leave

Kong was extremely busy yesterday morning at his private residence on West End Road, receiving guests. Those who visited Kong to say goodbye included He Yingqin, Wang Zhengting, and others. Kong then went to Chiang Kai-shek's private residence at 10:00 AM to pay respects and take his leave, departing after about 20 minutes. Chiang Kai-shek also went to the Central Bank at 10:30 AM to see Kong off. During their meeting, Chiang Kai-shek addressed Kong, stating that this mission was extremely important, and he hoped that Kong would make every effort. As for domestic finances, Chiang Kai-shek would personally pay attention during Kong's absence to ensure that everything proceeded as usual, so that when Kong returned home in the future, the domestic financial situation would be similar to when he left. He hoped Kong would be relieved during his long journey, etc. After talking for more than ten minutes, they took a group photo, and Chiang Kai-shek returned to his private residence. Special Envoy Kong gave some instructions on the affairs of the Central Bank and then went to the port.

Inspecting British Troops

When Kong, accompanied by his wife Soong Ailing and Madame Chiang Soong Meiling, his sons and daughters, etc., arrived at the northern pier of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at 11:30 AM, the military band played loudly and firecrackers exploded, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere. After Kong got out of the car, he and Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan inspected the British troops on the pier. Amidst the stirring music, they boarded the ship and shook hands with each of the well-wishers to say goodbye. The ship was originally scheduled to weigh anchor at noon, but because there were too many people boarding to see them off, they did not have time to disembark, so it was not until about 1:00 PM that the ship slowly left the northern pier of the China Merchants in a mixture of military music and firecrackers, beginning its journey abroad.

Personnel Traveling Together

Those who traveled abroad with Kong yesterday included Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan, Secretary-General Weng Wenhao, Counselors Zhang Fuyun, Zhu Changnian, Guo Bingwen, Secretaries Zhang Pingqun, Wu Jingchao, Yang Guangsheng, Chen Bingzhang, Chen Liting, Hu Yigu, Commissioners Tang Hai'an, Chen Shibang, Qiao Jinliang, Li Junwei, Guo Qinzhen, Military Attachés Gui Yongqing, Wen Yingxing, Lin Xianxin, Shen Deshe, Wang Chengfu, Zhou Yingcong, Lin Zun, Hu Xianhua, Madam Kong Soong Ailing, their eldest daughter Lingyi, second son Lingjie, Xiao Zhenying, who was ordered to investigate industries, Zhao Longwen, who was to investigate police administration, and over thirty people including telegrapher attendants. Tan Guang, the head of the Secretariat of the Central Bank, also accompanied the ship to Hong Kong. It is said that there are many people traveling with Kong, and most of the ship's cabins were already booked, so even after making arrangements, they were able to travel together. However, some personnel may disembark in Bombay and wait for another ship to continue their journey. The two envoys, Kong and Chen, will go directly to Genoa and take the international train to England. It is also known that Counselors Zeng Rongpu and Mei Lehe did not travel together. It is also understood that Mei Lehe will leave a few days later, traveling via the United States.

Issuing a Statement

Before leaving, Special Envoy Kong met with a reporter from the Central News Agency and issued a statement saying, "I am extremely pleased to represent the National Government in attending the coronation ceremony in England. I hope that this trip will make the friendly relations between China and England even more cordial. After the coronation ceremony is over, I plan to visit various European countries to examine their current economic situation. What pleases me is that before I left the country, some important issues have already been resolved. The major ones are: 1. The regulations for reorganizing the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank have been passed by the Central Political Council and submitted to the Legislative Yuan. 2. Amending the Banking Law to consolidate general finance has been planned. 3. The banknotes and reserves issued by the Farmers Bank have been taken over by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, with Ye Zhuotang as the general manager of the bank. 4. The government has taken important steps to rectify and stabilize the finances of various provinces, with particular emphasis on Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces. 5. The national budget for the next year has been completed in draft form after two months of planning. It is expected that the regular expenditures, excluding the payment of loans for improving and extending railways (rural reconstruction and other productive enterprises), as listed in the special budget, may have a slight surplus. 6. Great progress has recently been made in clearing overdue debts, and it is expected that measures will continue to be announced soon to repay them." Kong also said that all important matters during his absence will be handled by cadres. He hoped to return to the country in the shortest possible time. Furthermore, Minister of Finance Kong announced today that the government and HSBC have agreed on a method for repaying the debt owed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the bank.

A Reuters dispatch from this city of the Central News Agency stated that before Special Envoy Kong boarded the ship to England yesterday (the 2nd), he issued the following article at the request of Reuters: "I am honored to represent the Republic of China and go to London to attend the coronation ceremony of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England. As I embark on my journey, I am very pleased to take this opportunity to express my respect to the British people. Although Chinese representatives have attended the coronation ceremonies of previous British monarchs, the delegation departing from China, under the extremely auspicious sign of enhancing the inherent relationship between China and England, going to England, as led by me this time, has never happened before. Recently, Sino-British relations have made great progress. The reason for this is that the times have proven that the Chinese and British people have many things in common. Prudent and conservative, preserving their best old habits, holding noble ideas, possessing the talent for managing wealth, and being able to forget temporary grievances, these are all things that the two peoples share. In the past, the two countries were temporarily at odds, but Britain's firm attitude in maintaining its fair and tolerant policy has made the Chinese people look forward to the sincerity of British friendship. From this, the two countries stand together on a foundation of understanding that is more enthusiastic than before. My government has ordered me to represent it and participate in the coronation ceremony. I am deeply grateful for this honorable mission, as this trip will give me an opportunity to express my admiration for Britain's expansion of its friendship with China at a time when friendship is most valuable. I hope with full confidence that the spiritual ties between the people of the two countries will become closer, and that the commercial ties that bind them together will become stronger. This is not only for the mutual benefit of both sides, but also for the happiness of the world. If my trip to the British capital promotes greater understanding between the two countries, then my gains will be very rich."

### Han Fuqu Paid Another Visit to Chiang Yesterday

Returning to Shandong on the Qingdao Maru on the 4th; The discussion was to pay his respects to Chiang and ask for instructions

In addition to paying another visit to Chairman Chiang yesterday morning to ask for instructions, Han Fuqu, the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, also met with Liu Zhi, the Pacification Director of Henan and Anhui, and Yu Xuezhong, the commander of the 51st Army, at the residence of Chiang Bochang, the Chief Counselor of the Military Affairs Commission. Song Ziwen, a member of the National Economic Committee, specially hosted a banquet for Han, Liu, Yu, and others at the International Hotel last night at 7:00 PM. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Han at Chiang's residence and was granted the following interview: "The situation in Shandong Province is currently very peaceful, and public security can be said to be assured. Since Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing from Xi'an, I had planned to go south to pay my respects, but I was delayed due to official duties. This time, in addition to seeing Chairman Chiang to inquire about his health and ask for instructions, there is no other mission. I now have a very deep impression that Chairman Chiang leads the revolution with a spirit of perseverance, especially in dealing with the Xi'an Incident, moving people with sincerity. He is truly the only leader of our country, and this is something that the whole country should admire. Regarding the political situation in Shandong Province, in terms of finance, the annual tax revenue is about 25 million yuan. Last year, due to the impact of the Yellow River disaster, revenue was reduced by two to three million yuan. Efforts are now being made to tighten finances to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. In terms of construction, Shandong Province is flat, and highways are spread throughout the province. As for water conservancy, the system of conscripted labor is used to dredge the Yellow River and build flood control tubes, which are used to divert water for irrigation and to use the rapid flow to flush away silt. In terms of education, compulsory education is now the most developed. Although the education funding in Shandong Province is not as much as in the provinces south of the Yangtze River, it is more abundant than in the provinces north of the Yangtze River." It is reported that Han is scheduled to take the Dalian Steamship Company's Qingdao Maru tomorrow (the 4th), traveling to Shandong via Qingdao.

### Chairman Wu Will Go to Guangdong on the 6th

Going to the Suburbs for a Short Rest Today; Declining All Farewell Banquets from Relatives and Friends

Wu Tiecheng, the newly appointed Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, went to Hangzhou the other day to see Chiang Kai-shek to ask for instructions and take his leave. Yesterday, he also went to Nanjing and rushed back to see Special Envoy Kong off. It is reported that because Chairman Wu was ordered to govern Guangdong, the time was sudden. In addition to handling the handover, he also had to socialize with local people, causing him to be very tired. He is scheduled to depart on the 6th of this month and will take a short rest for a few days before going south to take office. He has gone to the suburbs this morning (the 3rd) and has declined all farewell banquets for his relatives.

### Mayor of Nanjing Ma Chaojun Talks About the Capital's Construction in the Past Two Years

Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to See Special Envoy Kong Off to England; Returned to Nanjing That Evening Due to Busy Official Duties

Ma Chaojun, the Mayor of Nanjing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing to represent Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, in seeing off Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy to England to attend the coronation ceremony. Because official duties in Nanjing were very busy, he returned to Nanjing that evening. Yesterday afternoon, reporters interviewed Ma at the Cangzhou Hotel and were received. He spoke in detail about the recent construction in Nanjing. The details are as follows:

Transportation Construction

Ma said that in the past three years, adhering to the spirit of hard work and practical work under the leadership, and holding the principle of doing more and talking less, he had very little time to come to Shanghai to talk to everyone. From 1928 to 1934, the capital built 450,000 cubic meters of roads, but the roads completed in 1935 and 1936 exceeded this number. The plan for this year also intends to build Jianye, Beiping, Dazhong, Baixia, Mochou, and other roads. The Zhongzheng Road and the city railway will be extended. It is scheduled to be completed by the end of last month, before the National Assembly meeting. The city railway will be extended to Yuhuatai to handle intermodal transport with the Jiangnan and Shanghai-Nanjing railways. This road was started by Duan Fang in the 33rd year of Guangxu, but until 1934, it had to suffer losses of tens of thousands of yuan every year. Since the reorganization in 1931, it has had a surplus every year. It is expected that the surplus will increase even more after intermodal transport is implemented in the future. In addition, the planning construction is to raise capital for trolleybuses, which are expected to cost over 3 million yuan, and negotiations are underway with banks. The plan has also been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is expected to be completed within a year and a half. The principal and interest can be repaid in five or six years. If it can be realized, it can reduce the burden on citizens, costing only 10-20 cents to reach the whole city, and recover a lot of losses. For example, reducing the consumption of imported gasoline. In terms of the life of buses and trolleybuses, one is two to three years, and the other is thirteen to five years, which means that a lot of rights have already been recovered.

Education Situation

In education, in 1934, there were only over 30,000 students, but now it has increased to 80,000 to 90,000. The monthly expenditure is 140,000, accounting for more than 50% of the city's income. This year, school-age children in Nanjing do not feel the pain of having no place to study. Compulsory education has been carried out in two phases, each lasting six months. Each phase enrolls over 15,000 adults, and over 30,000 have graduated. It is planned to eliminate illiteracy in the city in 1936 and 1937. If there are still illiterate people in Nanjing after 1937, they will be punished.

Civic Training

In Nanjing, 150,000 citizens have been trained, including 100,000 male citizens aged 18 to 40, and over 10,000 youth groups aged 12 to 18. 10,000 women have received rescue training. These people were like a heap of loose sand without any organization. Since receiving training, they have become extremely rich in national concepts and ethnic consciousness. Psychological construction and spiritual cultivation have improved.

Social Undertakings

A few years ago, Nanjing had only one training home, but due to improper management, the home was a mess and there were no achievements to speak of. Since the reorganization two years ago, it has accommodated over 8,000 men, women, old, young, and disabled people, providing them with education and support separately. In addition to receiving public training every day, they are required to work and study at a specified time. The work is divided into departments such as hosiery, weaving, towel weaving, shoemaking, rattan work, woodworking, and farming. Most of them are beggars, prostitutes, vagrants, refugees, homeless, and poor and destitute people. Therefore, each person is given two years of education and training to develop their livelihood skills, so that they can all become healthy citizens and increase the strength of the country. The fact that there are no vagrants or beggars in the streets of Nanjing in recent years is clear proof. Last spring, Nanjing also established a municipal hospital. Although the scale is not very large, it can also accommodate hundreds of patients. The health bureau has also established 14 clinics in the city, with an average of more than 1,500 patients a day, which is also very beneficial to the health of citizens. When I took over the water supply in the capital, there were only hundreds of users, but now it has reached more than 5,000 households. Statistics show that the cost has reached more than 4 million yuan, and it is planned to continue to expand it, so that it can supply 1.5 million to 2 million users in the future.

Labor Service

Nearly 50,000 people participated, divided into rural and urban areas. The rural areas built dikes, and the urban areas dredged. The old city moat has been started for two months and the results are good. Unfortunately, this spring there was excessive rain, which often hampered the work. These people are only provided with tools and food by the government, without any other expenses, but the results are still great.

Small Loans

Statistics show that after the program was launched in 1935, 450,000 yuan was loaned, and in 1936 it increased to 570,000 yuan. The types are divided into 1 yuan to 6 yuan. These loans do not charge interest. 6 yuan to 20 yuan charges 6% interest, 20 yuan to 50 yuan charges 7% interest, and 50 yuan to 200 yuan charges 1% interest. There are 37,000 to 38,000 loan households, divided into loans for plowing cattle, seeds, fertilizers, and other categories. Most of them are poor and helpless vendors or small businessmen, as well as farmers. There were many difficulties when the program was launched, but after urging and persuasion, the results were very good and there were no defaults.

Financial Situation

In 1934, the income in Nanjing was only 230,000 per month, but in 1935 it increased to 260,000, and now it has increased to 300,000, with house donations and car donations being the main sources of income. However, the monthly expenditure is 500,000 yuan, with a difference of 120,000 to 130,000 between revenue and expenditure. Fortunately, measures have been taken to mobilize funds and the debt is not very high. This is all thanks to the supervision and responsibility of Chairman Chiang and the central government, which has prevented us from collapsing.

### The Bank of Communications Held a Board Meeting Yesterday

Hu Yun is the Chairman of the Board; Tang Shoumin is the General Manager

### Stefano Takes Office as Our Country's Financial Advisor

Entered Nanjing at 4:00 PM Yesterday

Stefano, the former Italian Minister of Finance, was hired as our country's financial advisor. After arriving in Shanghai on the 29th of last month, Jiang Baili and Xue Guangqian, representatives specially sent by Chiang Kai-shek to welcome Stefano, accompanied him to Hangzhou the next day to pay respects to Chiang Kai-shek. The official duties have been completed. He returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 1st. At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, accompanied by his family and secretary Magna, he was still accompanied by Jiang and Xue by car to Nanjing to take office. Stefano will be stationed in the capital in the future. It has not yet been decided whether he will go to various places for inspection.

### Definite Date for Tobacco and Other Tax Increases

The Taxation Department Issued a Notice; To Be Implemented Starting April 5th

It is now learned that the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance issued a notice yesterday, approving the implementation starting April 5th, and changing the current two-level tax system to a four-level system. The original letter from the Taxation Department to the Chinese cigarette factories is as follows: "Gentlemen, I am writing to inform you that I have recently received an order from the ministry that the current two-level system of unified tobacco tax should be improved and a temporary four-level system should be implemented. For 50,000 cigarettes registered with a value of 800 yuan or more, the first level will be taxed at 800 yuan. For those registered with a value of 400 yuan or more to 800 yuan, the second level will be taxed at 400 yuan. For those registered with a value of 200 yuan or more to 400 yuan, the third level will be taxed at 200 yuan. For those registered with a value of less than 200 yuan, the fourth level will be taxed at 100 yuan. It is scheduled to be implemented starting April 5th of this year. In addition to separately notifying you of the procedures for the new system, this letter is to inform you to comply. Sincerely, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance."

### The Grand Occasion of the Three Major Medical Institutions (Continued from Yesterday)

Speech by Dean Yan

Yan Fuqing, Dean of the National Shanghai Medical College, reported, "Ladies and gentlemen, today our college is holding the inauguration ceremony of the new campus and the opening ceremony of the Shenshan Hospital. We are deeply honored by your presence. Regarding the details of the two institutions, firstly, there is a written report in the special issue, and secondly, I do not wish to take up too much of your valuable time. Moreover, I also want to save some time for your guidance and tours of the buildings and internal workings of both institutions. Therefore, my report today will be brief. I hope you will forgive any omissions. The Medical College was established in October of the 16th year of the Republic of China. In the beginning, it had no foundation. There were only four faculty members and twenty-two students. The budget was only 40,000 yuan. It had no self-built campus and used the Wusong Political University as its campus. However, the buildings of the Political University were destroyed in the January 28th Incident in the 21st year of the Republic. For the past five years, we have been confined to a temporary campus on Haig Road. The simplicity of the beginning and the difficulties encountered are probably beyond description. But today, we have a relatively large campus, self-built buildings, and a teaching hospital. Student dormitories, faculty housing, a pharmacy school, a nursing school, and other buildings have been completed one after another. The student population has reached 205, and the number of faculty, staff, and doctors has reached over 100. The pharmacy school has 15 faculty and staff members and 30 students. The nursing school has 15 faculty and staff members and 78 students. In terms of construction, the main building of the college occupies 28,200 cubic feet, with a building and equipment value of 350,000 yuan. The teaching hospital has 500 beds, and the outpatient clinic can accommodate 500 patients simultaneously. The building construction and internal equipment are valued at 800,000 yuan. The construction cost of the pharmacy school is 30,000 yuan, and the construction cost of the nursing school is 41,000 yuan. The construction cost of the student dormitory is 80,000 yuan, and the faculty housing is 130,000 yuan, totaling 1,431,000 yuan. A table is listed below. The college's expenses only refer to construction costs. In addition to the 160,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Education, the rest was donated by various sectors of society. The land purchase costs for both institutions were donated by the Luo Family Foundation. The Luo family donated approximately 130 mu of land on Father Lous Road in the Special Zone, of which 50 mu have been sold, leaving 80 mu. The proceeds from the sale of the land were used to purchase the land for the two institutions. Because the Luo family's donation came with conditions, namely, that if the donated land were sold, the proceeds could only be used for the purchase of land and hospital funds, and could not be used for construction or other purposes. Although some of the land donated by the Luo family has been sold, the remaining unsold portion is still large. At a time when society is experiencing economic decline, it is difficult to find a suitable buyer for the land immediately, not only does it not generate income, but it also requires an annual land tax of over 15,000 yuan, which is a considerable burden. The construction and equipment costs of the Zhongshan Hospital, totaling 800,000 yuan, were all generously donated by various parties. The cash donations received amount to approximately 600,000 yuan, with a total of 956 donating organizations and individuals. The remaining shortfall is 200,000 yuan. The nursing school building was donated by the family of Mr. Shi Liangcai and named Liangcai Hall. The pharmacy building was donated by the family of Mr. Xiang Songmao and named Songde Hall in commemoration. The student dormitory building was built with a loan from the Shanghai Medical Affairs Board of Directors. In addition, Mr. Ye Ziheng donated the Yeyuan Garden in Jiangwan, naming it Chengzhong Hospital and converting it into the college's second teaching hospital, occupying more than 80 mu. Looking back to the very simple situation ten years ago, we have achieved such results today. Although there are many reasons for this progress, the main driving forces are nothing more than the following: ㊀ We colleagues believe that medical work is a necessity for society. As long as everyone is willing to work hard and does not need to engage in much publicity, we will surely win the sympathy of society. If we can gain the sympathy of the majority of society, then material and spiritual assistance will naturally come in abundance. The fact that the hospital construction received donations from 956 donors is a good example. In addition, we have received assistance from all sides. Those with time have donated time, those with ability have donated ability, and factories have donated materials and sold construction materials at the lowest prices. Therefore, according to the engineer's estimate, the entire construction is at least 15% cheaper than the standard price last year, and at least 30% cheaper than the standard price this year. ㊁ We believe that medical work is a science related to human life. Doctors wield the power of life and death, so when hiring faculty and doctors, we must first pay attention to their qualifications, knowledge, and experience, all of which are subject to rigorous review and extreme caution. Therefore, we have gained the trust of all sectors of society. ㊂ We believe that doctors must have a spirit of sacrificing personal interests to serve society and the medical profession, without the desire to gain promotion or wealth. If colleagues serving in the college or hospital all have this determination, then the medical cause will surely make considerable progress. Therefore, medical talent and their spirit of service are more important than material needs. I recall that ten years ago, the government wanted to establish a medical school in Shanghai and appointed me to take charge of it. At that time, I had no confidence in the various expenses, and the school's facilities had no foundation. Therefore, the only hope that prompted me to try boldly was to seek the practical assistance of the leaders of the medical community in Shanghai. Please cultivate the cells of our medical education with a spirit of sacrifice. At that time, they all agreed to help, and only then did I dare to work hard. Now, our two institutions have a faculty and staff of hundreds, most of whom are full-time. Their salaries are only enough to maintain their livelihoods. Almost every clinical faculty member earns more for the hospital than they receive in salary. If they started their own practice, their material gains would certainly be greater than the rewards they receive from the hospital. For example, this time we established Zhongshan Hospital and hired Dr. Niu Huisheng to serve as the president. Dr. Niu, despite his ill health, is willing to sacrifice his personal career to fulfill his obligations and take on this troublesome task. This spirit of service is worthy of our admiration. I believe that if all of our colleagues have this spirit, the future of the medical profession will be very promising. Today, our college is holding the inauguration of its new campus and the opening of Zhongshan Hospital. I would like to express my sincere gratitude on behalf of both institutions to all sectors of society for their material, spiritual, and other forms of support. At the same time, I thank all colleagues in both institutions for their dedication, sacrifice, and service to society. With one heart and one mind, we will work hard to promote the greater development of medical education. I am willing to encourage this with my colleagues. (To be continued)

### Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Promotes Thrift Campaign

Drafting Regulations on Issuing Invitations and Giving Gifts, Notifying Members to Comply

The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union has a large membership, and social engagements are relatively frequent. The annual expenditure on social activities is considerable, and long-standing habits are not easily eradicated. Recently, the union, in view of the increasing cost of living and the growing financial pressure on members, and in order to vigorously promote the thrift campaign, has drafted regulations to reform the issuing of invitations and giving gifts, notifying all members to comply. The full text of the union's notice and the regulations are recorded below:

Union Notice

Regarding the matter of notification, the principle of reciprocity has been established since ancient times. If there is an event that warrants social interaction, it is intended to express sincere respect, not to focus on the extravagance of the gifts. However, in recent times, social customs have become increasingly extravagant. For ordinary events, invitations are issued, and friends often boast of lavish gifts to each other. They do not realize that this kind of social interaction only increases the recipient's desire for luxury, while the giver may be in dire financial straits. The prevailing atmosphere has even led to indebtedness, which is common. If such extravagance is not curbed, it will not only violate Chairman Chiang's purpose of promoting thrift, but also run counter to the virtue of frugality advocated by ancient sages. The union, aware of this situation, is deeply concerned. Therefore, the training department of the union has drafted "Fourteen Regulations on Issuing Invitations and Giving Gifts for Weddings, Funerals, and Celebrations by Members of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union," which have been amended and approved by the seventh meeting of the board of directors and will be implemented on the same day. This notice is urgently issued, hoping that all members will practice what they preach, promote it to each other, and benefit both personal finances and social resources. This notice is issued on April 1, 26th year of the Republic of China.

    ㊀ Issuing invitations beyond the scope of Article 3 without violating the provisions of Article 4 will result in a warning, and the member shall correct the situation on their own.
    ㊁ Violating any of the provisions of Article 4 will be ignored and will result in a warning.
    ㊂ Violating any of the provisions of Articles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 will result in a warning upon investigation by the union.
12. Members who participate in celebrations or condolences and use cars or chartered vehicles shall limit the meal allowance for the driver to 2 jiao, and the meal allowance for the car driver and bodyguard to 4 jiao. No additional payments shall be made.
13. These regulations apply to members of the union. For external matters, these regulations also apply to members acting as hosts. If the host is an outsider, members of the union may also use these regulations to send gifts or reject invitations that do not comply with these regulations.
14. These regulations shall be implemented after being approved and promulgated by the union's board of directors.

The compilation of phonetic symbols and the training of receiving and sending operators have been underway for some time. Now that preparations have been completed, a trial run has begun on April 1st in five locations: Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, and Tianjin.

### Abolition of Spanish Consular Jurisdiction Implemented

An Elderly Man Fell and Died; Investigated by Special Court No. 1

Spain originally enjoyed consular jurisdiction, and its citizens were not subject to management by Chinese authorities. Since the outbreak of the civil war in Spain, the country's ambassadors and consuls stationed in China have been withdrawn. China then issued an order that all lawsuits and management of Spanish citizens would be handled by Chinese authorities. There was a Filipino who acquired Spanish citizenship, Poncieno Mangilog, aged 68, residing at 285 Tang En Road. He worked as a night watchman at the Huifang Sawmill at 117 on the same road. On the 16th of last month, he went upstairs to fetch a thermos, and descending, he fell on the fourth step of the staircase, resulting in injuries. He was treated at home, but on the 18th, his condition worsened and he was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment. He died at 9:00 am on the Festival morning. The body was sent by the police to the Feilun Road autopsy site in accordance with the law. Yesterday morning, Tang Peiyou, prosecutor of Special Court No. 1, arrived at the site and confirmed that the deceased had died from complications after falling and sustaining injuries. The body was claimed by his mother, Ana Minggao, for burial. This is indeed the first time a Spanish citizen's death has been investigated by a Chinese court.

### The Yao Guisheng Case Continues to be Investigated

Yao Guisheng, the "Red Pill King," accumulated considerable wealth. In January of the 14th year, Huo Shouxiang, who was illegally selling red pills, was arrested in the Chinese area. He confessed that the Public Security Bureau notified the French Concession Police to arrest Yao and transfer him to Special Court No. 2 for prosecution. He was sentenced to four years and four months in prison and fined 4,000 yuan. Yao refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court Third Branch, which was rejected. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which revoked the original verdict and remanded the case for a new trial. The High Court Third Branch has already summoned Huo Shouxiang, who was serving a seven-year sentence, from the Garrison Command. Judge Chen Daqi once opened an investigative hearing to question him about the situation, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Chen again went to Criminal Court No. 3 and ordered Yao Guisheng and Huo Shouxiang to be brought in for further investigation and interrogation. According to Huo's testimony, Yao Guisheng was indeed the owner of the Yao Guiji Red Pill Company. Yao still argued that he used to run a pharmacy business and later engaged in real estate business and had never been involved in the red pill business. As a result, the witness Xu Jinyu, who was summoned, did not arrive, and the hearing was postponed for another interrogation of Yao and Huo. The two convicts were returned to custody. In addition, Yao's nephew, Yao Fulin, filed a lawsuit against Yao and his wife, Ge, and son, etc., accusing them of encroaching on the property jointly owned by his brother, Yao Binggui. The defendants were found not guilty, and the related civil suit was dismissed. Yao Fulin appealed to the High Court Third Branch. The collegial panel repeatedly held hearings without a conclusion. Yesterday, an investigative hearing was also held, but because the summoned witness, Zhou Jiechen, did not appear in court, the hearing was postponed again.

### Chen Lilin Sues Qiu Picheng for Abandonment; Hearing Concluded Yesterday

One to Two Hundred Love Letters Accumulated; Conflicting Testimony on Cohabitation

Chen Lilin, also known as Lin Zhen, a woman from Panyu, Guangdong, is now twenty-three years old. Her family was quite wealthy. Her father, Chen Zhupo, contracted the Tongtai Wharf. Chen also studied at Qixiu Women's Middle School. When Chen was twenty-eight years old, she met Qiu Peiqiu, the son of a wealthy family from Nanxun traveling in Shanghai. Their love was deep and there was a possibility of engagement. However, good times do not last, and in 1934, the two suddenly developed animosity. Chen repeatedly expressed suicidal intentions.

At that time, Qiu Picheng (the cousin of Qiu Peiqiu, son of Qiu Laoqi of the wealthy Qiu family in Nanxun), was introduced to Chen by Peiqiu. He then went to Chen's residence to watch movies, etc., as a form of consolation. Now, Chen has hired lawyer Chen Ziyun to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of Special Court No. 1 against Qiu Picheng, demanding 6,950 yuan in compensation, claiming that since knowing the defendant, they had cohabited at various locations, including the Hua An Hotel, the Great Shanghai Hotel, and 46 Maoyi Lane, Chuhai Customs Road. Now, Qiu

has abandoned her

Therefore, she is filing a lawsuit. The case has been summoned once by Special Court No. 1. Qiu Picheng has also hired lawyers Le Junwei and Le Junfen to appear in court, denying that he had cohabited with Chen Lilin. The court advised them to go outside to reconcile. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Gongdian opened Civil Court No. 7 to continue the hearing. The defendant's lawyer, Le Junwei, stated that during the period for changing the date, he had negotiated a settlement with the plaintiff, but failed due to disagreements. Because Qiu Picheng has gone to

Sichuan to take office,

he was unable to attend the court today. Subsequently, Xiang Zhongchuan, the landlord of 46 Maoyi Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, testified that Qiu Picheng and Chen Lilin came to rent a room together on the 14th day of the first lunar month last year. Lawyer Le also pointed out that, according to the plaintiff's statement, they had cohabited in room 16 of the Hua An Hotel. However, after the defendant obtained the telephone number installed in that room, it was under the Western name Lery Cheng. This Western name belongs to the

plaintiff's name

Chen Lilin. This proves that the room in Hua An was opened by the plaintiff. Moreover, according to the one to two hundred letters written by the plaintiff to the defendant, most of them invited the defendant to her home for consolation. In the plaintiff's diary and letters, it can be said that her and Peiqiu

were in love, and how

the defendant

was consoling

her. Therefore, it can be proved that the friendship between the plaintiff and the defendant existed, but there was no cohabitation. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Finally, the plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendant's cohabitation with the plaintiff had been proven by witnesses and material evidence. Therefore, the defendant should fulfill the plaintiff's request. Judge Xu submitted a report and announced the conclusion of the debate, scheduling a date for the verdict.

### A Wife Repeatedly Commits Adultery, Forgiveness Is Difficult

Divorce Lawsuit Filed in Court, One-Sided Argument Concluded

Du Jinzhong, an employee of the Yangtze Hotel, married a Miss Tang in Hangzhou several years ago. They had a son and two daughters. Unexpectedly, Miss Tang neglected her wifely duties and, while Du was working in Shanghai, had an affair with Zhong Alin. She invited him to her home for secret rendezvous. Du Jinzhong caught them together on two occasions and turned them over to the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau. However, after persuasion from relatives and friends, and considering their children, Du hoped she would sincerely repent and refrained from pressing charges. He then moved Miss Tang and the children to Shanghai, renting a house at 121 Shanhai Pass Road. Unexpectedly, Miss Tang was still consumed by her passion and relapsed, resuming her secret rendezvous with Zhong Alin. On February 25th of this year, Du returned home and caught them in the act. Although he turned them over to the police at the time, he did not file public charges. After Miss Tang was released, she fled and disappeared without a trace. Du Jinzhong, finding her repeatedly unrepentant, felt it impossible to spend the rest of his life with her. He hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting a divorce from his wife Miss Tang, based on Articles 1000 and 52 and 215, and Article 1000 and 55 of the Civil Code. Yesterday morning, Judge Peng Shi presided over the case in the Civil Court No. 4. Although the defendant Du Tangshi was notified through public notice, she failed to appear in court. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawyer, Qian Xingzhong, concluded the one-sided argument. The court adjourned and will announce the verdict on the 5th of this month.

### Dispute over Cohabitation of Amateur Opera Singers

Zhuang Guolan Accuses Zhang Shaocun of Abandonment

Zhuang Guolan, a woman from Ningbo, is seventeen years old and loves Peking opera. In 1933, she joined an amateur opera troupe to learn the art. There was a man named Zhang Shaocun (residing at 24 Chunyin Lane, Gordon Road, and running the Asia Hotel at 571 Hankou Road) who also studied opera and became acquainted with her. Their friendship developed into a relationship, and they began cohabiting on the Qixi Festival (Double Seventh Festival) of 1933, at 9 Wuchang Lane, North Chengdu Road. The following year, she gave birth to a son named Hongliang, who is now two years old. During their cohabitation, Zhang paid Zhuang 120 yuan per month for living expenses. They later moved to 3 Maoyi Lane, Shanhai Pass Road. In July 1934, Zhuang discovered that Zhang already had a wife, and she confronted him. On July 27th, Zhang wrote an agreement promising to permanently support Zhuang and her son. However, starting from January of this year, Zhang suddenly abandoned Zhuang and her son, neglecting them completely. Zhuang hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to file an abandonment lawsuit against Zhang in the First Special District Court, requesting that he be punished according to Article 294 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the criminal court for questioning. The defendant did not appear but sent a lawyer to court, stating that Zhang now resided in Ximen, Wuxi, so the court lacked jurisdiction. Judge Huang briefly questioned Zhuang Guolan. Because the crime was committed in Shanghai, the case fell under the jurisdiction of the court. The judge adjourned and scheduled another hearing.

### Five Families in Chunyang Lane Had Children Abducted

Fujian Authorities Crack Down on Kidnappers and Escort Them to Shanghai; Five Abducted Children Have Been Reclaimed by Their Families

Kidnappers have special terminology for abducting children. If the abducted child is a girl, it is called "selling sticks." If the abducted child is a boy, it is called "getting stones." There are many such kidnappers who "sell sticks" and "get stones" lurking in this city, and their internal organization is quite complex, making it very difficult to crack down on them. Recently, the Fujian authorities apprehended a group of male and female kidnappers from Zhenjiang who were taking abducted boys to Fujian by sea to sell. The kidnappers were Zhong Laosi (aka Zhang Jinxi), Tian Yuchun (aka Wei Laosan), Jiang Wangshi, a woman from Shaoxing, and Zhang Wangshi (aka Zhu Wangshi), a woman from Zhenjiang.

Five Boys Were Rescued.

After questioning, it was found that the children's families all lived in the vicinity of this city. The authorities telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, which sent officers to Fujian to escort the four male and female kidnappers, along with the five children, back to Shanghai. After notifying the children's families, the children were returned to them, and the kidnappers were temporarily detained for investigation. Subsequently, the police station arrested two more members of the gang, Huang Yihong (aka Shen Qizi), a man from Zhenjiang, at the wharf of the 16th Pier. According to Shang Wu, a detective from the Huishi Police Station of the Public Concession, and Fang Qingyun, a police informant,

Living on Tiantong Road

The six-year-old boy Guan Fu, son of Wu Daoyuan, a peddler at 137 Tiantong Road, disappeared at 10 p.m. on October 6th last year at the small vegetable market on Beishi Road. He was abducted by these kidnappers. Therefore, they brought the kidnappers to the police station for questioning yesterday. The kidnappers confessed that they abducted Guan Fu and took him to Fujian, selling him to a certain family in Quanzhou as their son, receiving 140 yuan which they split among themselves. Yesterday morning, the police station, together with Wu Daoyuan, escorted the five male and female kidnappers to the First Special District Court for punishment. In Chunyang Lane, Youheng Road, Hongkou,

Residents in One Location

Have had five children abducted in recent months. When these families heard that the kidnappers had been apprehended, they went to the 8th Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning to listen to the trial. Some of them saw the female kidnapper Zhang Wangshi among the five kidnappers and whispered to each other that she used to live with her lover Chen in Chunyang Lane. Now she is colluding with kidnappers, so they speculate that their children must have been

Abducted by the Gang

Soon after, Judge Fu Lin took the bench and began the interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu described the process of solving the case, stating that after thorough investigation, only Wu Guanfu was confirmed to have been abducted by the kidnappers. The other families who lost children need further detailed investigation. He requested that the kidnappers be detained. Judge Fu Lin questioned Huang Yihong and the other male and female kidnappers one by one, and then ordered them to be detained separately pending further investigation.

### Falsely Claiming Calligraphy by Chairman Lin, Extolling "Uncommon Moral Integrity"

The Plaque in Qu Jinshan's Home Was Reported

Qu Jinshan, a wealthy businessman from Jiangbei, lived in Rihui Port, Nanshi. Two years ago, his concubine was murdered by someone seeking revenge. Qu was suspected and detained by the local court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Qu refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court, which overturned the wrongful conviction and declared him innocent. After his release, fellow villagers held a banquet for Qu to dispel the bad luck, and presented him with a plaque inscribed with the words "Uncommon Moral Integrity." The inscription above was Qu Jinshan's name, and the inscription below was "Respectfully Presented by Fellow Villagers from Jianghuai in Shanghai," and signed "Calligraphy by Lin Sen." Below the calligraphy was a seal that read "Seal of Chairman Lin Sen of the Central Government," which was inappropriate. Xue Zhao, a prominent person, saw it and believed that Qu was falsely using the seal of Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government, obviously engaging in fraud. He filed a lawsuit with the local court, which sent officers to investigate secretly and confirmed the facts. The prosecutor summoned Qu Jinshan, but Qu, fearing punishment, went into hiding. His son Qu Derun and Cao Dajiu, a fellow villager who claimed to have presented the plaque, appeared in court for questioning. As a result, they were released on bail. A public prosecution was filed yesterday, and the case will be heard publicly soon.

### The Fish Market Implements Retrenchment

In order to implement retrenchment and save expenses, the Shanghai Fish Market merged departments and laid off staff starting on the first of this month. The Compilation and General Affairs sections of the First Department were abolished, and the Transportation Section of the Second Department was also abolished. Sixty-nine employees were laid off, and seventy-one employees were transferred. However, due to their livelihood, the laid-off employees plan to ask the authorities for relief.

### Fishmongers Citywide Petition Du Yuesheng

Request Reduction of Commissions and Improved Treatment

The fishmongers in this city have repeatedly appealed to all parties to request a reduction of commissions and improved treatment at the fish market, but the issue has not been resolved yet. Yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., fishmongers from various districts and markets in the city appointed representatives to bring a petition to the Fish Market Council at the Zhonghui Building, appealing to Chairman Du Yuesheng. More than twenty representatives from the Triangle, Fourth Road, Beijing Road, Zhoushan Road, Tongzhou Road, Avenue Edward VII, Shanhai Pass Road, Republic Road, Route Doumer, Nine Acres, Caishi Street, Xiaodongdou, and Laobaidu markets, including Wu Fugui, Tu Yunliang, Li Jiaosheng, and Le Jincai, arrived. Since Du Yuesheng was attending a meeting of the Bank of Communications' board of directors, he sent his secretary Yu Tianbi to meet them. The representatives presented their petition, and Secretary Yu replied, saying that the council understood their requests and had received letters and instructions from the Ministry of Industry. Therefore, they are actively planning and will implement the requested measures as soon as the plans are finalized. The representatives expressed their satisfaction and left.

### Overseas Chinese Voluntarily Pay Income Tax

Many Have Been Contacting Recently

The Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly negotiated with consuls of various countries regarding the issue of overseas Chinese paying income tax. There has been great progress recently. During this transition period, the number of people of various nationalities in Shanghai and Chinese employees working under foreign organizations who voluntarily pay taxes is increasing daily. Their respect for the law and patriotism is inspiring a sense of responsibility in the general public. It is reported that in recent days, many people have been contacting the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Office to discuss tax payment and voluntarily pay taxes, including Ren Zuowu of the British Sihai Insurance Company, Chen Zhenya, a Chinese employee of the British Marine Corps, and Chen Qijun of the British Jiye Bank. In addition, employees of the French Meiyi Foreign Firm and the Huahai Foreign Firm have also contacted the office to discuss tax payment procedures. Other stateless people who have paid taxes include M.R. Mascrimoff, Gziinisky Zepyroff, Gookott, and female typist U.F. Soclgeng, and Russian lawyer Mo Youluo Zuo Fu. Among them, the female typist is the most enthusiastic. It is said that her monthly income is 350 yuan, and she pays 7.6 yuan per month, plus 22 yuan for January and February. Although the HSBC bank did not deduct interest on her savings, she voluntarily paid the deduction.

### The Robbery at Ye Zhaosong's Home Was Orchestrated by the Cook

The Rooftop Plasterer Heard the News and Reported It to the Police; All Four Robbers Were Caught

Ye Zhaosong, a native of Guangdong, lives at 83, Lane 495, Huade Road, and works as a broker for Beiyang Bank on Jiujiang Road. Recently, he was targeted by robbers. At 9:10 a.m. yesterday morning, five robbers broke into his home, brandishing knives and threatening the maids to remain silent. They went upstairs and used knives to threaten Ye's wife, Ms. Fan, pointing the knife at her chest, demanding the keys to the safe. When she refused, they tied her hands and feet with rope.

Prevented From Taking Any Action

They obtained the keys from her niece, Ye Liandeng, and ransacked the safe, stealing national currency and jewelry worth 120 yuan. As they were about to escape, Zhou Zhongfa, a plasterer from Yangzhou, who was working on the roof, heard Ms. Fan calling for help and saw the robbers. He immediately notified his foreman, Zhou Awu, who called

The Yulin Road Police Station

Hua detective Liu Junxiang, detectives Li Pengfei and Wang Yufu, and officer Peng Zhenxuan, together with Western detectives, armed themselves and rushed to the scene in a car. The robbers panicked and dared not escape from the front door, but ran out of the back door, only to find themselves in a dead end. As a result, the Chinese and Western detectives captured Gu Hanzhang and Liu Zizheng from Anhui, Wang Huaisong from Shandong, and Yang Zhengjiang from Henan.

On Gu, One Robber Was Found

### The Bureau of Health Cracks Down on False Advertising for Milk

The Shanghai Bureau of Health discovered two types of printed advertisements from the Qiaji Country Ranch in Zhujiatan, Pudong. They stated, "The milk sold by our ranch has always been of extremely high quality. This year, it has been tested by the Shanghai Bureau of Health fifteen times and has received an A grade (i.e., A)." The investigation revealed that the milk sold by the ranch had been chemically tested by the Shanghai Bureau of Health eleven times in 1936, and seven times it did not meet the B grade standard. The ranch had been repeatedly instructed to improve. Only one chemical test result met the A grade standard for bacterial count.

### City Party Headquarters Actively Promotes Social Services

Detailed Plans Have Been Drafted and Implemented; Director Lin Meiyan Issues Statement

The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, in order to promote social services and assist the people, has established a Social Service Department to handle various social undertakings. A reporter from the Guomin News visited Director Lin Meiyan of the department yesterday to understand the department's purpose and progress. According to Director Lin, the purpose of establishing this department is to make it the center of Party affairs work in the future. Now that our country has achieved peace and unification, leading the people in national revival is a natural and just task, and the Party can also gain the people's faith, expand the Party's organization, and train the people's thinking. Whether from the perspective of the Party's responsibility or social welfare, engaging in social service work is essential. The department is divided into three parts: one is the Board of Directors, which hires enthusiastic public-spirited people from society to serve as directors and is responsible for raising funds; one is the General Management Office, which is responsible for guiding and promoting work. In addition to the director and deputy director, the General Management Office also has three sections: General Affairs, Promotion, and Inspection, all of which are voluntary positions. In addition, a Design Committee is established in each district to design suitable projects for each district. The methods for raising funds for the department include subsidies from the City Party Headquarters, donations from colleagues in the City Party Headquarters, donations from the Board of Directors, and subsidies from the central and municipal governments. In the future, it is also planned to raise considerable funds to enrich the department's various undertakings. The work plan includes: ⑴ Promoting social education, such as reading rooms, newspaper stands, libraries, theater troupes, lectures, broadcasting, movies, children's health camps, and rural improvement experimental zones; ⑵ Implementing vocational supplementary education, such as vocational supplementary education for industry, commerce, agriculture, and women, and assisting various trade associations and factories in running vocational supplementary schools; ⑶ Providing personnel consulting, such as job placement, career guidance, further education guidance, travel guidance, legal guidance, marriage guidance, health guidance, and service guidance; ⑷ Providing public welfare services, such as hospitals, public clinics, cooperatives, low-cost lending institutions, public canteens, affordable apartments, new village nurseries, and public halls; ⑸ Providing public entertainment services, such as clubs, tour groups, photography clubs, sports associations, equestrian clubs, concerts, and cinemas. It is also planned to build houses in stages in Nanshi, Zhabei, and the Special District, concentrating various undertakings according to their nature. The department plans to proceed in three phases. The first phase, from 1937 to 1940, will gradually promote social education, vocational supplementary education, and personnel consulting services, and plans to build a six-story steel-reinforced concrete building in Nanshi, roughly the size of the YMCA, and select concentrated undertakings to operate. The second phase, from 1940 to 1943, will organize public welfare services and public entertainment services separately, and build a building in the concession area to meet the needs of various undertakings. The third phase, after 1943, plans to build a building in Zhabei and establish various production undertakings. What is described above is only a general outline, and the procedures may be adjusted or changed temporarily. The completion of these undertakings depends on the full support of the central and municipal governments and enthusiastic people from society to promote their progress. However, colleagues should also maintain an unwavering determination and strive for the welfare of the people. After speaking, Director Lin told the reporter that the Shanghai Personnel Consulting Committee will be organized soon, a human resources consulting agency will be established, and the Shanghai Social Education Promotion Committee, Shanghai Public Welfare Undertakings Committee, Shanghai Vocational Supplementary Education Implementation Committee, Shanghai Public Entertainment Committee, and Shanghai Social Service Department Construction Committee will be organized. The principles have been approved by the City Party, and they will be implemented soon.

### The General Labor Union Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Measures to Deal with Labor Strikes

Submitting a Petition to the Party and Government to Implement Arbitration and Enforce Execution; Issuing a Letter to Workers Urging Labor-Capital Cooperation

Dagong News reported that the Municipal General Labor Union, deeply concerned about the recent surge of labor strikes in the city, which has affected social order and industrial development, convened an emergency executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss measures to deal with the situation. It was resolved to send four committee members, Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kechang, and Ye Xianggao, to visit Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan, and Wu Kaixian of the City Party Headquarters on Monday to discuss the speedy implementation of compulsory arbitration and to issue a letter to workers throughout the city, earnestly urging them to implement labor-capital coordination and prevent further labor strikes. The documents submitted by the union to the Party and government agencies and the letter to the workers are recorded below.

Petition to Implement Compulsory Arbitration

The General Labor Union submitted a document to the Party and government agencies yesterday, stating, "Submitting a petition to implement compulsory arbitration in order to quell labor strikes and stabilize society. This year, labor-capital disputes have been rampant, and labor strikes in various industries have been frequent and unstable, which is rare in previous years. If this continues, not only will the national economy not prosper, but it will also damage the vitality of national construction. Shanghai is an important industrial and commercial city, and the prosperity or decline of domestic industry depends on the situation in Shanghai. The impact is extremely profound. In the past, although workers were easily incited due to their knowledge, most of the disputes were caused by the capital side's excuses for suspending business, dismissing workers for no reason, or exploiting the interests of workers. Workers feel oppressed and have no means of livelihood, and they request the Party and government to call for assistance. However, the capital side often ignores the government's mediation decisions and even uses illegal means, luring and intimidating, causing a case to be delayed for months and years without resolution. This situation is particularly serious among the capital side in the concessions. This is the crux of the matter. The mediation committee for handling labor disputes cannot fully maintain its authority. The union, in view of this, resolved through the 25th standing committee meeting to submit a petition to the Party and government agencies to implement compulsory arbitration. After the arbitration committee decides on a solution, both labor and capital must absolutely obey. If there is any violation, it will be enforced. At the same time, a joint announcement will be made that workers who strike or slack off without authorization before a dispute has been legally mediated will be punished, and the capital side must also obtain the Party and government agencies' mediation decision before implementing any changes in treatment, dismissal of workers, or suspension of business and reduction of capital. Otherwise, they should also be severely punished. This will enable both parties to know what to follow, and disputes that have already occurred can be resolved quickly, and those that have not occurred can be prevented in advance. This matter concerns the livelihood of workers and the future of industry. We implore your office (government) to review and implement it as soon as possible in order to stabilize society and maintain industry and commerce. We await your urgent orders."

Issuing a Letter to Workers Throughout the City

The General Labor Union also issued a letter to workers throughout the city yesterday regarding preventing labor strikes and implementing labor-capital cooperation, stating, "Dear workers of all industries in the city, China is an industrially backward country. In recent years, due to the impact of the global economic downturn and the continuous years of domestic disasters, coupled with the constant aggression of various imperialist countries, industry and commerce are in danger, and the countryside is bankrupt. Both labor and capital are in difficult and hard times. In order to revive industry and commerce, labor and capital must cooperate sincerely, bearing in mind the meaning of interdependence, hand in hand, so that we can achieve common survival and common prosperity. This is the union's consistent position and has been repeatedly explained to the workers. The workers of all industries are indeed able to understand the situation of industrial decline and the importance of protecting national industry. Even in the painful situation of life, everyone can understand the difficulties of the capital side and have no complaints. Many workers can even voluntarily reduce their salaries and extend their working hours to help the capital side overcome the crisis together. This spirit of sincere cooperation is truly admirable and is also what the union considers extremely fortunate. Today, because of last year's bumper harvest of agricultural products, the effectiveness of the legal tender policy, and the government's efforts in construction, the endangered industry and commerce have slightly improved, and the market has also shown a slight recovery. The workers of all industries, after enduring a painful life for several years, are justified in demanding improved treatment at this time when the situation is improving. However, the demands we make must have a considerable limit, and at the same time, we must follow legal procedures and first submit a petition to the Party and government agencies for mediation. We must not strike or slack off without authorization, causing many serious disputes. We should deeply understand that at a time when the market is showing a slight recovery, we should cultivate it and cherish it with the same enthusiasm for labor-capital cooperation as in the past, so that national industry will move towards a truly prosperous state. We must not easily listen to others' incitement and arbitrarily create labor strikes, causing the slightly improved industry and commerce to fall back into the realm of danger and become irretrievable. Dear workers, we should jointly shoulder the responsibility of developing industry and restoring the country. This is what the union sincerely tells you and prays for."

### Silk Weaving Workers Accept Order and Announce Resumption of Work This Morning

Social Affairs Bureau Criticizes Workers' Demands; Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to Strictly Punish the Initiators

Xinsheng News reported that after the Social Affairs Bureau ruled on a compromise solution to the silk weaving factory workers' demand for improved treatment, it strictly ordered the workers to resume work by a certain date and rejected their demands. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry requesting an investigation and punishment of the initiators. The Workers' Committee for Improving Treatment announced the resumption of work today. The details are as follows.

Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to Investigate and Punish the Initiators

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday regarding the silk weaving industry workers' strike, stating, "(Omission above) Since labor-capital disputes are being mediated by Party and government agencies as usual, the conditions proposed by the labor side will naturally be discussed and conceded gradually. If they insist on their harsh demands without any compromise and threaten with a general strike as a tool to force the other party, it is equivalent to the labor side ordering the capital side, which has lost the original purpose of equal negotiation and mediation. Moreover, in terms of normal procedures, even if mediation fails, arbitration can still be carried out according to law. If the labor side's demands are reasonable, there is no need to worry about not being able to implement their demands, and there is no need to resort to direct action, causing unnecessary losses to production enterprises. Article 23 of the Trade Union Law has strict regulations on strike resolutions in labor-capital disputes. The main purpose is this. In this case, the silk weaving workers went on strike before the conditions were proposed and mediated, which is against the original purpose. They did not intend to seek a compromise between labor and capital. After receiving the order from the Party and government agencies to resume work, it was out of fear of violating the law and not what they wanted. Therefore, after starting mediation, they insisted on a quick breakdown in order to achieve their original wish of a strike threat. In this situation, it has to be said that their intention is to destroy production enterprises, cause emerging factories to be reduced to illusions, and the workers' lives will also be reduced to nothing. This method is definitely not for the true welfare of the workers. We hereby submit a petition to your Ministry and Bureaus to instruct the competent authorities of this city to investigate and punish the initiators, determine the initiators, impose appropriate punishment, and strictly order them to resume work in order to maintain the operation of the weaving factories and the livelihood of the workers, which is in the public interest. In addition to submitting separate petitions, we respectfully submit this petition."

Social Affairs Bureau Criticizes the Demands Yesterday

After the Social Affairs Bureau ruled on a compromise solution to the silk weaving industry workers' treatment conditions and ordered compliance, and advised the workers to resume work immediately, it criticized the representatives of the workers of each factory yesterday for disobeying the order and refusing to resume work. The criticism stated, "The relevant wage demands have been clearly instructed to be revoked. You are still ordered to comply with the previous order and resume work by a certain date. If you continue to disobey deliberately, you will be subject to the law," etc.

The Trade Union Announces Resumption of Work This Morning

The Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Workers' Committee for Improving Treatment announced to the workers of each factory yesterday, "Regarding the announcement, in order to take the overall situation into consideration, accept the orders of the Party and government agencies, and for the sake of protecting the national industry, it has been resolved by the emergency representative meeting of this committee that all silk factories in the city will resume work uniformly tomorrow morning (the 3rd). From now on, the silk weaving workers throughout the city should strengthen unity, consolidate the organization, establish a consistent spirit, and prepare for continued struggle. The workers of each factory are ordered to resume work uniformly within a limited time. This is of utmost importance. This is a special announcement. April 2nd."

It was resolved by the 13th regular meeting of the subordinate committee to telegraph your Ministry to quickly devise remedial measures to strengthen the customs anti-smuggling organization in order to protect national sovereignty. We respectfully request your Ministry to review and implement this matter. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Anti-Smuggling Committee respectfully asks.

### From Gambling to Improving Family Entertainment

— Wei Ji

Gambling is most prevalent in our China. No matter when or where, there is gambling in almost every place and every moment. From wealthy nobles to common poor people, regardless of gender or age, almost everyone gambles. Especially during the New Year, the sound of mahjong battles can be heard everywhere. Adults do not need to be mentioned, and children also gather to gamble, tirelessly all day long. This kind of atmosphere has a huge and dangerous impact on oneself, family, society, and the country's future!

Gambling can be said to have hundreds of harms and no benefits to people. People who are fond of gambling are not only prone to developing all kinds of bad habits such as being competitive, selfish, and seeking luck, but also very easily destroy their personal health. Imagine gambling day and night with great concentration, how can it not make people weak. Moreover, its damage to family order is even more worrying. Gambling causes financial difficulties for the family; the education of children cannot be taken care of; children are influenced subtly and imperceptibly! It may even lead to a breakdown in the relationship between husband and wife, poverty, and lead to family bankruptcy, creating all kinds of tragedies. Extending it further, it can disrupt society, corrupt public morals, lose the national spirit, and hinder the country's progress. Its harm is truly great!

Since the harm of gambling is so great, we cannot but prohibit it. But because our people, except for a small part of people who gamble as a profession, the reason why other men, women, old and young love gambling is nothing more than to pass the time and enjoy the spirit. So we can say: Leisure entertainment is needed, but it should be proper and beneficial. Gambling like this, which has hundreds of harms and no benefits, should be absolutely prohibited. Therefore, in addition to banning places with gambling, I think the first step should be to improve family entertainment, and being a housewife is the basic element of improving family entertainment to replace gambling. Because the housewife controls the family affairs, everything is initiated by her. She can lead by example and quit gambling; then her children will not be infected with bad habits!

But what is proper family entertainment? For example, raising fish and birds, gardening, chatting and laughing to relieve boredom, or playing silk bamboo instruments, playing the harmonica, playing the piano, singing songs, playing records, listening to the radio, and telling stories to children are all entertainment that cultivates temperament. Or playing chess, arranging tangrams, reading novels, drawing pictures, these are intellectual entertainment. Or accompanying her husband, taking her children for a walk, strolling in the park, or even traveling; or kicking shuttlecocks, practicing boxing, playing ball, doing freehand exercises, or dancing and swimming at home are all fitness entertainment. In short, there are countless proper family entertainments. Wise housewives, why should we abandon this and take the evil gambling!

A sound society is built on good families. If we want to improve society, we must start with improving families! May women across the country quickly and thoroughly eradicate gambling, which destroys family happiness and hinders social progress!

### Soviet Union's First Female Captain

— Shadow Stay

In the Soviet Union, women's status is completely equal to that of men, and in terms of society, women undertake any job that men can hold. Not long ago, the Soviet women's world produced a female captain. The merchant ship she captains, the "Chavicha," has a deadweight tonnage of 3,020 tons, and all the crew members must obey her orders. Last winter, this merchant ship even visited Singapore. Although women's occupations in the Soviet Union are more developed than in any other country in the world, a woman being a ship captain is still a first! The Soviet Union's first female captain is named Anna Ivanovina Schelinina. Her hair is curled like a child's, but in her conversation, we can immediately see that her position is very important and she powerfully commands all thirty-six crew members and sailors on board the ship. When the ship arrives at the dock, she wears a white Soviet merchant ship captain's uniform with copper buttons, but without stripes or epaulettes, a white shirt, white cotton socks, and leather shoes. However, we know that at sea, for comfort, she wears a loose smock.

She is twenty-eight years old this year, grew up in Vladivostok, and is the daughter of a carpenter. At the age of thirteen, she entered the merchant marine school in Vladivostok, studying navigation courses in the school during the winter and practicing merchant ship driving in the summer. After four years, she graduated and became a trainee on a local merchant ship, and soon was promoted to third mate. In 1931, she also passed through Singapore. In January 1932, she was promoted to second mate. On a trip from Odessa to Vladivostok, she passed through Singapore again. In June of last year, she was promoted to captain. Indeed, a woman holding such an important position is a great honor for the women's world. Eight years ago, she married a fellow wireless telegraph operator on the ship. At that time, she was still serving as second mate, but now her husband, unaccustomed to life at sea, works at a wireless radio station on land. According to her, the Soviet Union will have many female captains in the near future, because among her classmates, although many did not pass the graduation exam, there are still many who are serving in the maritime industry as second or third mates.

A twenty-eight-year-old woman captaining a 3,000-ton merchant ship seems a bit too young, doesn't it? In the eyes of most people, that is the case. However, in the Soviet Union, there is currently a large need for maritime talent to captain merchant ships. Traditionally, a mate had to go through a very long period of time to be promoted to captain. However, among the captains in the Soviet Union today, there are already many young people. As for women, most of them serve as second or third mates and wireless telegraph operators. She has ten years of experience at sea, so she is indeed qualified to be a captain. The crew members all obey her, which shows that she has extraordinary courage and skills. According to the general crew members, they all think that the female captain has a very good temper and treats them very kindly. Each of them can get a bottle of red wine every day, but the captain herself only drinks some absinthe and does not smoke at all.

The "Chavicha" is now owned by the Ganshdega Fishing Company, mainly developing shipping in that area. The shipping routes mainly involve ports such as Petropavlovsk and Vladivostok, or even sailing in the Black Sea and often passing through Singapore. In September of last year, the Central Soviet government bought it from Hamburg, Germany, and specially sent this female captain to Germany to take over the new ship and sail it to Odessa. As a woman commanding a merchant ship, she is the first in the Soviet Union, and it was also her first time, but after leaving the bay, she encountered heavy fog. Fortunately, she commanded properly, so she was able to safely arrive at Odessa. Along the way, after fifty days of sailing, she sailed in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. The weather was very good, but when she arrived in Singapore, it was raining, and she arrived at the shore exactly in the middle of the night. There was no pilot, but she was able to safely dock between British merchant ships and Japanese merchant ships. Her maritime skills are truly admirable!

### The Old Nanny Who Educated a Son to Adulthood

— Flower Bell

Twenty-five years ago, when my family moved north, we dismissed our old nanny, Aunt Wu, who had worked for our family for twenty years. Yesterday, I suddenly met her at my colleague Mr. Wu's home. Although she was showing unexpected signs of aging and had a head full of white hair, the kind smile on the corners of her mouth had not disappeared. When she saw me, she could still roughly recognize the contours of my original face, so she called out my childhood name in surprise when we met. But what surprised me very much was that the Aunt Wu of the past was actually the old mother of my colleague Mr. Wu today.

When Aunt Wu was hired by my family, she was only in her thirties. I wasn't even born at that time. Three years later, I was born, so Aunt Wu often held me in her arms when I was in swaddling clothes. I only learned about Aunt Wu's life when I was a little older, and it was very pitiful. She was originally a child bride who had suffered abuse from her parents-in-law since she was a child. Later, after her parents-in-law died, her husband, who did not engage in proper business, repeatedly tried to sell her, so she escaped from the family and made a living as a helper. Because of her amiable nature, diligent service, and love for everything, she never wasted anything, and was even loved by my grandmother, so she lived with us for twenty years. Although she had returned to live with her husband for a year in the middle because her husband had reformed, she was disappointed and returned to my home to work because her husband's old habits resurfaced. During that year, she had given birth to a child, but later, because of leaving home, she entrusted the child to others to raise. At that time, my fourth younger brother happened to be born, and my mother was ill after childbirth and lacked milk, so Aunt Wu's return was started by breastfeeding my fourth younger brother.

Later, my father moved to another place to make a living, and because he was afraid that Aunt Wu would not be accustomed to the new environment, he did not take her with him. However, when Aunt Wu was dismissed, she burst into tears, reluctant to leave, saying that she had been treated very well in my family, and that once separated, she would feel lost and dependent. Everyone in my family, from my grandmother down, also felt sad, and even more so, my siblings and I all felt that Aunt Wu was too lovable. After my family left Shanghai, unfortunately, my grandmother and father passed away one after another, and the family suffered repeated misfortunes. So, ten years ago, I shouldered a heavy burden and re-entered this city to make a living. Engaged in the struggle for food and clothing, I gradually forgot the golden age of the past, so Aunt Wu's impression also gradually faded in my memory.

But yesterday, unintentionally, I met her again, and learned that in the past ten years, she had used all her hard-earned income and past savings for her son's education. Her son was also very considerate of his old mother's hard work, worked hard, achieved academic success, and found a decent job, using his salary to support his old mother. Her son is my current colleague, Mr. Wu, who is young and handsome, and also frugal and admirable. Lucky Aunt Wu, I couldn't help but congratulate her.

Because of this relationship, I exchanged a card with Mr. Wu yesterday and became sworn siblings. From now on, I dare not call her Aunt Wu anymore, but instead call her Aunt. But she is still polite and dares not accept it. However, such a person who educates her son so well is probably hard to find in wealthy families.

### Floral Decorations in the Home

— Xia Fei

Home decoration is also a very important art in modern families. Often, a clever housewife will arrange the home in an orderly manner, and make people feel like they have entered a "palace of art" when they are in it, and a feeling of joy will arise spontaneously. Because indoors, whether it is a table, a bed, a mirror, a book, or a vase, as long as they are handled properly, they will naturally show an artistic beauty that is neither simple nor complicated. If they are arranged poorly, not only will it become chaotic, but it will also make people feel as if something is missing or something is too much, and they will always feel an unnamed disgust in their hearts. In reality, it not only destroys the beauty of the interior, but also loses the meaning of decoration.

Floral embellishment is also a type of interior decoration art. This is also listed as a course in Japanese bride schools. Although there are no so-called bride schools in our country, and there are no courses dedicated to the study of home decoration, I have read quite a few books and articles that discuss home decoration and interior decoration. However, there are many types of decorations in the home. Now, I just want to talk to readers about the part of indoor floral decoration.

Speaking of indoor floral decoration, the most important thing is the decoration on the table or desk: we just need to pay attention to it, when we walk into a new family, we can always find many beautiful floral decorations on their tables and desks—of course, this also exists in old families, but after all, they lack artistic expression.

In spring, it is the time when hundreds of flowers compete for beauty and thousands of flowers bloom. Whether it is plum blossoms, apricot blossoms, peach blossoms, hyacinths, nasturtiums, calendula, or daphne odora, all can be used. There are also many wildflowers and rare flowers, too numerous to mention. We just need to control the colors a bit, so as not to be too vulgar.

But merely individual flowers are really not enough to be called decoration; to decorate, we should prepare utensils for decoration, such as: pots, tanks, vases, bowls, etc., which cannot be lacking. And, we must prepare various styles, so that we will not feel lacking when using them, or have difficulties in the control of forms. For example, hydrangeas and phlox paniculata are best planted in large-mouthed bowls. Such as peonies, it is best to mix them with other flowers and insert them in tall vases, or transplant them alone in fine porcelain pots, but it is necessary to preserve the original epiphytic young leaves and bracts as a foil. Also, various grasses, planted alone in long-necked vases are also very elegant, but ordinary people generally match them with giant reeds, which are also quite noble. In short, the decoration of flowers should not be too complicated, nor can it be too monotonous. It must be quiet but not noisy, elegant but not vulgar, and it must be able to blend deep and shallow colors, and intersperse red and light colors. Whether it is blue, purple, yellow, or green, it must match the indoor environment, the color of the tables and desks, and the style of the vases and bowls.

Those who have not studied decoration will often fail. The reason is that some use too many materials, tying many kinds of flowers tightly together, so that they lose their innocence. Some people, in the season of beauty and splendor, when using flowers for indoor decoration, do not wait for introduction, and pick up any wonderful flower at hand. When using materials, because they have preconceived ideas, they are unwilling to sacrifice a few flower buds, so that the decoration lacks the air of youth. Therefore, we must have an artistic vision in order to arrange it into a natural beauty.

What is discussed here is only a little opinion contributed regarding the decoration of tables and desks, but it is something that those who pursue home decoration cannot ignore, especially the skills that young housewives should know. However, indoor floral decoration is originally not only a type of decoration for tables and desks. All places, such as beside fireplaces, on the sides of corridors, at door corners, and on top of cabinets, should have floral embellishments to enhance the tranquility, beauty, liveliness, and warmth of the house. However, whether the arrangement is appropriate or not depends on the genius of the bride.

### Beauty Techniques for Rural Women

— Jun Mei

Economic beauty techniques for rural women, under the huge annual figures of cosmetics expenditure, we feel that there are several that are worth introducing.

Women often have their faces appear abnormally pale and relaxed due to poor blood circulation, even like anemia. In addition to exercise and eating more nutritious foods such as green vegetables, for local treatment, rural women often use apples and buckwheat soaked in bottled Shaoxing wine or white liquor. After soaking for three to five days, they use gauze to filter the residue and wipe it on their faces with cotton in the morning. After one or two months, the complexion will naturally change from pale to ruddy. Secondly, rural women always like to wipe their faces with loofah juice before applying makeup. It is said that this will immediately show a smooth and delicate luster on aging and relaxed skin.

Rural women often like to drip soybean milk into the water for washing their faces, which can not only make the skin white and tender, but also maintain youthfulness and wrinkle-free skin if used for a long time. It is simple and economical, and there is probably nothing more than this.

Honey is also considered an indispensable cosmetic by rural women, especially those women with rough and oily skin, who always have to apply it once or twice after each face wash. In the cold and dry winter, it can also remove various frostbite and skin cracking diseases, and the fragrance of honey is simply better than fragrant powder and water.

Women of the times! Of course, we can be happier if we can do useful work with our limited time without makeup, but if we cause endless money to flow out due to makeup, the simple, economical, and easy-to-do beauty techniques of the rural women described above may as well be tried.

### Nuptial Sutra

— Huai Bing

A newlywed man's sexual desire may be burning like fire, swaying like water, crying like a child seeking food, and madly infatuated without certainty! The bride at this time is a beautiful, gentle, and good-at-nurturing nanny. You should exercise your mysterious and sacred duties, to comfort, lure, cherish "him," and not make "him" excessively happy, shocking the stimulation on his nerves. Flower-like days require you to always maintain two things: 1. Everyone has their own temper. The temper of the mother-in-law and the temper of the mother must be different, so the younger generation should handle it well. 3. Chinese people live an ethical life, and people-related problems arise everywhere, requiring the harmony of each other's feelings. Only "blame yourself." 4. Some time after the wedding is the most important trial period for love. Whether they can overcome this difficulty depends entirely on the attitude of the couple towards each other. After two young men and women get married, they will encounter various practical problems in life: the previous dreams and ideals must be corrected by reality. Since the two people live together day and night, the temperament and temper that they never dreamed of in each other will be revealed. At this time, you and he should resolve any unsatisfactory things with the determination to connect with each other and the sincerity to help each other. You and he must be tolerant, love each other, and plan to benefit and make each other happy, and find ways to make the fire of love burn even more!

### Common Sense of Family First Aid

— Guo Wei

A housewife should not only know common sense such as cooking, sewing, educating children, and managing household affairs, but also need to understand a little about family medicine and first aid common sense. Because who can guarantee that their family will never encounter any accidents? If some major misfortune happens occasionally: such as someone taking poison or getting an electric shock, and there is no time to send them to the hospital or ask a doctor, and the people in the family don’t understand any medical common sense, then there is no other way but to prepare for the funeral for the unfortunate person. Therefore, every housewife should know some common sense of family first aid. Now I will pick out some of the most common ones and write them down below:

1. Asphyxiation. The causes of asphyxiation can be divided into electric shock, hanging, and carbon monoxide poisoning, etc., and the first aid techniques are the same. First, lay the patient flat in a ventilated place, unbutton the clothes around the body, rub the whole body, move the patient's tongue according to the order of breathing, and finally perform artificial respiration. After the patient wakes up, have them swallow a stimulant.

2. Taking poison. The treatment for taking poison is to first pry open the patient's teeth, gently tickle the patient's throat with chicken feathers to induce vomiting, so that the poison remaining in the stomach is completely vomited out. Then dissolve two tablespoons of 45 cm sodium sulfate or table salt in a teacup of water and have them swallow it. Finally, in order to eliminate the remaining toxins, have them swallow half a liter of water, with four raw egg whites in the water.

3. Burns. If there are no blisters at the wound, you can first apply a layer of almond oil and lime water: (equal amounts) and then apply a layer of picric acid solution: (10 cm of picric acid per liter of water) and bandage it with gauze and cotton. If there are blisters at the wound, you can first pierce the blisters with a sterilized needle (smoked over fire), apply bismuth ointment or sterilized Vaseline, and then apply medicine according to the situation without blisters as described above. If bitten by a dog or poisonous insect, you can apply hydrogen peroxide to the wound with gauze, and you must immediately ask a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.

4. Falls and bruises. If the skin and flesh are not torn, you can tie the injured area with a tightly pressed cloth with water and Arnica, and take stimulants. If the injury is very serious and the patient has fainted, then you must prevent internal injuries and immediately ask a doctor for diagnosis.

### Letter No. 10 to Ms. B

— Zhuo Dai

You asked me about the Gujiazhai Park in Shanghai? I can tell you: it is a masterpiece of the French style. Although European and American gardens can be called architectural style or formal style, in fact, each country has its own faction. I may as well talk to you about it. Now let’s divide them into two categories: ㊀ gardens, ㊁ parks.

Gardens can be divided into four types: ㊀ Italian architectural style, ㊁ French architectural style, ㊂ Spanish architectural style, ㊃ modern architectural style. Parks can be divided into five types: ㊀ English landscape style, ㊁ French architectural style, ㊂ German architectural style, ㊃ American sports ground style, ㊄ natural landscape style.

Italian architectural style, this is passed down from the system of gardens in the Roman era. Its characteristic is to extend the building to the outside, according to the hilly land, using the varied terrain, with several terraces stacked on top of each other, and placing the main building in its upper or lower section. The axial line of the design of the main building can run straight through the terrace. Based on this axis, all parts are symmetrical from left to right. On the ground of each terrace, garden buildings, fountains, sculptures, and shaped trees are arranged very neatly. On the retaining wall of the terrace, there are also niches and wall fountains. Fountains, sculptures, and shaped trees such as umbrella pines are all characteristics of Italian gardens.

French architectural style, the characteristic is to move the Italian style into flat land and develop it on a large area. The axis is further extended along the majestic row of trees and waterways. The intersection of the axis and the axis is made into a star shape, where fountains and sculptures are located. Near the building, a beautiful patterned flower bed is specially set up.

Spanish architectural style, surrounded by buildings on all four sides, is just a courtyard-style garden. The walls of the surrounding buildings, the corridor, or the ground of the courtyard are all decorated with things embedded like the Eastern style in a lively way. In the center is a beautifully shaped fountain, constantly spraying fine water. Sculptures or flower pots are placed at the four corners of the courtyard. From inside the window, you can vaguely see the outside coconut trees. In short, it is a small garden with a cool taste throughout, which is also a branch of the Roman garden.

Modern architectural style, this is a practical-oriented garden that follows the modern residential buildings originating in England and developing in Germany. For outdoor living, the necessary gardens are divided into several parts, just like the distribution of rooms in a residence. It is a hygienic and interesting garden, which is the so-called "outdoor room". Grassland, shade trees, flower beds, vegetable gardens, sports grounds, etc. are the main parts. Braid trees into fences to divide them. For the connection of each part, the view line and garden path are very important. Practical garden houses and benches can replace the fountains and sculptures in the old gardens.

After reading the above four types, you can understand: Although European gardens are all architectural styles, they are actually completely different due to historical relationships. This time, I can only talk about gardens. I will talk about the park part next time. Zhuo Dai

### Seeing a Doctor

— Ji Shan

Contributing Four Kinds of Convenience

Usually, patients feel that there are four inconveniences when seeing a doctor; first, they don't know which doctor to find is the most appropriate; because there are many kinds of diseases, they can't remember so many famous doctors by themselves, and if they suffer from several diseases at the same time, they will have the suffering of "not knowing what to do." Second, if they find a famous doctor, but the clinic equipment is simple and crude, they will also feel unhappy. Third, the transportation is inconvenient, making the patient tired on the way. Fourth, it takes a lot of time to get the medicine, and often after seeing the doctor, they have to go to a very far place to get the medicine, which wastes a lot of time going back and forth!

The Five Continents Pharmacy has always had the ambition to build the most complete medical institution. Since the completion of the new building on Simaru Road, this ambition has also been realized. Now patients who go to the Five Continents Building for treatment can feel four kinds of convenience:

First, all internal and external departments are available, and the chief physicians are all famous doctors in Shanghai. Second, the consulting room is designed by experts, perfect and comfortable. Third, Simaru Road is in the central area, and the transportation is convenient. Fourth, the consulting room has a dispensing office, and the medicine can be dispensed immediately after the diagnosis. As for the low fees, etc., those are still minor matters.

### Jing Ke

— Du Hao

The changes of late autumn are swift and strange. The first half of the day may be clear and dry, but who knows when the dim, sorrowful clouds will come in the afternoon, painting the clear sky into a gray face? Several crows, thinking it was time to return to their nests, busily flapped their wings with all their might, not turning their heads as they flew straight from the distant mountain peaks to their roosts. In the high sky, their mournful cries of "Ear Ear Ear" occasionally drifted down, making it all the easier to think of loneliness or the sorrow of parting!

This was a road near the Yi River. Under the barrier of such dark clouds, to see the windy pavilion standing alone behind the small hill, one had to open one's eyes wide. But we finally saw it—Lan Ji, draped in a plain white garment, alone, pacing silently. She did not want to step out of this small world—the pavilion—but she often stretched her slender neck, gazing outside the pavilion, as if expecting something. Indeed, she had held a hope here since early morning—that the one she hadn't seen for a long time, today would be their last meeting. She hated him for being completely cold and devoid of emotion; yet, losing him was like losing her soul, and her existence would no longer contain a drop of joy.

Time seemed to pass a hundred times slower than usual, and several anxious gazes ended in disappointment. So she could only blankly lean on the railing inside the pavilion, sobbing with the first truly sorrowful sound of her life.

Who was it that stroked her shoulder?

"Is that Lan?"

The speaker was a man draped in a purple robe: that was Jing Ke.

At this moment, she didn't know how to control such emotions. "Is this the last time?" she asked, very hesitantly and stutteringly, hoping he would offer some denial, but that was too ideal a dream.

"Perhaps..."

"A wise wife will not hinder her husband's meaningful progress," she paused, continuing to display her fluent and clear eloquence. "The tragedy of living separation or death is an endless story. Jing, I hold no hope for this trip. I only hope that you will thrust your sharp knife into the heart of the demon—the King of Qin—then you will become a hero who will be remembered for generations..."

Jing Ke could only hear her choking sounds.

Jing Ke told her that the Prince of Yan had already prepared a pension for her.

She suddenly leaned on Jing Ke's shoulder, not hearing what Jing had said. She was just quietly, quietly listening to the surging waves of the Yi River. Then, with a fairly quick step, she turned behind the pavilion. Jing Ke followed, slightly quickening his pace:

"Lan, don't be sad!"

Turning past the hill, there was the torrential Yi River.

"Take care, Jing." A sound more mournful than the cuckoo's weeping flowed into Jing Ke's ears, and he heard even more shockingly:

"Do tong..."

"Lan!"

He ran frantically.

There was: a splash of water was gradually growing larger.

He stood there, gazing proudly at the distant two or three tents. Vaguely, he could hear the desolate sound of trumpets, like a mourning.

The sorrowful clouds looked even more bleak.

Dust rose on the road, along with the clatter of horses' hooves.

Coming were Prince Ju Wu, Gao Jianli, Qin Wuyang, and a few guards and servants.

"How could I trouble the Prince and the Grand Tutor to send me off so far? I am truly ashamed."

"Jing Qing is carrying a great mission this time. Our coming to see you off is not enough to express our respect and love." Saying this, he took Jing Ke's hand, and the group stepped into the pavilion.

"This is your deputy." The Prince pointed at Qin Wuyang and said to Jing Ke, "He is the most suitable person in the Yan kingdom."

Qin Wuyang, a young man in his early twenties, with a long face, clear black and white eyes, and a strong body.

Jing Ke enthusiastically went over and shook his hand:

"A healthy child!"

Servants brought up the prepared wine and dishes. The Prince first filled a cup full for Jing:

"This cup is dedicated to celebrating Jing Qing's victory!"

"This cup is one I offer on behalf of the people of the Yan kingdom to Jing Qing."

The elderly Ju Wu tremblingly held the wine in front of Jing Ke.

Cup after cup of wine was poured straight into his mouth. This was a rare occasion for him to drink so heartily. So he amplified his voice and sang:

"Autumn frost is cold, the grass and trees wither,
The Yan market is empty, wine cups shattered!
Upholding the great mansion alone, heaven and earth grieve!
The wind whistles, the Yi River is cold,
Once a warrior departs, he never returns!"

Gao Jianli, vaguely substituting his zither for musical instruments, accompanied Jing Ke's song, sending off such a gray dusk.

### Journey

— Zhang Hai

On the third day after leaving "Kulun," we reached "Sanger Dalai." The first thing that caught my eye was the lofty temple that shone with golden color under the sun, the supreme soul of these Mongolians: the dilapidated and small houses where the people lived, lined up around the majestic and magnificent temple. In the desert or on the plateau, Mongolian yurts seemed lovely, but here they went unnoticed. We strolled through the shops on the street, most of which were opened by Han Chinese, and their business was also more prosperous than those "Mongolian" shops managed by the "Mongolian government." Every time we entered a Han Chinese shop, we always asked questions. The old shopkeeper in a Han Chinese shop that specialized in selling "snuff bottles" told us that there was a Han Chinese painter in this place who specialized in painting various murals. The murals in the temples in Sanger Dalai and nearby places were all painted by that painter. He paints all year round, and the Mongols respect him very much because he can paint Buddha statues in addition to painting murals. In this barren land, "Sanger Dalai" can be considered a rare prosperous place.

With the lingering excitement of travel, we reluctantly said goodbye to "Sanger Dalai." Along the way, herds of gazelles followed us, so bold and unafraid of people, as if they wanted to spy on my secrets. When we arrived at "Heshuo Temple," we saw the magnificent palaces. More than two thousand lamas were chanting scriptures. We didn't stay long because, except for those few Lama tomb pagodas, nothing else really aroused our interest in admiring it.

In the evening, a strong wind rose, and we had no choice but to set up tents in the desert to spend the night. Disaster struck again! There was no water in the sandy desert. How could we cook without water! Everyone was very hungry, and couldn't hold on without eating something! So "Urjin" and "Nisetter" ran everywhere to find water, but in the end they came back with tired legs. Hunger, thirst, and melancholy were written on the faces of my travel companions. Let's be patient! Our stomachs were rumbling, the storm was pounding the tents, and sand was flying everywhere. No one slept peacefully that night. The sky dawned, and the wind was much less strong. When the sun came out, the desert returned to calm, and the storm retreated! We moved forward again.

At noon, we encountered a well on the prairie. Everyone was as happy as a convict who had been sentenced to death but was pardoned. So, we busily set up the pot, picked up dried dung (as fuel), and cooked noodles in the pot. Everyone gathered around the pot, eyes fixed on it. At that moment, I deeply understood how much a hungry person needs to eat! When the noodles were cooked, we ate them ravenously. After eating our fill, we went to the wooden trough next to the well to wash our faces and hands, vying for the first turn, which was extremely interesting.

Walking to a place, we encountered a "sand ridge," which we couldn't cross or detour around. After hesitating for a long time, we finally had no choice but to go to a nearby pasture to hire a local Mongolian. He led us around a short way, and we crossed the "sand ridge." Walking, we quickly arrived at "Guoerban Saiheng Mountain." Looking at it up close, it resembled an earthen mound. There were no trees or blades of grass on the mountain, only deep valleys where the accumulated snow had not completely melted. "Guoer" took a few photos here. After resting a little, we continued on, planning to reach "Shenbaitou" by nightfall.

"Shenbaitou" was a familiar place we visited again. After a night's delay, we decided to set off along the road to "Ningxia." The road was still flat. After walking sixty or seventy miles, we came to a well called "Bayin Chabbu" (meaning rich cellar). As we walked, we encountered another well, called "Baosuwu." The sky was clear and the ground was low-lying, and the climate gradually became warmer. We took off our leather coats. Along the way, the grasslands sprouted tender green buds, and the wild apricots were already budding. Next to the road, there was a kind of flower that was as red as brocade, with thorny branches and a height of two or three feet, whose name I didn't know. After several days of desert life, we were now back in the wilderness of red flowers and grasses, truly ecstatic, as if we had entered a paradise. That night, we stayed in "Bayin Heshuo."

Passing through the "Subuergan Mountain," with its strange peaks and protruding hills, we were presented with a sand dune resembling a steamed bun. In the distance, there were miscellaneous trees growing haphazardly, but even though there was warm sunlight shining on them at the moment, the branches were still bare. There was "sand onion" in the sand dunes, which was soft, tender, and delicious. Further ahead were mountains of high and low, uneven rocks, with paths in the concave valleys. On this section of the road, we encountered two wells, one in "Maolu Wusu" and the other at the end of the grassland, called "Budong Maowu." There were a few elm trees nearby, which were rare in the desert wilderness.

At "Holland Well," Hui started complaining that she was feeling unwell. We ignored her and continued on as usual. The flat road was gone. When we reached the "Chahan Uerha," which was full of white stones, there was a white mountain whose color was exactly the same as that of white lime. The weather here was getting even warmer. The yellow flowers of the wintergreen tree were in full bloom, with flower shapes like kidney beans and thick, fleshy petals. The wild elms had already shed their flowers, and tender leaf buds were sprouting. By the time we reached "Suhuai Hutu Mountain," Hui could no longer continue walking. Her whole body was burning with a fever. We stopped, set up a tent, and I made a bed for her to lie down. "Urjin" went to fetch water from the well.

Three days later, we left "Suhuai Hutu Mountain" and headed towards "Setagao."

Discussion

### Social Morality Problems in Shanghai

— Luo Caiqing

"Marriage is the best career for a woman." This statement may be overly humorous, or even insulting to women. I won't discuss it here, and it can't be fully discussed in this short piece. As things stand, there are thousands upon thousands of women who want to find the "best career" but cannot; and Nora, after leaving home, has still not been heard from.

However, apart from Hitler in Germany loudly calling for women to "return to the kitchen," most enlightened women have recklessly rushed into "the free world." Some work as typists in foreign firms, some work as clerks in department stores,...and other free occupations. This is naturally a welcome phenomenon. Unfortunately, these women's careers are all in the hands of devils. "The Traps of Great Shanghai" tell us that hiring female teachers is preparing to be the principal's wife, and recruiting female employees is a disguised prostitution escort agency. Others can be seen in social news at any time. So, when they can neither seek the "best career" nor fly in "the free world," what do they do?

According to the Shanghai Times: The Chinese Public Opinion Weekly published in this city mentioned the prosperity of the sex industry in Shanghai, which is particularly noteworthy. According to a survey conducted by Shanghai women's organizations in recent months, there are 349,744 women in the public concession, of whom about 25,000 are engaged in the sex industry; there are 277,300 women in the French concession. The concession has registered brothels, with a total of 390 registered brothels, and there are also 1,100 people who secretly prostitute themselves at any time. The father's survey proves that in one area of the central district of the public concession, there are as many as 10,000 people engaged in various sex industries, including about 1,400 people who frequent the entertainment venues of several major department stores on Nanjing Road, about 1,500 people who frequent various hotels in the central district, about 2,300 people who solicit customers along the street, about 800 people who frequent various parks in the summer, and more than 400 people who entice people on trams and in movie theaters. There are also about 100 special young girls who run to private residences... The report also mentions massage parlors, escort agencies, dance training schools, etc.

This number is probably not small, right? According to the report, "most of them are forced by their parents due to poverty." Naturally, those who are cold need clothes to wear, and those who are hungry need food to eat. Under the pressure of hunger and cold, countless women are forced onto this "way to make money."

This staggering problem does not seem to be something that can be solved with a few humorous remarks or a long sigh of "people's hearts are not what they used to be." Coincidentally, today (the 100th) the Chinese Women's Association is holding its annual charity banquet and dance at the Paramount Ballroom. The lively scene of dancing shadows and intertwined glasses can be predicted. However, can those ladies and wives spare a little time to think about the countless women who are struggling in the ditches in the cars on their way home after the banquet? Then it will be more than just "charity"!

### Editorial Intent

— Reporter

In the past, transportation was obstructed, and the Chinese people regarded travel as a daunting task. There was a saying, "Going a mile out is not as good as being at home," because at that time, water stations and mountain roads, boats and vehicles were slow and stagnant. Traversing the roads, the body and mind both felt pain, which was seen as dangerous obstacles. It was not surprising at first. Since the revolution, the Chinese people have gradually felt the fun of travel. However, at that time, transportation equipment was not yet perfect, and both time and money were wasted, while what was seen was very little. The group regarded it as something for wealthy officials and merchants to enjoy, and it was still not widespread among the masses. Until recently, highways and railways have become increasingly developed, travel equipment has become increasingly advanced, and there are even travel agencies that seek convenience for travelers (China Travel Service) and travel groups that seek organization for the masses (Yousheng Travel Group). Therefore, travelers can obtain great knowledge and experience at a very small cost. Therefore, travel is no longer an entertainment for a small number of people, but the only opportunity for ordinary people to increase their knowledge and cultivate their body and mind. This newspaper has always advocated travel. The footprints of colleagues are all over the world. If there is anything heard or seen, it must be published in the newspaper in order to awaken the attention of the Chinese people. The issuance of this special issue is also based on this intention. I hope readers will come forward and teach it.

### Red Lai Mountain Villa in West Lake

— Zhang Qichang

Spring returns to the world, and it is a time when everyone hopes to get in touch with nature, especially the general literati and those who hate the material prosperity; they are more willing to take advantage of the good time of peach and plum blossoms, and the breeze and sunshine, to take a short trip. The spring is bright and beautiful, and there are many places to go in Jiangnan, but Hangzhou is especially memorable, because she has a West Lake surrounded by mountains; for this reason, every spring, the ladies and gentlemen from all over the world who go to Hangzhou to play are always more than anywhere else. Almost everyone who visits West Lake knows where to go to play; naturally, there is no need to introduce it. Now, based on personal experience, I will introduce a good place that is not very noticeable, which is the "Red Lai Mountain Villa."

Take bus No. 4 on the Hangtong Road or Hangfu Road from Qixia - i.e. Xinshichang - and get off at Jingci Temple; climb the mountain on the road opposite the temple. The Red Lai Mountain Villa is above it. (If you take a yacht, you can also land in front of Jingci Temple.)

Red Lai Mountain Villa is a building with an antique flavor. The owner is a famous person from Guangdong. Because the owner does not live in it, it is open for tourists to visit. There are also people in the room to greet guests and prepare a West Lake specialty - tea - to show respect to guests.

Speaking of the terrain here, it is located on Nanping Mountain in the south of West Lake; in front of Jingci Temple: backing on the mountain and facing the lake, directly opposite the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, with Geling in sight, the entire West Lake is spread out before our eyes. There is an earthen mound on the right, which is the site of the Leifeng Pagoda with a long history. The mountain is not high, and the road is also flat. Flowers and trees are lush all around. When the sun is good, you can see countless flat boats rippling on the green water; at the same time, you can smell the fragrance of flowers among the grass and hear the birdsong on the branches. At this time, with a cup of clear tea, watching such scenery, it is simply unforgettable!

Suppose, in the case of a drizzle and a gentle breeze, this place is neither blown by the wind nor rained upon; at this time, if we look down, we can immediately see a rain scene that is different from usual and difficult to describe. Almost no tour boats can be found on the lake, and it seems to be shrouded in a light veil; the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Ruangong Pier, Huxin Pavilion and Memorial Tower are vaguely visible at the bottom of our eyes. They appear and disappear suddenly due to the size of the wind and rain! It is very quiet, only the Nanping bell sounds occasionally break the quiet air, but it soon disappears! I dare say that this scene is no less than the Yanyu Tower on Yuanjia Lake. At this time, if you are with a few close friends, cooking wine and talking, you may wonder "is this not the world"!

If the sky is clear after the rain, this natural picture will be even more delicate and beautiful, like a beauty emerging from a bath. At that time, if you walk to the back of the house - to see, there will be a unique and interesting picture in front of you, because there are not many roads below the house, and many peach trees are planted. At this time, many of the flowers that originally competed for beauty on the branches were knocked down by the wind and rain and scattered all over the ground, just like sprinkled with flower paper all over the ground. At this point, we can't help but think of Mr. Tao Yuanming's accurate description of falling flowers!

On a night with a bright moon, three or five stars, you can enjoy the moonlight and her reflection immersed in the bottom of the lake; in the distance, small red dots, neatly arranged on the west and north sides, are the street lights on Bai Causeway and Su Causeway; the lights in the east are brilliant, this is the lively market of Hangzhou - Qixia -.

### Scenery of Gusu

— Xiao Nan

A small piece of grassland turns from withered yellow to verdant green, and the tender branches and leaves of the weeping willows dance with the gentle breeze; the peach blossoms also compete with the plum blossoms to bloom their鮮𧰟flowers, making people intoxicated. Obviously, the curtain of spring has been opened before our eyes, and everything contains ardent vitality for people to appreciate.

### Hangzhou Itinerary

— A Xiang

Hangzhou has many famous scenic spots and historical sites. Tourists are often restricted by their affairs and cannot enjoy the tour. Now I propose a four-day itinerary for reference:

First day: Depart on an express train in the morning and arrive in Hangzhou at about 12 o'clock. First find a hotel (hotels near the lake and inside West Lake are recommended), then have lunch. After lunch, go to the lake, first to Huxin Pavilion, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Ruangong Pier, Baiyun Nunnery, and Wangzhuang. Then go ashore at Su Causeway to visit Huagangguanyu and Sudi Chunxiao. Then take a boat to Xiling Bridge to pay homage to Su Xiaoxiao's tomb, Qiu Jin's tomb, Wu Song's tomb, Xiling Seal Society, and Sun Yat-sen Public Garden. (At this time, you can order the boatman to wait at Pinghu Qiuyue) Then cross Gushan, visit Lin Chushi's tomb, Fanghe Pavilion, and Feng Xiaoqing's tomb. From here, go to Pinghu Qiuyue. After resting and drinking tea, return to the hotel by the original boat.

Second day: Hire a rickshaw, the price is about two yuan, first go to Huanglong Cave (at this point, order the rickshaw puller to wait empty-handed at Yue's tomb) and then cross Wanling Back Mountain to Yue Wang Temple. After the tour, take the original car to Yuhuangguanyu, then have lunch at Lingyin. After a short rest after lunch, continue to visit Feilai Peak, Yixiantian, Lengquan Pavilion, and then hire a sedan chair from here to climb Taoguang. Return in the original sedan chair, then go to Beigaofeng and Tiantianzhu and return.

Third day: Take a sedan chair to climb Yuhuang Mountain, visit Zilai Cave, and watch the scenic spots such as the Qixinggang. Cross the back mountain to Siyan Well, Shiwu Cave, Shuile Cave, Yanxia Cave, and Lian Temple. (At this time, you can have lunch at any of the above places) After lunch, walk to Jiuxi Tea Factory, Liuhe Pagoda, and the Qiantang River Bridge project. Then go to Hupao to rest, and then go to Jingci Temple, Honglaishanfang, and the Leifeng Pagoda site.

Fourth day: Hire a car to visit Yunlou, and the original car to Jiuxi Shiba Stream. At this time, order the car to go back and agree on a time to wait at Longjing) After that, walk through Shiba Stream to Longjing Temple for lunch. After lunch, return to the hotel, and in the afternoon, visit Wushan (i.e. Chenghuang Mountain), and then go to Qinghefang to buy Hangzhou specialties and take the evening train back to Shanghai.

When the clouds rise, the whole mountain is full of clouds, some in front of the building, some at the foot, sometimes you can't see the opposite things at all, and sometimes the mountains only show the tips of the peaks, like isolated islands in the sea.

Zheng Zhenduo's Random Notes in the Mountains

You can take a trip to Suzhou during a short vacation. It only takes a day to enjoy the famous scenic spots of Wu Gate, so you don't need to bring luggage except for an essential camera. In addition to sightseeing, you can also enjoy the famous Suzhou cuisine. Suzhou's food is recognized everywhere.

Many highways have been built near Suzhou, and cars can reach directly. If you plan to go to the mountains for a day, it will take only an hour to travel from Suzhou to Mu Du. After arriving at Lingyan, hire a sedan to Tianping Mountain, which takes only half an hour. There are many strange rocks on the mountain, including Chuanshan Cave, Dragon Head Stone, Toad Stone, and Fishing Stone. The most famous is Yixiantian. If you are a little fat, you have to go sideways. There is also good spring water on that side. Baiyun Spring is a famous spring in Suzhou. Fan Wenzheng Gong's tomb and ancestral hall are also nearby. After visiting Tianping Mountain and returning to Lingyan Mountain for lunch, then the Shijia Restaurant in Mudu is a must-eat. It is authentic Suzhou cuisine with a homely taste. Although the place is not big, it is very clean and elegant. You can eat all kinds of seasonal dishes, drunken shrimp, carp soup, broad beans, and laggong, which are fresh and delicious and unmatched anywhere.

Mr. Yu Youren once wrote a couplet there and gave it to them, which proves that their food is good.

After a full meal, one can stroll through the mountains without the need for a sedan chair. It is the former residence of the King of Wu, so there are many historical sites, such as the Xishi Cave, Wu Wang Well, Qintai Terrace, Wanhua Pond, and Caixiang Stream. There is also the tomb of Han Shizhong, a national hero of the Song Dynasty, which is worth a visit. If there is still time in the afternoon, one can go to Huqiu Hill. It is not as high as Tianping or Lingyan, but there are still many historical sites. It is said that King Helu of Wu was buried here, and famous sites include the Sword Pond, Test Sword Stone, Thousand-Man Stone, Nodding Stone, and the tomb of Zhen Niang. This way, a day will pass quickly.

The next day, one can visit the famous scenic spots near the city, such as the Xiyuan Garden, Liuyuan Garden, and Qingyang Land. In the city, there are the Lion Grove Garden and Canglang Pavilion. Because the streets are narrow, cars cannot enter the city, but rickshaws are sufficient for transportation. For lunch, you can go to Songhelou Restaurant in Guanqian Street. This is the only reputable restaurant in Suzhou, because the people of Suzhou are very particular about food. Whether it's meat or vegetarian dishes, they all have special flavors without any spicy stimulation, which is more suitable for the taste of southerners.

"Yuanmiao Guan" is worth a visit, similar to the City God Temple in Shanghai. In particular, it can be introduced that there are very good snacks inside, such as spare ribs, squid, and sweet fermented rice dumplings. In short, there are many delicious things that cannot be described one by one. When returning, you can purchase some Suzhou specialties, such as the soy sauce meat from Lugaocun and Sanzhenzhai. You can also buy soy sauce chicken and duck from Ma Yongzhai, and miscellaneous foods can be bought from Caizhizhai, such as stir-fried melon seeds, preserved plum peel, etc., which are unmatched elsewhere. Therefore, if you want a place that can both satisfy your eyes and your appetite, then this is the only choice.

Keep this icy, snowy quality, and do not follow the extravagance of the landscape. Zeng Xi, Meiyuan, Wuxi

Please turn back vulgar drivers, lest you be mocked by the mountain spirits. The Mountain Gate of Xuelang Mountain in Wuxi
