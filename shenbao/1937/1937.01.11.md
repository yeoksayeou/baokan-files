### Unprecedented Great Fire at Xidan Commercial Center in Beiping

Nearly 900 New and Old Stores Destroyed, Building and Merchandise Losses Total 2.6 Million Yuan, Authorities Investigate Disaster Situation and Prepare Relief Efforts

[Beiping] A major fire broke out at the Xidan Commercial Center in Beiping at 1:40 am on the 10th. The fire spread very quickly, and by around 4:00 am, the entire new and old centers had been burned down. The embers had not completely extinguished as of 7:00 pm this afternoon. The total building loss amounted to 200,000 yuan. The loss of merchandise has not yet been fully reported by the burned-out merchants, and there is no accurate statistic, but it is roughly estimated at 2-3 million yuan. This is unprecedented in Beiping in decades. According to those who escaped from the fire, there was a strong wind last night, and the weather suddenly turned cold. There were few visitors to the commercial center. The merchants closed their doors around 11:00 pm. Suddenly, at 1:40 am, a fire broke out. At that time, the watchmen of the commercial center and the police shouted along the doors. The people in each shop woke up in alarm and fled in confusion. The fire had already spread in all directions, and dense smoke filled the air. Its momentum was extremely fierce and quickly spread throughout the new and old centers. Therefore, the point of origin of the fire has remained unknown. According to mutual rumors among the people in the commercial center, it was approximately (1) the New Guangdong Restaurant, located on the southeast border of the old commercial center and the new commercial center; (2) the Itodani Commercial Residence in the new commercial center; (3) the Wu Ji Western Clothing stall in the old commercial center. The authorities were still detaining and questioning the watchmen of the commercial center as of yesterday. At 2:05 am, Fire Chief Bai Laizeng, upon receiving the report, led the entire fire brigade, teams 1, 2, 3, and 4, to the scene and distributed four fire engines at the four gates of the commercial center, with two fire engines outside the west gate, one in the Tangzi Hutong south of the commercial center, and one at the west end of Taipusi Street behind the commercial center. The team members were deployed to extinguish the fire, but because the fire was discovered a little late, the fire was too fierce, and the extinguishing was ineffective. At exactly 3:00 am, the flames from the northwest of the Yimao store to the southwest of the Wangmao store and behind the Fubinglou all soared into the sky, and it was impossible to approach. Bai Laizeng immediately ordered the firebreaks to be intensified to prevent the fire from spreading. Later, Chen Jiqing, Director of the Public Security Bureau, happened to be at the residence of Mayor Qin Dechun of Beiping. Upon hearing the report, he rushed to the scene, together with Inspector Qian Zongchao, Director Zhu Yuezhi of the Third District, and Captain Han Xiuting of the Third Security Team, to supervise the police and security teams in setting up posts and guarding the fire site. A company of infantry from the 29th Army stationed at the 物檀 Temple also arrived to set up posts. Traffic was cut off from Xidan Archway to Ganshiqiao. At that time, the north wind had not stopped, and the fire took advantage of the wind to surge into the clouds. The electric light company temporarily stopped the current north of Xidan, and the electric lights were completely dimmed, but the fire was still shining brightly. The streets and alleys around the commercial center were all covered in a deep red glow. The situation was tragic. The embers flew south with the wind, like stars in the sky, falling everywhere. Merchants and residents near the commercial center rushed to salvage their belongings, and the situation was tense and chaotic. Because the fire hose of the fire brigade leaked water in many places, shooting water was extremely difficult. Xidan North Street was full of water leaks. The residence of former Prime Minister Wang Shiling in front of Tangzi Hutong and the back of the Yijiao Girls' Middle School, adjacent to the commercial center, were in a dangerous situation due to the chaotic falling of embers. After the fire brigade watered them in advance and demolished the back of Wang's residence, they were finally preserved. Merchants and residents who escaped from the commercial center and its vicinity temporarily took refuge in Tangzi Hutong. The fire gradually died down at 4:00 am. The telegraph pole in front of the West Bureau of Telephones across from Yimao Store was baked by the fire. After being extinguished, it was spared demolition. The fire scene was mostly extinguished by 6:00 am this morning. The military police stationed there slightly withdrew, and the fire brigade continued to extinguish the embers, which had not been extinguished all day. As of 7:00 pm this afternoon, smoke was still emitting continuously. The trolley cars north of Xidan were all stopped, and the ground was covered with swimming pools. Lei Sishang, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, made a special visit to inspect at around 8:00 am this morning. He will investigate the losses with the Public Security Bureau and prepare appropriate relief measures. Because the fire was too intense at the time of the outbreak, the authorities thought that some merchants in the venue might have been in distress. Because the investigation takes time, no accurate number has been found yet. According to the investigation by the Public Security Bureau, the accurate number of losses in this fire is as follows: The new commercial center burned a total of 470 rooms, with a construction cost of 400,000 yuan. The venue was built by Rongyi Company, owned by Wan Fulin, commander of the 53rd Army. After the venue was damaged, Wan was telegraphed. Because the venue had fire insurance of 150,000 yuan with Yongdian Company in Tianjin, the company has been reported and asked to investigate the credit. Investigators can be sent to Ping tomorrow. The venue has 54 merchants and 140 stalls. The amount of lost goods is being registered by the Second District by notifying the affected merchants, because the shopkeepers and stall owners fled after the fire. The old commercial center burned a total of 400 rooms, with a construction cost of 200,000 yuan. The venue was built by the owner of the New Guangdong Restaurant, and it has a basic property fire insurance of 100,000 yuan with a certain insurance company, and is also contacting the company to request compensation. The venue has a total of 200 shops, 60 merchants, and 150 stalls. The amount of lost goods is also being registered by the Second District. In the midst of the chaotic situation, an apprentice from Yimao Store went missing. Wang Yulin, the shopkeeper of Qianfu Leather Shoes Store, who was about 30 years old and from Tianjin, was burned on his face, head, back, and limbs because he was slow to escape. He was rescued by the police and sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. His injuries are quite serious. (10th Dispatch)

[Beiping] This morning, a fire broke out in the large market in Beiping's West City, with losses amounting to 1 million yuan. The market is one of the main commercial markets in Beiping, with various shops occupying an area of approximately 30,000 square feet. It is said that around 2:00 am this morning, the watchman of the market discovered the fire. The fire brigade quickly arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire, but because the wind was too strong, it spread very quickly. As a result, approximately 200 shops were destroyed. As of this evening, the fire had not been completely extinguished. As for whether there were any casualties, it is currently unknown. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

[Beiping] A fire broke out in the middle street of the Xidan Commercial Center in Beiping at around 2:00 am on the 10th. Because a north wind was raging, it quickly spread throughout the venue. The fire brigade was dispatched upon hearing the news, and the authorities sent military police to the scene to maintain order. It was not extinguished until 6:00 am, but the venue, which was known as Beiping's second-largest commercial center, had become a wasteland. When the fire broke out, all the shop assistants in the shopping mall were awakened from their dreams. They rushed out without even putting on clothes, causing cries to be heard everywhere on Xidan Street, which was extremely miserable. In order to maintain order, the authorities temporarily cut off traffic in the area around the commercial center, which gradually resumed at noon. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, and the number of casualties is also difficult to know. It is estimated that more than 500 large and small shops were burned, and the loss of all the real estate is approximately 2 million yuan. The loss of goods is even greater. The authorities are currently investigating the true cause of the fire, and because this fire was too great and the market is sluggish, it will be difficult to restore it to its original state in the short term. Therefore, they plan to provide special relief to maintain commercial difficulties regarding the aftermath. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)

According to reliable sources, the autopsy results will reveal that the girl's body was blurred with flesh and blood, not entirely due to wild dog bites, but was actually killed in the house and then abandoned in a deep ditch. Currently, the investigation of this case is being fully handled by Director Han of the Southeast District Police Department in Pingdi. The missing items of the girl, including a bicycle, roller skates, hat, coat, and all underwear, have not yet been found. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain and Fascist Countries㊂

— British Member of Parliament Strabolgi Translated by Jin Tunan

Regarding the difficult question of returning German colonies, especially in Africa, we do not believe that there are no secret understandings. This summer, the Minister of Defense of the United Nations of South Africa, Mr. Pirow, was hired in London. After returning to South Africa, he publicly stated that important figures in Britain told him that British policy would support Germany's demands for territory in Africa. Mr. Pirow's statement obviously changed a claim.

Sir Vansittart, one of the most important figures in London, is the leader of the permanent officials of the Foreign Office. His wife and Mrs. Phipps (wife of the British Ambassador to Germany) are sisters. Mr. Vansittart has always been pro-French, until this summer.

Between July and August this year, he went to Berlin publicly in a private capacity and stood next to Hitler to watch the World Games. He and various official and unofficial German diplomats, such as Führer Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Neurath, did not discuss sports issues, and his purpose was to approach these important diplomats. We must note that since Mr. Pirow's visit to London, the sanctions policy against Italy has been lifted. Since Mr. Vansittart arrived in Ganlin, Germany's emphasis on recovering its former colonies or ceding territories of a tropical and semi-tropical colonial nature has also changed.

In this way, the turmoil of having colonies has been ceded to the idea of a perfect solution to this matter.

Within the British Conservative Party, there are still some powerful figures who, regardless of Germany or other countries' political system, fiercely oppose using British territory to satisfy the needs of Germany or other countries. You are unwilling to abandon even an inch or foot of colonial protectorate mandate territory. These people are ardent imperialists, awakened by the late Joseph Chamberlain.

The sponsors of this Birmingham policy now include Austen Chamberlain (the half-brother of Finance Minister Chamberlain) and former Cabinet Minister Amery. Both of them are representatives of Birmingham in the British Parliament.

Before the long parliamentary recess reopened, the House of Commons openly launched a fierce attack on the cabinet, demanding confirmation that the government's foreign negotiations did not include the issue of British territory, and demanding an explanation that the government did not discuss this issue. All parties were dissatisfied with this powerful part of the main British party. Regardless of how the general leaders of the British government put it, they always believed that there had been a gentleman's agreement on the colonial issue.

Now let us look at the recent events in Spain again. According to international law, the status of this chaotic area is very clear. Regardless of its merits or demerits, or the complexity of the situation, there is only one Spanish government recognized internationally. It has diplomatic representatives in countries around the world. It requests and repays a special kind of assistance in the diplomatic relations of friendly countries, which is obviously an obligation that all countries should fulfill. There will be no question of neutrality. As for imposing an arms embargo, that is an unfriendly act.

Furthermore, providing arms, money, and other assistance to the rebels to oppose the Spanish government recognized by all countries is clearly an act of aggression. The governments of Italy and Germany have committed this act of aggression before and after the outbreak of the rebellion. The British government's initial attitude was correct. The Spanish Navy transported arms and the like to the Strait of Gibraltar in the name of the government, and was not actually hindered, although this investigation was not easy. The government's tendency is to observe so-called strict neutrality between the two conflicting groups; however, this is not allowed to be distinguished between the recognized government and the rebels.

The French government and the majority of the French Parliament wanted to directly help the Spanish government, which was a completely legal action; however, French Prime Minister Lebrun hesitated, partly because he hoped for a universal agreement not to supply arms to either side, and partly because he doubted Britain's attitude.

This delay has benefited the rebels' pseudo-helpers. However, as mentioned above, if fascist Spain unites with the fascist group in Europe, it will pose a major danger to the British Empire. The British government's cold attitude towards France and its lack of goodwill towards the Spanish government are difficult to explain unless it is assumed that British politics are considering changes. If Britain does not want to join the fascist group, then the victory of the Spanish rebels will cause Britain to suffer many dangers.

After occupying East Africa, Italy has many things to be done, and Germany has not yet fully completed its rearmament. It is not easy to imagine that they would suddenly take the dangerous measure of assisting the Spanish rebels without first measuring Britain's attitude.

In fact, this action violates Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, which is clearly an act of aggression. We have not forgotten the difficulties that Britain suffered during the American Civil War.

Therefore, if the Spanish government can win victory, in theory, we can use the entire League of Nations mechanism to demand compensation for damages, enforce the payment of damages, or other compensation through sanctions or other methods. In short, this action by Germany and Italy cannot be deeply believed by observers familiar with the current situation without some secret understanding from Britain, or at least an understanding with a part of the British government that controls the final policy.

If Baldwin, MacDonald, and Chamberlain, this gang, maintain their power in the British cabinet, a secret agreement between Britain and Germany will be completed immediately.

Looking at it this way, Britain really no longer needs to boast of being a bridge between Germany and France. Things will inevitably have new changes soon, and it is not easy for us to predict its final outcome now.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Japan Strengthens Foreign Exchange Control

— Yu

On the 8th of this month, the Japanese Ministry of Finance issued an order to strengthen foreign exchange management. The main point is to strictly control the buying and selling of foreign exchange and restrict the payment of import prices. This extraordinary measure can be said to be an inevitable result of the current stage of the Japanese economic crisis.

Since Japan has stepped up the implementation of its so-called "active policy," it has fallen into a very precarious situation internally. In particular, the emptiness of funds is the biggest blow to the economy and finance. Because the military industry has deprived general production enterprises, making normal reproduction impossible to promote, and all useful funds have been almost entirely consumed on unproductive military preparations. At the same time, the excess of imports over exports has increased dramatically, and cash has continued to flow out, further shaking the foundation of the financial market. According to statistics, the excess of imports over exports in the previous year was 14.758 million yuan, and last year it reached 130.175 million yuan, an increase of tenfold. The gold paid abroad last year reached a huge 250 million yuan. This is definitely not something that poor Japan can sustain. In order to continue to strengthen its so-called "national defense" and implement its so-called "quasi-wartime system," it is absolutely necessary to preserve cash. The recent announcement of the huge budget for Showa 11 concretely reflects Japan's urgent need for funds.

The basic function of the newly issued order to strengthen exchange management is to control the inflow and outflow of funds. The Ministry of Finance's main intention is to reduce the outflow of funds by restricting foreign exchange payments. At the same time, it also wants to reduce the import of general commodities by restricting imports and focus on importing military supplies and military raw materials in trade, in order to carry out its consistent policy of military expansion. However, we cannot be optimistic for the Japanese authorities. The aforementioned laws obviously have many contradictions. First, to reduce the excess of imports over exports or eliminate the excess of imports over exports and turn to an excess of exports over imports, in addition to restricting imports, it is also necessary to increase exports. However, the current world market does not allow Japan to move freely. It is said that among the 127 countries that have trade relations with Japan, as many as 74 countries are boycotting Japanese goods. It can be seen that the future of Japan's export trade is over. Second, Japan is extremely lacking in raw material production. Since the military industry is expanding endlessly, the import of raw materials will naturally also increase endlessly. If this situation does not change, Japan will eventually become like Germany at present, exhausting its foreign exchange funds.

Naturally, the final means can also be to adopt direct currency inflation. But this means will instead promote the accelerated collapse of the Japanese economy. It can be asserted. Domestically, currency inflation will only make the people more impoverished and strengthen the revolutionary factors. At the very least, it will reduce the people's ability to bear taxes and absorb public bonds, making tax policies and public bond policies more bankrupt. As far as foreign countries are concerned, the method of exchange dumping may no longer be as profitable as in the past. How can the fragile Japanese yen withstand a blow from the joint front of British, American, and French currencies?

In short, the Japanese economy has reached its most critical stage. Strengthening exchange management can at most alleviate the economic crisis for a while. Looking at the chaotic situation of the Japanese exchange rate in the past day or two, where even no one cared about it, the currency inflation in the future may still be difficult to avoid.

Here, let us imagine our own situation again. We cannot forget that China is the most direct target under the "active policy." Economically speaking, the goods that Japan encounters obstacles elsewhere will surely flood into China like a flood. At the same time, China's raw materials will also be massively loaded away by Japan. In this situation, can we not actively plan for self-defense?

### Berlin Denies German Troops Opening Morocco

Still Cannot Eliminate French Fear, Curb Foreign Intervention in West Inner Strife, Britain Prepares to Take Concrete Action

[Paris] Today, responsible circles in France said that the continuous influx of Germans into Spanish Moroccan territory has caused a very serious situation. Berlin's denial of the existence of German troops in Morocco has increased public anxiety. According to a concrete statement here, the German presence in Morocco is a serious threat to France's defense deployment, because this deployment is based on unimpeded transportation in North Africa and is completely unrelated to the Spanish Civil War. The French government is now closely discussing this matter with the British government, which is a great comfort to the French government. It is heard that the British government has decided to take concrete action at the end of this month to curb foreign intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Even if it cannot be completely stopped, it intends to seek to prevent it from worsening. It is rumored that British Foreign Secretary Eden is currently planning to convene a six-nation conference in order to reach a compromise on reversing the danger of foreign intervention in the Spanish Civil War. There is no way to confirm this statement yet. However, it is generally believed that senior commanders from Britain and France may hold military talks. At the same time, according to an article published by the German News Agency, the German government has made its first official denial of the stationing of German troops in Spain or Spanish Morocco. It is said that because various foreign newspapers have spread various news of German troops entering Spanish Morocco, the News Agency has been specially instructed to declare that no German troops have arrived in Spain or Spanish Morocco. Berlin political circles claim that this news is continued by someone to poison international relations and is the product of the oversensitive. When the German denial was announced, the German government's press released an editorial with changing foreign communications, which was contrary to what was previously said about the Spanish Incident being the result of the work of the International Bolshevik Party. Today, the newspaper mentioned the incident as a civil war and said that the only way to end the Spanish tragedy is to return to the natural starting point, which is to recognize that the war in Spain is a purely internal affair of the Spanish people.

### French Government Negotiates with the West

Based on the Morocco Treaty, Please Pay Attention to German Military Activities

[Paris] Regarding the issue of German activities in Spanish Morocco, it is rumored that the French government has made representations to the Western National Military government. According to responsible sources, this is not the case. However, French Resident General in Morocco, General Noguès, has instructed the French Consul in Tetouan (the capital of Spanish Morocco) to make representations to the Spanish High Commissioner in Morocco based on the 1904 and 1912 Franco-Spanish treaties, instructing him to pay attention to the stationing of German troops in Spanish Morocco, which violates the provisions of these treaties. This representation will be made this afternoon or tomorrow. (9th Havas Dispatch)

### German Forces Invade Northern Africa, France Issues Strong Warning

Naval Exercises to be Conducted in the Mediterranean; Close Military Cooperation Between Britain and France

[Paris] France has warned Germany that if it sends more troops to Spanish Morocco, France may also have to consider military action. A foreign ministry spokesperson told an Associated Press reporter today that France currently has no special military operations in Morocco, but may consider them if Germany increases its troops. The spokesperson also said that (London has been consulted, hoping to change the policy of Italian and German intervention in Spanish affairs. In the naval ports of Brest and Toulon, 74 warships are preparing for secret exercises in the Mediterranean. Government officials still insist that these exercises are routine and not intended to intimidate Germany. However, according to London sources, France has suggested to Britain that they conduct joint naval demonstrations in Spanish Morocco, but Britain has rejected this proposal, saying that the government does not yet believe the situation has become serious enough to warrant demonstrations. The departure date and route of the French warships are currently being kept secret, but it is understood that the 38 ships of the Atlantic Fleet will exercise off the coast of Casablanca and Agadir, while the six ships of the Toulon Fleet will exercise near Corsica, off the French coast. It is reported that General Noguès, the French resident-general in Morocco, will arrive here on the 15th of this month to discuss "all matters concerning Morocco," and that Defense Minister Daladier will lead staff members to Morocco within a week to inspect defenses. Daladier's trip is a direct result of Germany's troop deployments. At the same time, Navy Minister Darlan will also inspect naval ports near "dangerous locations" in Morocco. Officials deny reports that France has sent 100,000 troops to North Africa, saying that France currently has no intention of intervening militarily in Spanish Morocco and will not allow the situation there to develop to any extent for which it is responsible. One report says that the French Atlantic Fleet, currently cruising in the South Atlantic, may change its route to the Mediterranean, leading some to believe that France may insist on a joint Anglo-French naval blockade of the Spanish coast in order to enforce the neutrality agreement. A government spokesman further stated that France will not allow Germany to establish military bases in Morocco. Recently, many Germans have immigrated to French territory in North Africa. Ordinarily, Germans cannot transfer capital abroad, but in North Africa, they can buy property, and the number of Germans enlisting in the French Foreign Legion has also increased sharply, so the foreign ministry is very concerned that a conflict could lead to serious problems. However, the head of the foreign intelligence department, Mr. Guo Mei, still calls the rumors that France is prepared to take military action against Germany in Morocco unfounded. (National Telegram, 9th)

[London] French Ambassador Corbin called on Foreign Secretary Eden in the afternoon to exchange views on the replies submitted by Germany and Italy, in order to maintain close contact between Britain and France on the issue of banning volunteers from going to Spain. In addition, Eden and Corbin also discussed the issue of German activities in Spanish Morocco. As a result, it is possible that the naval vessels of Britain and France stationed in Moroccan waters may cooperate in some way. According to recent news from Morocco, another batch of German troops will soon arrive in Spanish Morocco, where barracks have been prepared to house them. This news is quite disturbing. The British and French governments are now exchanging information, and any suspicious actions in Morocco will be reported by the naval vessels of both countries stationed in Moroccan waters to their respective navies via wireless radio, and the two governments will notify each other. As for the rumors that the two governments have ordered their warships to take coercive action in Moroccan waters, both countries here deny them. (Havas, 9th)

Casablanca: Although news is strictly censored in Spanish Morocco, it has been learned here today that there are indeed 300 German soldiers in Manlila, and a smaller team of German soldiers in Boar Aiten near Gouda. The German cruiser "Spee" is stationed near Tangier. General Noguès, the French resident-general in Morocco, told an Associated Press reporter that France is prepared to deal with any unexpected event and can defend its treaty rights in Morocco without firing a single shot. (National Telegram, 9th)

### British Government Issues Second Note

Addressed to Italy, Germany, and Three Other Countries, Urging Non-Intervention in Spain

[London] News today that Britain will send notes to Italy, Germany, Russia, and Portugal tomorrow, requesting a ban on the further dispatch of volunteers to Spain. It is understood that the note will suggest setting a date this month and using international controls to ban volunteers from entering Spain. (National Telegram, 9th)

[London] It has been learned that the British government will send notes to Germany, Italy, France, Russia, and Portugal tomorrow, with four objectives: ㊀ To confirm that each country has accepted in principle the ban on volunteers going to Spain; ㊁ To inquire when and how each country can implement the ban; ㊂ To notify each country of the measures that Britain itself will take. On this point, the British government will promulgate the "Foreign Enlistment Act" next week, prohibiting people from volunteering to serve in Spain, with violators subject to imprisonment; ㊃ Regarding the monitoring of indirect intervention (such as the dispatch of volunteers), Britain does not intend to propose any other plans in response to the demands of Germany and Italy, but only to express that Britain is prepared to accept all the suggestions of the London Adjustment Committee. Observers generally hope that after Britain takes the lead in expressing sincerity and fairness to set an example regarding the issue of banning volunteers, the countries concerned, especially Germany and Italy, can quickly adopt legislative procedures to follow suit. (Havas, 9th)

[London] The "Sunday Referee" reported today that it "learned" that Prime Minister Baldwin suggested that if the interference of various countries in the Spanish Civil War cannot be stopped immediately, the Navy Department should draft a plan to blockade the entire coast of Spain, and the Cabinet has approved the Prime Minister's suggestion. (National Telegram, 9th)

[London] Cabinet members held meetings on Saturday and diplomats visited each other frequently. It is widely believed that this is due to the British authorities' awareness of the increasing potential for international disputes in Spain, leading to new suggestions to prevent trouble. Diplomatic visitors now expect Lord Plymouth, chairman of the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War, to propose a new plan at the committee's meeting on Wednesday, abandoning the current monitoring system and replacing it with a detailed plan including provisions for dealing with air transport and volunteers. Newspapers in France and Germany have been attacking each other for days about rumors of German activities in Spanish Morocco, creating a sharp atmosphere. (Reuters, 10th)

### French Newspapers Attack German Military Actions

Claiming They Will Lead to Serious Consequences; German Newspapers Denounce Them as Deliberate Slander

[Paris] Newspapers continue to comment on the landing of German troops in Spanish Morocco. Le Petit Parisien wrote, "The troops stationed in the French territories of Algeria and Morocco in North Africa can be mobilized at any time, and the British fleet stationed in the Strait of Gibraltar has not been transferred elsewhere. If Germany's dangerous actions continue without restraint, the country will encounter a strong resistance." Le Journal wrote, "What we value is maintaining the status quo in the Mediterranean. Italy has already established a Mediterranean agreement with Britain, so why should it be otherwise? The relationship between Britain and France has now reached completion, as can be seen from the fact that the naval departments of each country have begun to exchange information." L'Écho de Paris wrote that the French Consul General in Tetouan, the capital of Spanish Morocco, issued a warning and protest to the Spanish Moroccan High Commissioner this morning. The significance of this move is very clear: France has the power to make people respect its rights, and Britain has supported it. If we continue to shirk responsibility at this time, it will inevitably lead to serious consequences." Madame Tabouis, a famous reporter for L'Œuvre, declared, "The continued encroachment of German labor into Spanish Rio de Oro in North Africa is obvious. This place was originally a haven for fugitives. All the leaders of bandits and rebels who have not yet surrendered and those who are hostile to French colonial policy have hidden here. The Germans love to go there to organize, arm, and train them, and help them build defenses, so that in the event of an incident, they can cut off the connection between French Morocco and French West Africa. In addition, Germans are actively operating in Portuguese islands off the coast of West Africa, such as Cape Verde, Funchal, and Madeira, and establishing oil depots to store heavy oil and gasoline. It is said that a batch of German engineers and technicians will soon go to the Spanish Canary Islands to work." (Havas, 10th)

[Berlin] Newspapers are strongly attacking the news reported by French newspapers about the German army's deployment to Spanish Morocco in North Africa, apparently at the instigation of the authorities. The Volksbeobachter wrote, "It is said that Germany has a planned uprising in Spanish Morocco in order to offset the soothing psychology of world opinion. French journalists who are familiar with the country's foreign ministry have actually fabricated this clumsy news. What about their vaunted French wisdom?" The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung wrote, "Trying to attribute all responsibility to Germany is a childish act." The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung wrote, "The reason why France is stirring up anti-German sentiment is that the replies submitted by the German and Italian governments on the issue of banning volunteers from serving in Spain have made a strong impression on fair-minded people in France. In order to shift this impression, French newspapers have fabricated false news to slander Germany." (Havas, 10th)

### Internal Disagreements in Germany on the Spanish Question

Army Commander-in-Chief Advocates Caution, Even Willing to Resign to Advocate His Position

[London] According to reports from Berlin correspondents of Parisian newspapers, Hitler currently has serious disagreements with the army and navy authorities on the Spanish question. It is said that Defense Minister General von Blomberg and Army Commander-in-Chief General von Fritsch, among others, are greatly displeased with Hitler for opposing the plan to assist General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist forces. (Reuters, 10th)

[Berlin] Führer Hitler is spending his vacation in Berchtesgaden and is scheduled to return to Berlin this Sunday. Previously, it was generally speculated that during Hitler's absence from the capital, the German government would temporarily "ceasefire" in diplomatic terms, but observers generally believe that this speculation is incorrect. In the first few days of the new year, the German cruiser "Königsberg" was very active in Spanish waters, and at the end of last year, General Faupel, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Burgos, Spain, returned to Germany to meet with Hitler in Berchtesgaden and personally told him that if he wanted to capture Madrid, Germany would have to send an expeditionary force of 60,000 troops to join the Nationalist forces. Later, rumors suddenly spread that General von Fritsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, had resigned. It was said that General von Fritsch believed that the German army's activities in Spain would inevitably lead to war, which would be a mistake for the country and the German army, so he was willing to resign to advocate his position. At the same time, people in upper-class society revealed the opinions of senior military authorities, believing that "Germany currently lacks food, and if it launches a war at this time, it will inevitably have to implement a food rationing system. If so, the war will inevitably fail." Later, military circles predicted that Führer Hitler would allow Fritsch to resign and replace him with General Reichenau, but in the end, Hitler accepted the advice of military advisors and allowed more flexibility, and did not send an expeditionary force to Spain to assist in the war, but only sent members of the National Socialist Party's paramilitary Schutzstaffel and special forces, carrying military supplies, to Spain. As for the German government's attitude towards Spain in the future, it will depend on the following two situations: ㊀ What is the response of various countries to the German government's reply on January 7 (regarding the issue of banning volunteers)? ㊁ Can the Nationalist forces capture Madrid, as Germany hopes? (Havas, 9th)

### Spanish Rebel Forces Continue Fierce Assault on the Capital

Adopting a Concentrated Tactics; Heavy Losses; Garrison Resists Calmly Without Dispiritedness

Madrid: The Nationalist forces launched a fierce attack on the capital yesterday and today, but the offensive has weakened somewhat due to the government forces' desperate resistance. The Nationalist forces are adopting a concentrated offensive tactic, and their losses have been quite heavy. Overall, the Nationalist forces are quite familiar with modern warfare methods, and the equipment they use is the latest type. For example, when the Nationalist aircraft bomb at night, they often launch rockets to observe the ground conditions before dropping bombs. Also, before the rebel artillery bombarded this afternoon, the planes first dropped smoke bombs on the target to aid in aiming. Instances like this are too numerous to list. (Havas, 9th)

Madrid: Special dispatch from our reporter: Although fierce fighting has taken place in the suburbs of Madrid in the past week, the government forces have resisted calmly and have not been dispirited. The strategy adopted by the Nationalist forces is to feign a retreat to lure the enemy forward in an attempt to win a quick victory, but the government forces have carefully observed and have not penetrated deeply. All positions that could not be defended in time were abandoned. The places recaptured by the Nationalist forces last Sunday were these kinds of places. As for the government's militia in the area of Aravaca in the northwest suburbs, they fought extremely fiercely and even broke through the Nationalist trenches, which was very successful. At present, the road from Madrid to the city of El Escorial has indeed been cut off, but the roads elsewhere can still be used normally, so the garrison in the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital can still receive a steady supply of food, and there is no need to worry about shortages. Based on this, it would be premature to say that Madrid has now turned the corner and is safe, but it can be said that the garrison in the capital now has room to breathe, and the future of the war is more promising. (Reuter, 10th)

Madrid: Special dispatch from our reporter: The government forces fought fiercely in the Casa de Campo park in the western suburbs of Madrid, and the number of those killed in battle reached more than 300. By the afternoon, the fighting was even more intense, and the sound of machine guns never stopped all day until sunset. However, no government planes were seen in the skies over the Nationalist positions. On the contrary, 30 planes belonging to the Nationalist forces flew back and forth over Madrid for a long time. It is generally believed that the city of El Escorial northwest of Madrid will fall sooner or later, and the garrison there can only control a few small roads, so it is not easy to evacuate the stockpiled ammunition to the rear. (Havas, 10th)

### Horse Meat Fills Bellies in Besieged City

Santander: It is heard that due to the lack of food here, shops have now been established to specialize in selling horse meat. Note: Santander is located in northern Spain, 47 miles from Bilbao. (Reuters, 10th)

### Prisoner Exchange Talks Break Down

Bilbao: According to a statement issued by the Basque government, the negotiations between the Basque and Nationalist forces on the exchange of prisoners have broken down. Note: These negotiations had been progressing smoothly recently. The breakdown is attributed to the attitude of the Basque government. Hundreds of Basque families were greatly disappointed after this news was released, as they had initially thought that the exchange of 4,000 prisoners between the Spanish government and the Nationalist forces would be successful. It is believed that military service age is the main point of difficulty. (Reuters, 10th)

### Submarine Activity in Spanish Territorial Waters

Two Government Merchant Ships Narrowly Missed by Torpedoes

[London] Naval activity off the coast of Spain is also increasing. The Soviet cargo ship "Tsyuryupa" carrying 3,500 tons of grain, which had been detained by the Spanish Nationalist forces, has been released from the port of Pasajes in the Bay of Biscay. The Norwegian ship "Ibis," which was captured by the Nationalist forces yesterday, has been released from the port of Algeciras. (Reuters, 10th)

⊙Valencia: The Spanish government-owned merchant ship "Ciudad de Madrid" was en route from Marseille to Alicante when it encountered a submarine in the waters off the city of Cullera, which fired a torpedo at it. Fortunately, it missed. In addition, another merchant ship, "Ciudad de Barcelona," was also attacked by a submarine in the area near Cullera, which fired several torpedoes, all of which missed. It is generally believed that the two attacks were carried out by the same submarine, but it is still unknown which side the submarine belongs to. (Havas, 9th)

### British Independent Labour Party

Twenty-Five Members Go to Spain to Serve

[London] Twenty-five members of the Independent Labour Party, led by one of the party's leaders, Edward, departed from here this morning for Spain to serve in the government army. One of them made a statement to the press before his departure, saying that there were originally 100 people who signed up, but the organizers only selected 25 of them. None of us have family burdens, and we do not receive any pay, and even the travel expenses required are paid by ourselves. But when they departed, a woman suddenly shouted at them, "You are committing suicide!" (Havas, 10th)

### Spanish Female Envoy to Sweden Takes Office

Former Envoy Refuses to Hand Over Power

Stockholm, Sweden: The newly appointed Spanish envoy to Sweden, Mrs. Valencia, has arrived here. Because the former envoy, Mr. Fisga Viesca, is a supporter of the Nationalist forces and refuses to hand over power, she requested assistance from the judicial authorities to forcibly order the outgoing envoy to leave the embassy.

### American and Russian Newspapers Comment on the European Situation

Peace is Threatened; Germany and Italy Should Be Held Responsible

[Washington] The situation of German activities in Spanish Morocco is currently being closely watched by various newspapers. Editorials in the evening papers clearly point out that Germany and Italy should be held responsible for the chaotic European situation. The "Evening Star" said, "The negotiations in London on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War will inevitably be delayed, and the result will only benefit the Spanish rebels, allowing them to achieve a final victory with the assistance of Germany and Italy (volunteers from Germany and Italy have now secretly gathered in Spain). Even if the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention wants to take action in the future, the rebels will have already won the battle, and the fascist faction will have established its regime throughout Spain. It will be too late to regret it. This is what we are deeply concerned about." The "New York Post" said, "If anyone wants to cause international disputes now, it is German Chancellor Hitler. For three years, Hitler has repeatedly trampled on various international treaties. There are three reasons for this: After the Treaty of Versailles was signed, people all over the world mostly expressed sympathy for the German people. This is the first reason. Britain, France, and Germany's other neighbors are willing to tolerate Germany's provocative actions rather than retaliate with force. This is the second reason. Germany's neighbors have failed to remain united throughout. This is the third reason. But now it is different. Hitler's situation is very different from before. Britain and France cannot ignore Germany's activities in Morocco and let them run their course. If Germany succeeds in Morocco, it will be tantamount to allowing Germany to attack France from both the north and south, and cut off France's transportation with Morocco. If Hitler has not completely lost his mind, he should stop at the right time and not go too far." (Havas, 9th)

[Washington] The government newspaper Izvestia recently commented on the replies of Italy and Germany regarding the issue of banning volunteers from going to Spain, saying, "From this reply, it can be seen that Italy and Germany's intention is to intensify their intervention in the Spanish Civil War. This does not need to be analyzed, and the content of the reply can show it. The actions of the fascist countries in Spain have been seen and heard by the world. While Germany and Italy sent replies, troops from both countries were attacking the positions of the Spanish Republican Army under the city of Madrid. This is a well-known fact. And it is not only the case in Spain itself, but also in Spanish Morocco, where civil and military power is now actually in the hands of foreign interveners, especially Germany. The only way for countries that aspire to peace and have no intention of launching a war to prevent the fascist countries from realizing their conspiracy is to unite." (Havas, 9th)

### Italy Actively Expands Military

Military Expenditures for the Army and Navy Increase Sharply; Cabinet Decides to Develop Road Network in East Africa and Prohibits People from Marrying Indigenous Africans

[Rome] Following the trend of expanding armaments around the world, the cabinet has approved an increase in the military budget for 1938. The army's budget for this year is 120,621,150 lire, and will increase to 131,115,115 lire next year. The navy will also increase from 81,291,600 lire to 94,348,000 lire. Currently, the total budget for 1938 has a shortfall of 167,058,450 lire after offsetting income and expenditure. (National Telegram, 9th)

[Rome] Today's cabinet meeting approved several important orders, including one order stipulating that the Secretary-General of the Fascist Party shall enjoy the status of a cabinet member. Another order is to develop the road network in Italian East Africa, with particular emphasis on the maintenance and expansion of the Libyan automobile road. Another order stipulates that a colonial exhibition shall be held every three years to showcase the progress of Italian colonies. The first exhibition will be held in 1938. (National Telegram, 9th)

[Rome] In order to protect the purity of the Italian race, the cabinet has decided to punish Italians who enter into marital relations with Abyssinian natives. According to a statement issued by the authorities today, the penalty is intended as a warning, not to punish people severely, because the Fascist government fully trusts that the people residing in Abyssinia will have a good understanding of the dignity of citizens and the success of politics.

### Dissatisfaction of Japanese Political Parties with Arita Diplomacy

[Nanjing] The Foreign Affairs Roundtable, a gathering of like-minded members from the Seiyukai and Minseito parties who advocate for the reassessment of Arita diplomacy and aim to alter foreign policy, convened at Tokiwa within Van Chih on the evening of the 9th. Attendees included Koyama (Matsuju), Tawar, Yamamichi, and Saito from the Minseito party, as well as Hamada, Azuma, and Uehara from the Seiyukai. As a result of candidly exchanging views on Arita diplomacy, they all agreed that the current cabinet's foreign policy lacked a consistent and firm guiding principle, leading to repeated failures. In the face of the current extraordinary situation, it has fallen into complete deadlock. If left unattended, it will inevitably lead to irreparable consequences. If a shift in direction is not initiated today and a better approach is not sought under a new policy, a significant crisis will inevitably arise. Subsequently, they discussed methods for reassessing Arita diplomacy. The result was a decision that, while both parties have not yet made a decision on the matter, they must each actively work within their respective parties to promote progress in the direction of reassessing Arita diplomacy. It is said that today, taking this meeting as an opportunity, the cross-party liaison movement of both parties is gradually intensifying. (10th, Domei News)

### Trotsky Arrives in Mexico

Releases a lengthy declaration, acknowledging that a European war is difficult to avoid, and refrains from commenting on the Spanish situation

Mexico, Tampico Port: Leon Trotsky, the leader of the anti-establishment faction of the Soviet Communist Party, arrived here this morning from Norway and has already departed for Mexico City. (9th, Havas News)

Tampico Port: Leon Trotsky, having been granted special permission by the Mexican authorities to relocate from Sweden to Mexico, arrived here on the Norwegian ship "Ruth" at 8:15 this morning. Many Mexican dignitaries welcomed him at the pier, including the painter Rivera (leader of the Mexican Trotskyist faction), his wife Frida, General Guerrero, the garrison commander of Tampico Port, Mayor Martinan, and Shardman, Trotsky's representative in New York City. Government officials had kept the ship's schedule strictly confidential beforehand and had mobilized two battalions of troops and numerous police officers to prevent any unforeseen incidents. However, the result was good order, and no incidents occurred. After the ship docked, Trotsky, wearing a dark gray golf suit and a dark red tie, smiled and told people that the sea voyage had been quite beneficial to his health. He also said that he was deeply grateful for the Mexican government's willingness to grant him residence and that he would certainly live up to their kindness, "and do his best for Mexico." He also intends to visit New York in the near future. Trotsky then delivered a lengthy declaration in French, which was immediately translated into English, stating in brief that he felt deep sympathy for the Norwegian people. On his way to Mexico, he received numerous telegrams from various American news agencies and major newspapers asking him to answer several questions. However, because the Norwegian government had previously ordered the captain of the "Mans" to prohibit Trotsky from using wireless communication to communicate with other places, even communicating with American friends on private matters was not allowed. Therefore, he was unable to answer the telegrams he received. "When I set out, the European situation was restless, and the signs of war were countless, people were panic-stricken and could not live in peace, and all kinds of rumors spread without wings. My enemies took the opportunity to spread various messages to my disadvantage. Now I intend to make my plans and thoughts public, without concealment, hoping that most newspapers in the New World will adopt an objective spirit and comment on them." He also said, "The ingredients for the outbreak of war in Europe already account for 75 percent." Regarding the situation in Spain, he declined to comment, saying that he had been unaware of outside news for twenty days on the way. The Mexican government has now prepared an airplane and a special car for Trotsky to choose from and go wherever he wants. (9th, Havas News)

Mexico City: The Mexican Communist Party recently issued a declaration stating that it would hold a demonstration when Trotsky arrived here and demanded that the government not allow Trotsky to stay in the country for long. (10th, Havas News Agency)

### Franco-Turkish Dispute

The two countries conduct diplomatic negotiations, and the League of Nations Council postpones its meeting

[Paris] Regarding the issue of ethnic Turkish minorities in the cities of Antioch and Alexandretta in Syria, the Council of the League of Nations was originally scheduled to meet on the 18th of this month to discuss it. However, because France and Turkey are currently engaged in negotiations, the Council may postpone the meeting until the 21st of this month. (10th, Havas News)

### Unification of Authority in American Territories

Senator makes proposal

[Washington] There are many proposals in Congress today, the most noteworthy of which is Senator Gibson's re-submission of the bill to establish a Department of Territories, which was not resolved in the previous Congress. Gibson suggests that the department be headed by a minister with an annual salary of 15,000 yuan, with jurisdiction over various overseas territories such as the Philippines, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, Midway Island, Palmyra Island, and Wake Island. Because the Philippines currently belongs to the Department of the Army, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands belong to the Department of the Interior, and the remaining islands belong to the Department of the Navy, the authority is not unified. Therefore, Gibson claims that he will vigorously promote the passage of the bill in the upcoming Congress. Congressman Costello proposed prohibiting the import of American flags manufactured abroad, in order to prevent American flags from being printed with the words "Made in Japan." (9th, Kuomin News)

### Deadlock in Negotiations on Export of Lu Salt

The Japanese side hopes to lower the price, but we have not agreed. The Kito puppet organization plots to occupy various salt fields, and private salt invades Tianjin and Beijing, affecting tax revenue.

Tianjin Correspondence: The export of Lu salt remains an intractable issue between China and Japan in North China. Last year, Mitsubishi Corporation ordered 70,000 tons in the name of manufacturing chemical salt. The authorities, considering the matter repeatedly, allowed foreign transportation, which was an unprecedented exception in the past fifty years. The contract was originally limited to one year and expired last winter. This year, the Japanese side needs several times more Lu salt than last year, with a planned order of at least 250,000 tons and at most 300,000 tons, to be ordered by the Xingzhong Company. Some time ago, Nagai Jyunichi, the commercial vice-consul of the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin, accompanied Hirayama, the Tianjin director of the Xingzhong Company, to directly negotiate with the salt field owners of Changlu, in an attempt to bypass our official procedures to avoid difficulties and achieve their procurement goals. However, the salt field owners mostly stated that the price they received for the salt sold last year was only two yuan and forty cents per ton, which was not even enough to cover the cost, and they had no profit to gain, so they were quite indifferent to foreign sales. Although the salt field owners established the Lufeng Store last year specifically to handle Lu salt exports, the store has not been closed, but it has no intention of undertaking the business. Therefore, the direct contact with the Xingzhong Company this time did not yield any results. Recently, they resumed negotiations with the Changlu Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office. The Transportation Commissioner's Office, based on reports from the general salt field owners, deeply felt that the current salt reserves in the Hangu and Xinhe salt fields, in addition to supplying the Huabei market, amount to at most only 100,000 tons. The Japanese side plans to purchase 250,000 to 300,000 tons, which is impossible to fulfill in terms of quantity. As for the price, last year's price was two yuan and forty cents per ton, and the salt field owners were already complaining bitterly. If they follow the Xingzhong Company's intention, the purchase price this year will not only not increase, but will instead be reduced to two yuan and ten cents per ton, which is really difficult to achieve. The Transportation Commissioner's Office believes that the minimum price demanded by the salt field owners should not be less than three yuan per ton, which is the most fair price. If the Japanese side can purchase within the quantity of 100,000 tons, they can mediate with the salt field owners to slightly reduce the price, which can be between two yuan and ninety cents and two yuan and ninety-six cents per ton. If both sides are interested, the Transportation Commissioner's Office still cannot make a decision on its own and must request approval from the Ministry of Finance before it can be implemented. As of today, the surface negotiations have come to a standstill, and the Japanese side is seeking other ways to choose convenient methods to achieve their goals.

Since the tenth of last year, the amount of private salt transported from the Jidong area to Tianjin and Beijing for sale has gradually increased from more than 500 dan per month to 1,000 dan. The source is quite ambiguous. The government only knows that it is transported from Dalian and Yingkou. Therefore, many people suspect that it is related to the Lu salt exported last year. Although the Changlu Transportation Commissioner's Office police are trying their best to intercept it, this matter is the same as the smuggling situation in the North China Customs. Every time private salt is transported, there are ronin bodyguards, and the tax police are not allowed to approach for inspection. If the situation continues, the problem of private sales is likely to gradually become rampant. The pseudo-Jidong government is currently planning to expand, and plans to forcibly occupy the Changlu salt fields east of Tanggu after the implementation. It was originally rumored that it would be implemented on New Year's Day, but it was slightly delayed due to the Transportation Commissioner's Office's negotiations on both sides. However, this is related to the Japanese side's purchase and transportation of Lu salt for export. If we insist on the price and refuse to reach a deal, the Japanese side will use any means, or manipulate the Jidong pseudo-organization to quickly forcibly occupy the salt fields, which is not impossible. Although there are still no accurate statistics on Lu salt tax revenue last year, it is at most only 13 million yuan. Because since February last year, the Transportation Commissioner's Office has been allocating 250,000 yuan of tax revenue to the Jidong pseudo-organization every month in the name of assistance, totaling 3 million yuan for the whole year. In addition to rampant smuggling, the tax revenue loss is only about 13 million yuan in actual income. (9th)

### Miscellaneous Notes on the New Year in the Old Capital

Special Correspondence from Beiping: As a general rule, the New Year's holidays for various agencies and schools are all three days, and the celebrations, etc., are also limited to three days. However, in the old capital, it is not very consistent. For example, some newspaper offices have one-day holidays, and some have three-day holidays. Also, some schools have one-day New Year's holidays, and some have one-week holidays. The Jicha authorities hold New Year's plays at Huiren Hall to entertain guests from all walks of life, which is similar to the abolished lunar New Year, and continues for five days. As for the general public, they showed New Year's scenes as early as the end of last month, and they have not changed until now. It will probably be more than ten days before they can return to normal. For example, the New Year's market in Changdian was originally scheduled to open for ten days, but in reality, it lasted for more than half a month, which is one example.

However, the widespread and official start of the New Year was indeed on the first of this month. Until now, a week has passed. Although the New Year's atmosphere has not yet passed, the enthusiasm has indeed faded slightly. Especially for various agencies and schools, because regular work has returned to normal, they have to return to normal. What is recorded here is the general situation of various aspects in the past week.

Someone scatters pseudo flags

In the latter half of last month, Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing from shadow exile, and the whole city was filled with an atmosphere of jubilation. In a few days, it was the Gregorian New Year, and the whole city celebrated with joy. Therefore, the continuous firecrackers from the eve of the first day to the fifth or sixth day intensified. The national flag of Blue Sky, White Sun, and Wholly Red Earth had already fluttered all over the roofs and eaves of the streets and alleys at the first dawn. Unexpectedly, the next day (the second), at about ten o'clock in the morning, there was suddenly a sound of airplanes rumbling from the eastern sky. The crowd looked up. Everyone initially thought that the pseudo-authorities were distributing announcements to the people. Just as they were looking forward to it, the fuselage gradually approached and flew lower and lower. What was presented to everyone's eyes was the emblem of a certain country's sun. At the same time, a large number of paper pieces were dropped from the aircraft. In addition to the red, yellow, blue, white, and black five-color flags of the Jidong pseudo-organization, there was also a so-called flag-protecting declaration, whose wording was extremely absurd. Even the words and sentences were semi-literate and uncultured Chinese. Using this to propagandize to the people, at best, only added to everyone's after-dinner conversation material.

The fate of drug offenders is slightly extended

All severe drug offenders in the country will be subject to the death penalty once captured from January 1 of this year. There have long been clear orders, and the Jicha Pingjin local authorities have especially repeatedly emphasized and earnestly exhorted this. They have established drug rehabilitation centers, ordered drug offenders to parade through the streets and give testimonials, posted slogans, posted notices, and sent patrol police to repeatedly warn door-to-door, and used various newspapers to publicize the phrase "death on January 1" repeatedly. In addition, more than a thousand coffins were prepared in the suburbs, and many pits were dug in advance for burial. All of these are nothing more than showing a heart of not being able to bear to kill without teaching, hoping that drug offenders will return from the wrong path. However, the situation in Pingdi is special. Most of the drug dens are opened by ronin or Koreans from a certain country, who use consular jurisdiction as a talisman and their drug dens as a hiding place for our country's drug offenders. From the end of December last year, the number of drug offenders living in various drug dens was already overcrowded. Especially from November 31 to around January 1 and 2 of this year, almost all drug offenders in the city had disappeared like water and birds, and most of them hid in drug dens. Under this situation, if they were to be searched and seized without the consent of a certain party, the unexpected disputes and troubles would be within expectations. This is one of the reasons why the authorities had to hesitate slightly before proceeding with law enforcement to punish them. Secondly, during the New Year period, various agencies were on vacation, and all search, arrest, and execution work had to wait until after the holidays. Therefore, various drug offenders were also able to take refuge in the celebration of this New Year. In addition, there are more than tens of thousands of drug offenders in Ping City, which is too many. If the law is strictly enforced, the corpses should be piled up like hills, and the blood should flow like a pestle. There are many charitable organizations and private individuals who have compassionate hearts and turn to the authorities to request a postponement of three or two months so that they can find ways to rehabilitate them. For example, the Ping City Chamber of Commerce once submitted a request to open up the net and drive them to serve as labor, which is one example. However, it is heard that the authorities' attitude is quite firm. Although Song Zheyuan has approved it for the Sui Shu to handle, it seems that the hope of obtaining an extension and leniency is also very slim. Probably after the New Year's scenes pass, the fate of drug offenders can be determined. It is said that a large-scale search and arrest has begun on the 7th.

The Happy Gathering at Huiren Hall

For a year, North China has been suffering. Just like after the Xi'an Incident not far away, a certain party planned to take advantage of the situation to expand the Jidong pseudo-organization to Pingjin Jicha. Fortunately, the Xi'an Incident was successfully resolved, and this place also felt relieved. Therefore, the authorities held an expanded celebration, and from the first day to the fifth day, plays were performed at Huiren Hall for five days to entertain all walks of life. In addition to the famous actors Yang Xiaolou, Cheng Yanqiu, Hao Shouchun, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Hou Xirui, Xiao Cuihua, Wang Youchen, Ma Fulu, etc., the rest were mainly children from the Fuliangcheng Drama School, which is famous here. Almost all the famous actors in the old capital were recruited, and what they performed were all the actors' best plays, such as Ma Lianliang's Ganlu Temple, Tan Fuying's Dingjun Mountain, Cheng Yanqiu's Hongfu Biography, Xun Huisheng, Ma Fulu, and the joint performance of Xiao Fangniu, etc. The agencies and people from all walks of life who were invited were also very numerous. It is estimated that on the first day, there were more than a thousand people from the Political Affairs Committee, its affiliated Law, Foreign Affairs, Economic, Construction, and Transportation Committees, and the Jicha Clearing and Checking Office. On the first day, there were also more than a thousand people from the military police agencies. On the third day, there were personnel from various agencies under the Beiping Municipal Government, as well as postal, telecommunications, judicial, and cultural agencies. The fourth day was for entertaining foreign guests, and the fifth day was for people from the business, banking, and news circles.

Release of Petty Criminals

In order to show the spirit of renewing with the people, the authorities here previously notified the judicial authorities to select some prisoners with minor crimes and with evidence of good behavior and repentance from various prisons in accordance with the method of dredging prisoners through judicial administration and release them on New Year's Day. After the judicial authorities verified the results, a total of four or five hundred prisoners were released on New Year's Day, and those who were far away were given travel expenses to return home.

### Emergency Relief for Various Counties in Henan Province

Selected heavily disaster-stricken counties to allocate emergency relief funds

Kaifeng Correspondence: The Henan Provincial Relief Association previously received 300,000 yuan of public debt bonds allocated by the Executive Yuan (equivalent to 183,533.78 yuan in cash), together with 30,000 yuan of emergency relief funds allocated from the province's disaster relief reserve, totaling more than 203,000 yuan in cash. In the current winter season, on the 7th, it specially selected 27 counties with the most severe drought, divided them into different grades, distributed them in advance, and formulated regulations for investigation and distribution, ordering them to comply. The number of relief funds allocated to severely disaster-stricken counties has also been stipulated. Yuxian, Mixian, Dengfeng, Yiyang, Songxian, Yiyang, and Rushan, etc., are listed as the most severe first-class disaster-stricken counties, with each county allocated 12,000 yuan of relief funds. Xiangcheng, Mengjin, Yichuan, Mianchi, Xin'an, Shenqiu, Shanxian, Luoning, Wenxiang, Lushi, Zhengxian, and Lingbin, etc., are listed as the most severe second-class disaster-stricken counties, with each county allocated 8,000 yuan of relief funds. Huaxian, Shangshui, Xihua, Fengqiu, Yanshi, Yanjin, Luoyang, and Lushan, etc., are listed as the most severe third-class disaster-stricken counties, with each county allocated 4,000 yuan of relief funds.

### Songjiang

Two Major Robbery Cases on Land and Water

A certain egg shop in Sijing Town, District 1 of this county, has a thriving business and sells to the Shanghai area. On the 9th, the shop transported 2,000 baskets of eggs, each basket containing about 2,000 eggs, and hired a boat to transport them to Shanghai for sale. However, at 1:00 PM, when passing through the Longhua Rihui Port area, two bandit boats suddenly came and jumped onto the egg boat, tied up the boatmen, and unloaded the eggs onto the bandit boats. The bandit boats sailed away. The tied-up boatmen, seeing the eggs being stolen, shouted for help and were rescued by a neighboring boat. They returned to Songjiang to report to the County Public Security Bureau to request an arrest. It is said that the loss is about 13,000 yuan. Also, the wealthy Zhang family in Mapeng, District 8, was robbed by many bandits on the night of the 7th, and more than 20,000 yuan was looted. The District Office has reported the matter to the county.

### Suzhou

Establishment of the Law Society Branch

The Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the Republic of China Law Society was organized and established in April last year. The General Assembly appointed Zhu Shusheng and 13 others as preparatory committee members. On the 10th of this month, the inaugural meeting was held at the Jiangsu Higher Court in Suzhou. The General Assembly sent Vice Chairman Qin Zhen to attend as a representative. At the inaugural meeting, Chairman Zhu Shusheng first reported on the preparatory process, followed by a speech by Qin Zhen. Then, directors were elected. As a result, Zhu Shusheng, Sun Honglin, Lu Yimei, Qian Sen, Shen Yuan, Liu Yun, Hu Shancheng, Shen Binqian, Cai Zhaoying, Dai Tianqiu, Luo Shishi, Tian Wennong, Fang Wen, Zhong Zhihan, Wu Yuheng, and 15 others were elected as directors. Chen Liren, Zhou Shaocheng, and 7 others were elected as alternate directors. The five standing directors will be selected by the branch and reported to the General Assembly.

Recruitment of Judicial Police

The Jiangsu Higher Court has been actively preparing for the establishment of local courts in various counties in recent years. As the local courts in Huaiyin, Taixian, Rugao, Dongtai, and Changshu have been prepared and are about to be established, a large number of judicial police are needed to facilitate service. Therefore, 50 to 60 judicial police officers are specially recruited. Registration will begin on the 11th and end on the 22nd. The examination will be held at Suzhou Middle School in Sanyuanfang from the morning of the 21st. Anyone who has graduated from higher primary school or has an equivalent level, and is between 25 and 40 years old, can go to register for the examination. Once admitted, they must be assigned to serve in the local courts of various counties.

### Wuxi

Broke up a large drug manufacturing organization

Lin Wei, the acting director of the Public Security Bureau of this county, received a confidential report on the 9th stating that Zhou Yu, the wife of Zhou Rongquan, a drug offender who had been executed, was continuing to set up an organization to manufacture red pills in An Di Li, District 5, on a large and extremely secretive scale. The headquarters was located at Jiang Gao's home. The director immediately ordered inspector Tong Guodong to cooperate with Gu Jiafeng, the captain of the security police team, and Liao Dingjie, the director of the Public Security Branch 4, to lead 20 armed police officers to the countryside that evening around 8:00 PM. They joined forces with Su Guangyi, the town chief, Jiang Jiahe, the Bao chief, and Jiang Tinggen, the Jia chief, to surround the homes of Jiang Gao and Zhou Yu separately. They searched the rooms and in a panic, Jiang Gao threw a bag of powdered milk candy, the raw material for manufacturing red pills, out of the window. It was immediately picked up by the police. The police then went upstairs and searched in detail. They found a secret organization behind Jiang Gao's bed sheets and curtains. They seized two sets of red pill manufacturing machines, red pill boards, a balance, a steelyard, 1.1 liang of corrupt pills, 2 fen of opium bubbles, 2 liang of powdered milk candy, 25 wax papers, one steaming sieve, one iron spoon, two stamping lids, one brush broom, one piece of face powder, one liang of red pill stamping scraps, one empty Qianhu brand pill box, and one rattan basket. Jiang Gao was arrested, and Lu Xianglin and Zhou Zhuoyun were also arrested. Jiang Gao claimed that the machinery was hidden in his home by Su Wenzhi. Inspector Tong and others went to Su's home to search and arrested Su Wenzhi. Finally, the police went to Zhou Yu's home to search and found only 1 fen of opium bubbles, and nothing else was seized. The main offender, Zhou Yu, escaped because she rented another house to live in. The police and others escorted the witnesses to the city at about 2:00 AM on the 10th and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.

Investigate Deed Tax on Squeezed Fields and Houses

The county government believes that when the villagers in various districts and townships of this county buy fields and houses, they mostly privately establish white deeds and do not comply with the regulations to purchase official deeds, resulting in hidden and evaded taxes. Although strict investigations and squeezing have been carried out, omissions are still inevitable. Now, at the time of land registration, it is necessary to strictly rectify this in order to increase tax revenue. In addition to sending personnel to various districts to reside and investigate and squeeze, the Land Administration Bureau was ordered yesterday to assist the various district chiefs properly.

A Major Fire Causes Losses of Millions

The Nanxiang Shanghoubei near the Slaughtering Cattle Workshop outside the East Gate of this county, along the railway, has dozens of acres of wasteland that have been rented by Jiangbei coolies to build thatched shacks, no less than a hundred, housing two or three hundred households. There are old railway sleepers around to prevent thieves. At about 2:00 PM on the 10th, He Meng, an old woman living in a shack on the west side, accidentally dropped a spark while cooking, causing a fire. At that time, a strong northwest wind was blowing, and the fire was fierce, and the smoke was so thick that it was impossible to approach. All the shack dwellers ran to the mountains to snatch their belongings. The fire brigade in each section heard the alarm and drove the dragon to rescue, and the fire was extinguished at 3:30 PM.

Electric Hair Perming Causes Disaster

The Wuyi Barber Association once banned electric hair perming due to its potential dangers. Later, steam perming was used, but electric perming became popular again. Mei Xingda, a woman from Mopan Bridge, went to the "Beautiful" barber shop on Main Street to get her hair permed, but suffered an electric shock, completely destroying her hair and injuring her brain. She is currently receiving treatment at Wujin Hospital. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, Mrs. Xu, wife of Pan Qingxiang of Xunxiang Bathhouse, also encountered danger while getting her hair permed at the same shop, suffering severe head injuries. Despite extensive medical treatment, little improvement was seen. On the morning of the 8th, she suddenly fainted from the pain and was rushed to the Red Swastika Society Hospital for treatment. Doctors say her condition is quite critical. Her husband, Pan Qingxiang, immediately entered into negotiations with the "Beautiful" barber shop, leading to a brawl and injuries. The case was reported to the First Public Security Bureau for investigation. The bureau chief, Si Daoping, also received a letter from the New Transport Promotion Association requesting that the police strictly prohibit electric and steam hair perming. As a result, this type of hair perming has completely disappeared from the market.

### Zhenjiang

Planning to Build a Qingzhen Brick Road

The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that Qingzhen's land transportation is maintained only by the Yangqing Line's buses. However, the road is not well maintained, and although counties along the canal have tendered for repairs, buses can only travel on sunny days. In rainy weather, the roads become muddy and buses stop running. To facilitate Qingzhen's transportation, the provincial government has allocated funds to rebuild the road with stone. It has repeatedly ordered the county magistrates along the canal to demolish all houses and obstacles along the route to facilitate road construction. The magistrates of Huaiyin and Huaian counties have ordered residents to demolish houses along the line immediately. Jiangdu and Gaobao are demolishing them as well. It is heard that road construction will begin soon.

Drug Trafficking Ring Cracked

The Provincial Public Security Bureau's Political Police Team received a tip that the Hong Taixiang shop at No. 127 Shanxiang Alley outside the city was actually a drug trafficking ring. The team, led by patrol officer Wang Tianniao of the Second Precinct of the Public Security Bureau, raided the shop around 4 p.m. on the 8th. They discovered two small packages of heroin and took the shop owner, Liu Hongtai, into custody for questioning. Liu, who lives near the Four Railway Stations in Paiwan, had been trafficking drugs for a long time and recently moved to Shanxiang Alley to open a spice shop as a cover. The shop had not yet opened when it was raided. After questioning, the bureau prepared a document to hand him over to the Garrison Headquarters for legal action.

### Hangzhou

Change of Zhang Taiyan's Burial Site

Zhang Taiyan's state burial was planned for West Lake. The burial site was initially determined to be Zhongtai Mountain. However, due to the presence of sand and gravel, construction would be difficult. Furthermore, the access road would require the relocation of other people's tombs. Therefore, Zhang's widow advocated abandoning this site. After days of inspection by Zhang's widow, son, and others, Longjing was deemed the most suitable location. Moreover, Zhang's ancestral tomb is also nearby. Wang Dong, a member of the state burial preparation committee, came to Hangzhou yesterday to survey the site and agreed. Wang is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 10th, and a meeting will be held next week to finalize the decision. Wang Tingyang and Du Shenfu, the director and deputy director of the state burial office in Hangzhou, are scheduled to establish an office on the 10th and begin collecting 民地. Zhang's tomb will require more than ten acres of land. An engineer will be hired to design it, and the state burial ceremony may be held in March.

At 9:30 a.m., the doors opened, and visitors entered in an orderly fashion. The first people standing in the front were one Chinese person and one Westerner, who yielded to each other. Ultimately, the Westerner said that since it was a Chinese museum, Chinese people should enter first. Therefore, the Chinese person entered first.

Because it was the first day of opening, the museum extended its hours by one hour. The Chinese Merchant Bus was crowded all day, and private cars came in an endless stream. It was the most grand occasion in the city center in a year.

The Credit Guarantee Bureau is a new organization that was established five or six years ago and is between the three major departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Foreign Trade. It is also an independent agency. As for Patrick's mission to China, some say it is to negotiate loans, which may not be entirely true. Patrick's mission is to investigate the conditions of China's industrial, commercial, and financial markets and report them to the British government. The Credit Guarantee Bureau will then introduce them to British merchants, who will lend and sell goods to China according to China's needs, with particular emphasis on assistance in the field of machinery, it is said.

### The Only Life Society Established Yesterday

Chen Lifu and Wu Tiecheng Appointed Honorary Chairmen, Pan Gongzhan Appointed Chairman, and Articles of Association Approved

The Only Life Society held its founding meeting yesterday at the China Cultural Construction Association. Over six hundred members attended to discuss and revise the articles of association and elect Chen Lifu and Wu Tiecheng as Chairman and Vice Chairman respectively, and Pan Gongzhan as Chairman, along with directors Jiang Jianbai and others. The details are recorded as follows:

Meeting Staff

The Only Life Society held its founding meeting yesterday, attended by more than six hundred members. Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Yuanruo, Guo Wei, Jiang Jianbai, Tang Jinbai, Ding Mocun, Ling Xianwen, Gu Jiwu, and Ji Hao were elected to the presidium, Huang Jingqi and Fan Jiabiao as recorders, Liu Zhuqing as master of ceremonies, and Chen Yuejiang as chief receptionist.

Chairman's Report

After the meeting commenced, Chairman Zhang Shouyong of the presidium gave a report, stating briefly that recently there have been two schools of thought in intellectual circles: materialism and idealism, but both are too radical. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's historical view of the people's livelihood combines the strengths of both schools and forms a central mainstream, the philosophy of the only life. Promoting this central mainstream, humanity's desires lie in survival, so solving the problem of the people's livelihood is the central issue. We uphold this true meaning to complete our view of life and the universe, and then together with the nation, seek survival and development, which is what we can hope for. The purpose of this society is to resolve this central issue. We will also supplement it with mutual assistance and mutual trust, so that our cause can be promoted and benefit our country and nation.

Preparatory Process

Next, the representative of the preparatory committee reported on the preparatory process, saying that the initiation of the assembly was more than a year ago. After obtaining approval from party and government organs to establish it in mid-September of last autumn, the search for members began, and has reached over six hundred members to date. Some of the members are students, but the majority are revolutionary-minded young people serving society.

Chen's Admonition

Next, Chen Lifu's representative, Liu Bomin, gave an admonition, stating briefly that: (1) The study of the philosophy of the only life is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's highest ideal. The purpose of this society is to select the most important point in Dr. Sun's theory, study it, elucidate it, and promote it. (2) Looking at past organizations, many lacked perseverance, resulting in many starting strong but ending weakly. The establishment of an organization is an expression of determination, and maintaining the organization depends on perseverance. It is hoped that the members of this society can reverse the trend, persevere, and strive to advance the work of this society without end. (3) You must know that studying knowledge is not a leisure activity. You must pay attention to how this knowledge benefits the country and the nation. Things like humorous writing, what benefit do they ultimately have for the country and nation? Those that are not beneficial must be rejected. Only those that are beneficial are worth studying. The way of learning is closely related to the interests of the country and the nation. I hope the comrades of this society will pay attention to this. (4) Studying knowledge is difficult, especially the philosophy of the only life, the newest, most accurate, and greatest invention in the world. But since Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated it in the past, and Chen Lifu continued to elucidate it, it will be easier for the members of this society to study and promote it, because our work is explanatory rather than creative. It is hoped that the members of this society will apply these philosophical principles to their own studies and careers, persevere, be down-to-earth, and work hard, so as not to betray the establishment of this society today.

Pan's Admonition

After Chen Lifu's representative finished speaking, a representative from the Municipal Party Department spoke, followed by Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, who stated briefly that we recognize that the actions and careers of every nation and every individual are determined by the most fundamental philosophical thought. Revolutionary leaders and great statesmen, to promote doctrine and awaken the people, must fight, and the most basic first step of the struggle must start with thought, because thought can determine the goal of our actions, grasp the faith of the masses, and guide the direction of the masses. We must choose a correct philosophical theory as the basis of our revolutionary cause. This most correct philosophical thought is the philosophy of the only life. However, our responsibility in the future is not only to understand and explain this theory, but also to apply it to various social phenomena to prove its correctness. The fundamental driving force of the philosophy of the only life lies in the life unit and life force. The basic strength of this life element has four aspects: self-control, self-generation, self-defense, and self-colonization. These four forces are the forces of the entire life, which is called life force, or vitality. We firmly believe that only by applying these four forces to various undertakings can progress be made. Taking the country as an example, to seek the progress of the country (it must be able to manage itself (i.e., self-control), it must be able to be self-sufficient, clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and cannot rely on others (i.e., self-generation), it must be able to resist foreign insults (i.e., self-defense), and the nation must be able to reproduce (i.e., self-colonization). Only in this way can the nation make progress. It is hoped that the members of this society can base themselves on this vitality of life in their own research and work to seek the evolution of their personal careers and the country and the nation, and strive for the integration and promotion of this philosophical theory in everyone's actual life, so as to contribute to the revolution at the present stage.

Election of Directors

The following motions were then discussed: (1) Review of the Articles of Association of this Society, resolved, amended and passed; (2) Review of the Declaration of this Society, resolved, amended and passed; (3) Election of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of this Society, unanimously elected Chen Lifu as Chairman and Wu Tiecheng as Vice Chairman; (4) Election of the Chairman of this Society, unanimously elected Pan Gongzhan; (5) Election of Directors of this Society, the results of the ballot count: Jiang Jianbai, Tang Jinbai, Shen Jiesheng, Gu Zhongyi, Zhu Youhuan, Gu Jiwu, Gu Fengcheng, Ling Xianwen, Ye Yunfeng, Chen Baohua, Zhou Hanmei, Xu Suling, Tang Huimin, Gao Jie, Zhou Leshan, Huang Jingqi, Yi Lirong, Liang Meichu, Feng Guangjia, Fan Anbiao, Chen Yuejiang, Ye Guangcong, Ji Hao, Zhou Yuying, Pan Shengyuan, Sun Mingqi, Yu Qiacheng, Jiang Zifang, Yao Sufeng, Zhai Shurong, Liu Zhuqing, Xu Xingchu, Jin Guangmei, Zhu Shaozeng, Liu Ranzhang, and other thirty-five people as directors, Yang Shaozhi, Zhou Guangxi, Pi Yu, Wu Xizu, Zhang Ren, Xiao Qichi, Yang Gang, Hu Renming, Cao Hanfang, Wang Tianyi, Lü Xinfu, Dong Wenyuan, Tang Yuanguan, Li Sen, and Xu Jinghai, and other fifteen people, as alternate directors, temporary motion, (1) organize various research societies, and hire specialized scholars as guides for each group to provide guidance, (2) this society should organize overseas branches, and please first establish branches in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Japan, and Southeast Asia, and submit them to the Central Government for record, (3) send a telegram to comfort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, resolved, to be handled by the board of directors, after the meeting, took photos and dismissed the meeting.

Declaration

The Only Life Society Declaration: Idealism? Materialism? In recent decades, the question that has been most deeply ingrained in the minds of the Chinese people is probably this one. Idealists, trapped in superstition, are inherently conservative, often hindering social progress. Materialists, falling into狂暴, are like blind bombs, needlessly increasing the waste of revolution. Especially materialism, wearing the cloak of revolution, with its heretical theories infiltrating, is even more prone to魔. Thousands upon thousands of young students have wasted their energy and mental power on it. Thousands upon thousands of working people have been unemployed for nothing because of it. Even hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians have been displaced and their corpses piled up like mountains because of the scourge of materialism. The Xi'an Incident not long ago was unconsciously麻醉 by the heretical theories of materialism, and they did not hesitate to be traitors to the country and the nation. We are deeply aware of these tragic facts, and we feel that the elaboration of the Three People's Principles, especially the establishment of the theoretical foundation of the Three People's Principles in philosophy, is extremely necessary. "Life is the center of the universe, and people's livelihood is the center of human history." These two sentences are the foundation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine. Now that the political foundation of the Three People's Principles has been established, the establishment of philosophical theory is of course becoming more and more important. The philosophy of the only life, which Chen Lifu has repeatedly spoken about in recent years, is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's historical view of the people's livelihood, and it is a philosophical theory that proves its certainty with scientific methods. This philosophical theory can be said to be a treasure unearthed from the five thousand years of Chinese cultural history. Elucidating the theory of the philosophy of the only life and promoting the doctrine of the historical view of the people's livelihood can not only eliminate superstition and dispel the source of chaos, but also restore the nation's self-confidence culturally and spiritually, and bring the country and the nation to a state of recovery and strength. China's strength and China's rejuvenation depend on China's own strength and China's own culture, and the most basic condition for this strength and culture is the establishment of philosophical theory. The philosophical concept of the philosophy of the only life is concretely and rigorously established, so that the strength of the nation can be brought into play and the culture of the nation can have a destination, then everything can be administered in an orderly manner, construction can be carried out in a structured manner, and the road to national rejuvenation can be embarked on. We are aware of the importance of the philosophy of the only life and the pain of the youth of the country wandering on the wrong path between idealism and materialism, so we have gathered more than seven hundred young people who are interested in studying philosophy, hoping to use the research of collective strength in an organized way to contribute to the philosophy of the only life that the country urgently needs. We must specifically explain about several aspects. (1) The college-style study of philosophy is obviously not possible for us. The philosophical theories of the "scholastic school" may not be of any help to the current turbulent society. Most of us have just left the school of struggle and are seeking to serve society. Even those who are still in school are not far from serving society. We cannot end our lives as students and must sooner or later become "social people." Therefore, our study of the philosophy of the only life must be practical from the beginning, opposing all utopian college-style. We must experience philosophy in life and study the progress of philosophy in the course of social service and struggle. (2) Because our attitude towards studying philosophy is realistic and inseparable from our real life, it affects the nature of our group, that is, we are not only gathering in a way to study academics, but also in a way to revolutionize and seek to serve society. Our individual members are not only academically related to each other, but we will also have close ties in life. Chen Lifu said in a speech on the philosophy of the only life that Westerners first discovered that "heat" is the center of gravity of matter and the driving force of matter, while the Chinese first discovered that "sincerity" is the center of gravity of spirit and the driving force of spirit. Therefore, the combination of our group should be a combination of "親愛精誠." In academics, we should encourage each other, and in life, we should do our best to help each other and trust each other. (3) We firmly believe that 空漠冥想 academics are of no help to facts, and that the philosophical essence, which is the source of cultural foundation and revolutionary power, can only be experienced in the life of actually serving society. Therefore, in the mutual assistance of members' lives, we expect to achieve job security, job introduction, low-interest loans, and special insurance, etc., and in terms of revolution and social service, every member must be able to work hard, practically go deep into society, and always serve others. The national situation is in crisis and has reached the final stage. We respectfully gather young comrades who usually get along with the heart of fearing the danger of national extinction, based on the belief of self-reliance and self-salvation, to seek a way to make a living for individuals and to seek survival for the country. We also hope that people of the country will correct us at any time.

In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), Song Ziwen firmly invited him to come north and entrusted him with the management of the consolidated tobacco tax. Subsequently, he was ordered to establish consolidated taxes on cement, matches, cotton yarn, and flour, as well as stamp taxes on tobacco and alcohol, all of which he worked hard to achieve, establishing a solid foundation for the Taxation Department, which stood alongside the Customs and Salt taxes, greatly benefiting the national finances. His contributions to the country and society, as well as his noble character and integrity, deserve our deepest respect.

### Relief Association for Disaster Victims in Suiyuan Pleads for Donations from All Sectors

Tens of Thousands of Disaster Victims are Suffering from Hunger and Cold; Please Donate Generously for Relief

Since receiving telegrams from the Feng and Yang committees of the Charity Organization Joint Relief Association in this city, stating that the disaster victims in Suiyuan are suffering terribly from hunger and cold, and that tens of thousands of lives are in urgent need of relief, the association has, in addition to allocating 20,000 yuan from its savings to be remitted to Suiyuan for relief, continued to send letters to all sectors to solicit donations. Specifically, this association received a telegram yesterday from Standing Committee members Yang Mingsheng and Feng Xuefen, stating that in the Suiyuan area, many disaster victims have been injured or killed due to the effects of the war, and houses, livestock, and equipment have been damaged, which is currently being investigated. The residents in the war zone are now without clothing, food, or shelter, and are wandering as refugees, suffering terribly from hunger and cold. No fewer than tens of thousands of people urgently need relief. They still hope to raise relief funds (continuous assistance, to save the lives of the people, etc., according to the telegram). After receiving the telegram, this association has allocated 20,000 yuan to be remitted for relief. However, at this time of severe cold, the disaster victims are without clothing, food, or shelter, and their tragic situation is unbearable to speak of. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will have great compassion, generously open their purses, and donate enthusiastically so that this association can provide continuous relief to save the lives of tens of thousands of disaster victims. It is truly a boundless act of merit. The association also sent a telegram to the Yang and Feng committees, saying, (titles omitted) "Geng telegram received.

Now, 20,000 yuan has been allocated first, to be handed over to the Bank of China on the Zhen day to be remitted to Suiyuan. Please check and receive it, strictly investigate and be lenient, and please send telegrams about the situation in the disaster area at any time. Sincerely, Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Relief Association."

### Second Payment of Loan to Beijing-Jiangxi Railway Syndicate

Amount of Three Million Yuan Prepared for Payment Within Days; Railroad Ties Use Domestic Materials and Are Shipped from Shanghai

In order to extend the construction of the Beijing-Jiangxi Railway from Xuancheng in Anhui Province to Guixi in Jiangxi Province, the Ministry of Railways successfully borrowed 14 million yuan from a syndicate composed of eight banks, including the Bank of Communications. The syndicate then allocated 3 million yuan first. A reporter from the New News Agency learned that the Shanghai syndicate will continue to allocate 3 million yuan within this month in accordance with the contract provisions. The banks have prepared in accordance with their borrowing proportions and will pay it within days. The remaining 8 million yuan is scheduled to be paid in installments of 3 million yuan in April and July, and 2 million yuan in September. The construction of this section is actively underway, with over 10,000 workers stepping up the excavation of earthworks. It is expected that it will reach Tunxi by the end of next month. Regarding the railroad ties used along the route, most of them are made in China and are contracted by timber merchants in Xuan, Ning, Ji, and She counties in Anhui Province. Other materials, such as telephone lines, are shipped from Shanghai in batches by chartered vessels to Wu and transferred to Xuancheng via the Jiangnan Railway for use. Therefore, the construction of this railway is progressing rapidly.

### Seven Men and Women Burned to Death in the Back Road of the Arsenal Yesterday Morning

Fire Started in a Charcoal Shop; Four Houses Destroyed; Seven Bodies Dug Out of the Rubble; It is Reported That a Man Named Yang is Still Missing

At around 2:20 AM yesterday morning, a charcoal shop at No. 55 Huixiang Alley, Manufacturing Bureau Back Road, Nanshi, suddenly caught fire, and flames immediately shot through the roof. The fire was fierce and spread to neighboring businesses, including Rongfuxing Tobacco Shop, a cooper shop, and a barber shop. Fortunately, the fire brigades from each district heard the alarm and immediately rushed to the scene with pump trucks to draw water and extinguish the fire. It was extinguished after about an hour. In this fire, four houses were destroyed. When the fire was raging, several men and women in the charcoal shop and the cooper shop were unaccounted for. Subsequently, firefighters dug through the rubble and uncovered seven bodies of various sizes. The families of the victims arrived at the scene to identify the bodies, but they were charred beyond recognition. Afterwards, the Huining Road Police Station in charge dispatched police officers to investigate and identify the names of the men and women who were burned to death. They included Wang Denggao, the owner of the charcoal shop, from Ningbo, 35 years old, his mother Wang Jiang, 61 years old, his son Wang Yuangen, 7 years old, his daughter Geng Hua, 5 years old, and a couple from Tongzhou, Yuan Zhongqing and his wife. In addition, there was Wang Yuande, a tenant in the cooper shop, 21 years old, from Ningbo. Yao Guangnai, director of the Ximen Branch in charge, upon hearing the report, was still concerned that there might be more bodies in the fire site, so he ordered the firefighters to continue digging through the rubble. At the same time, he sent police to investigate the cause of the fire and reported it to the General Bureau for investigation. However, after a detailed investigation, it was found that Yang Yutian, a tenant at No. 55, was said to be missing, and the police station is currently investigating.

### A Drug Den Was Raided on Huaji Road

According to Confession, Drugs Were Transported from a Japanese Person; Six Male and Female Offenders and All Drug Paraphernalia Were Seized

Shi Yuanfu from Haimen recently hired Zhang Jinbin, a local, and a woman named Wang Shen as accomplices in the house at No. 27, Lane 59, Huaji Road to open an opium den, specializing in selling the drugs red pills and heroin for profit. This was discovered by Chinese detectives Li Zhaogen and Wang Dongchen of the Huishan Police Station. At 8:40 PM the day before, they secretly went to the address with Western detective Vit, arrested Shi Yuanfu, Zhang Jinbin, and Wang Shen, along with Yong Ren Lin Kuixian, Haimen people Yu Xiangming and Xue Xiliang, and a suspected woman Zhang Shen, as well as 55 small packets of heroin, 264 red pills, six small heroin guns, one red pill gun, and a lamp. They were all taken to the police station, detained separately, and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court the day before. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of the Provisional Regulations on Prohibition of Drugs, and stated that Zhang Jinbin confessed at the police station that the heroin and red pills were transported daily from a Japanese person residing in Zhabei. He requested strict punishment. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the case, presenting the evidence for inspection. When questioned, the defendants' statements were evasive. Lin Kuixian, Yu Xiangming, and Xue Xiliang claimed that they went there to find friends and did not take drugs, asking for verification. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered a seven-day postponement for investigation and verification. The three defendants, Lin, Yu, and Xue, were transferred to the detention center to await forensic examination.

### Another Robber of Jewelry from a Dancing Girl Apprehended

Fugitive Qiu Yonggui Instigated the Crime; Shen Lili Did Not Appear in Court Due to Illness

Jin Huiying and Shen Lili, local dancing girls residing at No. 130 Xinzha Road, were returning home from the Da Hu Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road at 2:15 AM on the morning of September 25 last year, riding in the same rickshaw. Near the intersection of Rue Bourgeat and Avenue Edward VII, they were stopped by three bandits who pulled out toy guns and threatened them into silence. They were robbed of two handbags containing a gold bracelet worth 80 yuan, two gold rings, several dance tickets, and cash, and then fled in a hurry. The next day, Zhang Xinbin, a Ningbo robber involved in the case, tried to pawn a gold bracelet at Yongde Pawnshop, No. 438 Wuzhou Road. Cao Jinbiao, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, found his behavior suspicious and arrested him. After questioning, he confessed to the crime and was sent to the First Special District Court, where he was sentenced to one year in prison. The day before yesterday, Detective Cao arrested another accomplice, Wang Xiaolinzi, a Ningbo native, and took him to the police station. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, explained the case, stating that Shen Lili, the victim, did not appear in court due to illness, and only Jin Huiying came to court to testify, requesting a postponement for investigation of another case. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he was instigated by Qiu Yonggui, who was still at large, and went to rob with Zhang Xinbin. Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### Investigation of Shanghai Bird Market

Two Million Yuan Exported Annually; Plan to Form a Syndicate to Control Trade

Birds in this city are not only one of the main leisure products, but also a huge number are transported from various producing areas to Shanghai every year for re-export to foreign countries. At the same time, foreign-produced birds coming to China must also be imported through Shanghai. Therefore, this city is actually the only bird distribution market. The reporter of Shenzhou News Agency now records the general situation of the Shanghai bird market as follows:

Annual Turnover of Three Million Yuan

The currently popular birds are purely for ornamental purposes. Among them, although pigeons are used for more than ornamental purposes, their production, sales, and breeding numbers are extremely weak compared to the former. As for edible birds, only pigeons, sparrows, and doves are common. The annual turnover in the market has been less than 30,000 yuan in recent years, and there is a tendency to decline. Although this city is a bird distribution market for domestic and foreign countries, there is no bird production in Shanghai itself. Although the total annual turnover of the Shanghai bird market reaches three million yuan, the city's own consumption is only about 250,000 yuan per year, accounting for about one-tenth of the total imports and exports.

Shanghai Has Two Million Birds

The most widely raised birds in this city are the Rubies produced in Shandong, followed by the White-eyes produced in Zhejiang, and then the Larks and Thrushes produced in eastern Hebei and Liaoning. The Siskins produced in Zhejiang and the Quails produced in Shandong are also popular among the lower classes because they are good at fighting. Their numbers are also around 100,000 to 120,000 each. Every year in March and April, there are large-scale bird fighting gatherings in the City God Temple and the tea houses in the suburbs. The total number of birds currently raised in this city, combined with all categories, is about two million, and the total value is between 600,000 and 700,000 yuan. Before and after 1931, the annual turnover of the bird market was over 500,000 yuan in this city alone. In the past three or four years, due to the social and economic depression, it has gradually decreased to about 250,000 yuan. Without the support of a large amount of export trade, the so-called bird market will collapse entirely. The Shanghai bird market is concentrated in Yuwei, with a total of more than 40 large and small stores. The larger ones require a capital of about 10,000 yuan, and the smaller ones require more than 1,000 yuan. Those who engage in foreign exports must have a larger capital to be competent. The annual sales value of birdcages, an ancillary business, is also about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.

The Most Exported Are Warblers and Rubies

The total value of birds exported from this city to foreign countries every year has always been around one million yuan. The most widely sold are the Warblers produced in Zhejiang, with an annual export volume of about 3.5 million, totaling about one million yuan. The second is the Rubies, with an annual export volume of about 65,000, totaling about 100,000 yuan. The remaining White-eyes and Larks total 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Initially, the annual export value of Mandarin ducks was also several hundred thousand yuan. Now, due to the government's strict ban on the export of poultry and Mandarin ducks, there are no exports. Most of the birds imported from foreign countries are Parrots, Cockatiels, and Rubies. Among them, Rubies are also produced in our country and are exported in large quantities. Their price is also very low, only two to six yuan per bird. However, because foreign-produced birds are of better quality, they are still imported from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and Norway. Among them, the German species are the best, with prices ranging from fifty to sixty yuan to about two hundred yuan. However, the annual import of foreign birds is limited, not even half of our exports.

Organize a Syndicate to Control Foreign Sales

Although there are more than 40 bird dealers in this city, due to excessive business competition and most of them being short-sighted, there is still no organization to date. However, every morning, there is a discussion meeting of a conference nature in the Leyi Lou teahouse in the City God Temple. Most of the more prominent bird breeders gather in the Deyilou in the Yu Garden, and the rest gather in other teahouses. From morning to night, people carrying birds and cages gather in groups, up to dozens of people, to visit and compare each other, and to discuss and study together. The corners of the house are filled with the sounds of warbling, which is truly a grand sight. Although bird merchants can make a slight profit this year, foreign sales are entirely in the hands of foreign merchants and manipulated by them, and we have become vassals. Therefore, some enlightened bird merchants are now planning to eliminate the past state of isolation and competition with each other and jointly organize a unified syndicate to seek a way out to foreign countries. However, most bird merchants are blinded by prejudice, which has delayed its realization. At the same time, although there are many domestically produced birds, due to transportation obstacles and difficulties, birds from distant producing areas are difficult to transport to Shanghai, which is also a loss in foreign trade.

### Do Not Abandon Infant Corpses, Small Coffins, or Dead Infant Bundles; Send Them to the Charity Hall

This Can Avoid the Trouble of Opening Coffins, Turning Corpses, and Taking Photos; They Should Be Sent Directly to the Charity Hall for Handling or Supervision

In the past, infant corpses, small coffins, or dead infant bundles found on roads and remote places in the French Concession were reported by officers and health officials to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch, which sent laborers to collect and bury them. Since the establishment of the Second Special Court, the French Police Department, out of caution, requires each police station to investigate the abandoned infant corpses, small coffins, and dead infant bundles found in the concession, transport them to the corpse examination center of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch, open the small coffins, take out the corpses for photos, and report to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court for inspection before handing them over to the hall for burial. The procedure is very complicated, mostly because the families have no way to purchase coffins or lack the ability to buy coffins, so they entrust people or send the bundles themselves to the charity hall for burial. Some rascals are greedy and lazy, abandoning the infant coffins or bundles halfway in secluded places or on the side of the road, causing the police to find them, report them to the police station, and transport them to the corpse examination center for inspection, which is troublesome. Moreover, the small coffins that have been coffined must be opened, the corpses turned over, and photos taken, which is painful. Once the weather is not right, and smallpox or seasonal diseases are prevalent, there are more than ten such abandoned small coffins or infant corpses in a single day, and the undertakers and hall laborers are overwhelmed. According to people in the charity hall, if residents in this city unfortunately have an infant death, whether in a coffin or a bundle, they can send it directly to the charity hall for burial. If they entrust someone to send it, they must also send someone to follow and supervise to avoid abandonment along the way and the trouble of reporting and opening coffins. This benefits both the living and the dead, and is a boundless act of public virtue.

### One of Two Apprentices Who Stole Money Apprehended

Shi Jiuhua Tracked Him to Shanghai; Li Qingyang Was Detained for Investigation

Shi Jiuhua, a 50-year-old man from Zhenjiang, has been running the Jiuhua Lace Factory in Taohuawu, Suzhou, for many years and has accumulated a lot of savings. He hired two apprentices, Shi Hongkui and Li Qingyang, to help with the work. On the 13th of last month, while Shi was unprepared, they stole 525 yuan in national currency from the account and fled to Shanghai. The day before yesterday, Shi found out that Shi and Li were working in the Yuandong Textile Factory on Jessfield Road after arriving in Shanghai, so he made a special trip to Shanghai and reported it to the Caojiadu Police Station in charge. Upon receiving the report, the police station sent police to the scene and arrested Li Qingyang on the spot. Shi Hongkui escaped. After questioning Shi at the police station and finding him innocent, he was prepared to send a document to the General Bureau for interrogation because the case involved stealing money and fleeing privately.

### Did Not Know How to Drive a Car and Injured Two Children

One Broke His Right Kneecap; One Broke Several Ribs

Gao A'er, a worker from the Yong'an Auto Repair Company on Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, from Yangzhou, 33 years old, drove a repaired car with the license plate number 4371 from the company at around 11:00 AM yesterday. Gao was curious and drove the car onto the road. He did not know how to drive, and after driving only a few steps, he ran over two children on the side of the road, causing serious injuries. Zhou Zhenyou, a boy from Funing, 13 years old (living on a boat on Hengbang Bridge), broke his right kneecap. Another boy, Zhou Lianyun, 12 years old, from Shandong (living in a shack on Tiantong'an Road), had his chest crushed by the wheels, breaking several ribs, and his life was in danger. Gao A'er, who caused the accident, was arrested by the police officers from the Tiantong'an Road Police Station who rushed to the scene after hearing the news and taken to the station for strict handling by the police station at the Huazhan. In the meantime, the two injured children were rushed to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Li Jinying, a Woman from Rugao, Sues for Divorce

Husband Hides and Cannot Be Seen; Issue of Jurisdiction Under Study

Li Jinying, a woman from Rugao, is 25 years old. She married Gu Gendi, a 26-year-old glass factory worker from Taixing County, at the age of 17. Only eight months after the marriage, her husband joined the Communist Party and was wanted by the local government in his hometown, and he fled without a trace, abandoning his young wife for eight years. There has been no news. Recently, Li Jinying heard that her husband was working in Shanghai, so she also came to Shanghai and lived at No. 40 Tanqianwan, Zhabei, hoping to reunite. However, Gu hid and could not be seen. Li Jinying believed that she had mistakenly married a bandit, and if she did not find a way out, she feared that she would have no hope for lifelong happiness. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit for divorce with the Shanghai Local Court. Yesterday, Judge Cao held a court session. The defendant's address was unknown, and there was no way to summon him. The judge then stated that the issue of jurisdiction lay with Taixing County, the defendant's original county. Li Jinying stated that the defendant also had no address in Taixing and requested the court to accept the case. The judge asked if anyone could prove that the defendant had no address in Taixing. She replied that a man named Wang could testify. The court ordered a postponement to summon the witness for further questioning.

### Last Year's Shanghai Sugar Industry Overview

Business Booming in All Sectors, Mostly Profitable

The sugar industry in the 25th year [1936], originally expected to improve due to abundant agricultural harvests, suffered setbacks because of rampant smuggling in North China and rumors of tax reductions on foreign sugar in May and June. Both commodity prices and sales were affected, resulting in considerable losses. Fortunately, the tax reduction was not implemented, and price fluctuations were not excessive. The maximum price differences for various sugars, such as Dutch coarse white, East white, Dutch red, and East red, were only a few dollars. Domestic Chaozhou sugar had better business opportunities. The price fluctuations of Chaozhou green and red sugar were significant, with a maximum difference of four to five dollars. Those who managed the ups and downs effectively made substantial profits. Industry insiders believed that the inventory of Chaozhou sugar was not high and feared it would be difficult to introduce new stock. Therefore, those who bought at low prices were confident and waited for good prices to sell, eventually achieving their goals. For other types, such as Diaoqing, the lowest price was less than ten yuan, and the highest reached thirteen and a half yuan. Hainan red sugar had a minimum price of ten yuan and ninety cents and a maximum of fourteen yuan and forty cents. Guangdong coarse white and local cotton white were affected by foreign sugar, so their price fluctuations were relatively small, with a maximum difference of only sixty or seventy cents. Other fancy varieties such as local ice and miscellaneous white generally yielded profits. It is said that last year, businesses like Sheng Ji and Jun Yi, which focused on domestic sugar, achieved excellent profits. Other well-funded businesses, such as Yuan Sheng, Fang Cui, He Yu, and Feng Heng, also performed well. Detailed profit and loss figures will only be revealed during the final accounting, according to old customs. For now, only a general overview can be provided. According to industry insiders, all businesses were profitable, varying only in the amount. Furthermore, bad debts from customer guilds were minimal last year, which is of utmost importance to business. In previous years, some businesses that could have been profitable suffered losses due to bad debts. This was not heard of last year, reflecting the industry's stability. The Xi'an Incident was closely related to the sugar industry. If the issue remained unresolved, the sugar industry would have inevitably suffered significant losses. Fortunately, the incident was resolved peacefully, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek safely returned to Nanjing. Any losses to the sugar industry were minimal. Moreover, as transportation in the north gradually resumed, domestic green and red sugar became active again, revitalizing the industry. Consequently, the price of Shantou sugar at the end of the year rose by sixty or seventy cents due to active buying by various guilds. Local traders, observing the frequent price drops of green sugar, mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in low inventory. Prices rose accordingly, and foreign sugar also showed a firm trend. It is predicted that prices will not fluctuate excessively in the near future, and the sugar market is expected to stabilize.

### Stealing and Selling Under the Guise of Sample Collection

Petty Thieves Accumulate Small Amounts, Four Arrested for Interrogation Last Night

Recently, some unemployed vagrants came up with an idea of making counterfeit sample bags from Shanghai customs brokers or Hakka merchants, marked with brand names. They would infiltrate warehouses to collect samples of grains and sugars, accumulating small amounts and then selling them privately to make a living. Others would pose as dockworkers, entering warehouses to load and unload goods, seizing the opportunity to steal soft goods and conceal them under their clothes for sale. This technique is called "running horses" by these individuals. Lai Yidu, a warehouse of Hua Tong in Pudong, recently noticed frequent shortages of white and red sugars in the warehouses. Upon closer inspection of the sugar bags, they found traces of sample collection. After a secret investigation, they learned that the losses were due to these thieves. They reported to the Pudong Police Bureau, which instructed the stationed police to be vigilant. At 7 PM last night, Luo Hanxiang from Hubei, Ma Bin from Nantong, Yi Zhongxiang from Hubei, and Li Zhenlin from Nantong were arrested on the docks. They were found with two sample bags and more than ten pounds of white sugar. Both the individuals and the stolen goods were taken to the bureau for interrogation.

A: The remitter should obtain a "Domestic Money Order Application Form," also known as a "General Money Order Form," from the postal remittance window. They should fill in the amount to be remitted, as well as the names and addresses of both the remitter and the payee. When filling it out, pay attention to the following:

1.  The amount of remittance: The amount should be written clearly and legibly to avoid errors.

2.  Return receipt required?: The post office provides a form that, along with the money order, is given to the remitter to send to the payee. The payee, when cashing the money order, will sign and stamp the form in the designated area and present it with the money order (which also needs to be signed and stamped) to the cashing post office. The cashing post office will then return the form to the remitting post office for the remitter to keep as proof that the payee has received the remittance. This form is called a "Return Receipt" and costs eight cents per form. Whether or not it is needed is up to the remitter. If needed, the remitter should indicate "Yes" in the relevant section of the "Domestic Money Order Application Form"; otherwise, indicate "No."

3.  The remitter's name and address: The remitter's name and address should be filled out in detail so that if the remittance is not cashed by the payee within the validity period, the remitting post office can notify the remitter to retrieve the money within a reasonable time.

4.  The payee's name and address: The payee's name and address should be written clearly and in detail. The name, in particular, should be accurate to ensure that the signature and stamp of the payee match the information on the form when cashing the money order, preventing delays in the cashing process.

5.  The cashing post office name: To facilitate the public, post offices will also have postal branches where money orders can be cashed. The remitter should indicate the postal branch closest to the payee's address where money orders can be cashed in the "Cashing Post Office Name" section of the "Domestic Money Order Application Form" to make it easier for the payee to cash the money order nearby. For example, if the payee lives in the Xiafei Road area of Shanghai, the remitter should write "Xiafei Road Branch" in the cashing post office name section. If only "Shanghai Post Office" or "Shanghai" is written, the payee will have to go to the Shanghai Postal Administration on North Sichuan Road to cash the money order.

After filling out the Domestic Money Order Application Form, submit it along with the remittance to the postal remittance staff. They will calculate the remittance fee. After the remittance fee is paid, the remittance staff will issue the money order and fill out a receipt (which is the lower part of the Domestic Money Order Application Form). If a return receipt is requested, it will be given to the remitter along with the money order for verification. The remitter should then seal the money order, and the return receipt, if any, in an envelope and send it by registered or express registered mail. The money order receipt should be kept safe as proof in case the money order is lost or needs to be inquired about.

Also, when purchasing a money order, besides obtaining the money order receipt from the post office, be sure to also take the money order and seal it in an envelope yourself. Do not just take the receipt and give the letter to the postal remittance staff to seal and mail the money order on your behalf.

### Fourth-Class Passenger Train Services on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway

A Central News Agency reporter, noting public questions regarding the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's fourth-class passenger train service's restricted ticketing stations and nighttime operation, inquired with the railway bureau. According to a statement from the person in charge of the railway bureau, the issue of limited station ticketing is due to the fact that state-owned railways do not issue fourth-class tickets. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway is the only one with this service, and its intention is to meet the specific needs of the railway's environment. Some stations along the railway line are heavily affected by water transport competition, and there are many poor workers between Shanghai and Zhenjiang. To cope with competition and facilitate these workers, the railway sells fourth-class tickets. Therefore, the ticketing stations must be strictly limited to avoid exceeding the original purpose and harming national revenue. In recent years, the railway has spared no effort in renovating passenger train facilities. The cleanliness and comfort of fourth-class passenger cars are far better than before. Many third-class passengers try to take advantage by switching to fourth-class cars. If this behavior is allowed to grow, the third-class passenger service will suffer a sharp decline, affecting the overall situation. There is considerable concern about this. Therefore, the railway cannot reduce the number of designated stations for selling fourth-class tickets, nor can it increase the number of undesignated stations. Regarding the issue of nighttime operation, fourth-class passenger trains between Shanghai and Zhenjiang originally operated during the day. However, many passengers on these trains needed to cross the Yangtze River to return north after arriving in Zhenjiang. Because the train arrived in Zhenjiang at night, they could not cross the river and had to stay overnight in Zhenjiang, increasing their travel expenses. In view of this, the railway changed the departure time of the Shanghai train to after 12:00 AM, allowing passengers to arrive in Zhenjiang after dawn, enabling them to cross the river immediately, thereby reducing their expenses. Furthermore, the train does not stop at many small stations, making it equivalent to an express train. Since the change, passengers have found it convenient, and the train has become very crowded. The railway had no choice but to add the Shanghai-Wuxi 46th train, which departs later, to alleviate the situation. As for the Shanghai-Beijing 42nd train, which departs at 5:40 AM, it is a train that stops at every station along the entire route and must depart early to reach Nanjing without being too late. However, passengers on this train are not completely without sunlight throughout the day. In addition, the Wuxi-Shanghai 45th train departs at 12:10 PM, the Zhenjiang-Shanghai 43rd train departs at 9:30 AM, and the Beijing-Shanghai 41st train departs at 8:20 AM. All of these trains carry fourth-class passengers. Therefore, not all fourth-class passenger trains operate at night. The Shanghai-Beijing express departs at 11:00 PM, and the Shanghai-Beiping through train departs at 12:00 AM. Therefore, nighttime train services on this railway are not limited to fourth-class passenger trains.

### Gansu Relief Association Pleads for Mayor Wu's Assistance

Earnestly Soliciting Donations from All Sectors to Save a Million Souls

The Gansu Provincial Relief Association sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government, urging all sectors to donate funds to relieve the disaster in Gansu. The telegram reads: "To Mayor Wu Jun of the Shanghai Municipal Government: Gansu Province, already impoverished, has suffered another red disaster, devastating over fifty counties and ruining millions of lives. The disaster situation is extraordinarily severe, unprecedented in ancient times. The provincial authorities, though cutting flesh to mend sores, are striving to provide relief, but their efforts are like a cup of water trying to extinguish a cartload of burning wood, insufficient to make up for even a tiny fraction of the need. Now, as the year draws to a close and the weather turns cold, freezing and starvation are rampant, and death and displacement are rampant. If generous aid is not provided, they will inevitably await death in dried-up ruts. In addition to telegraphing the central government to allocate a large sum to provide urgent assistance, we earnestly appeal to you to show great kindness, generously open your wallets, and encourage donations from all sides to save the afflicted people. Your compassion is admired by all. We make this urgent appeal, hoping for your attention. The Gansu Provincial Relief Association kowtows."

According to the petition from the Shanghai Pawnshop Trade Association, this bureau has learned that the order from the Shanghai Municipal Government to reduce pawnshop license fees by eight percent was only until the end of the 25th year and will not be extended. The request from the industry will not be considered. We hereby respond to your letter and request that you inform the members to comply with the regulations and pay the fees."

### Lawyers Association Again Asks for Attention to Provisional Execution

The Shanghai Lawyers Association, based on a proposal from its members, previously stated that courts were not paying attention to announcing provisional execution for illegal appeals and requested that the Ministry of Justice be petitioned to order all courts to pay attention to rigorously implementing provisional execution. Believing this to be true, the association submitted a petition to the Ministry of Justice, which responded that it could not be uniformly enforced. After further discussion, the association stated that while it was not possible to uniformly announce provisional execution for illegal appeals, the courts should pay attention to considering the circumstances and announce provisional execution for cases that should be provisionally executed to avoid delays in litigation. It is heard that the association has continued to petition the Ministry of Justice to order all levels of courts to pay attention.

### Exemption from Customs Inspection for Drug Transportation and Sales

Notice from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association to Members

The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association sent a letter to its members yesterday, stating that it is no longer necessary to fill out licenses when transporting goods to other locations. The letter read: "Regarding the matter of exempting drugs from inspection to alleviate commercial difficulties, this association previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Ministry of Finance.

It is inappropriate to delay the legitimate transportation of goods due to a small number of smuggled items, which would be detrimental to public health. Therefore, this ministry has temporarily exempted drugs from inspection and will monitor the situation. If necessary, further remedies will be considered. The aforementioned matter has been approved for implementation. You are hereby notified.' Therefore, as this matter was previously requested by the industry association and forwarded for exemption from drug inspection, it has been approved. We are now sending this letter to inform you that it is no longer necessary to fill out transportation and sales licenses and certificates when transporting goods to other locations."

### Solicitation of Articles for the Completion of Mr. Wan Jiye's Ancestral Hall and Tomb

Mr. Wan, whose name was Sitong, courtesy name Jiye, sobriquet Shiyuan, and posthumous title Zhenwen, was from Guanjiagans of Yin at the end of the Ming Dynasty. His family was known to the world for their four loyalists, three paragons of virtue, and one righteous person. His father, Tai, was the ancestor of Siming literature and taught the classics and history to his sons, allowing them to study with Huang Lizhou, each becoming famous in their own right, and Mr. Wan was the most outstanding among them. His brother, Sida, buried Zhang Cangshui's remains at Nanping. Mr. Wan was exceptionally intelligent, read widely, was well-versed in history, and wrote prolifically. He cultivated his reputation and was indifferent to fame and fortune. He did not accept the position of erudite scholar in the Qing Dynasty, but lamented the fall of his motherland and the imminent loss of literature. He participated in the Bureau of Compilation as a commoner for over twenty years, personally editing the Draft History of the Ming Dynasty in five hundred volumes, creating a special case for historical revision and initiating the Zhejiang school of history. Later generations who read his works not only understood the gradual decline of the Ming Dynasty due to foreign invasions but also spontaneously felt a sense of patriotism. He awakened the deaf and restored China through his writings. Mr. Wan promoted the national spirit through his writings, and his contribution was immense. His tomb is located on the hillside of Aoniaoyangguan in Chunhu West Zhongyi District, Fenghua. His descendants are scattered, and offerings have long been neglected. During the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, Xie Wufeng Si Gongsong first found it among the wilderness. There was a tombstone inscribed by Grand Secretary Wang Xuling, "Tomb of the Confucian Scholar Wan Jiye of Yin who Exemplified Learning," and a couplet by Hanlin Qiu Lian, "A pen of Ban and Ma, a commoner of Heaven and Earth." En Gong pitied its desolation and lack of inheritance, and invited Wu Kezhou Xun Dao of the same village and Liu Yutang Xun Dao Shao Cong and others, seven or eight people in total, to take turns making sacrifices and sweeping the tomb during Qingming. They once planned to raise funds to purchase sacrificial fields but were unsuccessful. After the death of these gentlemen, the sacrificial offerings ceased, and only the Xie family still maintained the intention. The year before last, the Yin people of the Nanlei Society initiated the restoration of the Baiyun Villa, the ancestral home of the Wan family. Now, the central government honors the sages of the past and has listed Mr. Wan as a local worthy. However, his tomb is located in a remote mountain village and is gradually being forgotten. Xie Engong's disciple, Ying Zhaosong, was concerned about this and urgently planned to repair the tomb to settle his spirit and build an ancestral hall to perpetuate his worship. He gathered fellow villagers from the former Ningbo prefecture and initiated the project, receiving support from famous figures in the country. Construction began in May of this year (the twenty-fifth year) and has now been successfully completed. The process of repairing the tomb and building the ancestral hall is briefly described below, so that learned gentlemen can gain some insight. I have always known that Mr. Wan devoted his energy to writing and created works to benefit the world, and I dare to respectfully offer this communication to seek his peaceful rest. As this matter concerns the commemoration of a wise man, I hope you will not hesitate to contribute your valuable insights.

㊀ Purchase of Land

Wan's tomb is located on the southern foothills of Aoniaoyangguan in Chunhu, Fenghua. The original area was quite narrow and insufficient to commemorate a local worthy. A considerable amount of mountain land has now been purchased around the left, right, and rear of the tomb, extending about three to four or six to seven zhang from the walls. Fourteen fields, totaling eight mu and one fen, were purchased in front of the tomb. In this way, there is considerable open space around the tomb, which can be used to set up altars and plant trees, enhancing the view. The ancestral hall is located at the Dongqiao Bridge in the north of Chunhu Town, with a total area of one mu and five fen, about fifteen zhang long from east to west and about ten zhang long from north to south. It is adjacent to Chunhu Elementary School, with a garden to the south and facing the stream. The surrounding mountains, including Jiufeng, Datong, Jin'e, and Chunhu Ao, encircle the four sides and can be seen from near and far.

㊁ Construction Project

The planned project for Wan's tomb included raising the tombstone, repairing the tomb enclosure, leveling the open space in front of the tomb, building a tomb passage archway, building roads, building bridges where there were streams, and building stone retaining walls where there were slopes. All of these were contracted out and completed in stages and have now been completed. The tombstone has been raised by one chi, and the inscriptions and couplets have been completely refreshed. What was once only found by feeling is now clearly visible. The ground in front of the tomb has been leveled with cement, with a width of four zhang and a depth of four zhang. A sacrificial table and two stone benches have been set up, also made of cement. Forty-odd zhang in front of the tomb, a cement archway has been built in a twenty-character shape, with a height of two zhang and four chi and a width of one zhang and one chi. The front is inscribed with the nine large characters "Tomb Passage of Local Worthy Wan Jiye" by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the rear is inscribed with the four characters "Noble Virtue and Integrity" by Chairman Lin. The four sides of the archway pillars are engraved with couplets by Zhuang Songfu, Chen Zhuo, Shen Changyou, Ying Zhaosong, and others. Zhuang's couplet reads, "The historical pen is worth a thousand troops, the teacher is immortal; a commoner for his whole life, later generations admire his grace." Chen's couplet reads, "His generation's writings remain in history, his offerings will last for a thousand years on famous mountains." Shen's couplet reads, "His writings hang in the universe, his integrity strengthens the lakes and mountains." Ying's couplet reads, "The teacher's tomb is close by, clearing the weeds; a heart of incense offering to the righteous history; the ancestral mounds stand tall, modeling the mountains and waters; a thousand years of offerings, admiring the fragrant spirit." "Teacher's tomb" refers to Xie Engong's tomb on the right mountain, and Ying's ancestral mounds are on the front mountain, hence the couplet. On the side of the road, a cement memorial arch has been erected, nine chi high, with the five large characters "Wan Township Kidney Tomb Road" engraved on the east, west, and south sides to indicate the location of the tomb. The circumference of the ancestral hall is seven zhang wide and nine zhang deep, divided into two courtyards, front and rear. The front courtyard has a gate in the middle, with side rooms on the left and right. There is open space in front, with tung and willow trees planted along the stream and holly trees planted along the roadside. Between the front and rear courtyards, there are several zhang of paved ground, planted with osmanthus trees in the middle and peach and plum trees in the surrounding gardens. The ground is covered with grass, and the scenery is quite secluded. The rear three rooms are the main hall, with the middle room being one zhang and seven chi wide and the side rooms being one zhang and five chi wide each. The height is two zhang and two chi, and the depth is one chi greater than the height. The three rooms are the same. Inside are the plaques "National Model" by Chairman Lin, "Noble Aspiration and Action" by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and "Seeking Aspiration and Achieving Dao" by Zhuang Songfu. There are couplets between the pillars by Chen Zhuo, Zhao Cisheng, Ying Zhaosong, Zhou Chu, Shen Changyou, and Sun Yizhi. Chen's couplet reads, "His historical pen flows through the ages, his writings ascend to the ranks of the left and right; a model to admire, his thousand-year integrity alongside Liu and Huang." Zhao's couplet reads, "Holding the pen like strict frost, a word of praise or condemnation, the historical talent of Ban and Ma establishes a tripod; abandoning office like discarding worn-out shoes, a life of simplicity, the Taoist learning of Liu and Huang is passed down." Ying's couplet reads, "His writings are on famous mountains, feeding on Yan Xi's righteousness, his attire and crown remain in the old country, his integrity is strong and high." Zhou's couplet reads, "The tripod shifts and the society changes, where to serve the country, documents await searching, only caring for the commoner to participate in the history bureau; the ancient tomb and new ancestral hall, the residing spirit finds its place, fragrant incense is offered forever, looking up to the portrait, worshiping the Confucian master." Shen's couplet reads, "Grieving for the separation from the old country, the affairs are true and the words are clear, the historical lineage can be inherited by Ban and Ma; shamed to eat the millet of foreign lands, his conduct is pure and his aspirations are bitter, his integrity is comparable to Yi Qi." Sun's couplet reads, "The rise and fall of the country are tied together, a generation's history preserves national righteousness; the new atmosphere of the lakes and mountains, a thousand years of people worship the commoner's honor." The three characters "Local Worthy Shrine" outside the main gate were written by Chen Qicai, the Director of the National Government's Accounting Office. The ancestral hall and tomb projects have all been completed.

㊂ Management Method

It is planned to set up twenty-odd mu of fields and establish a Management Committee for Mr. Wan Jiye's Ancestral Hall and Tomb. The income from the fields will be used for the expenses of sacrifice and repair. Every year on April 1st, the Management Committee will join with all the teachers and students of Chunhu Elementary School to make sacrifices and sweep the ancestral hall and tomb. On the same day, a meeting will be held to discuss matters and report on income and expenditure accounts.

Please send your works to our office on the third floor of the Ningbo Zhejiang East Bank by February. Launched by the Construction Office of Mr. Wan Jiye's Ancestral Hall and Tomb

### Ideal Team Wins by a Narrow Margin in the First Inter-Port Football Trial

Wins 5-3, Barely Defeating the Royal Ulster Rifles, Trailing 1-2 in the First Half

In the inter-port football trial match, the Ideal team played its first trial match against the Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR) from Shanghai yesterday at the Shenyuan Grounds. Due to the absence of center back Ma Shan'er, Bocchis of the French Chamber was selected to fill his place, resulting in many loopholes. The RUR had a strong momentum, taking a 2-0 lead within ten minutes. The first half ended with the RUR leading 2-1. The Ideal team relied on their efforts in the second half to win 5-3 by a narrow margin. Although there was a line of cars in front of the Shenyuan Grounds yesterday, only two-thirds of the one-dollar seats were filled, and the half-dollar seats were even more sparse, totaling less than 2,000 people. The battle situation is as follows:

Royal Ulster Rifles Take the Lead

After choosing sides, the Ideal team had the advantage of the sun at their backs and the right to kick off. The Shenyuan field was still muddy yesterday, making it difficult for both sides to control the ball after the start. The RUR seized the opportunity to advance, advancing on the left. Bocchis stumbled, and Bao Saizhong fell to the ground, unable to get up, in a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, Feng Yunyou arrived in time to send the ball out for a corner kick, avoiding disaster. The Ideal team counterattacked, with a pass from Little Walter reaching the goal, but narrowly missing success. At the five-minute mark, Prome of the RUR went deep, passed to the left wing, and Creighton crossed the ball. Bocchis stepped on it, unexpectedly turning it into an own goal, gifting the first goal. The inter-port wings launched very active counterattacks, but without progress. At the ten-minute mark, Zha Xu dribbled the ball poorly, and it was intercepted midway. The entire RUR team attacked, and Summer shot. Bao Saizhong fumbled the ball out, and the two defenders stood there blankly, allowing Morris to tap the ball into the empty net. The Ideal team conceded two goals within ten minutes. They counterattacked aggressively, and Robertson got a chance to shoot, hitting the goalpost and bouncing back onto the goal line. McNally re-kicked it out, but it was ruled invalid, resulting in a fruitless effort. Stalemated until the twenty-fifth minute, James Walter crossed the ball from the baseline, hitting the right post and the goalkeeper's body. Sun Jinshun rushed in and deflected the ball, penetrating the bottom of the net, making it 1-2. After that, the Ideal team had several shots on goal. Once, Tuile opened a corner kick, landing right in front of the goal, but the goalkeeper was not in position, and Yaz used his body to stop it, and Creighton cleared the danger. Once, Tuile crossed the ball, and Little Walter left the goal open, but Sun Jinshun's flat shot was sharp and fast, but it was caught by McNally. The first half passed with this score, with the RUR leading 2-1.

Ideal Team Wins

After the restart, the Ideal team immediately progressed from the right. The initial attempt failed, but after just one minute, Greenberg advanced sharply and passed far to the center. Sun Jinshun, fifteen yards from the goal, bent down and hooked the ball, and the RUR goalkeeper was on the left, so the ball grazed the ground and entered the right corner of the net. The Ideal team tied the score at 2-2. The RUR counterattacked, and Creighton crossed the ball. Feng jumped up and headed it out, but the ball was intercepted by Chambers, who immediately shot, landing on the side of the left post. Bao Saizhong slapped it out with both hands, fortunately avoiding a disaster, extremely dangerous. The Ideal team's offense intensified, but Walter's shot went wide. Zha Xu received help from Zhen He and shot from 30 yards away. Although the kick was strong, it missed by a mile. At the fifteen-minute mark, Little Walter passed far, and Greenberg intercepted the ball under the goal and kicked it in, giving the Ideal team a 3-2 lead. However, after the kickoff from the center line, the RUR had swept over, with two forwards attacking in the center. Morris shot, but the ball was very slow, and Bao Saizhong came out to meet it, but was too careless and stumbled. The ball hovered on the goal line, and Morris rushed up and tapped it in, tying the score again at 3-3, just one minute after the previous goal. After that, the RUR became vigorous again, and the Ideal team's area was frequently in danger. After a long stalemate, they finally escaped the predicament. Robertson advanced to the opponent's goal, but lacked support and missed a good opportunity. Fortunately, shortly after, Greenberg charged in, and McNally came out to meet him, leaving the goal empty, and Greenberg tapped the ball into the empty net, giving the Ideal team a 4-3 lead again. The RUR left-back Faleman was also injured while blocking Greenberg's ball. After that, the RUR's attack was very fierce, but fortunately, two minutes before the end, Robertson went deep alone and, taking advantage of the two defenders coming out to meet him, kicked hard, bouncing off the top of the net and into the corner of the net. Shortly after, the whistle blew, and the Ideal team won 5-3 by a narrow margin.

### Yu You and Surveying Teams Advance to the Finals of the Zilin Cup

Eliminating the Aurora and Russian Teams

Yesterday's Zilin Cup semi-finals saw Yu You and Aurora, who had tied in the Group B league, meet at Jiaozhou Park. Yu You had a strong momentum. After about a quarter of an hour, left-winger Ge Xizhuo opened the scoring. Then, left-winger Shen Shiqi scored from a penalty kick, taking a 2-0 lead in the first half. After the restart, left-winger Shen Baigui scored another goal. After that, Yu You had many opportunities, while Aurora's offense was also strong, with its forwards advancing very quickly. However, Yu You's defense was effective, and they were not taken advantage of, so they eliminated Aurora 3-0. In another Zilin Cup semi-final, the Russian team played against the Surveying team, still held at Hongkou Park. The Russian team ranked first in the Group B league, while the Surveying team was unknown. Before the game, it was predicted that the Surveying team would not be able to withstand the Russian team's attack. However, the result of the game was that the Russian team was too careless and was defeated by the Surveying team 4-1. In the final week, Yu You and the Surveying team will compete for the championship. The lineups are as follows:

### Jindes Primary Advances to the Finals of the Junior Cup

Eliminating Aurora Savaria

The Junior Cup football, like the Zilin Cup, held its semi-finals yesterday. Those who met were Aurora and Jinde from the Morning League, and Savaria and Junior from Group C. As a result of the game, Jinde, although encountering a strong opponent, was able to cope calmly with a higher skill, winning four goals in the first half and making it four to two in the second half. The overall result was to eliminate Aurora with eight to two and gain the right to the final. Another group, Savaria, although winning six consecutive victories and ranking first in the Group C league, was surprisingly eliminated by the Junior Association, which had suffered four defeats, with six to four. Jinde will compete with the Junior Association for the Junior Cup championship in the final week. Although Junior is one level higher, Jinde is full of strength, and it is feared that Junior will find it difficult to touch its edge. The Jinde lineup yesterday was as follows

### Shanghai's Financial Situation Over the Past Year

— Wei Youfei

(1) General Financial Market Conditions for the Year

Observing the economic surface phenomena of the entire country, if we consider the 24th year of the Republic [1935] as a period of panic outbreak, then undoubtedly, the national economy in the 25th year [1936] has shown a slight upturn from the period of economic depression. This situation can be seen from the financial market conditions in Shanghai over the past year. During this year, the rise and fall of financial institutions were very rare; interbank lending rates remained stable and relaxed throughout the year. Industrial and commercial activity saw a turnaround compared to the previous year, but was not particularly prosperous. In short, all financial dynamics throughout the year were in a state of flatness, and both the supply and demand of finance were sluggish.

Before describing Shanghai's financial market conditions over the past year, I will first introduce the economic changes within the country.

In terms of finance, following the New Currency Decree, in February of the 25th year, the authorities announced a plan to consolidate government bonds, which involved issuing unified government bonds worth 1.46 billion yuan to redeem previously issued domestic government bonds and treasury bills; and separately issuing reconstruction government bonds worth 34 million yuan to strengthen the financial foundation and balance national treasury revenues and expenditures. The total amount was 1.8 billion yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, issued successively on February 1st and March 1st. The issuance of this huge amount of government bonds was unprecedented in the history of Chinese government bonds. Consolidating many uneven government bonds under a unified name was also an unprecedented move in government bond history. At the end of June, the national budget for the 25th year was announced, along with the declaration that emphasis would be placed on the collection of direct taxes. In August, the Income Tax Regulations were promulgated and implemented starting January of the 26th year [1937]. In addition, direct taxes such as inheritance tax were being prepared for collection.

In terms of currency, two agreements were established, both confirmed by foreign news reports. One was the Sino-American Silver Agreement in May. Although the content of the agreement was not officially announced, based on information gathered from various sources, it was roughly that the United States would purchase 50 million to 70 million ounces of silver from China, and the proceeds would be deposited in the United States as China's foreign exchange stabilization fund. The other was the Sino-British Credit Loan Agreement in October. Its content was also not officially announced. Initial rumors suggested that Britain would lend China £5 million to £10 million to promote trade between the two countries and stabilize exchange rates. At that time, when China's diplomacy was tense, the establishment of the Sino-British loan gave major jealousy and attention to all related countries. In the end, it was announced that it was only a type of export credit lending, but undoubtedly it had considerable power in stabilizing China's exchange rate against the British pound. Summarizing these two agreements, the former can be said to be China's exchange fund in the United States, and the latter is China's exchange fund in the United Kingdom, both providing a stable foundation for the new currency system.

In terms of the general economy, it is especially noteworthy that the smuggling situation in North China expanded. After April and May of the 25th year, smuggling became even more severe. Not only was the tax revenue of North China greatly affected, but the expansion of smuggling areas also affected the tax revenue of the whole country. The dumping of smuggled goods posed a major threat to national industries. The textile industry in the Tianjin area, which was slightly larger in scale, was almost entirely annexed by foreign capital, partly due to the benefit of smuggling.

In the first month of this year, international trade once showed a surplus, breaking the new record of 50 years of trade history, but the numbers were very small. This year's national crops, such as rice, wheat, and cotton, were fortunately all harvested abundantly. The prices of agricultural products were also still stable due to overseas demand, so the rural economy was more active than the previous year.

In March, the Shanghai Bills Clearing House was established, and in August, the currency consolidation of Guangdong Province was completed. These were all important measures in the national finance this year.

Because the national economy showed calmness, but at its core, all the panic factors had not yet been completely eliminated, the Shanghai financial market showed a phenomenon of sluggishness throughout the year. After autumn, although part of it was driven by the slightly active rural economy, the reflection on finance was still very subtle, only adding a few opportunities for future growth. Because the most important element of the revival of urban finance in China is the increase in rural demand for commodities, which in turn restores the industrial and commercial credit system and increases the active power of finance. However, after this panic, whether in planning or strength, industry, commerce and finance did not dare to expand the scope excessively, so even if rural purchasing power gradually recovered, the superficial prosperity of finance was still very far away.

Due to habitual relations, the financial season of previous years still could not escape the state of ending every three months of the lunar calendar, but this year it was unexpectedly invisible. This is because the financial demand relationship and the environment created its long-term stagnation, and all superficial forms seem to be very stable.

From January to March this quarter, late January was exactly the end of the 24th year. Because of the implementation of the new currency system, the panic of lack of chips was eliminated, so the end of the 24th year, which was expected to be very unsafe, finally passed very safely. The amount of banknotes issued increased from 400 million yuan in October of the previous year to 800 million yuan (including the number of miscellaneous banknotes exchanged), which shows the general need. February is the first month of the lunar calendar, which is a very leisurely month. In March, interbank lending rates were slightly more active, but financial institutions still advocated contraction for this year's lending. After the announcement of the government bond consolidation plan, the price of government bonds fell due to the reduction in subsequent government bond yields. The reserve of silver decreased compared to previous years due to shipment abroad. Since October of last year, overseas silver prices have remained at around 20 pence. According to general observation, it is probably because the United States is unwilling to buy silver in London, so as to prevent China from completely selling silver and becoming a non-silver-using country, or even joining the sterling bloc. Because if the price of silver falls, it will be more expensive for China to sell silver and exchange it for pounds. Here, the announcement of the establishment of the Sino-American Silver Agreement can already be seen.

In March, the Shanghai Bank Bills Clearing House was established, increasing credit chips in the financial market, which will naturally promote the discounting business. The Farmers Bank of China was also ordered by the Ministry of Finance to issue 100 million yuan in banknotes and invest 50 million yuan in rural areas.

April is the small end of industrial and commercial long-term lending, and the market situation is still very stable. Interbank lending rates were slightly more active at the beginning of the month, but in general they were very stable, which is incomparable to the high level of the same period in previous years. After the establishment of the Sino-American Silver Agreement in May, the world silver market became stable again, and China's foreign debt also rose in the overseas market. In June, due to the gradual expansion of smuggling in North China, the entire foreign exchange was affected; and the news of changes in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces caused the market prices of domestic and foreign government bonds to fall. Silver continued to be shipped out, and although the reserve decreased, because silver in the country is only used as a legal currency reserve, it does not have a direct impact on the market's chips. However, silver from other ports continued to be shipped in. This quarter is the time when spring cocoons enter the market, and the three banks of the Central Bank of China, the Republic of China, and the Bank of Communications jointly sponsored a lending syndicate of 30 million yuan. A total of 19 banks and one native bank participated.

After July, due to the good harvest in rural areas and the promotion of sales of various goods, the market situation showed a slight activity, but the real estate business still maintained the sluggish situation of the past few years without any improvement. Although Shanghai's silver reserves were imported, more were exported to the United States for use as foreign exchange stabilization funds. After the situation in Guangdong was stabilized, the authorities re-announced the plan to reform the Guangdong currency, and from then on, Guangdong Haoyang was also on the unified road. At the end of September, France abandoned the gold standard, and the price of gold in Shanghai once rose to more than 1,160 yuan, which was the new high price after the currency reform.

From October to December, October was again the end of long-term lending, but because of the lack of transactions and the abundant harvest of crops, the market appeared to be abundant, and there was no longer the tension of previous years. After the news of the Sino-British loan agreement came, the general public was more optimistic about the future of China's commercial finance. The prices of goods in Shanghai have been rising day by day since October, and the upward trend has been even more severe after November. Yarn, cotton, rice, wheat, and wool fabrics have seen even more amazing increases. After December, prices were even more active. The price of yarn once rose to 268 yuan, which was the new high price since the yarn market. In mid-December, due to the Xi'an Incident, the market situation had a tense reaction, but the process was still good.

In short, the financial market situation during this year was loose throughout the year. The reason is, on the one hand, that the increase in chips after the currency reform eliminated the phenomenon of currency tightening. On the other hand, due to the undeveloped industry, the need for finance is extremely idle. The promotion of farmers' purchasing power, although it is one of the reasons for the rise in prices, it is obvious that it exceeds the component of purchasing power expansion, and it cannot be said to be a scene of economic recovery. Therefore, the revival of the financial market situation is not something that can be seen in a short period of time. The following is the interbank lending rate situation throughout the year: (unit points)

(2) Legal Tender Issuance, Exchange Rates, and Prices

Due to Shanghai's special importance in the country, the amount of legal tender issued by Shanghai banks can clearly show the state of most chip activities. Here, I will first introduce the process of legal tender issuance, exchange rates, and prices over the past year:

Legal Tender Issuance, Exchange Rates, and Price Indices Over the Past Year

The above legal tender issuance amount, the customs gold is outside, the issuing banks include the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, four banks, Siming Bank, Commercial Bank, Kenye Bank, China Farmers' and Workers' Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China. The date used is the last inspection report of each month.

As can be seen from the table, the amount of legal tender issued is increasing month by month, from January to December, it probably increased to about 45%. However, this number cannot be used as an absolute standard, because since the currency reform, the silver in the hands of the people has been gradually recovered by the central bank, then the amount of banknotes issued will naturally increase. Therefore, since there is no way to grasp how much circulation there was before the currency reform, there is no way to judge how much it has increased to date.

From the external price of currency (foreign exchange) and the internal price (prices), a trend of gradual decline and gradual rise can be seen, but the degree of price rise is greater than the fall in exchange rates. The above is the overall foreign exchange index. If we separate the foreign exchange situation of each country, then the exchange rate of the British pound is particularly stable throughout the year. Why is the price rise more severe than the foreign exchange rate fall? It can be clearly said that it is the result of the latter being managed by the authorities, and in fact the buying and selling of foreign exchange is slightly added or subtracted from the listing price.

The price index cited here is only the wholesale price index. Its ups and downs are relatively slow. If we separate each major commodity, then the upward trend of prices is even more obvious. The process of price increase this year can probably be divided into two phases? One phase is the first quarter of the first half of the year in April, and the second half of the year is after October. And the upward trend of the latter period has caused significant attention and impact in the business community. In general, industry and commerce have indeed shown a few signs of activity due to rising prices. However, because the price increase is not entirely for real needs; and industrial and commercial activities are extremely weak after a long period of hardship, so from the perspective of weighing the pros and cons, it seems that the bad influence is greater than the good influence, not to mention that prices are still rising? What is cited here are the four standard commodities in Shanghai: yarn, cotton, flour, and wheat:

Table of Yarn, Cotton, Flour, and Wheat Prices Over the Past Year (Unit: Yuan)

The upward trend shown here is different from the upward trend of wholesale prices, that is, it has been rising steadily from beginning to end. Taking cotton yarn as an example, in previous years, the price of bitter yarn was too low and the price of cotton was too high, making yarn mills unprofitable; this year, not only was the price of cotton not low, but the price of yarn also had an amazing increase. In mid-December, the price of yarn also created a new peak at any time, combining the price of cotton into the price of yarn, not only not losing money, but also making a profit. As for flour and wheat, they also show new high prices that have not been seen in previous years, and they are still rising.

The special upward trend of prices can be divided into several aspects. The first is naturally due to needs. If the needs are great, the price will naturally rise; but the needs mentioned here cannot point out real consumption needs or artificial needs (speculation and hoarding). The second is due to production. The production of cotton has risen due to the reduction in the harvest of American cotton, and wheat has risen due to increased exports. In addition, factors such as the world supply and demand situation and the stimulus of legal tender naturally also account for a considerable part.

After the sudden outbreak of the Xi'an Incident, prices changed dramatically. Due to people's panic, the state of capital flight was particularly obvious. The price of gold rushed out of the 1,170 yuan mark, and about 10 million yuan was used to purchase British and American foreign exchange. Flour, wheat, yarn, cotton, and food all rose sharply. Under the strict management of the authorities, foreign exchange was still able to maintain stability, but the reaction of prices was unstoppable.

Looking at the issuance amount over the past year, it is expanding, foreign exchange is stable, and prices are rising. Although the price increase has the possibility of stimulating industrial and commercial prosperity; but in fact, China's economy as a whole is still extremely weak, and the increase in purchasing power is minimal; although prices can rise due to needs, the extreme price increase can reduce needs. Therefore, the current high prices of flour, wheat, yarn, and cotton, as well as the high prices of other goods, cannot be considered a normal result, so I hope that the authorities will have the necessary management.

(3) Important Commodities and Import and Export Trade

Shanghai also occupies a leading position in the country's international trade. The trade volume of Shanghai port often accounts for 50% to 60% of the trade volume. This is because Shanghai has special convenience in national transportation. Therefore, whether it is import or export, it must be collected in Shanghai. From the situation of Shanghai's import and export trade, we can know the prototype of the national trade situation. The honor and disgrace of various important commodities can also be regarded as the prototype of the honor and disgrace of general commodities in the country. Now, I will first introduce the situation of the whole year's commodities, and then introduce the situation of the whole year's import and export trade in Shanghai port:

(1) Silk The silk price for the whole year was better in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. Although the export volume of silk this year was less than last year, the value was more, due to the rise in silk prices. In January, the highest price of high-end factories reached 915 yuan, which was the highest price since 19 years [1930]. The countries with the most exports are the United States, India, and Japan. In the domestic silk market, the Jiangzhe area is more active due to the support of farmer loans and the higher silk prices, but the output for the whole year is not much.

(2) Tea The price of tea for the whole year was higher between June and July. The average price of Qimen (black tea) rose to 197 yuan in May, and the average price of Zhenmei (green tea) rose to 37 yuan in July, which was the high price in recent years. The output was also more than last year. However, the amount of exports was more silent than in previous years. Morocco is the first country to export to, and Russia is the second.

(3) Cotton This year, China's cotton production had a bumper harvest. According to the latest estimate, it was more than 14 million dans, which was 6 million dans more than last year, which was the highest number in recent years. The price of cotton was smaller in the first half of the year and better in the second half of the year, which was higher than in previous years. Imports decreased and exports increased throughout the year. Japan is the first place for exports.

(4) Cotton Yarn The price of yarn this year was better in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, so yarn mills were able to profit in the second half of the year. The highest price of yarn was 268 yuan, which was the highest price since the market. The production volume this year was very small, and the high price of the market was mostly due to the situation. The total output was slightly less than in previous years.

(5) Rice and Wheat The country had a bumper harvest this year. According to reports, Anhui had a 14% harvest, Jiangxi also had a 14% harvest, and Hubei had a 10% harvest, which was more than 30% more than 21 and 22 years. Wheat production increased by 17% compared to last year, barley increased by 8%, and the harvests of soybeans and wheat were also called bumper harvests. The market price of rice and wheat was higher than in previous years, especially in the second half of the year. Imports of rice and wheat decreased and exports increased throughout the year.

In short, the output of various commodities increased this year compared to last year, and the market price also increased compared to last year, and the trend of sharp increase in the second half of the year was even more intensified. Therefore, hoarding merchants were able to profit.

As for the trade situation of Shanghai port over the past year, the list is as follows:

Shanghai Import and Export Trade Volume Over the Past Year (Unit: Thousand Yuan)

Summarizing the trade situation for 11 months, both import and export situations increased compared to last year, and the months of increase were slightly higher in the period of April and May and the period of August and September. The highest amount of exports was in August, and the highest amount of imports was in May, and the month with the largest trade deficit was April. According to the situation in previous years, April, May, August, and September are the peak seasons for import and export. Because on the one hand, there are exports of silk, tea, rice, and grains, which can be exchanged for many foreign goods. The trade surplus in January was the only situation in 50 years, which once caused great attention from scholars across the country. Now, after analyzing the past facts, the reason for the trade surplus is due to the slight increase in exports and the extreme decrease in imports, which is a coincidence and does not have a significant impact on the entire international trade.

Exports have increased more and imports have decreased more over the past year, but if converted into gold prices, the change is very small. Another noteworthy fact is that smuggling is still very serious. Although Shanghai is not a famous smuggling port, the active smuggling can naturally reduce the regular needs, thus reducing Shanghai's imports. (According to the Jianghai Customs, the total revenue for the whole year decreased by 258,000 yuan compared to 24 years) Another worrying thing is that the crops had a bumper harvest this year and the prices were very stable, then the purchasing power of farmers can naturally be slightly increased. Historical facts tell us that the so-called increase in purchasing power often refers to the increase in the ability to purchase imported goods. The active import business can promote the active commercial transactions between urban and rural areas. Therefore, the problem of future trade deficits is a big problem.

(4) The Rise and Fall of Finance and Commerce

The financial business this year is much more stable than last year, and it shows stability in the same way as the financial market situation. There is a saying that the Central Bank has been changed to the Central Reserve Bank, and the following eight regulations have been established: (1) Central Reserve Bank, (2) Exchange Bank, (3) Industrial Bank, (4) Trust Bank, (5) Real Estate Mortgage Bank, (6) Savings Bank, (7) Agricultural Bank, (8) Industrial Bank. The development of the banking business shows more sharpness. From these eight banking regulations, it can be seen that the concentration of banking power in the future is more expected. In fact, the capital and deposits of banks this year have a tendency to concentrate in state-owned banks.

The new financial institutions established this year are:

(1) Central Savings Association, belonging to the Central Trust Bureau, opened in March.

(2) Shengda Trust Company, with a capital of 1 million yuan, opened in July.

(3) Guangdong Bank resumed business in December.

The financial institutions that stopped operating are:

(1) Tongyi Trust Company, (2) Meihua Bank, (3) Hua'an Bank, (4) Guotai Bank.

The financial institutions that increased capital and reorganized are:

(1) Zhizhong Bank increased capital by 500,000 yuan, (2) Silk Industry Bank, jointly operated with Jiangsu Bank, (3) Siming Bank increased capital, (4) China Exchange Jiangsu and Zhejiang Banks merged.

The bank money houses loans of more than one million yuan established this year include (1) Electric Administration Government Bonds mortgage loans 6 million yuan, (2) Zhejiang-Jiangxi Nanping section loans 10 million yuan, (3) Jiangsu-Zhejiang spring cocoon loans 30 million yuan, (4) Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou road loans 2 million yuan, (5) Zhejiang Silk Control Association loans 5 million yuan, (6) Zhejiang Provincial Government loans 4 million yuan, (7) Ministry of Railways loans 3 million yuan, (8) Hunan Provincial loans 1.4 million yuan, (9) Guangdong Provincial loans 8 million yuan, (10) Hunan Rice Mortgage Bank Group 10 million yuan, etc.

The general business situation is generally carried out in the following ways: (1) Individuals tend to carry out in groups, (2) The scope of business advocates shrinking, (3) The goal of operation is cautious. Therefore, the establishment of large loans is more than small loans, and political loans jointly operated by state-owned banks are more than small industrial and commercial loans.

The general industrial and commercial situation is also slightly improved compared to the 24th year. Now, I will introduce the reports from the China Credit Investigation Institute and various parties, then the number of industrial and commercial bankruptcies in the current year for nine months is roughly as follows: (Before April, according to the Monthly Economic Statistics, after May, according to the China Credit Investigation Institute.)

Number of Industrial and Commercial Closures in Shanghai

23rd year 510 5th month of 25th year 36

24th year 1,065 6th month 78

1st month of 25th year 108 7th month 71

2nd month 74 8th month 58

3rd month 19 9th month 59

4th month 25 Total of 2,103 in three years

According to the observations on the numbers, the number of industrial and commercial bankruptcies is much less than last year. However, after June, the number of bankruptcies suddenly increased. The China Credit Investigation Institute studied the reasons for this and said that "although the number of new creations is considerable; however, the number of bankruptcies will double, and there are even more who have reorganized or liquidated their businesses in less than three or four months, because the purchasing power of the market has not increased, and the turnover of finance is still stagnant." According to the survey, the number of new industrial and commercial creators in September reached 52, breaking the new record for each month of this year. The institute said that the reason is: "This kind of deformed prosperity is due to the recent appearance of a large number of so-called guide societies. The fatigue of industry and the gradual decline of the sales industry are still a major obstacle to the prosperity of the market. However, comparing this year's situation with the same period last year, the industrial and commercial situation in this city this year is actually much better than last year." Probably after the summer of this year, the purchasing power of the market was slightly active, so general business operators wanted to take the opportunity to develop, but because the environment was bad, they still inevitably failed. This is the reason for the increase in the number of new creations and closures this year.

Although this year is still far from economic prosperity, there are examples of increased purchasing power. For example, the production index released by the Central Bank shows that it is generally rising. This kind of number is obtained based on unified tax calculation, which includes the numbers of foreign merchants, but the increase in output, in any case, the consumption is also increasing, which is inevitable.

According to the report of Shanghai public utilities, the commerce in the Shanghai Special Zone in October of this year had an upward trend, because the consumption of electricity and water was increasing. The use of electricity in commerce increased by 9.4% compared to the same period last year, and the industry increased by 15.3%. The use of tap water in commerce increased by 35% compared to the same period last year, and the use in commerce increased by 23%. The consumption of tap water and telephones is also increasing. The goal of making this report may be to prove that Shanghai is gradually prospering and increase the collection fees of public utilities cannot prove it. Because the development of public utilities, like the above production index, includes the numbers of foreign merchants in China, which is still very far from the word prosperity, but the increase in public consumption is undoubtedly increasing work, and the work is for production. Although the producers are not necessarily domestic factories, the consumers are undoubtedly Chinese.

Another proof is the number of check exchanges. The amount of check exchanges in the first ten months of this year increased compared to last year. If compared with the same period last year in October, the increase reached about 40%.

The number of government bond transactions has decreased sharply since the issuance of unified government bonds. The number of government bond transactions in October was only 220 million yuan, while it was 520 million yuan in the same period last year, a decrease of more than 50%. This is because the interest on government bonds has obviously been reduced after the consolidation.

Real estate transactions are still very quiet. Recently, the population of Shanghai has reached more than 3.8 million, which is 300,000 more than in the "January 28" era, but the need for real estate is still not active. Except for the unique amount of transactions in January due to the stimulus of legal tender (3.89 million yuan), the total number of real estate transactions for the whole year was only 12 million yuan, a decrease of 2.5 million yuan compared to the 24th year.

Due to the inactivity of government bonds and real estate, we can infer that the status of the two investments in the financial market is not important.

(5) Criticism of the Financial Market Situation Over the Past Year

The financial market situation in Shanghai over the past year is better than last year on the surface. The display of this improvement is that the financial market situation is calm and uneventful, and the purchasing power of the market has been slightly promoted. The former is the result of the financial institutions adhering to the scope after the panic, and the latter is the promotion of the stability of agricultural product prices, the bumper harvest in rural areas, and the improvement of the world economy. On the surface, the financial panic situation has turned upwards.

From the perspective of China's economic essence, it is a country with a long-term trade deficit. The year with more imported goods is also the year of superficial economic prosperity. The more imported goods, the more industrial and commercial operators can profit, and the financial market situation tends to be active. This is because Shanghai is a commercial port, and Chinese farmers buy foreign goods from cities, which is what the countries implementing silver policies call "the purchasing power of silver-using countries in the Far East." Under this economic prosperity, the rural areas are of course good, the cities are also very good, and the commercial and financial businesses are also good, but it only makes the national debt status increasingly heavier.

The foreign exchange after the new currency system has been very stable over the past year. However, long-term stability must have smooth international balance of payments as the only condition. These are all things that should be paid attention to when talking about China's economic recovery.

The dramatic upward trend of prices over the past year contains many reasons, and the impact of the sharp rise and fall, from the perspective of China's national economy, whether it is the cost of living index or the cost of raw materials, the former is related to the livelihood of civilians, and the latter is related to the progress of industry, which are very unfavorable. Our ideal is not a low price or a high price policy, but the stability of prices.

After the purchasing power of farmers is promoted, it has created the superficial prosperity of the economy, which is a way out for the financial business that is responsible for financing commercial funds. But this cannot be taken as an optimistic thing. Because we of course also hope for China's economic independence, rather than growing forever in a semi-colonial land. Judging from the current national situation, maintaining the economic prosperity of a semi-colonial land is probably a problem in the first place. (December 22nd)

### Telegrams Reporting Two Losses in Beijing

Defeated by the Central Team with a score of 21 to 22, Defeated by the Military Academy Team with a score of 25 to 53

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Shanghai Xintong Basketball Team played against the strong Beijing Military Academy Team at the Amateur Athletic Association at 3:00 PM. The weather was sunny and warm, and the audience numbered no less than 3,000. The referees were Jin Zhaojun and Xu Zheng. Before the match, a "warm-up act" was performed by the Reporter Team and the "28" Team. The "28" Team was the champion of the Zhongda Shijie Cup and had strong strength. It defeated the Xintong Central Team on the 9th, and had previously been defeated by "28". However, the Reporter Team, although nominally an old soldiers team, were in reality all veterans of many years. As a result, the Reporter Team won 36 to 37. After Xintong's recent defeat, their morale was low. For the first five minutes, they were able to hold on, but after that, it was all the Military Academy's game. The Military Academy players, under the command of Wang Yuzeng, attacked and defended with ease, and Xintong was at a complete loss. In the first half, the Military Academy scored 20 points, while Xintong only scored 3 points. After the break, the Military Academy continued to maintain an absolute advantage. Wang Yuzeng and Bao Wenpei's beautiful passing and accurate shooting won a lot of applause. Afterwards, Carson made repeated efforts, but it was like a single hand clapping, and he only scored a few points, barely holding up the facade. As a result, the Military Academy won by a large margin, 53 to 25. The improvement of the basketball standard in Beijing can be confirmed from this.

The Amateur Association held a banquet for the players of each team that evening, and the Xintong team members returned to Shanghai by the late train.

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Shanghai basketball team leader, the Xintong Pirates, came to Beijing for their second expedition. The entire team of six was led by Carson. They arrived in Beijing at 1:00 PM on the 9th and played against the Central Team at the Amateur Athletic Association at 8:30 PM. Although the weather was severely cold, there were still more than 800 spectators. The Central Team moved quickly, and Li Zhenzhong was especially elusive, making it impossible for Xintong to defend. The Central Team led all the way, and finally defeated Xintong by one point, which was very gratifying. Although Xintong, under the leadership of Carson in the second half, tried hard to counterattack, it was ultimately in vain. The performance of both sides in this game was extremely exciting. Li Zhenzhong and Tang Shaohua's wonderful passing won a lot of applause. In the first five minutes, the Central Team took the lead with a score of 14 to 4, a difference of as much as ten points. The first half ended with 14 to 8. As a result, the final score was 22 to 21. Xintong will play against the Military Academy at 3:00 PM on the 10th. Judging from their strength in this game, they are probably not the Military Academy's opponent, as the Military Academy has many national players such as Wang Yuzeng and Wang Shixuan, and their strength is extremely strong. The lineup for this game is as follows:

Central Team Name Fouls Points

Center Tang Shaohua 4 8

### Jiangwan Cross-Country Run Second Practice Yesterday

Full distance of 6 miles

The annual Jiangwan Cross-Country Team Championship, organized by the Western People's Sports Association, will be held in early April. Yesterday at 10:30 AM, the second practice run started at the west gate of Hongkou Park. The full distance was 6 miles.

Although Mackenzie had signed up, he was absent yesterday due to business. A total of 84 players participated. However, due to the rain and snow of the previous day, the rural fields and roads were extremely muddy. However, the players were in high spirits and achieved excellent results, with no one dropping out midway. This year's British Army Royal Artillery team has three famous players. Although the others are slightly less strong, they have won championships in the United Kingdom. It is expected that the competition for this year's championship will be a three-way battle between Royal Artillery, Yi Bing, and Shanghai United. Other teams such as Hongkou, the French Army stationed in Shanghai, and Mackenzie are still strong and should not be ignored. In the future, practice will continue every Sunday, even in rain or snow.

### Training for Promotion of National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy

National Language Society Regularly Opens Classes

The National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy was proposed by Tan Yaozong, a member of the National Language Unification Association, at the fourth transportation conference of the Ministry of Transportation in Beijing in the 11th year of the Republic of China, with the "Proposal to Change Railway Telegraphy to the National Phonetic Alphabet", which was passed for trial implementation. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, work began on compiling and printing the "National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy Compilation". In the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education announced the standard National Phonetic Alphabet. The Ministry of Transportation then sent technician Chen Yiyu to Ping to review and revise it in conjunction with the National Language Society. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation instructed the Hebei and other telegraph administrations, saying, "The revised National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy Compilation" is about to be completed. The method for receiving and calculating telegrams using the National Phonetic Alphabet has also been formulated and will be announced soon. However, there are very few personnel in each bureau who are familiar with the National Phonetic Alphabet and the spelling of the national language, which will be very inconvenient when the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy is implemented in the future. Attached is the outline for the training of personnel in the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy and the table of symbols for the National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams, instructing the personnel handling telegraphic and business matters to receive thorough training in order to prepare. Article 2 of the training outline stipulates, "The reading and writing of the first and second styles of the National Phonetic Alphabet, and the standard spelling of commonly used single characters, words, and sentences in the national language, the National Phonetic Alphabet spelling shall be based on the National Phonetic Alphabet Commonly Used Characters Compilation edited by the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee of the Ministry of Education and published by the Commercial Press. The training shall be completed in two months." It is learned that the so-called first style of the National Phonetic Alphabet in the order is the phonetic symbols, and the second style is the National Romanization. The Hebei Telegraph Administration has scheduled to open training classes after the New Year holidays. The National Language Promotion Committee of the Ministry of Education has also scheduled to open classes in the National Language Printing House on Xidan Street starting from January 18, dividing into two classes: the first style (phonetic symbols) and the second style (National Romanization). Each class will be held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and will be completed in three weeks. Those who pass the examination will be given certificates for dissemination. Registration has been advertised in the National Language Society of the City Party Department.

### First Graduation Ceremony of the New China Medical College Research Institute

The New China Medical College Research Institute in this city held its first graduation ceremony yesterday (the 10th) at 2:00 PM at the new site of the institute, Yuqing Bridge, Hutai Road.

The Bond Market Was Very Stable This Week

Due to the New Year holiday, the public bond market traded for only five days throughout the week, and the environment was very quiet. The market situation was very stable. The people's hearts were quite calm due to the quiet situation, and both the bulls and the bears were quiet and watching. In and out transactions became more chaotic and faded. However, some bulls have been slowly selling, causing market prices to tend to decline from hovering. However, the trend is still very stable, and there is unlikely to be a major change in the short term. The Renaissance Public Bonds have been listed on the market on the 7th of this month under the order of the Ministry of Finance. Because the outside chips have become almost extinct, the market price opened quite high, at 72.3 yuan. Because the goods are scarce and the price is high, very few people are interested in them. The progress of the whole week: Monday was closed for the New Year holiday. On Tuesday, because the situation was settled, people's hearts were all taking a wait-and-see attitude. Unexpectedly, a group of major players emerged very actively, and market prices fell by 3 to 9 corners. On Wednesday, the trend became more and more tired, and the chips on the table were quite crowded. However, after major players such as No. 11 and No. 13 purchased them, the market situation was tired but firm. On Thursday, the Renaissance Public Bonds began to be listed on the market. Because the chips were short, the market price opened surprisingly high at 72.3 yuan, but the trading was extremely clear. Because people's hearts were firm, the Unified Public Bonds were enthusiastically bought, rising 1.2 to 6 corners. On Friday, because the bulls and bears were mutually exclusive, the ins and outs became more chaotic and clear. The market price was quite hovering. On Saturday, the trend was extremely dull, and retail transactions were mostly for rescheduling and closing out. As a result of the whole week, there was a uniform decline of 2 to 6 corners. The total transaction volume was 30.23 million yuan. The comparison of its gains and losses, highs and lows, is listed in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)

Reuters, Bombay - At the beginning of the week, the Bombay cotton market had a slight surplus settlement. Later, due to the surge in the price of three-grade yarn, the buying atmosphere here suddenly became strong. Yesterday, the news that the Japanese government had tightened the management of yen exchange rates triggered a fierce selling wind. However, speculators, exporters, and local manufacturers took advantage of the fall to buy. The total number of Indian cotton shipments to Japan this week was 149,871 bales more than in the same period last year. Forward orders are huge, but there are many arrivals everywhere, and although the export industry is good, it is still difficult to absorb them all. Pingguoer fell 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Aomula fell 1.75 to 2 rupees, Bai Luoxi fell 1 rupee, British cotton spot fell 2 points, and futures fell 45 points. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 9th).

### Finance

London Silver Is Rapidly Shipped to India

Due to Rumors of Increased Silver Import Tax in India

London Spot Silver Is Ample, and Discounting Is Under Pressure

Reuters, London, 9th - Clearing banks and other financial institutions have ample cash after receiving huge amounts of government interest, and can meet the needs of borrowers at any time. The discounting market is under pressure due to the abundance of cash and the scarcity of treasury bills.

Reuters, Bombay, 9th - The silver market has been dull and colorless this week. Although market prices have occasionally risen, inventories are too large, and they have eventually fallen back. Not only has the import of London silver not decreased, but the rumors that tariffs will increase have prompted London silver to be shipped out early so that it can arrive before the budget is passed. The average daily need in the mainland is about 80 bars. It is expected that there will be a surplus of about 30,000 bars after the February settlement. It is heard that Bombay has already confirmed a huge amount of silver worth 900,000 pounds, which will be shipped within the week. When the mail ship arrives this time, it will bring a batch of silver bars worth about 130,000 pounds.

### Grain

Thick Japonica Supply Exceeds Demand

Prices Plunge Twenty to Thirty Cents

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various sources were stronger than before, with more than eighty firms arriving, carrying approximately sixteen thousand three to four hundred piculs of goods. Thin paddy rice accounted for forty of these firms, so market conditions continued to decline. Moreover, sales in this area were sluggish, and wholesalers were inactive. Only Qingdao brokers handled over a thousand bags of thin paddy rice, further weakening the situation. Prices continued to fall by more than a dime. The supply of thick japonica exceeded demand, causing a sudden drop of twenty to thirty cents. Du Yang pointed rice was unsalable, and the Yin Yuan market was fixed.

(North Shanghai) Recently, the arrival of goods from the river continued to be strong, about thirty firms. The market declined as sales of all goods had been very sluggish for days, resulting in over four hundred ships docked at the river. Yesterday, only a few shops put goods on the market, and demand remained sluggish. The market price of white japonica rice fell by another ten to twenty cents. Early rice followed suit with a drop of more than a dime. Yang Du Bu pointed rice was nearly two dimes short, and Bai Yuan rice was down by about a dime. Other types of rice fell by several cents to more than a dime. Given this situation, it is feared that there will be little improvement in the coming days.

### Ula of Jilin

— Wu Jiang

In the cold winter weather, one doesn't feel terribly cold during the day because of physical activity. Only when sitting quietly late at night do your feet freeze, making you restless. Thus, I involuntarily think of the benefits of "Ula."

What is called Ula? Ula is a type of shoe made from Ula grass, suitable for wearing in winter.

Speaking of Ula grass, it is a specialty of Jilin. There is a local saying: "The three treasures of Jilin are ginseng, sable fur, and Ula grass." This grass grows in the mountains and fields, with stems three to four feet tall, triangular in shape, with sharp ends, and dense roots. New shoots grow from the roots every spring.

Every winter, when the land is covered in ice and snow, farmers busy themselves with preparing their Ula after dinner. The method of making it is: first, the grass is crushed very finely, then placed inside leather Ula shoes, and they can be worn. However, some also braid the grass into small braids and weave them into a pair of shoes. For the sake of aesthetics and warmth, the shoe opening is trimmed with scraps of fur. Wearing them is warm and lightweight, making them the best thing possible. There are specialized shops in various counties and towns, and even in Jilin City, there is no shortage of them. Moreover, the price is very cheap; twenty to thirty copper coins (about forty to fifty cents) can buy a pair. Wearing these things is very common.

Now that chilblains are appearing, I really want a pair of these, but where can I get them? Because of this small thing, I also feel the pain of lost territory. When will we get "Give me back my mountains and rivers?"

### A Group That Burrows into Crowds

— Jiao Shijie

Some people living in Shanghai can live comfortably and quietly due to their different lifestyles, while others are forced by their environment to live in crowds all day long. Although they may hate the noise and fear being squeezed, they still have to burrow into the crowds. Who are these people?

The first type is the ticket sellers on trams and buses. Although the carriages clearly state in white paint "This vehicle is limited to ×× passengers," who counts the number of people? As long as there is space for one person to stand, another person can come up and fill that small space. Sometimes, it's so crowded that it's impossible to turn around. This is a common occurrence and nothing to be surprised about. At this time, I can only admire the skills of these ticket sellers. They can continuously say "Excuse me" while pushing their way through, and actually sell tickets from the inside out. Therefore, I say they are the type of people who, when seeing a crowd, push against it and burrow in.

The second type of people are those who sell things in amusement parks. They carry a tray filled with bananas, water chestnuts, dried tofu, melon seeds, etc. No matter how crowded the park is, they always have to squeeze in. Like swimming fish, they constantly burrow in and out. Even if there is no business, even if people are disgusted, they ignore everything and still go in and out like this. This is another type of person I admire.

The third type of people are the prostitutes in amusement parks. They are heavily made up, like shuttling butterflies, flitting east and west, constantly dazzling in front of many people, dazzling them until their eyes are blurred and their hearts are swaying. Thus, their great work is accomplished. This group can be considered the third type of people.

The fourth type of people is a group of idle people and troublemakers. For example, if a crowd is gathered on the street watching a fight or something, they must push through the crowd, walk in, put on the air of a big brother, inquire about the beginning and end of the matter, and then come forward to mediate, so that they can extort some money and get some benefits. Therefore, these people almost always want to stir up trouble. Now that something has happened, is there any reason for them not to squeeze in? This is what is called the fourth type of people.

The above four types of people are all those who burrow into crowds. They all live in this bustling Shanghai, just like others. And we often encounter these people.

### An Escape from the Wardrobe (Part 1)

— Te

The Heroic Actions of a French Mother and Daughter

In August 1914, after the outbreak of the European War, British and German forces fought a major battle at Le Cateau towards the end of August. After the battle, a cavalryman named Fowler, who had served in the 11th Hussars Regiment for 21 years, became separated from his main force. His current problem was how to avoid being seen by the enemy and how to find food to eat. Like a wild animal, he hid in the deep forest, occasionally encountering kind French farmers who gave him some food. His embarrassed situation was truly indescribable. After several months of this, on January 15 of the following year, he encountered a savior in a forest near the village of Bertry. This person was named Bascon, who was unfit for military service due to a disability and made a living by logging. That day, Bascon was logging in the forest and saw this British soldier who looked neither human nor ghost. Filled with pity, he shared some of the bread and cheese he had with him. Then, he pointed to a haystack and told Fowler to hide inside. Because they didn't speak the same language, Bascon put a lot of effort into making Fowler understand to come back and save him after dark.

This loyal lumberjack kept his promise. That night, he returned to the original spot and led Fowler to his home in the village of Bertry. It must be known that this action was very dangerous. Even if Bascon was walking alone, he was already violating the German military order prohibiting night travel, let alone leading a British soldier. If discovered, he would inevitably be executed. Just as the two were about to enter the village, two German policemen suddenly walked over in the darkness, shouting and asking Bascon why he was still running around outside at this hour. Bascon replied, "My mother-in-law is sick and asked me to see her." The policeman then asked, "Who is with you?" "Show me your address and name certificate!" Oh dear! This was terrible. Bascon, with good intentions, tried to save Fowler, but unexpectedly, he encountered death as soon as he took action. Just as the situation was critical, a commotion suddenly broke out on the street, followed by the sound of gunfire, like a string of firecrackers. As a result, the two policemen ignored Bascon and his companion and rushed to the street to investigate a more serious case. Bascon took the opportunity to lead Fowler back home in a flash.

### The Dwarf Island in the Sea of Earth

— Chen Xiaokan

The World's Only Orchestra

In the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea (near the French border), there is a small island with an area of only 20 square miles and a population of less than 5,000, called Key Largo. Because the natives here are born with a height of less than four feet, it can also be called Dwarf Island.

The climate on Dwarf Island is exceptionally mild, and the soil is extremely fertile. Among the lush and tall forests, there are towering trees everywhere. In the vast fields, the fruits are like brocade, red, yellow, green, and white, hanging heavily on the green branches. Parrots with red beaks and green feathers fly in the sky, and flocks of white seagulls chew seaweed by the water's edge. A scene in a painting, a painting in a scene, it is truly the world's only orchestra!

Although the natives on the island have a body only three feet tall, they are born very strong and rarely suffer from illness throughout the year. Both men and women enjoy swimming and climbing trees. In the brilliant morning light and the vast evening glow, young couples hold hands and play to their hearts' content on the mountain peaks and by the water's edge, while singing love songs with a Japanese-tinged melody. Under this unrestrained play, a generation of passionate girls will promptly commit many romantic acts.

The natives here have deep-rooted traditional superstitions. For things that harm them, such as mountains, rivers, water, and fire, they believe that there are gods in charge. Especially for the fire god and the water god, whenever a volcano erupts somewhere, or a dike collapses, they undoubtedly believe that this is the result of the gods being angered by insufficient offerings, and they must find ways to sacrifice and pray. The biggest sacrifice is a virgin's precious life and beautiful blood. In this way, under the harsh demands of the gods, the most beautiful girl in the village will be seized by the masses, stripped naked, and sacrificed to the gods. In the flaming eruption vent, in the surging and turbulent waves, hearing the most tragic cry, the precious life of a virgin ends.

The construction of the natives' houses is also very special. They do not use brick walls or earthen walls, nor do they have thick beams or large pillars. All four sides are built with wooden boards, with windows opened on the boards. The window frames are not decorated at all. At night, they urinate and defecate arbitrarily in the house, completely unaware of the meaning of the word "hygiene."

Although Catholicism is now prevalent among the dwarfs, there are still many remnants of ancient ethnic heresies and superstitions. In the dense forests, one can often find fierce-looking idols and crosses placed together, similarly yellowed by the smoke of incense. To this day, dance festivals are still held regularly in various towns, preserving the customs inherited from ancient ethnic groups. When dancing, they wear a skirt made of grass and a strangely shaped ancient costume on the upper body. The dance is graceful, and the singing is melodious, which is also very enchanting.

### The Replaced Luan Feng

Chapter 10 (Su Pa Sends Twined Silk with Strange Words, Huang Hua Grieves Over Falsely Cast Autumn Letters Adding Sorrow)

Guoqi said, "Why didn't you lead him to the old lady's room?" Aunt Liu said, "The old lady went to the Wang family at the entrance of the alley. I said I would go and invite the old lady back, but he repeatedly said there was no need. I thought that everyone in the family had run away, leaving a guest alone in the house, which would be very impolite, so I had to sit and keep him company in the main room." Guoqi said, "While he was sitting in this room, what did he say to you?" Aunt Liu said, "He didn't say anything." Guoqi said, "Did he flip through my books?" Aunt Liu said, "He didn't read any books either." Guoqi said, "Are you saying that he just sat blankly in this room?" Aunt Liu said, "Yes, he just sat blankly in the room. Later, he didn't know what he remembered, said to himself, 'No need to wait anymore,' left this note on the table, smiled slightly at me, and left. At the door, he turned back and said to me, 'There's no need to tell the old lady he came, lest the old lady feel bad.' In my opinion, he must have something on his mind." Guoqi casually crumpled the note into a small ball and threw it into the wastepaper basket on the corner of the table. He asked, "According to you, what's on his mind?" Aunt Liu said, "I don't know. If I knew, I would have told him." Guoqi laughed, "Female students are different from ordinary young ladies. They are like men and can go outside to visit friends without any problem. We are relatives, and she can come and play every day if she likes. What could be the matter?" Aunt Liu heard this and replied, "Yes." Seeing that there was still a hint of hesitation on the master's face, she excused herself and left the room. Guoqi sat in the chair, lost in thought for a while. Later, he thought again, "This body is like catkins stuck in mud," what exactly does this sentence mean? Thinking of this, he picked up the note from the wastepaper basket again, slowly unfolded the paper ball, placed it on the table, and gently smoothed it out with his hand. He paid close attention to those seven characters for a while, then placed it back in the collection of Li Yishan's poems, returned the book to the bookcase, put his hands behind his back, and paced back and forth in the room, thinking only of strange things. However, he only found it strange and didn't let Youmei's actions shift his attention. Because that afternoon, he had already received a letter from Menglan. The letter said that the two red beans had been received. He had always seen records of such things in Chinese poetry and prose, but had never obtained the real thing. Now that he had received these real red beans, it was enough to satisfy his longing of several years, and it was ten times more precious than the gift of fine jade.

Special Feature

### White Ape Sunbathing

— Xu Hengren

In front of the Manjushri Monastery on Mount Huangshan, there is a Manjushri Terrace, with a flat area of less than five feet. Sitting down there, looking up and around, the top of Tiandu Peak is on the left, and the top of Lotus Peak is on the right. Looking far into the distance, there is a vast sea of clouds, with many strangely shaped mountain peaks floating in the clouds, like the Penglai Islands at sea, appearing and disappearing, incredibly beautiful. Looking down diagonally, there is the mountainside of Tiandu Peak.

Always eager to overcome challenges, I walked step by step up the mountain in this freezing weather. When I reached the Manjushri Monastery, it was already late, so I spent the night there. The wind was very strong at night! It snowed that night.

The next morning, the sky cleared again, and the sun shone from the top of the mountain all the way to the mountainside. I got up and sat on the Manjushri Terrace, feasting my eyes. Suddenly, I saw a stone cave in the mountainside of Tiandu Peak. Many apes slowly climbed out of the cave. After more than forty had come out, three small ones supported a large one out. Only this large one had gray-white fur, while the rest were blue. Reflected in the sunlight, they shone brightly. Then, more than forty small blue ones climbed out, making a total of more than ninety. The large one sat down on the flat area in front of the cave. Small ones sat around it in front, behind, and to the sides, appearing like guards. The others who were not performing guard duty included some that were holding even smaller ones and nursing them, just like human mothers nursing babies. In addition, some were climbing trees to pick privet berries to eat, and some were pulling up grass roots to eat on the hillside. Two others climbed down from the tree, crawled to the white ape, spat out the privet berries in their mouths, and fed it. They also helped it groom its whiskers—the white whiskers had already reached its navel. Its cheeks were red—as if painted with rouge. After the white ape ate, it coughed—"Cough..."—just like our old men coughing. Two others were fighting over food. The white ape glanced at them, pointed with its left forelimb, and coughed twice—"Cough, cough," and they didn't dare to fight anymore. I was enjoying watching, when suddenly the sun was covered by clouds. The group of apes returned to the cave one after another, in the same order they came out. First, more than forty went into the cave, then they helped the white ape into the cave, and then they all went completely into the cave.

I watched for half a day. After watching, I was hungry, so I ran back to the Manjushri Monastery to eat. While eating, I chatted with the monks and talked about the apes' antics. The monk said, "The apes under our Manjushri Terrace are different from those on other mountains. The fur of those on other mountains is yellow-gray, while the fur of those under Manjushri Terrace is blue. There is only one old white ape, and there is no other like it. I don't know how old it is. Speaking of this ape, it is truly magically powerful, no less than the Monkey King of old. Its kind never harms the vegetables, fruits, and corn planted all around our mountains. It is said that this old ape manages its kind with rules. According to our master's teachings, in the past, whenever someone came to the mountain to perform rituals and chant scriptures, on the day when the merits were completed, they had to make some wheat flour steamed buns for them to eat, called vegetarian monkey buns. There is also a classic scripture. As long as the buns are placed near the ape cave, and a young monk is called to recite that classic scripture, the apes will know to climb over and take one each, and not take more than one. If there are dozens of buns, there will be dozens of apes coming." I said, "If hundreds of buns are made, then will hundreds of apes come?" The monk said, "Our master has a number in his mind and will not ask the benefactor to make that many buns." I responded with a mix of belief and doubt. In a moment, the meal was finished. I left the Manjushri Monastery and walked step by step down the mountain in the misty fog.

### Snowy Night

— Nie Yun

The days are shorter in winter. When dusk covers the treetops, goose feather-like snowflakes are flying outside the window, swinging like swings in the cold wind. As they approach the ground, a gust of wind picks them up again. Looking out at the dim sky, it seems as if rice flour is being sifted from a distant place, parading across the sky. Leaning against the window lattice, I think of how it must be skating time in my hometown!

At this lonely dusk, the sound of casting iron comes from the neighboring courtyard. Is it that family's daughter ending her lonely life, or are those monks and Taoists doing hopeless ghost tricks?

I pulled open the curtain of the back window, and the sky was already a gray-black expanse. I vaguely saw a bright corner lamp and moving shadows in the central hall, guessing that the frantic scene there was as lively as it was on the daughter's third birthday. But is the old lady mother wearing her brocade skirt and jacket from when she was married, receiving guests among the guests, and raising a face full of smiling faces?

That was still last year's affair, is that unmarried girl only having a glorious day? And now she's been sick for nearly three months. Every morning, standing at the back window, watching those doctor's sedan chairs shuttle back and forth, that old lady also appearing in person to welcome and send them off in person! Guessing that she must be burning incense and praying in front of the Guanyin statue in the warm pavilion, reverently asking her old husband in heaven to help his daughter, the widow only has this pearl on her palm to please her lap now. Moreover, she has this distant hope, she wants to find a compatible son-in-law for her daughter, so that the mother and daughter can rely on each other for the rest of their lives, and she also wants to think about the sacrifices to her old partner, but she doesn't know that her daughter's precious youth has passed away, a thirty-year-old girl has her own requests!

After the glorious birthday passed, the thirty-first spring came. The rolled curtains around the hall were all lifted, and the swallow's nest in front of the eaves was babbling with yellow-beaked nestlings, and the mother swallow was flying hurriedly on the edge of the pond, as if competing with the butterflies in the flowers, but she was burdened with the responsibility of being a mother, grabbing food to feed her children, and when the autumn geese came south, they led their children back to their old home in the south like daughters returning home!

Upstairs in the hall is the girl's boudoir, where the lake silk window curtains are almost always deeply hung. It is said that her family's master had been a magistrate in the past, so the official lady would naturally not easily show her face. They live deep in the boudoir, with kind and attentive maids in attendance, playing a game of chess, reciting a few poems, that is, when the mood is high, they only play with dominoes to pass the time. Even going down the hall requires turning over the almanac for an auspicious day.

Time is really a ruthless demon, the cannon sound under Wuchang City changed the times, and at the same time shattered their happy family, and that large mansion became their residence after their death. But the past cannot come again. In the annoying spring, the window curtains on the hall floor were also opened. The yard is desolate, only a pear tree in the corner of the wall blooms with three or five white little flowers, so the hostess takes down the moon zither hanging on the wall, adjusts the strings, and sends out the sorrow from the depths of the wild goose's heart from her sharp fingers. Sometimes she burns a furnace of musk in front of the window, she watches the fluttering swallows there thoughtfully, she may be praying to heaven: that her father is safe underground, her mother is healthy, and her own wishes, but she is now short of a clever maid!

That corner of the red building will always close off her resentment! In the autumn when the nestlings return to the south, she fell ill, and it has been nearly three months now!

The snow is falling more densely, in clumps, and by the time the lamps are lit, the corners of the house have already been covered with a white coat.

The sound of gongs and cymbals rang all night, and a delicate red gauze lamp was hanging outside the window of the hall floor, which is a sign of calling souls in the hometown. Watching the light of the lamp fluttering in the gale, I seemed to feel the warm feelings of my hometown, and silently recited the line from "I know the former land after passing by my hometown," blessing that declining family to be happy!

Near dawn, the sound of gongs and cymbals was mixed with mournful crying. Looking out from the back window, the red gauze lamp fluttering outside the hall floor had gone out.

The snowflakes cover the ridge, the treetops, and the paving even more thickly, but they cannot cover up the mother's crying.

Brief Remarks

### Discussing Warming Around the Fire

— De Lin

Warming around the fire was originally a very refined thing. In addition to warming up, writing something like "Occasional Notes by the Fireside" would make it seem even more leisurely and elegant. However, in this day and age, warmth is not something everyone can obtain, and warming oneself doesn't necessarily require a fire. There are also things like "water radiators," which are actually much more comfortable than smoky fires. So, although both can warm the body, the methods are vastly different. Of course, when the weather turns cold, every living creature loves warmth. Those who cannot afford to sit around a fire or live in a room with a water radiator can only lament their misfortune.

Speaking of misfortune, it certainly exists. In such cold weather, being able to sit in a room and light a fire to warm oneself is not easy. People wandering the streets without cotton clothing are too busy envying to even think about it. But even the act of sitting indoors and lighting a fire can lead to disaster for the unfortunate:

"Liu Ruohui from Hunan and his wife, Zhou Zhiping, lived in a small room in the Baoxingfang, No. 7, North Henan Road. The night before last, the weather was quite cold, and before going to bed, they lit a coal briquette stove in the room for warmth. Unexpectedly, they were poisoned... immediately, they experienced shortness of breath and lost consciousness... both are in critical condition..."

This was the report in Shanghai newspapers the day before yesterday. This news itself is enough to illustrate why the unfortunate are unfortunate. A couple living in a small room typically doesn't have the privilege of warming themselves. Even after such a big disaster, they still lack basic hygiene knowledge. If they had known that coal gas trapped in a room could cause poisoning, they wouldn't have done it. But if they could have spent a few more dollars to install a few sections of lead pipe to vent the gas outside, wouldn't it have been safer? However, they didn't know about this clever method – actually, it's not that they didn't know, but that they couldn't afford it. Judging by their living in a small room, it can be seen that hiring a craftsman to install lead pipes was "beyond their means!"

People shivering on the streets undoubtedly envy those who are warming themselves by the fire in small rooms. However, they don't know that the people inside are also envying those living in rooms with water radiators. We naturally extend our utmost sympathy to this unfortunate couple, but we don't hope that they can also live in rooms with water radiators. Instead, we hope that they gain more hygiene knowledge, and even more, we hope that the unfortunate friends wandering the streets can one day live in a small room!

Opening Piece "Romance of Flowers in the Mirror"

"Romance of Flowers in the Mirror," a peerless and extraordinary book,
Discusses the causes and consequences of love affairs in a confused manner.
In the Autumn Heart Courtyard, the person is like jade,
At the Spring Mirror Tower, the guest's soul is broken.
Dreams of paired mandarin ducks reveal conflicting intentions,
Ten years of wandering, trapped in the dust of the world.
Talented individuals falling into destitution is a common occurrence,
Wasting a stalwart seven-foot frame.
Don't laugh at the impoverished and desperate Chi Zhu,
Pity the talented woman who has Autumn Traces.
Why must one have met before to recognize each other?
All are wanderers at the end of the world.
Gathering the beautiful destinies and returning to the land of regret,
Briefly using death to repay special grace.
Cai Qiu is also a courtesan,
Capable in poetry, prose, and all things.
Her demeanor is charming and captivating,
A pair of keen eyes recognizes a scholar.
Amorous blessings are naturally bestowed,
Achieving a double success with one arrow.
Wealth and poverty are insignificant,
Do not lightly judge glory and adversity.
Tang Qu weeps tears, Feng Tang grows old,
A lofty spirit in vain cannot express his ambitions.
Winning everlasting praise for future generations,
Reaching venerable status in plain clothing during his lifetime.
Leisurely recounting the joys in my heart,
Regardless of whether the sky collapses or the earth turns dark.
Dragging the pipa, the flowers and moon faintly leave their traces.

Movies

### Central and Southeastern Studios Co-Screen News from the Suiyuan Front Lines

Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the Nanjing Central Photography Studio and the Shanghai Xinhua Film Company, recognizing the great significance of this war, specially dispatched personnel to brave dangers, penetrating deep into the front lines to risk capturing war footage, in order to allow people across the country to understand the truth. In addition to screening the captured anti-Japanese war scenes continuously in theaters across the country, in order to give the audience a comprehensive impression, the two parties have agreed on a cooperative approach, combining the footage captured by both sides. The content is entirely from the latest footage taken from the front lines, such as the real situation of soldiers on the Sui East and Sui North front lines resisting the enemy with hot blood, and the rear military preparations, which have not been shown before. It is reported that the film is currently being screened for the first round in the Central and Southeastern theaters in this city simultaneously.

### Worse Than a Dog

In today's society, because of the disparity between the rich and the poor, the lives of the poor are far inferior to the lives of dogs raised by wealthy families, truly causing one to lament, "Worse than a dog."

Ge Furong and Weng Shirong, in the Tianyi Film Company, are two well-known fools. Their foolishness is comical, and every move they make is laughable.

Recently, in the film "Wealth and Prosperity" in which they starred, they were responsible for the work of raising dogs for a wealthy family. They often stole dog food, and one day, they were discovered by the owner, who scolded them, making them not know whether to laugh or cry, and they could only lament their unfortunate fate.

### Our Hometown

The fifth part of "Lianhua Symphony," a Lianhua blockbuster produced by Hua An, "Moonlight Serenade" directed by He Mengfu, features the interlude "Our Hometown," composed by musician Sha Mei. The melody is tragic and passionate, and the lyrics are particularly upright and magnificent, inspiring profound reflection, and are truly a rare work in today's Chinese music scene. The song has been recorded and released by Baidai Company, number 35208. The lyrics are recorded below:

Do you ask about my hometown?

My home is in that place!

That place is so good,

There are forests and coal mines,

Fields are full of sorghum,

The treasure is truly immeasurable, truly immeasurable,

There are also thirty million compatriots,

Every one of them is full of hot blood,

Who knew that one day five years ago,

That place was forcibly occupied,

From then on, we lost our hometown,

From then on, we wandered in all directions,

Wandering for five years,

Five years, suffering endless hardships,

Five years, we are always on the brink of hunger and cold.

Now we can't bear it anymore,

To endure, where will there be an end?

We want to see the tombs of our ancestors again,

We want to see our sisters and parents again,

We'll climb the White Mountain again,

We'll swim in the Zu River again,

We want to go home,

Go home,

Go home!
