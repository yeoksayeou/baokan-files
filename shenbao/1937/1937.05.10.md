Zeng Yangfu requested the provincial government to continue the unified control, but the provincial government stated that the revised methods still implied management, so it replied that there was no need for further discussion. It is now known that Zeng has submitted his resignation for the third time. The provincial government has telegraphed Zeng to persuade him to stay and has also sent a letter explaining the situation, advising him to withdraw his resignation. (Special dispatch, 9th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Tragedy of the Hindenburg Airship

The German airship Hindenburg was flying from Germany to the United States the day before yesterday. As it was about to reach its destination in Lakehurst, it suddenly exploded. The entire airship was incinerated, and more than 30 people were killed. This unexpected tragedy has shocked the world. The Hindenburg was the largest airship in the world at the time. Its construction was more magnificent and sophisticated than the famous Graf Zeppelin. It crossed the Atlantic ten times last summer without any hindrance. At that time, its designer and builder, Dr. Eckener, published an article in the French newspaper "L'Intransigeant," saying that the successful flights of the Hindenburg dispelled people's doubts about the usefulness of airships. "It proves to the world that giant airships are the safest aerial vehicles for long-distance travel, and are especially suitable for traveling between the two sides of the Atlantic."

However, less than a year after Eckener's article was published, the famous Hindenburg suffered the same tragedy as many large airships before it. In the past, the US airship Shenandoah was wrecked off the Atlantic coast, the Macon crashed during a Pacific naval exercise, and the British R-101 was destroyed on its way to India. This tragic encounter has made the aerial scientists of Britain and the United States feel apprehensive. They would rather focus on the development of "heavier-than-air" airplanes and dare not try to build this kind of "lighter-than-air" large airship again. Only Germany, with its Graf Zeppelin airship, has had few accidents in decades. Its aerial scientists, such as Dr. Eckener and Colonel Lehmann, have always recognized the advantages of airships and worked hard in this area. Since the first Graf Zeppelin-style airship was built, 130 have been built so far. They have maintained many round trips between Germany and the Americas every year. However, this time, the Hindenburg crashed, and even the famous airship pilot Colonel Lehmann met his doom. It is inevitably a major setback for the airship industry in Germany. From the perspective of scientific development and human sympathy, we feel it is extremely regrettable.

However, we have another feeling from the tragedy of the Hindenburg, which we must mention here. We feel that the fundamental significance of the development of aviation technology is to show mankind's conquest of natural resistance, and its practical role should be to promote the exchange of human culture and cooperation in governance. But what is the result of aviation development now? The Graf Zeppelin first attracted the world's attention when it appeared on the front lines of the European War. Now, airships and airplanes are valued by various countries because of their strong destructive power. The initial speculation on the German side regarding the Hindenburg accident was that it was caused by someone's sabotage. All these incidents show that the development of the aviation industry has not only failed to fulfill its responsibility of communicating human culture and promoting international cooperation, but has been used as a tool to destroy civilization. Its promotion and development have also been hindered by the suspicious atmosphere of politics. A clearer piece of evidence is that the airship's gasbag should use non-flammable helium instead of relying solely on flammable hydrogen. However, because Germany has been expanding its military equipment in recent years, its treasury is poor and it cannot purchase helium from the United States with cash, which has caused such a great scientific product, along with dozens of passengers and aviation technicians, to suffer the same tragic end. In addition to mourning, we would like to use this humble opinion to awaken the attention of enthusiastic people in the aviation science community, so that everyone knows that the development of science, when it deviates from the right track, can only cause disasters for mankind itself.

### Important Developments in World Politics and Economy Expected

Davis Returns Home to Report on His Impressions of Europe
Possibility of International Conference Being Called

[Washington] After Davis, the chief representative of the United States at the World Sugar Conference, returned to the United States from his tour of Europe, it is expected that there will be important developments in world politics and economics. Davis has spoken with major European politicians several times, and his report to the US President will definitely involve the following matters: ① The rise of a stable global economic atmosphere; ② The possibility of a commercial agreement between Britain and the United States; ③ The moral assistance of the United States to Britain's policy of easing European politics; ④ Cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East or a triangular understanding between Britain, the United States, and Japan, especially regarding naval matters; ⑤ Germany's moderate attitude and its willingness to participate in peace conferences. Currently, people in the US government are not saying a word about Davis's trip to Europe, in order to avoid premature optimism. However, they believe that it is possible that a world economic conference will be convened, but it must be initiated by Europe. Regarding this point, European politicians all advocate that President Roosevelt should convene this conference. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 9th)

### Japan and Chile Business Circles Establish Agreement

Promoting Economic Relations

Osaka The third trade conference between the Chilean economic delegation and Osaka business circles was held at the Cotton Industry Hall on the 8th. The parties discussed proposals, and as a result, 16 items were decided. The conditions were signed by representatives of both parties to suggest to their governments for specific implementation. The more important resolutions are as follows:

① Establish Japan-Chile Associations in Tokyo and the capital of Chile. ② During the period of maintaining exchange relations between the two countries, strive to satisfy the economic supply of all parties, and the procedures should be simple and implemented quickly. When the trade relations between the two countries remain the same, both countries will receive most-favored-nation treatment. ③ Although both countries can protect domestic industries, they should try to avoid raising tariffs. ④ Separate tariffs on silk fabrics and rayon fabrics, consider the protection of domestic industries, and set appropriate tariffs at the same time. ⑤ Chile will consider reducing tariffs on cotton fabrics of 40 cm or more per square meter to the extent that it does not harm domestic industries. ⑥ Japan and Chile will jointly invest to develop Chile's domestic iron ore and promote the iron and steel industry.

The French Chamber of Deputies Expresses Confidence in the Government

Supporting Economic and Social Policies People's Front Maintains Unity

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies continued its meeting this afternoon to discuss the government's economic and social policies. It finally passed a vote of confidence in the government with a majority of 380 votes to 199. During the discussion, the chairman of the Radical Socialist Party's Chamber of Deputies delegation, Gan Binji, delivered a speech, stating that the Radical Socialist Party is determined to continue to support the Blum cabinet. "If the current government can fulfill its promises, then this party will definitely not go back on its word and will always sincerely support it. As for undermining the People's Front, the responsibility is heavy and this party is definitely not willing to bear it. The right-wing parties should not have any illusions about this." Gan Binji then said that domestic public opinion is not without apprehension. The reason for this is not because the current government is implementing the People's Front program, but because workers in various industries are constantly making new demands. "The government should resolutely reject this when necessary, answer the workers with 'no', and exercise its authority. What we need now is general sincerity, so-called general sincerity, that is, workers should be patient, the majority party should adopt a wise attitude, and the government should express its authority," etc. Other party members successively made speeches, expressing optimism about the domestic economic situation, especially Communist Party member Dugrolo, who said that according to recent statistics, the number of unemployed people in the country has decreased and railway income has also increased. The Bank of France has as much as 57,000,000,000 francs in gold reserves, which is enough to prove that general sensationalist propaganda is groundless. At this point, the Chamber of Deputies passed the vote of confidence in the government and immediately announced the adjournment of the meeting until the 20th of this month. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 8th)

### Worsening Relations Between Britain and Italy

Italy Withdraws Reporters Stationed in Britain Bans British Newspapers from Entering the Country

[Rome] The Fascist political system newspaper, edited by Farinacci, the former secretary of the Italian Fascist Party, published a fierce article, which was the prelude to yesterday's ban by the Italian government on British newspapers from entering the country. The article said that the British are inherently good at lying, and that the British are not only fundamentally childish, but have also been confident in themselves for centuries under the influence of the ruling class. The British newspapers reported that the Italian army was defeated on the Guadalajara front, that Italian planes bombed the ancient city of Guernica, and that when the residents of Pellermo, northeast of the town of Curitiba, were bravely defending their territory, Spanish women threw Italian volunteers out of the window. These news items can all be used as evidence of British lies. Farinacci threatened last Thursday that he would shackle Italians who went to London to participate in the coronation ceremony of the King of England. Now, after the reporters of Italian newspapers stationed in Britain received the order to leave the country and return home, they have begun to leave London. This move is a sign that Italy will not participate in the coronation ceremony at all, because Italy has no official representatives to participate in this ceremony.

Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech on the balcony of the Venice Palace, saying, "We are now celebrating the anniversary of the establishment of the Italian Empire, which is enough to make us proud. We have three ideals: glory, strength, and peace. We Italians have a cultural mission, and we will complete it no matter what obstacles there may be. This is what the whole world should know."

### British Fleet Gathered on the Thames

London Citizens Turn Out in Droves
Mighty Warships Connected, Imposing and Unmatched

[London] With the coronation ceremony of King George VI fast approaching, 30 warships belonging to the home fleet sailed to the southern port yesterday and anchored at the mouth of the Thames to participate in the grand ceremony. London citizens, considering the home fleet's gathering in the capital a rare opportunity, turned out in droves to feast their eyes. The first thing that caught their eyes was the battleship "Nelson," the flagship of the fleet commander, with the commander's flag flying high from the mast, and the towering gun turrets rising from the front, adding to its majesty. Next to it were the battleships "Rodney," "Resolution," "Royal Sovereign," "Revenge," and "Royal Oak," mighty warships connected one after another, a truly spectacular sight. Not far away was the aircraft carrier "Furious," a behemoth that looked like a giant terrace on the sea. Two torpedo boats were sailing upstream on the Thames, and another was parked in the Tilbury dock with three submarines. Among the warships, the most attention was paid by the audience and naval experts to the newly completed 9,000-ton cruisers "Newcastle" and "Southampton." These cruisers are the latest in naval shipbuilding technology, and their anti-aircraft equipment and aircraft launch equipment are praised by everyone. In addition, between Gravesend and East Woolwich, there are two ships with submarine wire mesh and six anti-torpedo boats. Looking further afield, there are several submarines and a flotilla leader ship, as well as the "Indus" coastal defense ship, with the Indian naval flag hanging from the mast, representing the Indian fleet participating in the naval review ceremony. All the warships are scheduled to radiate searchlights on the evening of the 10th, and light up colored electric torches on the nights of the 11th and 12th, which will be extinguished at midnight.

### London Transport Workers' Strike Under Mediation

A Resolution Is Not Immediately Possible

[London] With the British King's coronation imminent and the number of tourists visiting Britain increasing daily, efforts to mediate the London bus drivers' strike have been doubled. The Central Motor Committee of the Transport Workers' Union held a meeting this morning, and later, they were summoned to the Ministry of Transport to confer with the Minister of Labour, Ernest Brown, until dusk. The union is prepared to hold a representative conference, at which time the basis for negotiating a resolution may be known for certain. Currently, the bus strikes in various provinces have improved. The Canterbury buses, which had been out of service for 23 days, are now operating normally. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th, Reuters)

[London] Regarding the London bus strike, union officials recently expressed the opinion that if the Municipal Transport Bureau and the workers cannot reach a compromise within the next few days, the strike will be prolonged. Furthermore, there is a risk that employees of the city's public transportation system, such as the subway, tram, and trolleybus, will also stage a sympathy strike. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th, Gavas)

[London] The London bus strike has not been resolved despite several lengthy meetings. Therefore, the crowds attending the coronation ceremony are still experiencing various inconveniences. The most important meeting yesterday was the Transport Workers' Union representative conference, which began at 10:00 PM to discuss the Central Motor Committee's negotiations with the Minister of Labour, Ernest Brown. After two and a half hours, it was decided to ask bus drivers their opinions on the following two matters over the next two days: ① Whether the strikers can be allowed to negotiate a new contract based on the Transport Bureau's latest proposal. In addition to the 7.5-hour workday, the bureau is prepared to discuss the workers' grievances and, if a direct compromise cannot be reached, to submit the matter to a court of inquiry. ② Whether the strikers want to continue the strike to achieve the demand of a 7.5-hour workday. The representative conference is scheduled to reconvene at 5:00 PM the day after tomorrow to hear reports from the union branches. As for the Transport Bureau, it claims that it has already given the union its final reply. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 9th, Reuters)

### Spanish Rebel Advance on Basque Front

Occupying Mount Sollube; Defenders Retreat to Second Line of Defense

Rumor: Japan Prepares to Recognize Rebel Government

Bilbao. Special dispatch from Havas reporter. The Nationalist forces recently infiltrated Mount Sollube near Bermeo, Basque Country. The government has retreated to the second line of defense. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 9th, Havas)

Bayonne. The Spanish Nationalist forces claim that their infantry, with the assistance of 16 tanks, many machine gun-equipped motorcycles, and aircraft, have occupied the highest slope of Mount Sollube, which controls the northern part of the Basque front. Meanwhile, the Basque government says that its forces have destroyed six rebel tanks. Heavy fighting is currently occurring in other areas of the Basque front. According to Nationalist sources, Nationalist forces have captured the village of Munguia, nine miles north of Bilbao. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 9th, Reuters)

Hengtai. Although the rebel forces launched a simultaneous air and ground attack today, the Basque government forces fiercely resisted on the summit of Mount Sollube, making it difficult for the rebels to succeed. The forests on the mountainside have been set on fire by rebel bombs, but the government forces remain unmoved. If General Mola's troops can occupy the mountain, they can bombard the port of Bilbao with heavy artillery and cut off the government forces' supply route, which would be more effective than a naval blockade. Therefore, the rebels must first occupy Mount Sollube if they want to take Bilbao. (National Telegram, 8th)

[Paris] According to sources within the Spanish Nationalist forces, a delegation sent by the Japanese government has arrived in Salamanca, intending to recognize the Nationalist government immediately and negotiate a commercial agreement with the Nationalist authorities. The newspapers here are closely monitoring this news. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th, Havas)

All of this is aimed at maintaining peace and security, and it is hoped that all labor unions and political parties will fully cooperate. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 9th, Havas)

### New Life for Young German Women

An Overview of the Labor Service Corps Organization; Enables Deep Immersion in Rural Areas to Understand the Masses

▲Berlin Correspondence. Today, German women have a new concept of their responsibilities to the nation and society, which is manifested in the organization of the Women's Labor Service Corps. The age of joining the corps is limited to those between 18 and 25 years old. Except for high school graduates who must join the corps and complete their service period before being able to take the university entrance examination, the rest are all volunteers. Each term is six months long, and graduation occurs after that. In special circumstances, it can also be divided into two terms of three months each. During the service period, the members engage in various basic tasks for women according to the work outline. Most of the locations are in newly reclaimed areas (these areas were originally barren land but have now been transformed into habitable areas through the reclamation of the Youth Labor Service Corps), or mowing grass in the fields, or cooking in the kitchen, or sharing the burden of overworked farmers – all of which involve deep immersion in the civilian population and genuine service. Daily life is very structured. They wake up for exercise at 5:30 AM, wash up and tidy up their personal belongings at 6:00 AM, have breakfast at 6:30 AM, and the time from 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM is for labor service. Each person engages in different individual tasks. They rest from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM, have afternoon tea at 4:30 PM, discuss issues and listen to celebrity lectures at 5:00 PM, have dinner at 6:30 PM, have free time from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and turn off the lights and go to bed at 9:30 PM. Each person has one day off per month and can receive a small wage for saving (this wage is issued by the government; the government spends two marks per day on each member, equivalent to approximately 2.4 yuan in national currency, but after deducting food, lodging, and uniform costs, the actual amount received by each member per day is equivalent to 0.38 yuan in national currency) for free use. As of January 1 this year, there were 300 Women's Labor Service Corps in Germany, totaling 10,000 people. According to the plan, this number will be increased to 20,000 by the end of this year. As the number of people increases, meals and accommodation become extremely difficult. The first problem is "housing". Houses cannot be purchased and can only be rented because they move to places with the most work at any time. However, finding a house suitable for 40 women to live in, and which must be attached to a flower garden and vegetable garden, is really not easy. The second problem is "clothing". Each member must at least be issued short coats, shirts, outerwear, breeches, shoes, socks, and other items by the government. As the number of members increases, the number of clothes required increases accordingly. The difficulty of the agency responsible for coordinating the national women's labor service can be imagined. The female doctor is most responsible for the members, not only paying attention to the physical health of the service women but also emphasizing spiritual cultivation and instilling hygiene knowledge. In addition to this, the work of training members in the corps also includes the following: ① Repairing, ② Washing and dyeing, ③ Growing flowers, ④ Raising livestock, ⑤ Sewing, ⑥ Cooking. They also do not force a semi-militarized discipline, as they believe that strict regulations for men are not entirely applicable to women. In short, the purpose of the Women's Labor Service Corps is to enable young girls in the city, especially future doctors, lawyers, and teachers, to deeply immerse themselves in rural areas, understand the masses, break the concept of class, and gradually reach a common and profound understanding of women throughout the country.

### Traditional Customs of the British King's Coronation

---Special

The anointing of the King with holy oil and the crowning on his head are the acts that enthrone him as King. The antiquity of this ritual is almost as old as the history of the nation's founding of a King. The earliest record can be found in the former part of the Bible, chronicling that after Saul, the King of Israel, was selected, Samuel brought him out and performed the anointing ritual, the text reads, "Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him, saying, 'Has not the Lord anointed you ruler over his inheritance?'" Whether Saul performed the coronation ceremony after this is not further specified in the Bible. Judging from the subsequent text, even if he did not perform the coronation ceremony, he must have at least been crowned on his head, as a symbol of the King. This is because after Saul's death, a young man who had returned from the battle where Saul was severely wounded told David about his experience, saying, "So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord." From then on, the anointing of holy oil became associated with all the coronation rituals in the Bible and in Christianity, and the crowning on the head became an outward and secular symbol of the King's enthronement.

The earliest crowns were obviously made of leaves or flowers. However, historical records state that Pharaoh V used embroidered silk as a crown. During the Roman era, it was generally accepted that the laurel wreath created by Emperor Nero was a symbol of the King's nobility. King Constantine later changed the laurel wreath into a full hoop, which is the ancestor of modern crowns. Afterwards, it was decorated with jewels to increase its nobility. As of today, the royal crown is slightly different from the style set by King Constantine. There are two other commonly used items in the coronation ceremony that are also related to King Constantine: one is the scepter, and the other is the golden orb. The existing statue of the Roman Emperor, Constantius, always has a golden rod in his right hand and a golden orb, as large as an orange, in his left hand. This can be verified.

The first King of Great Britain to be crowned was King Aidan in the year 520 AD, and the ceremony was presided over by Saint Columba of Iona. The existing coronation records written by Saint Adomnan vividly describe the circumstances of King Aidan performing the anointing ceremony and the coronation ceremony. In 1066, William the Conqueror's coronation was held on the same day at Westminster Abbey. It was initially carried out with a grand ceremony. Although subsequent monarchs have made additions and deletions to the ritual, the main points of that day have been followed to this day, such as the anointing, the coronation, the ceremonial robes, and the oath of allegiance. William the Conqueror was crowned as a conqueror of foreign invaders, so he made various preparations to prevent tragedies from happening. All those who wanted to attend the ceremony and those who had duties in the grand ceremony were carefully interrogated to ensure that they were not harmful to the new King. This custom still exists. Every time a new King is crowned, a "Court of Claims" is organized first. All those who participate in the grand ceremony must apply to this court, and only this court has the exclusive right to grant permission. However, in today's world, the work of the court is like a fleeting illusion. The court is held by a committee led by the Earl Marshal (Duke of Norfolk). Lawyers come to court to present requests on behalf of their clients, as in an ordinary court. Although those who participate in the grand ceremony or have duties in the grand ceremony cite precedents, their rights are undoubtedly unquestionable, but they must also make a formal request to this court. The new King's coronation is usually performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who places the crown on the King's head. However, the Archbishop must first obtain permission from the court before he has this right. As for those who attend the ceremony in Westminster Abbey, the beginning and end of the ceremony, those who respectfully help the King and Queen walk in the hall, and those who hold various imperial items used during the coronation, their rights are all decided by the court. Occasionally, strange requests are made, and the court immediately rejects them. For example, a woman claimed that she had the hereditary right to sit near the Queen during the coronation, but the court rejected it. In the past, the "Court of Claims" had many duties. For example, who should prepare the meals for the King during the coronation, and who should prepare the wine for the King, all had special rights, and the court had to decide each one. This was because in the past, these matters were very important, because the royal family was always worried that evil people would poison the wine and food.

In the past, there was also a strange request, but this custom has been abolished today, which is the self-proclaimed challenger to the King. The person wore a suit of the King's finest armor, followed by the Minister of Police and the Earl Marshal. When the coronation banquet was in progress, he rode into Westminster Abbey and proclaimed, "Anyone who wants to dispute the new King's right to ascend the throne, come and fight!" The person then threw a glove on the ground to wait for someone to pick it up. After a long time, no one responded to the challenge, so the King raised a golden goblet and drank it all to the warrior who challenged him. The golden goblet and armor were later given to him as a reward for his service. This banquet is no longer held. Since the coronation of George IV, the challenge ceremony has been abolished. The challenge ceremony was carried out for more than 500 years, and one of the Tymock clans inherited this right. The person who enjoys this right today is Skegmann-Tymock of Scrivelsby Barthy. Tymock enjoys the title of "Challenger and Flag Bearer of the King of England." Every time a new King is crowned, he is given a golden goblet, so Scrivelsby has stored many golden goblets. However, after the mansion was destroyed by fire, the number of those remaining has been reduced to seven. This time, Tymock only holds the flag and does not challenge.

In addition to deciding on these claimed rights, the Earl Marshal's responsibilities include deciding on the number of seats to be set up in Westminster Abbey for the coronation ceremony, the decorations inside the hall, who should sit in which seat, and the style of the robes of the noblemen and their wives who attend the ceremony, and all the guards of honor coming and going to the Great Hall. In short, he is the "stage manager" of the coronation ceremony. Other things, such as the buildings along the route of the coronation procession and the hanging of flags and banners, cannot be done without prior approval. However, for this coronation, the style and color of the formal dresses worn by the noblewomen have been left to the discretion of the nobles or their wives. When the coronation procession travels between Westminster Abbey and the Royal Palace, the Earl Marshal wears a gold-red ceremonial robe, waves a scepter, and leads the way. When the King is performing the coronation ceremony, the Earl remains respectfully close to the King. After the coronation ceremony is completed, and the King ascends the throne to receive the oath of allegiance from his subjects, then, after the royal family, he leads the Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons to first kiss the King's left cheek and touch the King's crown with his right hand, to show that he and all the nobles are willing to loyally protect the King's throne.

The current Earl Marshal is only twenty-nine years old and began attending the House of Lords in 1929, replacing his uncle FitzAlan as the Earl Marshal. What is strange is that the Earl is a Catholic, and when the new King is sworn in to uphold Christianity, the Earl must still stand respectfully by the King's side to listen quietly.

### Japanese Economic Aggression in Shandong Is Rapid

Establishing Packing Plants and Flour Mills; Also Purchasing Land in Jinan to Establish a Textile Mill

Jinan Correspondence. The Sino-Japanese Development Company, established by the Japanese, is determined to monopolize the textile industry in North China. Recently, it plans to expand by 1.4 million spindles in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan. In addition to greatly expanding the existing Japanese textile mills in Tianjin and Qingdao, it has also decided to build one in Jinan, as there were no Japanese textile mills there before. The company has added Nagasawa Sokuji to Jinan to actively carry out this plan. In addition, Mitsubishi Corporation is also planning to build a packing plant in Jinan. Jinan is the concentration point for cotton from western and northern Shandong. Every year, a large amount of cotton is exported. Previously, there were two packing plants, China Cotton and Shen Xin, each packing only 40 bags per hour. It is heard that the packing plant planned by Mitsubishi (also related to the Sino-Japanese Development Company) this time can pack more than 300 bags per hour, in order to monopolize everything in the future. The Zhangdian Station on the Jiaoji Railway is also an important cotton concentration point in northern Shandong, comparable to Jinan. Mitsubishi also plans to establish a packing plant there. Recently, it has been under construction. In 1918-1919, the Japanese established a South Manchurian Flour Mill on Weiba Road in Jinan. After 1921, due to diplomatic relations, the business did not expand and went bankrupt. Its machinery has been sold to the Qingdao Hengxing Flour Mill, and only an empty house has remained for many years. Now, the Japanese are reviving it. They are installing new machines on the original factory site. It is expected that they will start installing them after the new wheat is harvested, at the latest in the autumn. It is heard that the maximum capacity of the factory is more than 3,800 bags of flour per day. The above-mentioned addresses of the packing plant and the flour mill are all Japanese-owned land, so progress is easier. However, the textile mill is quite troublesome. At first, the Japanese Nagasawa contacted the existing textile mills in our country to join as shareholders, but he was rejected. The second step was to attempt to purchase land and build a textile mill themselves. However, our government reasoned that Jinan is a self-opened commercial port, and foreigners have no right to purchase land to establish factories. This was resolutely stopped. At the same time, it was also difficult for Japanese merchants to purchase land. However, the Japanese merchants have not stopped their efforts. Recently, they have been using Chinese traitors to purchase more than 100 acres of land in the northern expansion area of the commercial port, under the false names of Jinpu Company, Eryoutang, Sanyoutang, etc. Later, because the traitors' division of spoils was uneven, they disputed each other, which led to exposure, and it was not successful. However, the Japanese are still unwilling and are still secretly carrying it out.

### Siamese Mistreatment of Chinese Immigrants

Many Deaths in Immigration Bureau Jails; Many Who Go to Siam in Secret Suffer Tragic Deaths

Quetou Merchants' News. Since the Siamese government promulgated the regulations on inspecting Chinese immigrants, in recent months, passengers from Shantou to Siam have been labeled as having eye diseases and detained in jails. No less than 1,000 people have been detained. According to regulations, local wealthy merchants are allowed to pay a deposit of 200 baht within 15 days to bail them out for treatment. After they fully recover and are certified by Dr. 温, the deposit can be retrieved. At the same time, a residence tax of 100 baht and an entry permit of 15 baht must be paid before they can be free from trouble. If no shop bails them out within 15 days, then after suffering the pain of jail, they must still be escorted back to Shantou. Since last winter, every time a Siamese ship returns to Shantou, it must carry 20-30 or more than 100 deported Chinese laborers. On the first of this month, the Xia Le Shi ship returned to Shantou, carrying 29 people who had been deported. According to them, there are still more than 470 people in the Siam Immigration Bureau's prison waiting to be sent back to Shantou. Nine out of ten of them are from Chaozhou. The weather there is hot, and the prison has no sanitation facilities at all. The people in the prison all sleep on the ground, with dirty faces and heads. The mistreatment is worse than that of animals. Everyone suffers from depression, and their diet is also poor. Therefore, vomiting and diarrhea occur, and the infection is extremely fast. There were 20-30 deaths in one day. The Siamese authorities are afraid of causing resentment and do not allow this situation to be exposed. It has been found that Chinese who go to Siam all hold health certificates issued by the Shantou Port Quarantine Station. The certificates are obtained after paying a fee of one yuan. The Siam Immigration Bureau now believes that the Shantou Quarantine Station is issuing certificates indiscriminately and has sent special agents to Shantou to secretly investigate the Shantou Quarantine Station's epidemic prevention. They also intend to use the materials obtained from the investigation to rebut any negotiations raised by China, thereby proving that China's inspection is not fully competent. The Siamese Immigration Bureau mistreats and makes things difficult for the Chinese population in various ways. In order to avoid the pain of the Siamese immigration inspection, those who go to Siam again perform the tragedy of hiding in the cabin and jumping into the sea. It was found that last year, the Xia Le Shi and Guiyang steamships carried more than 670 stowaways to Siam. They were discovered by the Siamese customs and all were confined in iron cages to be exposed to the sunlight. This incident was less than a year ago. On the 16th of last month, when the Xia Le Shi ship arrived in Siam, the same tragedy was discovered again, which was caused by the collusion between the crew and the Shantou Inn. The inns deceive those going to Siam by first paying 70-80 yuan to more than 100 yuan, claiming that they can work as partners on the ship and do not have to go through the immigration inspection when they arrive in Siam, as well as the suffering of being imprisoned and guaranteed. Those going to Siam believe it. Usually, when the number of people is small, they may be able to sneak through this method. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 15th of last month, when the Xia Le Shi ship entered the Ge Xi Inn, Siamese customs officials boarded the ship to count the passengers. In the dark, windy, and rainy night, the crew forced those going to Siam to hold floating bamboo tubes and jump into the Mae Nam River. The crew also pointed to the sampan and said, "After you jump down, the boat will rescue you ashore." Everyone was forced to jump into the water, and more than 20 people were taken by the waves. Three people who refused to jump suffocated in a canvas bag. The rest were arrested by the officials and confessed the above tragic situation. Upon hearing the news, the philanthropists in Bangkok sent a few boats to salvage bodies near the river surface of Pak Nam Po. Also, when a certain ship of the Taikoo Dockyard arrived in Siam, the stowaways also tried to escape by jumping into the water and were killed by the ship's propeller, with their bodies cut into pieces in the water. The Xia Le Shi ship has now returned to Shantou. The Chaozhou Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Siam has specially sent a letter to the Shantou Municipal Government requesting them to detain the ship and find ways to prohibit the inn from tricking passengers into sneaking to Siam.

### Suzhou

The Silkworm Business in the Suzhou Countryside Is Going Smoothly

The silkworm eggs issued by the improvement area in the spring silkworm in Wuxian County total more than 180,000 sheets, an increase of one-third compared with last spring. Now, the Guangfu, Hengjing, and Huguan areas are entering the second molt on a large scale. Because of the sharp increase in the number of silkworm eggs, the county government is worried that the supply of mulberry leaves will be in short supply, so it has implemented a control system. An announcement has been issued immediately prohibiting the private transportation of mulberry leaves out of the country. In order to improve cocoon baking equipment, special regulations have been formulated to limit the establishment of 20 new-style cocoon baking machines in the county, which will be handled by the improvement area for registration. As of the 8th, a total of 40 cocoon shops in the county have been registered and prepared to start weighing spring cocoons. According to the observation of the guidance personnel in the improvement area, there is a 90% certainty of success.

### Jiading

Regular County Games

The County Government, under orders, is holding county games. A preparatory committee has been established, rules have been set, and the event is scheduled for the 13th. Chen Youmin has been appointed as the general manager, Shen Paiyang as the chief of general affairs, He Hua as the chief of the discipline department, and Jin Yanfan as the chief of the competition department. Currently, over ninety people have registered to participate.

### Wuxi

Strict Prohibition of Labor Union Disputes

Xiao Rongqian, a special commissioner dispatched by the Wuxi General Labor Union, noted that recently, many disputes have arisen within various trade unions in the county. Often, the situations are not reported, and advertisements are published or news articles are released without authorization. Some even directly file lawsuits in court. As a result, minor issues escalate, and major issues become unmanageable, negatively impacting the future of the labor movement and causing other complications. This is highly inappropriate. To strictly prevent future occurrences, yesterday, a special order was issued to all trade unions, notifying them that any disputes must be reported to the General Labor Union for mediation.

Capture and Delivery of Bandit Leader

On the night of the 30th of last month, the Pufu Temple at Dayang Bridge, Fanghu Township, in the third district of the county, was robbed by three bandits, resulting in significant losses. Following the incident, He Chao, the chief of the Zhouxinzhen Police Station in the jurisdiction, paid close attention. The day before yesterday, Chief He led five officers to the temple to investigate and search for the escaped bandits. Subsequently, in the Shangfengzhu area, the main suspect, Gu Agen, was apprehended. The next day, another suspect, La Li Afu, was captured in Zhoutan. On the 9th, both were delivered to the general bureau for investigation.

### Changshu

Restoration of "Grievance Mound"

The county's widening of the north-south main road will soon be completed. However, there is a pile of earth behind the old county field east of the chamber of commerce that is scheduled to be leveled. Upon investigation, locals such as Yan Zhixin have stated that this pile of earth is called "Grievance Mound" and holds significant historical value in the national revolution. They request that it be preserved and even built upon, to serve as a model. When the Manchurian forces arrived in Su during the Qing Dynasty, they sent a magistrate to Changshu and ordered the people to shave their heads and change their clothing. The populace unanimously resisted, leading to a struggle at the yamen. The magistrate was bitten to death. When the authorities above received the report, they dispatched troops to massacre the city, reaching Ouzhenzhen outside the east gate before halting the slaughter (therefore, the truly Changshu natives are only the people of Ouzhenzhen; all others have migrated from elsewhere). After the massacre, a new magistrate was sent to Changshu and posted a notice, ordering the people to shave their heads, with the phrase "Keep your hair, lose your head; keep your head, lose your hair." Therefore, many who refused were killed. The severed heads had to be sent to the yamen, gathered in the back, and buried in that location. A total of twenty-one heads were buried there. Later generations named this place "Grievance Mound." During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, gazetteers dared not record this, leading to the destruction of the spirit of national resistance warriors over the past three hundred years. Upon receiving a letter, the county party headquarters will restore the mound.

### Hangzhou

Bridge Construction on the Hangzhou-Caoe Section

The construction of the Hangzhou-Caoe section is progressing rapidly. All seventy-nine small bridge steel beams have been transported to the work sites and are starting to be erected. This is expected to be completed by the 10th of next month. Fifty thousand railway ties have been transported to Hangzhou. Starting on the 15th of this month, track laying will begin in the Xiaoshan and Qianqing sections, with ballast gradually laid using ships. Bidding for station buildings has begun and construction has started. The No. 4 caisson of the Caoe River Bridge has sunk to eighteen feet. The bridge body is expected to be fully constructed by June 15th, steel beams are expected to be delivered by August 5th, and the bridge is expected to be completed by September 5th.

### Dinghai

Japanese Ship Sinks Fresh Fish Boat

The Jinyulong fresh fish boat, operated by the Shanghai Gongda Fish Company, with a carrying capacity of nine hundred dan, was collecting fresh fish in the waters off Sheshan when it was suddenly struck and sunk by the Japanese fishing vessel Daizhen Hakupi on the evening of the 2nd of this month. All the crew members fell into the water. Fortunately, Zhang Ahe, a fisherman from Xiazhi Lianghu, was fishing nearby and witnessed the incident. He immediately did his best to rescue the crew. He rescued all thirteen people, including Wang Achang, and transported them to Shenjiamen on the 6th, requesting the fisheries office to handle the matter.

### Taixian

Egg Prices Plunge

For farmers in Jiangbei's Taidong and other counties, raising pigs, chickens, and fish has always been an important side business. The quantity of eggs exported each year is particularly large, greatly contributing to rural finance. However, recently, the market price of eggs in the county has repeatedly fallen. On the 6th, the market price had fallen to about sixteen yuan per hundred jin, one-third cheaper than a month ago. Farmers, needing funds urgently as the wheat harvest season approaches, are reluctantly selling at a loss. According to rural farmers, there is such a period of low prices every year, which they call "wave market." They hope that each township can organize an egg sales cooperative to stabilize market prices and compensate for this rural loss.

### Odds and Ends from the Yunnan Journey (10)

— A Cup of Tea

At noon, some went to "Dongshan" and "Fairy Cave" for sightseeing, some went to "Qianling Mountain" for a panoramic view, some went to "Guanfeng Terrace" to overlook the entire city of Guiyang, and some went to "Jiaxiu Tower" to explore history. Behind Jiaxiu Tower are two iron pillars commemorating Ertai's pacification of the Miao people, as well as a plaque with the words "Juwei Pavilion" and a poem written by Ruan Yuan in the eighth year of Daoguang when he served as the academic administrator of Guizhou. There is also a line by Pei Mou, with two memorable phrases: "Bronze drums do not startle topknot dreams, reed pipes have long changed barrel skirt styles." This describes the actual situation of the Miao people at that time. Guiyang was the land of Guifang during the Yin and Zhou dynasties and only became a province in the early Qing Dynasty. However, the various regions of western Guizhou only became pacified in the early years of Daoguang, so there is no detailed history to examine. Cao Jingyuan, the civil affairs director, has newly compiled "General Overview of the Miao People in Guizhou," which is quite clear, and includes Miao people's "water paintings" and "Yi script stone carvings" discovered in western Guizhou, recording several dozen characters, all similar to Zhou Han bronze inscriptions, which proves that the Miao people also accepted Yan Han culture. In the afternoon, Dr. Yu Zhongxiu visited. Mr. Yu is an old friend from the small newspaper circles in Peiping. He was transferred to Anshun as the president of the court by Shan Chongqing, the chief of military law of the Chongqing headquarters. He came specially to meet me. Mr. Yu said that the case situation in Guizhou Province is very light. The Miao people do not like litigation, and there are not many difficult cases. The backlog of cases has been cleared. At three o'clock, Director Xue Yue invited me to a tea party, where his wife personally made six Cantonese dim sums, of which "Shark Fin Chicken Rong Shaomai" and "Crispy Skin Assorted Box" were the best. At the same time, Commander Chu and Secretary General Xue Cixin distributed the members of the delegation to return to Beijing via the north and south routes. Seventy-five people returned via Guangxi, and forty-two people returned via Sichuan. After arriving in Chongqing, these forty-two people plan to go to Chengdu to visit Jiading, Qingcheng, and Emei. Those returning via the south route were invited by Chairman He Yunqiao to visit Nanyue when passing through Hengzhou. In the evening, the provincial government presented a book titled "Today's Guizhou," which recorded everything in great detail, so there was no need for investigation. The best newspapers in Guiyang Province are the Morning Post and the Revolutionary Daily. Central broadcasting messages can be arranged on the same day. In the evening, the New Life Club of the Second Route Army held a variety show with one Kun opera, three Peking operas, and one martial arts performance. Commander Chu was specially invited by all sectors to perform a set of Tai Chi. Since the suppression of the communists throughout the territory, the situation of education has gradually developed and has greatly improved compared to two years ago. Although the city streets are not clean, they are much better than last year. The Miao people are afraid to use their brains and cannot keep pace with the Han people, so it seems appropriate to set up a simple curriculum first to train teachers and then distribute them to the villages for simple guidance so that they can be promoted and benefit everyone. Mr. Wang Wenxuan was ordered by the Central Political School to investigate where in the southwest it would be suitable to set up a political branch school. This belongs to the training of high-level talents, while the need in Guizhou seems to be to set up more extremely low popular education. Director Zhang Zhihan also sees this.

Day Twenty-one (April 25) Rain. From Guiyang, 40 kilometers to Huaxi Village (formerly known as Huagelao), a Miao farming village. The scenery outside the village is excellent. There is a lake in the middle, surrounded by mountains, quite similar to Lake Lausanne in Switzerland. The mountains are named Dragon, Snake, Turtle, and Kirin. A three-story book pavilion is built on Turtle Mountain. The quiet environment is better than West Lake. A little to the north is Biyunwo, with Miao people's homes where they spin, weave, farm, and eat by themselves. They rarely buy things from the outside world. They also offer gods in their homes. Cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep are all raised next to the bedrooms to make it easier to take care of them. Further ahead is Stone Village, where a cooperative has been established. Farmers mortgage items to trade for what they need. The current Guizhou authorities are using this as a standard farming village and have also established a mass education center.

In the afternoon, I returned to the city and attended a banquet hosted by Zhang Zhihan, the director of education. There was a dish called "Frozen Fungus," which was white and tender. Guizhou produces white fungus, which can also be called silver fungus. Mrs. Zhang is the daughter of Dr. Gao Shuo and can speak the dialects of Peiping, Wuxi, and Guangzhou. She is known as a standard beauty in Guiyang. Mrs. Cai, whose name is Wenna, the wife of Telegraph Director Yang Zihui, also studied in Europe and is proficient in piano. She also played for the guests in the theater. In the central park of Guiyang, there is a bronze statue of Zhou Xicheng. Some people once advocated removing it and building a statue of Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek heard about it and said that although Zhou Xicheng was a failed warlord, he also contributed to local construction, so why remove his statue? Therefore, it is still preserved to this day. However, after reading Zhang Daofan's "Secret Code," Zhou's bronze statue seems unnecessary to keep. Also, three friends from Guizhou in the group, such as Mr. Shi Weixin, Mr. Wan Cong, and Mr. Meng Guangzhao, had left Guizhou for twenty years or fourteen or fifteen years. This time, they returned to their hometown and were extremely kind, but the children met them and did not recognize them. Cao Jingyuan, the director of civil affairs, published the deeds of Hu Linyi in governing Guizhou as a political example and also carved the posthumous works of calligraphy and painting of Zheng Ziping (Tong) and funded the planting of trees at Zheng's tomb, treating the predecessors with courtesy to encourage the gentry, which is also a style of governing Guizhou. That evening, the Guiyang Reporters Association invited colleagues to the Petit Paris Cafe, and Wang Songnian was elected to give a speech, which was very appropriate, and the guests and hosts were all happy.

Day Twenty-two (April 26) Rain. Departing from Guiyang, the mountain scenery is beautiful and completely different from eastern Guizhou, quite similar to the scenery of Guangxi. Passing through Pingba County, there were many "Midang Flowers" along the way, nine-tenths of which had been temporarily removed a few days ago. Originally, the anti-opium policy in western Guizhou still had several years of preservation according to the law. After planting them, they were removed again, and the farmers complained endlessly. The tour group today is no longer a tobacco inspection team. Wu Junzhang, the widow of Qi Weifu, also drove a car and joined the group to send the delegation to Anshun. In the evening, we arrived in Anshun. The main streets in Anshun City are all paved with square stones, which were built by Yang Sen's troops. The people are very grateful for this. The city has a "nun team" who put their palms together and lined up on the side of the road to welcome people from all walks of life. This is a characteristic of this trip. Anshun has an incomplete middle school (the only complete middle school in Guizhou is in Guiyang). Five miles outside the city is Huayan Cave, which can be explored deeply. Residents along the cave plant Midang flowers. It is said that since the tour group came, farmers in Guizhou Province have suffered losses of more than one million yuan because they have been ordered to remove the flowers along the roads within their reach, and those farther away, where they do not need to be removed, are not exempt from land tax. They are very angry with the officials for not informing them before planting so they could have chosen not to plant them. Because of this year's severe drought, the farmers' livelihoods are almost exhausted, and the officials would have allowed a period of flexibility, but now that part of the flowers has been removed, it is too late to plant anything else. In the evening, the commissioner's office held a tea party. Commissioner Zhang graduated from Baoding Military Academy and is in charge of nine counties. He is very serious about the Clean Countryside Campaign. Also, the various districts in this area are stationed by Xia Shi, Yang Sen's troops, and the military and civilians are very peaceful. A month ago, Xia Shichang captured Guizhou's four major bandits, sent them to the provincial capital, and sold tickets for people to watch. More than 10,000 spectators came to watch. This is because the people of Guizhou have feared the four major bandits for a long time. When people in the family scold children, they often say that the four major bandits are coming, and the children dare not make a sound. Now that all four have been captured, everyone is rushing to see them. The money from ticket sales has been used to establish a Miao school. Anshun is the first prosperous county outside the provincial capital. The three Gu Zhenglun, Gu Zhengwang, and Gu Zhengding, are all from Anshun, and their father still lives in the city.

### All Sectors Hold Grand Meeting Yesterday to Commemorate May Ninth National Humiliation

Over 500 Representatives Attended, City Flew Flags at Half-Mast in Mourning

Yesterday was the anniversary of the May Ninth National Humiliation. The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters specifically convened representatives from all sectors at the Mass Education Center on Wenmiao Road at 10:00 AM yesterday to hold a commemorative meeting. The chairman of the Municipal Committee, Xing Wan, reported the significance of the commemoration. The entire city flew flags at half-mast in mourning and entertainment was suspended for the day. Details are as follows:

Participation from All Sectors

Participants included representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Local Court, First and Second Special District Citizens' Federations, Journalist Friendship Association, General Labor Union, Postal Workers' Union, and native place associations of Baoshan, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, etc., as well as representatives from various levels of party headquarters, agencies, and schools, totaling over 500 people.

Chairman's Report

At 10:00 AM, the meeting was called to order with the ringing of a bell. Chairman Xing Wan, leader of the Municipal Committee, presided over the ceremony. He then began the report, stating briefly, "Today is the anniversary of the National Humiliation. Japan has long coveted China and, taking advantage of the intense European war and Yuan Shikai's obsession with his imperial dream, presented our country with conditions for national subjugation. The details of the process (I believe are well known to everyone and need not be repeated). However, the reason why Japan was so daring and Yuan Shikai was so stubborn was that the people lacked awareness of the country. In this commemorative meeting, we should awaken the people and expand the inherent family concept into a national concept. All interests should be based on the nation. At the same time, we should eliminate feudal thinking, so that the people have a deep understanding of the Three Principles of the People, so that the unity of the country becomes increasingly consolidated, and all construction projects move forward. Furthermore, the Communist Party has been destroying unity and national construction in recent years and should be forcefully corrected. If they can work hard under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People, they can participate in the revolution as a member of the nation. Otherwise, they must be thoroughly eliminated and cannot be tolerated."

Commemorative Slogans

At the end, he shouted slogans: ㊀ Commemorating the National Humiliation requires strengthening national defense! ㊁ Eliminate traitors! ㊂ Eradicate the Red Scourge! ㊃ Consolidate unity! ㊄ Strive for economic construction! ㊅ Long live the Three Principles of the People! ㊆ Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! ㊇ Long live the Republic of China!

Flags at Half-Mast in Mourning

In addition to sending representatives to attend the commemorative meeting of the National Humiliation from all sectors, all agencies, groups, and schools in the city flew flags at half-mast for one day in mourning. Shops on all roads also flew flags at half-mast. Major theaters, cinemas, and amusement parks in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas were closed for one day. The city's radio broadcasting station stopped broadcasting to show that it would not forget the national humiliation. The city's military police were on alert for the day to maintain public order.

Other Commemorations

㊀ The Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Seamen convened representatives at 10:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the headquarters to commemorate the National Humiliation. In addition to all the committee members and staff of the headquarters, the Seamen's Union, and the Seamen's Branch, a total of 300 representatives from the Navigation Safety Association, Foreign Port Cargo Handling Mutual Aid Society, Zhongcang Guild, Navigation Helmsmen Carpenters Mutual Aid Society, Yihuo Houcang Tongyi Society, Yihuo Cargo Handling Club, New Taikoo Cargo Handling Club, and other associations attended. Chairman Yang Hu, a special commissioner of the headquarters, led the ceremony. Director Liu Huogong reported on the origin of the National Humiliation and the preparations for avenging it in the future. The propaganda section of the headquarters also printed and distributed leaflets titled "Commemorating 'May Ninth' requires determination to sacrifice and avenge the humiliation under the principle of self-reliance and self-defense." The Hai Sheng Monthly, published by the headquarters, specially issued a special issue commemorating the National Humiliation on the same day and distributed it on the spot.

The newly appointed Pacification Director of the Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi Border Region, Shangguan Yunxiang, recently took his family to Shandong to return to his home province and had been there for ten days. According to news from Shangguan's Shanghai residence yesterday, General Shangguan has already returned to Shanghai from Shandong by train and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:50 AM this morning.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry Requesting Negotiation on Foreign Residents Paying Income Tax

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance regarding the matter of foreign residents paying income tax according to law, saying: "Respectfully addressed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing. Since the implementation of the income tax regulations on January 1st of this year, Shanghai merchants have wholeheartedly supported it as the starting point for the country to promote new taxes. On the one hand, they studied the tax system to make it simple, and on the other hand, they led the industry to declare and pay taxes on time. All of this should be on record in the report of the competent department to the collection agency and need not be repeated. However, the foreign residents are still delaying and holding out, so that the provisions of Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations are equal to being empty regulations. Within the same territory, the tax obligations are divided into two sections, which will allow cunning people to pretend to be foreign residents and indulge in deception. This will greatly hinder the implementation of the new tax. The foreign residents in China are divided into three categories: ㊀ countries that have not signed a treaty, ㊁ countries that have signed an equal new treaty, these two categories are not a problem, ㊂ countries that have not yet abandoned the old treaty, according to the treaty, this type of foreign resident also promotes civil and criminal litigation, which belongs to the case where the foreign resident is the defendant, which is tried by the official of their country, and is not given the treatment of diplomats, exempting them from the obligation to pay taxes to the country where they are located. It is requested that your Executive Yuan (Ministry) order all the officers in charge to handle the matter seriously in accordance with international practice, so as to protect sovereignty and maintain the tax system, which is fair and convenient. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows, Geng."

### Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Company Continued to Hold Establishment Meeting in Shanghai Yesterday

Zhang Gongquan, Wu Yunzhai and others were elected as directors and supervisors. The company's preparations are complete and it is scheduled to start work in two months.

The Guangda Porcelain Company, initiated by industrialist Du Chongyuan, has received support from Kong Xiangxi, Xiong Shihui, and others, and has raised a capital of one million yuan. It held an inaugural meeting in Shanghai on December 28th of last year. The company's articles of association were approved earlier, but at that time, the directors and supervisors appointed by the Jiangxi Provincial Government had not yet been determined and could not be submitted to the general meeting for approval, so another date was set. Yesterday afternoon, starting at 2:00 PM, at the World Society on Ferguson Road, the inaugural meeting was continued to report on the preparations and elect the directors and supervisors. 119 shareholders, including Xiong Shihui (represented by Gong Xuesui), Gong Xuesui, representative of Jiangxi Province, Zhang Gongquan, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Du Chongyuan, Li Dingkui, and Kong Lingkan, attended. Details are as follows:

Reporting on Recent Preparations

After the meeting began, Chairman Zhang Gongquan gave an opening speech, announcing the continuation of the inaugural meeting. Then, the initiator, Du Chongyuan, reported on the recent preparations. However, Mr. Du has been in Shanghai for a long time, so Preparer Yang Zhiping reported, extremely detailed, which is as follows: ㊀ In terms of construction, the factory buildings have all been built, and the offices, staff dormitories, and clubs are currently being built by merchants. It could have been built earlier, but due to the spring rain and the bidding method for the contractor to prepare materials, it was not easy to bid. Recently, the construction company that built the factory buildings contracted the job. ㊀ In terms of purchasing machinery, most of it is manufactured by the China Iron Works. Originally, it was intended to purchase it from Japan, but it has now been decided that the China Iron Works will send people to the Northeast to manufacture it in the same way. It will be installed in about two months. ㊀ In preparation for starting work, because scientific methods are used for making porcelain this time, there are very few skilled workers, so they were recruited from Northeast China. However, it is easy to burden the workers coming south by using the company name, so Du Chongyuan sent a letter to recruit them. More than ten people have been recruited, and it is expected that 100 apprentices will be recruited in Nanchang, Jingdezhen, and Jiujiang at the end of May. The workers will be responsible for training them.

Elected Directors and Supervisors

In accordance with the articles of association, the Jiangxi Provincial Government appointed Gong Xuesui, Wen Qun, and Xiao Chunjin as directors, three people in total. The alternate directors were Tang Shoumin, Song Ziwen, and Mu Ouchu, three people in total. ㊀ The elected supervisors were Shi Jiu'ao, Wu Yunzhai, Zhang Wenhuan, and Hu Ruoyu, four people in total.

### Time of Mercury's Transit Across the Sun

— Prediction by Ye Youqin

May 11th of this year, i.e. the 2nd day of the fourth lunar month of the Xia calendar, Wuxu, is the date of Mercury's transit across the sun. At that time, Mercury will be seen to cross the edge of the sun from east to west, south of the sun. I have now calculated the standard time seen by the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory as follows:

Mercury touches the sun's surface at 4:55:48 PM.

Mercury is closest to the center of the sun, 15 minutes and 53 seconds south, at 5:03:34 PM.

Mercury leaves the sun's surface at 5:11:22 PM.

Also, according to the fixed number of times that Mercury crosses the sun, when it passes the quadrature point, it is about a few days before and after the Beginning of Winter. The first time is about 13 years apart. The second time is about 7 years apart. The fourth and sixth times are about 3.5 years apart. When it passes the conjunction point, it is about a few days before and after the Beginning of Summer. The third and fifth times are about 9.5 years apart. The cycle repeats, circulating about once every 46 years. The next time Mercury will cross the sun is on November 12th of the 29th year of the Republic, around 8:00 AM, passing across the sun's surface for 5 hours.

At 1:40 PM the day before yesterday, holding a donation book, he approached Shou Jichun, a native of Shaoxing living at No. 46, Dean Lane, Taopeng Road, to write a donation of two yuan. Shou asked, "Do you know Mr. Chen Yucai of the Boji Charity Association at No. 245, Huade Road?" He claimed to be from the same charity organization, so he pretended to agree and asked him to sit for a while, saying he had other business and would be back soon. He immediately inquired by telephone and found out that the Chengji Charity Association was established on Maigen Road and was canceled last year. The Boji Association did not send anyone out to solicit donations. At this time, Yu Arong knew that things were not going well and took the opportunity to escape. He was caught by Shou Jichun on Kunming Road and handed over to Chinese detective Ma Anxiang, along with the donation book, and taken to Yulin Road Police Station for detention. The next morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the events and said that the investigation should be postponed. He presented the donation book for inspection. Then, according to Shou Jichun's proof of the incident, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Zhong Ji ordered him to be taken back into custody for further review.

### Western Domestic Helper Sues Husband for Divorce

### Yangjiazhai: Police Investigate Case of Murder and Robbery

Suspected of Coming Specifically to Kill

At 3:00 a.m. on the 5th of this month, six bandits broke into the home of Chen Tingzhang, a wealthy household at 188 Yangjiazhai Road, Pudong, and went deep into the bedroom. Because the house had several guard dogs, they barked wildly at the bandits, waking Tingzhang's eldest son, Jia Peng. Having received military training at school, and being physically strong and brave, he rushed out with a hunting rifle. In the darkness, he captured one bandit. Because the family had been driven into one room and no one could help, another bandit holding a gun shot Jia Peng in the lower right back. The bullet exited on the right side. The captured bandit took the opportunity to escape. The bandits then pretended to chase after each other and fled through the side door. Jia Peng died at the Hunan Hospital due to his severe injuries. After the case occurred, Zhang Mingqin, head of the Pudong Police Branch, and Xu Xianming, head of the security regiment, paid attention to it. Director Zhang offered a reward of one hundred yuan and ordered the case to be solved within three days. Now that the deadline has passed, there are no clues, so an additional reward of one hundred yuan has been offered, and detectives have been ordered to investigate strictly. Yesterday, he took his staff to Chen's house for a detailed inspection. After careful study, the theory that the bandits descended from the upstairs window with a rope was deemed unreliable due to the lack of any traces on the inner wall. Moreover, the side door that was pried open was operated from the inside, making it impossible to open from the outside. Therefore, it is suspected that one of the bandits had secretly entered the house in advance and responded at the appointed time. Furthermore, after the bandits entered the house and went to Tingzhang's room, all the family members had already been confined. At this time, it was impossible to rob calmly. However, the bandits did not rummage through boxes and cabinets or take any property. They chased Jia Peng, who ran out of the front hall of the house, and then shot him down. Judging from their actions, it seemed like a planned assassination rather than a simple robbery. The purpose of the murder seemed to be Tingzhang himself. Fortunately, Tingzhang lived in Puxi and escaped the disaster. Based on this line of thought, the director has instructed his subordinates to strictly investigate.

Yesterday, Judge Zhao Yuesheng held a court hearing. Zhao Yin'e stated that her father, Zhao Qingzhang, also known as Baotou, passed away 14 years ago. He had four children: two sons and two daughters. The eldest daughter has also passed away. All the property was previously managed by her mother. When her mother passed away two years ago, her two brothers divided all the property, without giving her a single share, and without considering her livelihood. Because she is not married, she has to make a living as a helper. Her father had previously allocated 1,000 yuan in her name, which was also seized by her second brother and never received, only receiving 190 yuan in interest. Therefore, she is now suing her brother Zhao Quangen, sister-in-law Sun, and nephew Zhao Linqi for a division of the inheritance, requesting one-third, including 20 mu of land in Baoshan, estimated at about 500 yuan per mu, totaling 10,000 yuan, and 17 houses, estimated at 5,000 yuan, totaling 15,000 yuan. She requested assistance with litigation costs, etc. The defendants were not present, but a lawyer appeared in court and stated that the land price and other values did not match.

### Plaintiff Appeals Again in Land Company Embezzlement Case

Second Special Court Opens Investigation Hearing; Lin Ziwei and Others Submit Evidence

Xu Kaimin, a current engineer at the Beijing Water Company and a native of Fujian Province, and Lin Yuqing, a technician at the Sulgang Steel Plant of the Army Department in Rihuigang, this city, formerly raised 10,000 yuan with fellow townsmen and old relatives Lin Ziwei, Chen Zhang, and others to establish a land company, with Xu serving as manager. Land was purchased on Kangnaot Road in West Shanghai to build houses for rent. Later, because Xu went to Beijing to take office, all management duties of the company were entrusted to Lin Yuqing. Later, due to insufficient capital, in addition to mortgaging to Shengsheng Bank, they also borrowed from Xinyou Bank to barely complete the construction of the houses for rent. Lin Ziwei and Chen Zhang, because Xu and Lin Yuqing had been operating for many years without holding shareholder meetings or reporting accounts, and had rashly mortgaged and borrowed money, feared that the company would suffer losses in the future and that the disputes between shareholders would be unclear. In order to avoid future troubles, they transferred all their shares to Xu and settled the accounts clearly. However, because no share certificates or agreements had been established at the beginning, Lin Ziwei and Chen Zhang, after transferring their shares, discovered that Xu Kaimin and Lin Yuqing had illegally embezzled a large amount of money, and after unsuccessful negotiations, they hired lawyer Sun Biwu to file a lawsuit in the criminal court of the Special Court, accusing Xu Kaimin and Lin Yuqing of the crime of occupational embezzlement, and also attached a civil lawsuit to recover the embezzled money of more than 7,000 yuan. The defendants hired lawyers Ge Yuanqin and Lin Nanchen, etc. to defend them. After repeated court hearings and testimony by Judge Sun Penghang, it was considered that the evidence of the defendants' crimes was insufficient, and Xu Kaimin and Lin Yuqing were found not guilty, and the attached civil lawsuit was dismissed. Because the plaintiffs were dissatisfied with the judgment, they appealed to the Third High Court. The day before yesterday, the presiding judge Wu Tingqi summoned the appellants and their lawyers to the court to open an investigation hearing. After questioning the reasons for the appeal of the appellants Lin Ziwei and Chen Zhang, the lawyers presented their opinions and submitted evidence. The court ordered that a date be set for trial.

### Establishment of a Corpse Examination Center in the Chinese Area

Police Bureau and Court Discuss

According to Dagong News Agency, the city of this municipality is vast and densely populated. In recent years, social customs have been deteriorating and business has been sluggish, resulting in cases of revenge killings and suicides in the urban area almost every day. However, when such cases occur in the two concessions, the examination of the corpses is generally carried out by the Forensic Examination Center on Fielun Road in the Common Concession and the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Forensic Examination Center on Ningbo Road in the French Concession. In the Chinese area, the corpse examination center is still lacking. Due to the administrative relationship between the Chinese and concession areas, the procedures are very troublesome. In order to meet the needs of society and improve urban construction, the Municipal Police Bureau plans to set up municipal corpse examination centers in Nanshi and Zhabei. After a case occurs, examination procedures or collection of corpses will be carried out at any time to avoid exposing corpses in the alleys and affecting hygiene. The competent department of the bureau and the Shanghai Local Court have discussed this several times. A part of the funding will be raised from local charities and gentry merchants, and a part will be requested from the Municipal Government and the Judicial Administration Department. Once the funds are raised, land will be selected for construction. The internal construction equipment is planned to be more complete than the corpse examination centers in the concessions. However, the date of commencement has not yet been determined.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (23)

Question: The Q&A for the 23rd issue explained that the mailing of samples is limited to products or items sold by factories and businesses that are sent out without charge, solely as samples. Items mailed by individuals, regardless of quantity, cannot be sent as samples. If someone uses their academic knowledge to create a certain chemical product, such as toothpaste or vanishing cream, and sends it to various businesses under their personal name as a sample for selection, and does not charge a price, can it be sent as a sample? Also, what are the procedures for sending samples? Please explain in detail.

Serum ampoules and various organ instruments used for reference in pathology, but only if their manufacturing and packaging methods do not harm others.

The procedures for sending samples, except for wooden or metal whole items that do not need to be packaged according to commercial practice, must be properly packaged according to the nature of each item, the distance of the journey, and transportation conditions. For example: 1. Glassware, porcelain, or other fragile items should be packaged in metal or wooden boxes or strong corrugated cardboard. 2. Liquids and easily melted items must first be tightly sealed in glass bottles or other containers, and then placed in metal or wooden boxes or strong corrugated cardboard containers, and fully padded with wood chips, cotton, or sponges to absorb the liquid in case the bottle breaks and prevent damage to other postal items. Also, the lid of the box must be extra sealed, preferably nailed down, to prevent the contents from falling out. 3. Greasy items such as ointments, soaps, resins, etc. should first be sealed in wooden or leather inner boxes and then placed in metal or wooden boxes. 4. Various pigments and dry powders must first be placed in metal boxes and then covered with wooden boxes, with wood chips filled between the two boxes to ensure stability.

The above packaging methods should be as stable as possible, but also easy to open for inspection. The post office may require the sender or recipient to open the sample on the spot for inspection when it deems necessary.

Each sample must not weigh more than 500 grams (approximately 1 catty), and its dimensions, length, width, and thickness, must not exceed 90 centimeters in total. The largest side must not exceed 60 centimeters. If it is a roll, the diameter twice plus the length must not exceed 100 centimeters, and the largest side must not exceed 80 centimeters.

### Death for Justice

— Shi Ji

It seems like it was the year before last when a minor official, distressed by national affairs, jumped into Xuanwu Lake and committed suicide. At the time, it caused quite a stir in public opinion, with some lamenting and others "blaming the virtuous" (from the Spring and Autumn Annals), saying he was evading responsibility. Unexpectedly, not long after, Mr. Ruan Zewen, a Guizhou native who had previously served as a county magistrate, also jumped into Xuanwu Lake to commit suicide because he "had the heart to love the country but lacked the power to serve it." Before jumping into the water, he also took a large dose of "Lysol" to show his firm determination to die and the righteousness of his death for justice.

Regarding suicide, we either sympathize with the plight of the deceased and cannot bear to blame them deeply, or we feel that the suicidal lack the courage to grit their teeth and live on. Especially for those who "have the heart to love the country but lack the power to serve it," we always feel that their death is taking the easy way out, unintentionally weakening a force for saving the country. If it is said that "because of overwhelming grief and no way to serve the country, they only rely on this sacrificial determination to remonstrate with the people through their death," then in my opinion, it may not have much effect. It is just like this patriotic person jumping into the water: when he jumps in, there is a splash, but after the waves are carried away by time, the surface is as smooth as a mirror, as if he had never jumped in. It is better to wait—as long as the green hills remain, there is no need to worry about firewood. "It is much better to do some work to save the country and wait for the tide of national anger to surge up and push the waves!"

Let's put these aside for now. Let's first quote a passage from his suicide note:—

"The government, following the principles of 'ten years of recuperation and ten years of education,' endures humiliation and bears burdens, responding calmly. Its ultimate strategy is certainly beyond the comprehension of ordinary citizens like us. I believe that the national spirit of North China has gradually declined, and the enemy is using various means of coercion and inducement. As time goes on, there will be more traitors, and the enslavement will deepen. It will be difficult to revitalize the people's spirit, and saving the situation will become increasingly difficult."

This can be seen in conjunction with what Ms. Ishihara Kiyoko, a Japanese colleague, said to the reporter of the Da Wan Bao. Ishihara Kiyoko said: "Only after arriving in the South did I understand the North." What she "understood" about the "North" was: "There are many prostitutes and opium in the North; the spirit of resistance among the people in the North is not very strong. To this day, the people of North China are still living peacefully."

These are probably the facts, which are the best annotation of "As time goes on, there will be more traitors, and the enslavement will deepen." However, to deal with these painful facts, it is best to wait before "sacrificing oneself to show sacrificial determination." "Having the heart to love the country, even if there is no power to save it, it will certainly not be impossible." To put it negatively, living with resilience means that even if the enemy wants you to die, he will at least have to spend an extra bullet, but now that you have "sacrificed yourself" for nothing, that bullet could just as well kill a fellow compatriot. Before "not becoming a slave of a fallen country," there was originally a saying, "I would rather be a ghost under the gun." Have we forgotten this saying?

—"Life is a hundred years, and death is inevitable. Why not seek life in death and die for a worthy cause, rather than enduring humiliation and living in shame?" This statement is very correct, but committing suicide for "death for justice" is definitely not "dying for a worthy cause." Moreover, before "dying for a worthy cause," one should still "seek life in death!" Therefore, those who "have the heart to love the country" and live on are definitely not entirely "reluctant to leave life or afraid of death."

Our lives should be more valuable, and our deaths should be even more valuable!

### Mule Driver

— Wu Zantang

It was raining early in the morning. By the time we passed Qing Song Ridge, I didn't know what time it was. The mule cart was slowly moving forward with great difficulty on the rugged mountain road. Bean-sized raindrops, mixed with sharp mountain winds, hit us head-on, feeling like a knife stabbing my face. The mule driver pulled his hood down tightly, hunched his back, exhaled cold air, and whipped the skinny mule with great force. The mule neighed from the whipping and ran desperately. The mule's hooves clattered on the dangerous mountain road, filling one's heart with terror and desolation. The cart body shook uncontrollably, and the person sitting in the cart also felt uneasy. I couldn't help but ask through the cart railing:

"Hey! Old Liu, why are you whipping it so hard? Isn't it dangerous to run so fast on this rugged mountain road?"

The mule driver, Old Liu, had a gloomy face, as gloomy as the sky. He seemed to have swallowed a mouthful of phlegm in his throat, spitting out a low, barely audible voice.

"You bookish fellows really don't know the height of the heavens or the distance of the roads. These days aren't peaceful. We still have thirty miles of mountain road to cover before we reach Guanghua County for lunch. If we don't hurry, it will be dark, and if something bad happens on the road, no one can guarantee anything!"

After listening, I stopped speaking. I just felt like something heavy was pressing on my heart. It seemed like a hero would suddenly jump out of the forest ahead and shout, "Hey! Leave the money for the road!"

The cart continued to shake on the rugged mountain road. Whenever it slowed down a bit, Old Liu would whip it fiercely, and the crisp echoes would ring in the empty valley.

After running silently for twenty miles, we finally finished the rugged mountain road. Old Liu finally breathed a sigh of relief, and the cart gradually slowed down. But by this time, it was already dark, and we couldn't distinguish the surrounding scenery. There was only a faint, endless muddy road that seemed to be vaguely visible. Old Liu held the reins, took out the short pipe from his waist belt, lit it, and put it in his mouth to smoke. A dazzling spark flickered in the darkness! The pungent smell of smoke drifted into my nostrils, which was quite unpleasant. After taking a few puffs, Old Liu seemed to have reduced some of his fatigue. He suddenly turned his head and asked me, "Master, why are you only staying for a few days this time? If we reach Guanghua County today, you can take a car tomorrow. Master, when will you be back again? Old Liu will still be happy to pick you up."

I showed excessive fatigue, as if I was about to fall asleep, and simply replied:

"Hmm! That's hard to say!"

"Master, the world is really bad now! These days are not like before. There are often bandits (Note 1) who come out to rob rich sheep (Note 2). The most unclean section is the Qing Song Ridge. There's always something going wrong. We're lucky to have made it through this section today. After this, there are ten miles of official road, so we don't have to worry about any trouble."

He took another puff of smoke, as if taking something out of his bag. He used his trembling hand to pinch the mouthpiece and took a few more puffs in a row.

"Master, I have this bad habit. I have to smoke three or four cents worth of opium every day. If I don't smoke, I don't have any energy. The few coins I earn from a hard day's work are never enough to smoke opium..." He shook his head, and the rest of the words were left unsaid.

My eyelids, which were about to close, were suddenly chased away by his words. I glanced at his gloomy face again, and the skinny mule were just like both of them were under the same fate. Seeing that I didn't answer, he whipped the mule again. The mule, as if struck by an arrow, leaped with both hooves and galloped towards the forest with a little firelight.

That night, I stayed in a hotel in Guanghua County. I couldn't fall asleep, and I kept thinking about the loyal mule driver and his companion, on whom his livelihood depends on.

Note 1 (Meaning bandits) Note 2 (Bandits’ term for travelers)

### A Conversation Among Several Frugal Students

— Cao Juren

On the Shanghai-Hangzhou train, I happened to meet several young students who had come to Shanghai from their hometowns to study. I took the opportunity to talk to them about the situation in their schools. One of them was in a private university, two were in private middle schools, and several were in national universities. Their annual expenses varied greatly. Not only were the expenses for private middle schools higher than those for national universities, but sometimes they were even higher than those for private universities. It is said that even within the same school, there could be a difference of three to five times. It is not uncommon for a university student to spend over a thousand yuan a year, while poor students can barely make do with more than three hundred yuan. I myself am from a farming family, and the production of a farming family can be calculated. It is truly difficult to set aside three hundred yuan a year for the education of a child. However, knowledge cannot be bought with money. Students who spend more money may not necessarily get good grades. Poor students who do not have breakfast or dinner often achieve very good results. One of the young men had the worst family situation. He could only barely scrape together about two hundred yuan a year to attend university. I asked him how he supported his life, and he told me everything in detail: "I attend a national university, so the tuition is relatively low. My grades are also good, so I sometimes get a little scholarship to make up for it. However, the cost of meals for a year is considerable, at least over one hundred yuan. The cost of books is also not low, plus travel expenses, clothing expenses, and so on. Two hundred and fifty yuan a year, I don't know how to manage it. Therefore, I try my best to save on what I need. For example, for brushing my teeth, I buy a Samsung toothpaste; for drinking tea, I drink a glass of plain water; for writing, I buy a Jinbuhuan pen. I only think about practical aspects, and I don't need to pay attention to any luxury. Even with a tube of toothpaste, some classmates buy foreign goods, saying that it costs more than one yuan a tube, which is almost five times more expensive than what I use. Everything costs a little more, so naturally it's nothing to spend more than a thousand yuan a year." One of the middle school students, who came from a relatively well-off family, spent five or six hundred yuan a year. He was a little unconvinced by the university student's description of his frugal spending and said, "What's so great about using Samsung toothpaste? Many of our classmates use Samsung toothpaste. Does that mean they are all model hard-working students?" Because their argument suddenly turned to Samsung toothpaste sales, I felt it was not good and quickly mediated. I said that he was right to seek practicality. A country's national consumption should match its productive power. Without this productive power, to seek excessive consumption, not to mention that young students should not do this, even wealthy millionaires with abundant annual income should not do this. The meaning of "practicality" should be interpreted as balancing production and consumption. They all agreed with my explanation, and the middle school student stopped saying anything.

### Noon Break

— Yu Lu

Beneath a large fire wall painted with the character "Soy Sauce," several strong men were mixed together in a chaotic fashion. Among them were porters, rickshaw pullers, vagrants, beggars,... But, what did it matter? The sunshine did not have any class distinctions for them.

They were naked, liberating their chests that had been cramped up all winter. Their hands searched through their tattered cotton clothing for their friends, those bedbugs that had been parasitic on their flesh and blood throughout the winter. They were doing this work with great interest and excitement.

Two or three of them were entertaining themselves by rolling copper coins. At times, they would raise their fists towards their opponents for a bit of minor contention.

Time is unforgiving. They should well cherish these short moments.
