On the 20th at noon, amidst rain and snow, they took a Eurasia special plane from Nanjing, stopped briefly in Zhengzhou, and flew directly to Xi'an to meet again with Yang Hucheng and others.

For the sake of the entire future of the country, the decision has been made to strictly enforce government orders. (20th Dispatch)

Tongguan The Central Government believes that the relationship between Shaanxi and Gansu provinces is extremely important to the national defense of the Northwest, and will certainly not allow the Red bandits to run rampant. In order to pacify the local bandits and consolidate the Northwest border defense, the National Army has a meticulous military deployment. In the future, whether the bandits flee south to Shaanxi and Gansu or cross the river north to Shanxi will be impossible. Their extermination by the National Army will certainly not be a problem. A part of Zhang's troops' generals have shown repentance. The Red bandits occupy Bao'an, Anding, Fushi, and Yanchang in northern Shaanxi, with Fushi as their base. A part of them went south to join Zhang Yang's troops, based in Weinan and Pucheng. The Red bandits are about to enter and exit Shangxian and Zhen'an in southern Shaanxi, attempting to disturb the border between Shaanxi and Henan. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched Wang Guang to cooperate with personnel from the British and American embassies to handle the formalities for foreign nationals leaving Shaanxi, which has come to an end. A total of 75 people in the first batch and 6 people in the second batch have all passed through Luoyang and have been separately transferred to Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai. Because three foreign nationals in Pingliang, Gansu have already left the country, Wang Guang will pass through Luoyang to Beiping and will have to wait in Luoyang before returning to Beijing to report. The Eurasia plane that went to Xi'an on the 19th returned to Nanjing with an empty plane at noon on the 20th because all the foreign nationals had left the country. (20th Dispatch)

[Zhengzhou] 64 foreign nationals in Xi'an arrived in Zhengzhou on the morning of the 20th and were transferred to Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jinan. The Eurasia charter plane remained in Shaanxi, waiting to carry American nationals from Pingliang. (20th Dispatch)

[Nanjing] According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' telegram from Wang Guang, the handling of the departure of foreign nationals remaining in Shaanxi has been completed. It is planned to take the original plane back to report on the 21st. (20th Dispatch)

[Xuzhou] The foreign nationals in Xi'an arrived in Xuzhou this afternoon on a Longhai Railway passenger train, totaling 58 men, women, and children. 42 people were transferred to Shanghai by train, and the remaining 16 people took the evening train to Jinan. (20th Dispatch)

[Luoyang] The American Consul in Wuhan telegraphed Luoyang on the 20th, notifying Bao Maoxun, the secretary of the American Embassy in Luoyang, and Wang Guang, the section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that the three American nationals living in Pingliang had departed from Pingliang on the 19th to Hanzhong and would not come east for the time being. After Wang received the confirmation, he immediately notified the Eurasia plane that flew from Luoyang to Xi'an at noon on the 19th and the British and American military attachés, Chuan Ruize and Ba Ruide, to return to Luoyang quickly. It is heard that the plane will carry the three military attachés, Chuan Ruize, Si Kaotuo, and Ba Ruide, back east from Xi'an on the 21st. Wang will return to Beijing to report after the plane arrives. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Xuzhou] Of the foreign nationals living in Shaanxi and Gansu who were rescued and came east, 71 people in the first batch got off the train in Luoyang, 13 people, and 58 people arrived in Xuzhou at noon on the 20th. Lupu Road prepared a second-class carriage, and 35 men and women, as well as three young children, went south that noon. Another 14 people, as well as two young children, went north to Jinan that evening. According to one foreign national, there is still a group of injured people in Shaanxi and Gansu who have arrived in Xi'an, waiting for a plane to come east. We left Xi'an at noon on the 18th, taking eight cars to Tongguan and changing to the Longhai train to arrive here. Many of the Red bandits who arrived in the provincial capital were in plain clothes. It is heard that Xu Xiangqian, Xu Haidong, Mao Zedong, and Peng Dehuai have arrived in Xi'an and met with Yang Hucheng and Zhang's generals. Most of the Red bandits are still gathered in Sanyuan, Jingyang, and the northern bank of the Wei River, supplied by Yang Hucheng. Wherever the bandit troops go, they wantonly disturb the area, especially by arresting landlords and gentry and extorting them in every possible way, which is resented by the people of Shaanxi. Yang Hucheng is quite responsible for the protection of foreign nationals. When we left Shaanxi, the atmosphere of war was extremely strong, but the Chishui front line had not yet officially clashed, with only sentry battles occurring at night. The people of Shaanxi believe that the Red bandits are active and Yang's troops are completely paralyzed, and the provincial capital is full of terror. They hope that the Central Army will quell the rebellion as soon as possible. Most of this group of foreign nationals are missionaries, and the rest are engineers and businessmen. When leaving Shaanxi, they were only allowed to carry light luggage. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] After the Eurasia plane flew over Xi'an from Luoyang yesterday, it stayed overnight. It has not taken off at 10:30 AM this morning. According to Lt. Col.

The reason for the plane's delay is unknown, but it is believed that a small number of foreign nationals are unwilling to leave the country. The military attachés will do their best to persuade these people. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

### Song Zheyuan Publishes a Letter to Comrades in Hebei and Chahar

Upholding National Unity and Implementing Central Government Orders

[Beiping] Song Zheyuan published a letter to comrades in Hebei and Chahar, with the following key points: ① Uphold national unity and implement Central Government orders. Pledge to achieve political rejuvenation through self-reliance and strength. ② The essential elements of a country are sovereignty, land, and people, which are the military's natural duty to protect. ③ Communism is inherently unsuitable for China and has long been recognized by enlightened people. I have repeatedly refuted Marx's theory of surplus value. The bandits are using this name to incite the masses, incite class struggle, and achieve their purpose of plundering rights. In fact, killing and arson are purely bandit actions, and they do not know what doctrine is. They only endanger the foundation of the country and slaughter the lives of the people. (20th Dispatch)

[Beiping] Song Zheyuan believes that the country is in dire straits, and today, the Political Council and the Pacification Office jointly issued four orders to the military and political organs under their jurisdiction, ordering them to resolutely implement them: 1. Do not participate in civil wars. 2. Anyone who invades our territory and insults our personality is an enemy and must be fought. 3. Bandits and communists who disrupt social order should be punished by everyone. 4. Suppressing bandits should not be regarded as a civil war, and suppressing communists should not be regarded as a civil war. They should be thoroughly eliminated to ensure social stability.

In addition, seven companies of a certain party's troops are stationed in the East Beach of Nanchaoqian, with about 500 to 600 people.

The National Army has long been aware of this and has made considerable preparations. The bandits have absolutely no chance to succeed. Although there are small groups of bandits harassing the eastern border of Sui from time to time, it is not a concern. The actual number of bandits and puppets in northern Chahar is still no more than 20,000. A certain party recently sent personnel to the Shangdu North Reclamation Point to inspect Wang Ying's bandit troops. Because Wang had too few people, he temporarily pulled 400 to 500 farmers to make up the numbers. Their outwardly strong but inwardly weak situation can be imagined. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Guihua] In the past two days, the east of Sui has gradually become peaceful again. The Sui North project has been completed, and Fu Zuoyi has sent a special commissioner to inspect it.

They have been completely repelled by our army in recent days. Recently, small groups within the bandit army have fled to our side from time to time. A certain party sent a large number of planes to pursue and bomb them. (19th Dispatch)

### Smuggling by Ronin on the Jinpu Railway is Rampant Again

Buying Tickets According to Regulations and Luggage Does Not Exceed the Limit Li Xingzheng Connects with All Parties to Suppress Smuggling

[Tianjin] The smuggling by ronin on the Jinpu Railway has recently become rampant again. This matter began a week ago. Ronin form groups, each with 30 to 40 people, disguised as passengers, wrapping artificial silk, seafood, sugar, foreign cloth, and other items into luggage, each roll weighing about 60 kilograms, and taking the Jinpu passenger train south, getting off at Cangzhou, Botouzhen, or Jiyan and selling them to major cities and towns in Hebei and Shandong at extremely low prices. Although the customs and railways are aware of this, because the ronin all carry weapons and buy tickets to ride the train, and the weight of their luggage does not exceed the regulations, they cannot be inspected and detained, resulting in the three-class passenger trains traveling south on the Jinpu Railway being extremely crowded every day. The newly appointed Director of the Railway Anti-Smuggling General Inspection Office, Li Xing, is connecting with all parties to discuss anti-smuggling methods, but there has been no result. Customs estimates that the smuggling will be rampant in the two weeks before and after the abolition of the year, and may be more severe than last summer. (20th Dispatch)

In terms of rice quantity, the Ministry of Railways may instruct the Yuehan Railway Bureau to urgently improve freight transport so that Hunan rice can be sold smoothly in Guangdong, thereby increasing the rice supply and seeking adjustment.

### Prices for Second Batch of Luyang Salt Exported to Japan Have Not Been Agreed Upon

Beaches Refuse to Sell at Old Prices; Export by End of February Unlikely

[Tianjin] The price per ton and the quantity for the second batch of Luyang salt exported to Japan had previously been discussed between the two parties and were nearing resolution. Recently, the Chinese side, due to the significant domestic industrial and commercial demand for salt, intended to increase the agreed-upon 300,000 tons to 500,000 tons. The beaches indicated that they must increase the selling price to maintain their costs and refused to sell to the Japanese side at the old price of the first batch. Negotiations are still underway, and it seems unlikely that the export by the end of February will be realized. (Special dispatch from the 20th)

### The Franco-Turkish Dispute in the League of Nations Council Meeting

— Fu

The first regular meeting of the League of Nations Council this year is scheduled to open today in Geneva. Attending are the foreign ministers of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Poland, and other countries. Mr. Gu Weijun, the representative of our country, will serve as chairman. Important issues on the agenda include the Free City of Danzig problem, the Franco-Turkish dispute over the minority issue in Syria, and the refugee relief issue in the Spanish Civil War. Among these, the most important is the dispute between France and Turkey over their colonial territories in the East.

France and Turkey have historically had very friendly relations. This dispute arises from the jurisdiction over the areas of Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria. These two areas are important regions in the northwestern corner of Syria near the coast. Before the war, they belonged to Turkey. After the war, they were incorporated into Syria and became French mandated territories. However, the residents of Alexandria and Antioch are mostly Turks. Therefore, Article 7 of the 1921 Ankara Treaty stipulated that "the Alexandretta region shall be governed by a special administrative system. Turkish residents in the region shall enjoy all facilities to develop their national culture. Turkish shall be considered an official language." Similar statements were made later in the 1926 Luvenel Agreement. If these treaty obligations could be faithfully implemented, disputes between the two countries would not arise. However, according to the Turkish government, France has not faithfully fulfilled these treaty obligations and has often treated the Turkish minority in the Alexandria and Antioch areas unfairly. Therefore, Turkey is now demanding that France return these two cities to Turkey or establish them as independent regions. However, from the French perspective, the reasons put forward by the Turkish government are merely a pretext to reclaim old territories. France believes that out of the 219,000 residents in the Alexandria and Antioch areas, only 85,000 are Turks, accounting for 30% of the total population. The majority of residents are Arabs and other ethnic groups. France also cites facts to show that they have not discriminated against the Turks. For example, Turks occupy 13 of the 23 mayoral positions, while Arabs occupy only 10. Turks also occupy a majority in the administrative organs of the region. For example, the ministers of public works, agriculture, education, and health are all Turks. Arabs only hold the position of Minister of Finance.

The opinions of both France and Turkey mentioned above have considerable justification. However, the reason why this issue has recently become serious is not because France has discriminated against the Turkish minority in the Alexandria and Antioch region, but because of the changes in the situation in the Near East. There are two phenomena in the changing situation in the Near East. First, France signed treaties with its two mandated territories, Syria and Lebanon, last year, allowing them to become independent and planning to introduce them to the League of Nations. As a result, Turkey wants to take the opportunity to reclaim the Alexandria and Antioch regions or make them an independent organization not subject to the rule of an independent Syria. Second, Turkey's foreign policy has recently shifted from passive to active. In the past ten years, Turkey has been devoted to construction, working hard to become strong, and its national power has greatly increased. Therefore, it has recently been thinking about expanding outwards to reclaim territories lost after the war. For example, last year it restored the fortifications in the Dardanelles region. The recent demand to France to reclaim the Alexandria and Antioch regions is also a manifestation of this active foreign policy.

The discussion of the Franco-Turkish issue at this Council meeting is because the Turkish government filed a complaint with the Council last year. The Council resolved to send a three-person investigation committee to the Near East to conduct an on-site investigation. The report will be presented at this meeting for detailed discussion. Although we cannot yet predict how this issue will be resolved, given the close relationship between France and Turkey in the past, both sides will certainly make considerable concessions to achieve a satisfactory resolution.

### President Roosevelt Sworn in to Defend the Constitution

Unjust Blemishes Will Be Eliminated as Much as Possible; 300,000 People Participate in the Ceremony

[Washington] In his speech upon taking office for his second term as president today, Roosevelt declared his determination to eliminate "unjust blemishes," which make America feel lacking in the midst of abundance, and to make every American citizen a citizen who shares the joys and sorrows of their country.

President Roosevelt, who has just solemnly sworn to defend the Constitution, gave a broad interpretation of the powers of the Constitution in his speech. He said, "Our ancestors built a sound government with the power of united action. From that day to this, all difficult problems that individuals and localities cannot solve can be solved easily. They established the federal government to promote the happiness of the people and to obtain the enjoyment of freedom for the American people. Today, we must still appeal to the power of this government to achieve the same goal. The Constitution of 1787 did not diminish our democratic spirit in the slightest." Roosevelt continued, "The progress of the restoration is extremely obvious, but the significance of the new systems created in all aspects since 1933 is more than that. "Now, with new materials used in social justice, we are engaged in building a more lasting structure on the old foundation for the better use of future generations." Roosevelt also said, "Now there is one thing that runs counter to our American democracy, that is, today there are tens of millions of citizens who are still denied most of the minimum standards needed for their current lives. It must be known that the test of our progress is not whether we have made those who are already rich even richer, but whether we can satisfy those who enjoy too little." The President's concluding remarks were: "If I can fully understand the spirit and purpose of our country, we will certainly not value enjoyment, speculation, and cowardice. We must move forward. I now swear again as President, taking on the solemn obligation to lead the American people forward on the path they have chosen." (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)

[Washington] The crowd gathered in front of the Capitol today to watch President Roosevelt's inauguration ceremony for his second term reached 50,000 people. It rained heavily, and everyone was soaked. Although the sky was dark, the weather was slightly milder than usual, and the people's enthusiasm was not diminished in the slightest. The number of people who came to the capital specifically to watch the event reached more than 300,000. The military parade was quite long. President Roosevelt watched them pass by the observation platform specially built outside the White House. The military flags fluttered, and the sound of military music filled the air. The observation platform was built in the style of the home of President Jackson, the seventh president, who was also a Democrat and was also re-elected. President Roosevelt stood in a space surrounded by glass. Participants in today's ceremony were limited to representatives of civil servants and the military. The first team was one representative from each military unit and each officer training school in the country. The order was determined by the order in which each state passed the US Constitution, led by Postmaster General Farley, who was a strongman in this Democratic campaign. President Roosevelt's re-election was due to his great efforts. The second team was all military personnel from the Navy and the Army. Four hundred members of the civilian land conservation corps, all in uniform, carrying hoes, shovels, axes, etc., also participated. Hotels and boarding houses in Washington were all full. The overnight fee for a single room in a large hotel was at least ten US dollars, so each hotel's profits tripled. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)

### US Fleet Commander Visits Singapore

Not Without Political Significance; Symbol of Friendship Between the Two Countries

[Singapore] US Fleet Commander in Asia, General Shanar, told reporters here yesterday that the US fleet in Asia will visit the British $50 million USD naval port in the Far East from time to time in the future. In addition to the flagship leading the destroyer fleet on an annual visit, other warships will also come frequently and independently. It is hoped that the British fleet will also visit US naval ports from time to time, which will be a "symbol of friendship between the United States and the United Kingdom." Singapore newspapers believe that the US fleet's emphasis on the British naval port is not without considerable political significance, but US Consul General in Singapore, Davis, said that the US fleet's visit to Singapore has no other political effect other than expressing "goodwill." (Guomin Telegraph dispatch from the 19th)

### Japanese Parliament Reopens Today

The Two Major Parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, Have No Determination to Overthrow the Cabinet; The Huge Budget Will Become a Fierce Point of Contention

[Tokyo] The Japanese parliament will reopen tomorrow, and the political atmosphere here is extremely tense. Each political party held a conference today to express its attitude. Among them, the attitudes of the two major parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, are particularly noteworthy. The Minseito Party, which represents the largest party in the House of Representatives, declared that it has no determination to overthrow the cabinet. The moderate wording of the declaration shows that it is dyed with the colors of the ruling party, even more so than the Showakai. The Seiyukai's declaration lists various failures of the government, but in the conclusion, it expresses very little power to fundamentally change the current cabinet situation, limiting itself to impeaching the government. The Social Mass Party's declaration is clearly different from the declarations of the two government parties, strongly stating the need to overthrow the Hirota cabinet. Its position on domestic and foreign policies is clearly expressed, which seems to attract attention from all parties. The National Alliance and the East Association also advocate overthrowing the Hirota cabinet, but the reasons for their arguments are very different from those of the Social Mass Party, and their influence is far less than that of the Social Mass Party. Observing the atmosphere on the eve of the reopening of the parliament today, the current cabinet, although facing many obstacles, can still overcome the difficulties and continue to exist because the two major parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, did not advocate overthrowing the cabinet. However, the important key lies in whether the tax increase plan will be changed, and the diplomatic issue is secondary. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 20th)

### Today's Parliamentary Procedure

[Tokyo] The parliamentary procedure for the 21st is as follows: The House of Peers will convene at 10 AM, beginning with Prime Minister Hirota's speech on the government's policy, followed by Foreign Minister Arita's speech on foreign policy. Then, it will proceed to the question-and-answer session for the speeches of the Ministers of State. Watanabe, Sakatani, and others will raise questions. Then, the bill to amend the Commercial Code will be submitted. The House of Representatives will convene at 1 PM. After the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister give the same speeches, Minister of Finance Maba will deliver a speech on financial policy. Sakanouchi Yukio of the Minseito Party will be the first to launch the question-and-answer session. (Allied Press dispatch from the 20th)

### Government Faces Many Difficulties

[Tokyo] The parliamentary recess period has ended and will reopen tomorrow to formally discuss various important government affairs. The government continued to hold cabinet meetings on the 18th and 19th, deciding on the content of the speeches of Prime Minister Hirota, Foreign Minister Arita, and Finance Minister Maba in the parliament, and several dozen important bills will be submitted by the government at the beginning. The various factions of the House of Representatives also held meetings on the 20th to decide on the final policy for dealing with the parliament. This parliament is the first ordinary parliament after the establishment of the Hirota cabinet. In addition to the large budget of 3.04 billion yuan, there are also important cases such as tax increases, diplomacy, electricity, and compulsory education, which are bound to involve overlapping waves and complex subtleties, so its progress is particularly noteworthy. Moreover, various political parties have expressed opposition to the government's foreign policy, and due to high prices and public unrest, a part of the normal sector has even demanded a review of the budget. Therefore, after the parliament reopens, there will definitely be a tense scene. The Japanese people are all paying attention to its development. (Allied Press dispatch from the 20th)

### Division of Forces among Factions

According to our newspaper's survey on the 20th, the distribution of power among the various factions in the parliament is as follows: 162 members in the House of Peers affiliated with the Research Society, 67 with the Justice Society, 41 with the Huoyao Society, 34 with the Friendship Club, 34 with the Tonghe Society, 22 with the Tongcheng Society, 32 Independents, and 18 members of the Imperial Family. In the House of Representatives, there are 205 members of the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party), 172 of the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government), 25 of the Shōwakai, 20 of the First Control Room, 18 of the Social Masses Party, 2 of the Proletarian Party, 19 of the Second Control Room, 5 affiliated with the Tenth Group, 14 Independents, 12 with the National League, 9 with the Eastern Society, and 4 pure Independents, totaling 466.

### Soviet Russia Uncovers Another Major Counter-Revolutionary Conspiracy

Trotskyite "Parallel Center" Military Tribunal Scheduled to Hear Case on the 23rd

[Moscow] The Soviet Public Prosecutor's Office recently issued a public announcement stating that the organs of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs have completed the investigation of the Trotskyite "Parallel Center" case. The "Parallel Center" case involves Piatakov, Radek, Sokolnikov, and Serebriakov, who, in 1933, following the orders of Trotsky, who was exiled abroad, formed the group along with the Trotskyite Center of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Smirnov, and Mrachkovsky. The investigation has proved that the "Parallel Center" was ordered by Trotsky to organize sabotage and terrorist groups. These groups carried out sabotage in various enterprises, especially those with national defense significance, and prepared to use terrorist means against the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. These groups were also ordered by Trotsky and the "Parallel Center" to carry out espionage work on behalf of certain countries. The investigation proved that the criminal activities of the "Parallel Center" and the Trotskyite organ party members charged in this case were aimed at destroying the Soviet military strength, promoting armed aggression against the Soviet Union, assisting foreign aggressors in occupying Soviet territory, dividing the Soviet Union, overthrowing the Soviet regime, and restoring capitalism and the rule of the bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union. Defendants Piatakov, Radek, Sokolnikov, Serebriakov, Muralov, Livshitz, Drobnis, Boguslavsky, Knyazev, Rataichak, Norkin, Hestov, Stroilov, Turok, Grashi, Pushin, and Arnold are proven to have committed crimes, and they have all been publicly prosecuted.

### Italy and Germany Firmly Cooperate to Prevent the Reddening of Central Europe

Opposing the Establishment of Soviet Political Systems in Western Countries Willing to Pay Any Price in the Face of Crisis

Capri Island General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation, declared here today, "Italy and Germany have decided to oppose the rise of communism in Central Europe and Spain. The threat of reddening has reached a serious stage in Spain. Italy and Germany cannot allow communists to gain a foothold in Central Europe. Therefore, we will resolutely oppose any development that increases this kind of red disaster with all our strength." (National News Agency, 20th)

[Berlin] Today, General Göring issued a statement to the newspapers, saying that Italy and Germany are determined to oppose the establishment of Bolshevism in Spain, regardless of the cost. Göring also stated that Italy and Germany have consistent ideas and opinions, and the systems of authority and command are also the same. The two countries have recognized that they should firmly cooperate to overcome the great danger of the spread of Bolshevism in the world. This danger has reached the most acute level, so the two countries have decided to oppose any development that increases the danger with all their strength. As for the rumors that the Italian government had tried to persuade Germany not to insist on its policy towards Spain, it is completely unfounded. Göring ended by saying that the warmth of the welcome he received in Italy shows that the Italians have not forgotten the friendly assistance Germany gave during the East African war. (Reuter, 19th)

Naples, Italy After General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation, went to the nearby island of Capri the other day, Crown Prince Umberto of Italy also took the destroyer "Valreno" to the island to accompany Göring for a day. General Göring has now decided to stay on the island until Friday of this week, presumably to meet with Mussolini once more before returning home. (Havas, 19th)

### British Foreign Secretary Eden's Speech on the Diplomatic Situation

Strongly Advocating the Policy of Non-Intervention in Spain Hoping that Countries Will Cooperate to Seek Peace in Europe

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in the House of Commons today that 1937 is expected to be a difficult year for international problems, but he said that this year will also be a year when international opportunities come. Eden solemnly stated that Britain may be invited to do more in world affairs this year, so Britain has a great responsibility.

The Foreign Secretary stated that in recent years, diplomatic affairs have occupied a large position when the government usually holds meetings with the parliament. This is due to the ordinary people's desire and worry for peace. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not yet been universal. He does not mean that the desire for peace of certain people is not as eager as that of Britain. He only says that because of the lack of complete freedom to express opinions and communicate with each other in various places, world public opinion has not been able to exert its full strength on peace. This is a situation that Britain regrets, because Britain deeply feels that the number of people in the world who desire peace is very large. If all the barriers set up for freedom of communication and freedom of speech are destroyed everywhere, then the threat to peace that exists today can be greatly reduced. The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the civil war in Spain, saying that the current situation in Spain has made all other affairs in the international arena pale in comparison. Although the danger that the Spanish civil war may plunge Europe into a whirlpool of war has not been completely eliminated, this danger has indeed been limited. If anyone believes that the result of the Spanish civil war will be that any foreign power or powers will rule Spain for thirty years, that is, manage its way of life and guide its diplomatic policy, he believes that this person is completely wrong. Of all the results, this is the least likely to be realized. (Cheers from the crowd) Britain certainly opposes this kind of encounter. This is not only opposed by Britain. All 24 million Spaniards also oppose it. Now the only event that can unite Spain is the common disgust for foreigners. The magnanimous Spaniards will have the slightest sense of disgust for the countries that interfere in Spanish affairs. The act of interference will eventually be bad humanity, not only this, but also bad policy. Britain and Spain certainly have interests, but it is not Britain's concern what kind of special political system Spain should have, whether it is right-leaning or left-leaning, because if Britain has a position on this kind of event, it will fall into a war of conflicting ideas, which is what Britain deeply hates. Therefore, Britain has always opposed foreign interference and will continue to maintain this aspiration in the future.

The Foreign Secretary stopped his debate at this point in order to clarify the "matter concerning the principle of non-interference" that had been raised during the question time in the House of Commons. The Foreign Secretary solemnly stated, "There is not a single word, not a single line, not a single point in the Anglo-Italian Joint Declaration that can give any foreign country the right to interfere in Spanish affairs, no matter what form the government of any part of the country takes."

The Foreign Secretary then continued the debate, saying that Britain is concerned about two things in the Spanish war: ㊀ The war must not spread outside of Spain, ㊁ The political independence and territorial integrity of Spain should be maintained. Therefore, non-interference in the Spanish civil war will still be the correct policy for Europe to pursue. The Foreign Secretary then brought up the issue of volunteer soldiers, and traced back to the British government's efforts to conduct an agreement since Christmas Eve, so that foreign people can be prohibited from joining the Spanish combat groups on both sides, and said that the failure to put forward this issue earlier is the reason why certain powers have this kind of dispatch of volunteer soldiers.

When the Foreign Secretary mentioned the French government's bill prohibiting its volunteer soldiers from leaving the country and joining the Spanish war, he said that if all countries' governments can do this, then they can approach a compromise, and it will certainly not be like the conflict of opinions today.

The Foreign Secretary answered because the communist member of parliament, Mr. Greig, had raised the issue of Spain recruiting soldiers in the United Kingdom, so he said that anyone who is recruited to go to Spain, their purpose is purely for money, not to agree with their doctrine. It can be clearly understood from the situation of a certain British recruit recently, because according to this person's claim, Spain hired him as an aircraft pilot, with a weekly salary of forty pounds and all expenses paid, in addition, if he can shoot down an enemy aircraft, he will be given a bonus of five hundred pounds.

The Foreign Secretary also cited the example of a certain unemployed miner, saying that this person was induced to go to Spain when he was drunk, but because he woke up in the middle of the journey, he escaped from the ship and returned to his country.

The Foreign Secretary also mentioned the humanitarian efforts in Spain, saying that both the Spanish government and the Nationalist army should be held responsible for the failure of the negotiations for the exchange of a large number of prisoners.

Regarding the status of Morocco, the Foreign Secretary declared that the reports received from the British Consul-General in the area are all comforting. In addition, the British government has also received reports on the investigation of Hòa Tǎ and Mí Lǐ Lā'ěr area, knowing that there is no evidence that German troops have landed or are preparing to land in these two places. The Foreign Secretary also assured the House of Commons that the government will continue to pay close attention to the situation in Morocco.

The Foreign Secretary also said that the British government hopes and deeply believes that after the establishment of the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Declaration, the tense relations between the two countries will come to an end. However, the establishment of the above declaration does not mean that the British government's policy has changed, or that the British side has made any concessions, and there is no change to any of Britain's existing friendships. Its only function is to greatly help stabilize the situation in the Mediterranean. The Foreign Secretary also said that the French Foreign Minister, Delbos, expressed great welcome to the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Declaration. Turkey, Yugoslavia, Greece and Egypt have also expressed their approval.

The Foreign Secretary also stated that the government has seen that the reorganization of various military preparations is the only necessary method to achieve their goals. The so-called goal is to negotiate a pan-European solution and consolidate the authority of the League of Nations. The Foreign Secretary said that political appeasement and economic cooperation, if they are to succeed, must rely on the concerted efforts of all parties. If this can be achieved, then we will be able to create a better, healthier, and more prosperous Europe in a peaceful world. But to achieve this goal, we must reduce military expenditures and learn economic cooperation methods so that living standards can be improved.

The Foreign Secretary then mentioned Germany, saying that people around the world are now asking where will racism and nationalism lead Germany and all of us? If Europe continues to float towards an increasingly vague future, and if it continues to be torn into pieces by national adversarial factions and very different thinkers, then its hope of survival will be very slim, and its trauma will not be healed by several generations. Germany has the power to choose in deciding the fate of its country and all of Europe. If it chooses the path of full and equal cooperation with Europe, then no one in Britain will do their best to help eliminate misunderstandings and pave the way to peace and prosperity. But merely empty talk and local remedies can heal the pain we are currently feeling. This kind of fantasy is of no benefit. Therefore, any country that cooperates with other countries and abandons the attempt to interfere in the affairs of other countries must not have any thought of evasion and retreat.

The Foreign Secretary concluded his speech by saying that the world cannot be ruled by conventions, agreements, and noble speeches. The way to cure is to abandon national monopolism, accept the European countries as legitimate partners in the overall solution of Europe, reduce military preparations to the extent necessary for national defense, accept the League of Nations as the international body to resolve all cases, and move towards the path of cooperation together. Only then will there be hope for peace. (Reuter, 19th)

### The Council of the League of Nations Meets Today

Italy Alone Has No Representative Present

[Geneva] The Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to hold its ninety-sixth regular meeting tomorrow, chaired by the Chinese representative, Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun. There are a total of sixteen member states of the Council. At this meeting, only Italy did not send a representative to attend. In addition, nine of the fifteen countries belonging to Europe are attended by the foreign ministers in person, namely British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Foreign Minister Delbos, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüștü, Polish Foreign Minister Beck, Spanish Foreign Minister Del Vayo, and Latvian Foreign Minister Munters. Portugal in Europe, Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador in the Americas, and New Zealand in Australia have also sent representatives to attend. In addition, Ecuador has not sent a representative to participate in the Council meeting since last September. This time, it specially sent its Consul-General in Geneva, Mr. Ruesdro, to attend as a representative, because the Chilean government has initiated the relief of refugees from various countries' embassies in Madrid, which will be discussed by the Council at this meeting. Ecuador sent a representative to attend to support Chile's proposal in order to express the solidarity of the American countries. (Havas, 20th)

[Paris] The Council of the League of Nations will meet tomorrow. According to the Petit Parisien, the Council will appoint a committee to study the issue of re-distributing raw materials, and the Polish representative, Colonel Beck, the country's foreign minister, will also request that the German Foreign Minister Neurath send someone to participate in this committee. "In addition, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, has unofficially requested a few days ago that the United States, Japan, and Brazil (all non-League members) cooperate with the committee. It is generally believed that these countries have expressed their acceptance in principle regarding this request." (Havas, 20th)

### Quasi-Wartime System Japan's Trade Deficit

[Nanjing] The trade in the middle of this month shows a deficit of 69 million yuan. The main reason for this is the sharp increase in cotton imports, with a quantity of 1.15 million piculs, valued at 70 million yuan, which is twice the normal amount. It is believed that the strengthening of exchange control has led to this reckless import. Other military raw materials such as crude oil, heavy oil, machinery, and pig iron have also shown a significant increase. In addition, the import quantity of miscellaneous goods has also increased by 15 million yuan. This is a phenomenon that should exist in the compilation of the so-called quasi-wartime system. However, other aspects of exports are normal, and the continuity of this trend is extremely noteworthy. (Domei News Agency, 20th)

### Overview of the Puppet Organizations in Chahar Province

The Puppet Meng Government is the Highest Political Institution A certain party also established a special affairs agency in Zhangbei

Zhangbei Correspondence Recently, Prince De once changed the name of the Huade Administrative Bureau in Jiabusi to Dehua, and now it has been changed back to Dehua City, with Prince De concurrently serving as the puppet mayor. The puppet municipal government is located in Prince De's palace. As for the former Zhangbei puppet Meng government, its internal organization has also undergone major changes and has been renamed the puppet "Meng Government Office". There is also a so-called Chahar Province Supreme Special Affairs Agency, in which certain people are in key positions, overseeing all military and political powers in Chahar Province. The following is a detailed description of its organizational structure and the situation of various bandit and puppet troops in Chahar Province.

Overview of the Organizational Structure of the Puppet Meng Government The Zhangbei Puppet Meng Government Office is a product of the former puppet Meng government and is now the highest puppet administrative institution in Chahar Province. Its internal organization is divided into three departments: Security, Finance, and General Affairs, and three sections: Han, Mongolian, and Manchu. Each department has several advisors from a certain party, totaling more than 30 people, and there is also a chief advisor, who is also from a certain party. The head of the puppet Meng government is Zhuote Bazhapu. The address of the puppet Meng Government Office is in Zhangbei County Government Street. In addition, the organization of the government offices in each county is also divided into three sections: General Affairs, Finance, and Security, and a search office is set up. The puppet directors of each county are all from a certain party, searching people's homes from time to time, day and night, which is very disturbing to the people. Each puppet county government has one advisor from a certain party, and each security section also has one guidance officer from a certain party.

Overview of the Organizational Structure of the Special Affairs Agency There is also the so-called Chahar Province Supreme Special Affairs Agency, which is a disguised form of a certain party's military department, located in the southeastern corner of Zhangbei County. Tanaka is the head of the special affairs agency, with about 30 subordinates, only three of whom are Chinese. Its task is to specialize in spying on the military and political situation in various places and collecting secret intelligence. Currently, there are personnel from this agency active in Suiyuan, Chahar, and other provinces. In addition, the troops in the Mongolian areas are directly under its command. As for the counties, political special affairs agencies have also been set up. Under this situation, all military and political powers in Chahar Province are in the hands of a certain party.

Prince De Purchases Vehicles and Orders Military Uniforms Prince De is currently in Jiabusi (Dehua City). Because the military transportation of various troops in Chahar Province has been heavy recently, the existing transportation vehicles are not enough. He specially sent his puppet director Zhang Jicheng to Beiping on the 17th to order 20 heavy-duty trucks, and instructed Zhang that after the trucks are ordered, he can collect the vehicle price from a certain party (stationed in Beiping). He also sent Li, the former director of the Finance Bureau of Bailingmiao, to Tianjin Huachang Military Clothing Shop to order 20,000 sets of cotton military uniforms and 17,000 pairs of horse boots. It is said that Li arrived in Kou on the 17th and has already contacted the manager of the shop to proceed. He also sent Yu, the manager of the Dehua store, to Kou to purchase a large number of military supplies, preparing very actively.

Wang Ying Requests Military Expenses for Expansion Wang Ying returned to Shangdu from Tunken Village on the 15th and plans to go to Jiabusi again within a few days to meet with the head of a certain special affairs agency to request military expenses in order to carry out expansion. On the 17th, more than 60 puppet soldiers newly recruited by Wang's troops from Yi County arrived in Kou. It is said that they can open to Shangdu via Zhangbei on the 18th. More than 300 troops of Xiong Erdu, the puppet 6th Division of Prince De's troops, also arrived in the west of Shangdu from Xisumente Banner on the 16th. As for the puppet troops that opened from Nanhongqian, the total number has now exceeded 2,000.

### This Year's Labor Service in Beijing Begins Implementation

Divided into Urban and Rural Areas for Implementation; This Year's Project Scope is More Significant Than Before

Nanjing Communication: Under the leadership of Mayor Ma, the National Labor Service in Beijing has achieved excellent results in recent years. Yesterday, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Song Xishang, reported the preparations in great detail at the weekly meeting of the Municipal Government. Regarding the situation in the 24th year, according to Song's report, after receiving the telegram from Chairman Chiang, the city immediately began to organize national labor service in the 24th year, focusing on water conservancy and afforestation. Soldiers and civilian workers were recruited to build flood control dikes along the river. More than 4,000 soldiers and more than 3,000 civilian workers participated, building more than 31 kilometers of earthen dikes and planting tens of thousands of trees.

The National Labor Service project for the winter of the 25th year has also begun and is now implementing the recruitment of workers. It was originally scheduled to start construction in Shangxinhe in the rural area on the 19th. On the 20th and 21st, Xiaolingwei and Yanziji districts successively started construction, engaging in building dikes and deepening reservoirs and ponds. In the urban area, the Qin Huai River from Tiechuangnu to Sixiang Bridge will be dredged, scheduled to start on February 1st. Later, the district chiefs in the rural areas requested a postponement of one week due to continuous rain and snow, which made construction difficult. Therefore, the Shangxinhe district was rescheduled to start on the 25th, the Xiaolingwei district on the 26th, and the Yanziji district on the 27th, all holding opening ceremonies at 9 am on their respective scheduled dates. Mayor Ma Chaojun, Director of the Public Works Bureau Song Xishang, and others will all attend. Regarding the preparations for this year's National Labor Service, the following is a record of Song Xishang's report: Firstly, the National Labor Service to be undertaken in the 25th year, its engineering plan, is divided into urban and rural areas for implementation. (A) In the urban area, the task is to dredge the Qin Huai River. Because the Qin Huai River has been neglected for many years, it is silted up, dirty, and smelly, causing great harm. Dredging cannot be delayed. We will first select the most silted section from Sixiang Bridge to Tiechuangling, which is more than 2 kilometers and 300 meters long, with approximately 19,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Calculating three laborers per cubic meter, approximately 98,000 laborers are needed. In addition, three sections, namely Taiping Bridge to Ganheyan, Huaiqing Bridge to Lishe Bridge, and Zhu Bridge, will be selected and dredged in sequence, totaling approximately 30,000 laborers. However, the riverside residences are densely packed, the slope is very steep, and there is very little open space, making it very difficult to remove, pile, and transport the excavated earth. Furthermore, the draftees have no relevant experience in taking earth from the river. At the same time, although the original accumulated water will be pumped out during construction, underground water will continue to flow, making drainage a major problem. These difficulties are currently being resolved with all efforts. (B) In the rural area: ㊀ In the Shangxinhe district, the task is to build the North Bank dike, which is the unfinished part of the previous National Labor Service, approximately 9 kilometers weak, with approximately 75,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Calculating one laborer per cubic meter, approximately 75,000 laborers are needed. ㊁ In the Yanziji district, based on the urgent needs of the district, the task is to excavate 5 kilometers of ditches, 60 reservoirs and ponds, build 2 roads, and repair approximately 17 kilometers of dikes. ㊂ In the Xiaolingwei district, based on the urgent needs of the district, the task is to build a dam, dredge 1.5 kilometers of ditches, build 6 roads, repair 9 kilometers of dikes, and dredge 270 ponds. In total, over 50,000 people must be mobilized for work in both urban and rural areas. The method of recruiting laborers is in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan, requiring all draftees aged 18 to 45 to respond. All matters regarding recruitment, dispatch, and deployment will be handled jointly by the Self-Government Affairs Office and the District Offices, together with the National Military Training Council. At the same time, with reference to the previous year's successful case, a National Labor Service Committee will be organized by relevant municipal agencies to take charge of the work in groups, cooperating fully, totaling 11 agencies, divided into General Affairs, Public Works, Propaganda, Recruitment, Supervision, and Health. Currently, in rural areas, work in the Shangxinhe district is scheduled to begin on the 19th of this month, the Xiaolingwei district on the 20th, and the Yanziji district on the 21st. Work in the urban area is also planned to begin on the 1st of next month. The scope of this year's National Labor Service is larger than last year's, and the dredging of the Qin Huai River, which has been neglected for many years, by mobilizing civilian workers is particularly innovative. It is hoped that everyone will pool their efforts and actively participate, and it is further hoped that the people can understand the government's purpose of organizing labor service, enabling them to use their spare time from farming to contribute enthusiastically, cultivating the spirit of practical hard work and serving the country."

### Travelogue of Bian and Luo

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Mingxin

Since the Xi'an Incident occurred on December 12th of last year, a month has passed in an instant. Initially, due to Chairman Chiang's presence in Xi'an, active military arrangements were made in Shaanxi Province. Even after Chairman Chiang's safe return to Nanjing, military actions ceased to advance. However, after Yang Hucheng disobeyed orders, the central government had no choice but to remain on high alert. Considering the original intention, there was no desire for aggression, but being forced into this situation, like holding a venomous snake in hand, a strong man must sever his wrist. The situation could not be avoided. Zhengzhou and Luoyang were the only transportation routes to Shaanxi, and thus became the center of the rear. The reporter, undeterred by the cold weather at the end of the year, made this journey to understand the situation and satisfy the eager expectations of the nation. The reporter traveled from Shanghai to Zhengzhou by Eurasian Aviation aircraft. The wind was gentle, the fields were abundant, and the weary birds flew as usual, nothing worth mentioning. Gradually, I learned that Eurasian had a special charter flight to Xi'an. At that time, I thought that this lone goose flying to the cloud nets would guide harmony, although the future results could not be predicted. The exchange of messengers would undoubtedly leave room for improvement. I secretly hoped for its success and awaited its development. Upon arriving at Zhengzhou Station, the reporter briefly stayed in Zhengzhou. At that time, I thought that the front line must be on alert and the rear must be tense. However, after arriving in Zhengzhou, strolling through the streets, I was surprised to find it peaceful and calm. Asking the locals, I realized that ㊀ military deployments had already been completed, and at this time, they were only supplementing and rotating troops, so the ground was not disturbed at all. ㊁ In recent years, military governance has improved. Soldiers passing through do not arbitrarily occupy residences or forcibly buy and sell goods, so the people live in harmony with them. ㊂ The people generally believe that national self-reliance and resistance to foreign aggression is the only way to save the country, and that domestic trifles can be easily resolved. All of these are signs of the country's progress in recent years, so they are worth writing about in detail. However, looking back at the city, it was mostly quiet. Although it was not affected by the passage of troops, it still did not show prosperity during this time of abundant agricultural harvests. I also eagerly wanted to know the reason and inquired about it. There were two main reasons: First, Zhengzhou is a transportation hub connecting east, west, north, and south, and it is also a center for cotton collection. Therefore, the prosperity of its market depends on external trading firms, not on local consumption. Currently, the Longhai Railway connects east and west, and the market in Chang'an also has a westward trend. Although gathering in one place is better than scattered production areas, it is still affected to some extent. In other words, this may be a reflection of the development of the northwest, and it should not be hastily regarded as a decline in the local commercial market of Zhengzhou. Second, this year's Shaanxi cotton harvest was abundant. In mid-December, when it was about to be shipped out, an incident suddenly occurred, and railway transport was suspended, with hundreds of thousands of packages stranded in the province. The stagnation of transshipment also caused financial stagnation. This is a temporary aberration, but it is not difficult to recover from. The administration of Zhengzhou is becoming more and more organized, and the city appearance is also good. Commissioner Ruan, in cracking the case of the Japanese spy agency, was unwavering, followed the law, and was praised by those in the know. This has been detailed in various newspapers, so there is no need to elaborate further. However, some friends who have seen the contents of the documents have revealed some details that are amusing. The people in charge often submitted untrue and incomplete reports, and even kept multiple blank restaurant receipts to fabricate proof of reimbursement. In addition, some people in that country had deep addictions, and smoking paraphernalia was present. Furthermore, there were countless documents of fraudulent expenses and mutual accusations. Therefore, after the case was discovered, the secretary of the embassy and the local consul also felt uneasy, which is enough to know. Zhengzhou has always been accustomed to extravagance. Recently, smoking and gambling have been banned. For smokers, they are issued licenses on an annual basis according to the central government's regulations. Although this has only just started this year, taking small steps to achieve distant goals is commendable. The reporter stayed for one day and then hurried to Luoyang, taking the newly arrived blue steel train on the Longhai Railway, which was more comfortable than the Shanghai-Ping. Thanks to Qian Zongze's efforts, the Longhai Railway has made rapid progress in materials, vehicles, locomotives, and roadwork over the years, achieving today's results. Just last year, more than 20 locomotives, several blue steel trains, and more than 20,000 tons of freight cars were added. The various machinery in the repair shop can be said to be the result of overcoming hardships. Debt repayment and passenger transport are now within reach. Unexpectedly, the Xi'an Incident came, and the railway was the first to bear the brunt. Property was damaged, and passenger transport was suspended. The estimated loss was more than ten million yuan. How could these not be the resources of the country and the material strength of the railway bureau? Therefore, every time Qian mentioned it, he sighed and could not control himself. After arriving in Luoyang, I went to the city. The streets were smooth and the people were bustling. Although there were many temporary troops stationed there, there were no signs of chaos in the city. The occupied areas were mostly public places, such as libraries and parts of schools. The senior military officers mostly resided in the residences on Longhai Road. These residences were originally for the staff, and they were used to accommodate guests. It was not difficult. This small place was the temporary capital of the National Government during the January 28th Incident, and these staff residences were also the locations of various ministries. Recalling the past, it is full of thoughts. Currently, the headquarters of Director Liu Zhi is located where the National Government was, and the magnificent characters "National Government" are still there as a memorial, which is enough to make the people of the country deeply reflect. After arriving in Luoyang, I learned that the plane that went to Shaanxi yesterday had returned to Nanjing, and that Shaanxi was more likely to achieve peace and show remorse. This was the good news I received during my journey, which can be used as the conclusion of this dispatch. (Sent from Luoyang on the 16th)

### Recent News on the Case of Shen Junru and Others in Suzhou

Lawyers Shen Junru, Shi Liang, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, and four other people were arrested in Suzhou and held in the Jiangsu Higher Court Detention Center. However, due to serious suspicion, visits were suspended, and precautions were very tight. On the 19th, Prosecutor Yu Zanian conducted another interrogation in the detention center's branch office.

### Accidental Fatality in Jiading's Winter Defense

In this county, several "wuwu" boats often join together and go deep into the countryside to steal chickens and ducks, or even commit robbery. When villagers chase and try to catch them, they flee, and some even resist. On the evening of the 18th, the Wai Gang Winter Defense Office received a report that four of the aforementioned "wuwu" boats were in the Yantieh River near the Tonggang Temple in the south market of the town.巡官 Zhu Shengying, the patrol officer of the public security substation, 叶秋鼎, the mayor of the town, and 谭思源, the platoon leader, led a team to search the boats. The first boat was normal, but the people in the second boat ignored them. After shouting for a long time, they heard movements and chicken calls inside the boat. 排长 Tan, fearing the unexpected, brought two live ammunition from his box. However, due to carelessness, he accidentally triggered the mechanism, and the bullet was fired, hitting a man named 伏 Hu in the cabin, entering from his left shoulder and exiting from his right rib, piercing his heart and lungs, causing him to bleed to death. Upon seeing the tragedy, Tan and others fled in panic, and the remaining two boats that had not been searched escaped. The deceased, 伏 Hu, was 29 years old and from Yancheng. He left behind a baby girl, only three months old. His husband, 伏如白, was 28 years old. The county government, after receiving the report, sent 何华, a supervisor from the Public Security Bureau, to investigate on the morning of the 19th, confirming that he had died from a bullet wound. The townspeople collected money to buy a coffin for the body. The perpetrator, 谭思源, was sent to the county by more than ten members of the winter defense team to surrender himself. The county government detained him for interrogation.

### Over a Thousand Drug Offenders Arrested in Nantong

In a half-month-long general review of drugs in Nantong, more than a thousand drug offenders were arrested, including more than eighty drug dealers, of whom more than sixty have already been sentenced to death.

### Interrogation in the Danyang Prostitution and Coercion Case

陈雨春, a resident of No. 28 Yanzi Lane in the city of this county, married 王 named 女顺姑 from No. 5 Wutong Mountain as his daughter-in-law through a matchmaker many years ago. After she entered the door, she was raped by an unnamed civil servant on the first night and left. On the second night, she was raped by 王, who often came to the Chen family. Shun Gu, after being stimulated by this, planned to swallow gold to commit suicide but was discovered by her family, who urgently rescued her and gave her medicine. Unexpectedly, she suddenly became deaf and mute. Shun Gu's mother, upon hearing this, immediately took her back home and filed a lawsuit with the county government, accusing 陈雨春 of coercing her into prostitution for profit and detaining her, causing injury and disability. After receiving the lawsuit, the county government, led by County Magistrate Jiang, interrogated her personally at 9:00 am the other day. According to the plaintiffs, Ms. Wang and her daughter, the mother and daughter of the 王孙 family, narrated the case and said that the defendant 王影亭 was addicted to smoking opium and had not obtained a quit-smoking license in accordance with the regulations. Subsequently, the defendants Chen Yuchun and Wang Yinting denied the allegations of coercing her into prostitution for profit. County Magistrate Jiang, after reviewing the statements of both parties, determined that the case still needed investigation and ordered each defendant to post bail. Wang Yinting was found to be privately smoking opium, and he was sent to the addiction treatment center to verify whether he was addicted before further investigation.

### Kerosene Prices Suddenly Soar in Gaoyou

Kerosene is sold widely in this county. Although there is an electric light factory, there are not many users, and the electricity is not sufficient. Therefore, most shops use gasoline lamps, and households all use kerosene lamps. 美孚, 亚细亚, 光华, and other brands are the most popular in this county. On the 15th, after the managers of each dealership received the price increase notice, speculators rushed to buy from various stores, increasing the price by five corners per box (two cans) compared to before.

Each Scores 28 Points in the First Half; Result is 57 to 46

In the second match of Shanghai Basketball Group A, Chi Zhi and Mai Ling met last night. The two teams are in different groups in Xiqing and have never met before. This was their first meeting. Chi Zhi, as a newborn calf, is not afraid of tigers. They are good at shooting baskets and especially good at interception. After the match began, Su Yinghai opened the scoring with a free throw, followed by another. Chi Zhi took a 3-0 lead first. Locke scored, and Su got another free throw, still leading 4-2. After that, Locke tied the score, but Zhang and Liang scored for Chi Zhi, leading again with 12-10. After that, from 14-12 and 16-14, Chi Zhi led. Locke scored twice, and Mai Ling finally broke through. Before long, Chi Zhi suddenly took a four-point lead with 22-18 due to Liang's two throws and Su's two free throws. This was the peak of Chi Zhi's power. However, Mai Ling soon tied the score again, 28-28, ending the first half. Although the situation passed in shock and was extremely tense, the result was still undecided. After the break, 开顿 opened the scoring. Zhang and Liang scored twice for Chi Zhi, leading again. However, in an instant, Mai Ling scored five consecutive goals, taking a lead of eight points. In addition, Liang Yunming of Chi Zhi was injured in Guangdong yesterday. After this fierce battle, his foot injury relapsed, and he withdrew to rest. 徐沛生 replaced him, but he was not discouraged. Soon, Zhang and Chen scored twice, and the difference was only two balls (40-36). After 潘洛司尔 of Mai Ling scored, 阿勃特 加因 was sent off after committing four fouls. 徐沛生 scored a free throw again, and 苏英海 continued to score, and the score gradually closed (42-41). Chi Zhi was about to recover its momentum. However, after 潘洛司尔 and 苏英海 each scored a goal, they were too eager to succeed, and 詹廷瑞 and 陈学𥚢 successively committed fouls, so Mai Ling scored with free throws and added nine points in one go. Chi Zhi still tried hard to follow. Although 张良雄 added three points, time was running out, and Chi Zhi finally lost with 57 points to 46. Before this game, there were also one game each in Group A/B and Group B1. Group B1 未名 beat 南光 with 46 points to 27. The first half was 28 to 13, and 未名 also took the lead. The game between 南青 and 青光 in Group A/B was postponed.

### Chinese Departures from Inter-Port Teams Confirmed

Western Football Club Issues Notice Yesterday: Roster Reorganized with All-Western Lineup

It has been confirmed that Sun, Chen, and Feng have withdrawn from the Shanghai Inter-Port Football Team. However, the reason is not as severe as rumored yesterday. The three withdrew simply because the newly revived Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Inter-Port Games are scheduled to be held in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year. Although the official date has not been determined, they feared a conflict. Even if the dates differed, they worried that the extended holiday would interfere with their duties. To remain available for the Chinese Inter-Port Games, they had no choice but to withdraw. This was not a result of a disagreement with the Shanghai Western Football Club. The Shanghai Western Football Club has already re-evaluated the Inter-Port selections and newly selected Brewing, Newberg, and Cochrane from the Lux Club to join the team. However, Yates from the Labour Club was dropped. A total of seventeen players remain. The lineup for this week's trial match has also been arranged. The defense will consist of Bow Sai-chung as goalkeeper and Victoria Díaz from Portugal as the full-back. The center defense line will be Perth Chen from the French Club and Chen Zhenhe. The forward line will have Brewing as the center forward, with Tiller and Habers from the Labour Club on the right wing, and James and Boscut from the French Club on the left wing. It is likely that this will become their official lineup going forward. The club officially announced these changes and the withdrawal of the Chinese players yesterday, stating that the Chinese players were unable to accompany the Inter-Port team to Hong Kong due to work commitments. Therefore, the Inter-Port lineup for the three trial matches announced the day before has been changed. All selected players must still arrive at the field by 2:30 PM and bring their own shorts and shoes. The schedule for Saturday's First Division League has also been slightly adjusted, with the Lux vs. Western Merchants match changed to Western Merchants vs. St. Francis. The reorganized lineup and the revised schedule are listed below.

Reorganized Ideal Team Lineup

Bow Sai-chung (French Club), Ma Shan-er (French Club), Perth (French Club), Victoria (Portugal), Gash (Spanish Port), Jack Water (French Club), James Water (French Club), Boscut (French Club), Brewing (Lux), Habers (Labour), Tiller (Labour) (Reserves) Whiting (Labour), Robert Stov (French Club), Greenberg (Lux), Jack (Western Merchants), Newberg (Lux), Cochrane (Lux)

### Grain

Flour and Wheat Fall Continuously

Low British and American Wheat Prices Stimulate Market Sentiment - Flour and Wheat Prices Too High Reduce Demand - Wheat Down Small Angle, Half Flour Down 75

According to a Reuters report from Liverpool on the 19th, the Liverpool wheat market was pressured by Argentinian wheat, and there were hopes for a good harvest of American winter wheat. Therefore, many parties released large amounts of wheat, especially for March delivery. However, long-term factors are bullish, such as excessive loading of Canadian wheat, the quality of new Argentinian wheat, and increased grain reserves in various countries. For example, rumors that Britain is using grain reserves as a national defense plan, and the situation of using miscellaneous grains for feed is still tight. Germany's wheat reserves are very low. In November of last year, Germany's wheat reserves were only 521,000 tons, compared to 1,325,000 tons in November of the previous year. Therefore, those who are concerned about the wheat market are optimistic.

The Chicago wheat market fell 1.125 to 2.375 points due to the liquidation of foreign markets and long positions.

The local wheat market is also depressed. Domestic flour sales have invisibly decreased due to high prices. The wheat market cannot prosper alone. After the market opened, prices for various months fell by 56 to 89 points. Until the afternoon opening, those with goods thought about delivering for the current month because there were only four or five days until delivery. However, factory stomachs were as flat as usual, causing even more anxiety. Prices continued to fall by 56 points. Distant months were more stable, with prices only falling by 131 points. Currently, the wheat market is completely stagnant because the standard has plummeted endlessly and the price must be reduced.

After the flour market opened in the morning, prices continued to plummet for various months. Chicago's quotation for foreign wheat fell 70 cents, Canada's fell 4, 6, and 7 cents, and Liverpool's fell 1 penny. Therefore, after the opening price, market sentiment was greatly shaken. Due to the frequent declines in the quotation for foreign wheat, domestic sentiment also changed due to the stagnation of actual sales. Therefore, the opening price for both near and distant months immediately fell by 56 points compared to the previous day. Afterward, sentiment continued to weaken and market sentiment continued to soften. However, after continuous sharp declines, some floating positions rose to replenish, so sentiment seemed to temporarily stabilize. Until the afternoon opening, prices fell to a low of 3.835 yuan for the current month because delivery was near and long positions had to be liquidated. February also fell to 3.86 yuan, and March to 3.905 yuan, with a difference of one dime from the previous day's closing price. Later, long positions were less likely to be reduced and short positions were thinking about replenishing, so prices gradually stabilized by two or three points. Compared to the rising prices before the year, there was a trend of absolute shortage of goods. Now, there is no end to the decline, with no turning back. This is because the situation of supply and demand is different, resulting in a downward trend.

Bean Cake Breaks 2 Yuan Mark

Shantou Gang Buys Actively After Price Drop

Yesterday's bean cake market saw Lianlian plummet in Dalian, causing local sentiment to fall. First, the brokers and domestic households released goods, so the "Four-Brand Cake" market immediately saw a sharp drop. Moreover, factories with thick goods were shouting for cheap sales, so the market price fell below the 2 yuan mark, cutting to 1.98 yuan. This caused the Shantou Gang to take advantage of the cheap price to buy actively. As a result, 23,000 pieces of Four-Brand Cake from various factories were traded. In addition, 15,000 futures contracts were traded for delivery in February and 5,000 contracts for delivery in March from the Dade New Factory. According to future trends, it may not be overly repaired for the time being, because there are still inquiries about the way to go, and bean prices are not easy to be too humiliated. However, the big end period is approaching, and there may still be changes in the middle.

Guang Gang Meets Small Purchase of Ke Xian Rice

Yesterday's market for Ke Xian rice saw the original Ke rice business very sluggish in the morning, and the market price immediately dropped a small amount. Later, because the Guang Gang had stopped business for several days, it saw that the price was small and cost-effective, and immediately purchased all kinds of brown rice smoothly in the market, totaling more than 20,000 bags. Machine rice also purchased 2,000 to 3,000 bags. There was no smooth stomach in this street, but because the Guang Gang was lively, it also slightly entertained, so it also formed 3,000 to 4,000 bags on the whole day. The whole day's transaction was very prosperous, totaling 26,000 bags. However, the market price still saw a fatigue reduction of several points to near the corner, because the Cantonese Gang was eating the price very tightly, and there were too many stocks in the market, and the cargo owners and brokers also tried to reduce the price to sell smoothly, so the large transaction was caused by the price reduction.

He Mi North Market Road Slightly Smooth

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang arrived at more than 40 houses, about 8,300 to 8,400 stone of goods. Among them, there were about 20 houses of Bo Dao. The street market's smooth sales are rarely adopted every day, the package stomach is not prosperous, only Qingdao Yantai Gang handles 2,000 or so bags of Bo Dao, so the situation suddenly becomes soft and drooping. As a result, except for high-quality materials, which are still fixed due to the scarcity of goods, the middle-section goods have all been repaired from a few points to the corner. It is even more difficult to fix the thick japonica, and it has been reduced by more than one corner. Judging from the current situation, it seems that there is little hope of turning good for a while. Du Jian follows 5 minutes less, the foreign tip is more stagnant, and it is even more difficult to change the corner and cause the arrival of limited goods, and there should be no ups and downs.

### Gauze Flower

Current Gauze Price Plummets, Standard Market Trembles

Factory Foundations Relaxed, Short Selling Active, Sufficient Chips for Delivery This Month

The gauze market lingered for several days, but yesterday a sharp decline occurred. Because spot sales were sluggish and factory foundations became increasingly relaxed, morale was weak. Spot gauze prices plummeted, and short sellers became active, making it increasingly difficult to support market prices. It was also said that there were sufficient chips for delivery this month, so selling was particularly intense. The bulls, including Indian merchants, not only failed to spend more, but by the time of closing, futures contracts for February and earlier were generally dragged down, supported by the market price.

Recent Marked Gauze Especially Weak

The opening price of marked gauze varied across different months, with near-term contracts weak and distant contracts slightly stable. As the delivery period for this month approached, rumors circulated of 3,000 to 4,000 bales being delivered, so even though the bulls held on, the market still lacked upward momentum. At the same time, spot gauze transactions were quiet, and spot prices were gradually decreasing, leading to apathy. As a result, each month's price fell by 127 coppers compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, the decline intensified, and selling pressure suddenly increased, mainly due to the sharp fall in spot gauze prices. The price of 20-count Red Man Bell gauze plummeted by 5 to 6 yuan compared to the previous day, causing morale to falter. Affected by this, market prices gradually declined. By the time of closing, the bulls again bought in a weak attempt to support prices. As a result, each month's price fell by 1.8 to 2.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Checks revealed that Dafu sold 1,310 bales, Shenji 1,300 bales, Hengde 900 bales, Senkang 2,050 bales, Changyu 1,750 bales, Runkang 3,300 bales, Hengchang 850 bales, and Xinhua 900 bales. Hengyi bought 2,400 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, Gengfeng 4,650 bales, Changji 600 bales, Renfeng 850 bales, Yichang 1,200 bales, and Changfeng 5,150 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Spot Gauze Falls 3-4 Yuan

Spot gauze sales remained flat. Checks revealed that various trading houses bought a total of 436 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by 3 to 4 yuan. The buying volume of each trading house is listed below: Jiangxi 5, Guangdong 75, Mainland 58, Counterparts 25, Changsha 0, Ningbo 0, Henan 53, Total 435.

Cotton Pulled Down by Cotton Yarn

The cotton market declined due to weakness in the yarn market. The cotton market, which is closely linked to yarn, was pulled into the vortex. However, the bulls held firm and did not give up, making it difficult to loosen prices in various production areas.

Marked Cotton Suddenly Drops Half a Yuan in the Afternoon

The opening price of marked cotton was slightly lower across different months, but the momentum was relatively flat. American cotton fell by 4 to 10 points, Indian cotton rose by 0.25 to 1 rupee, and Osaka's third-grade cotton saw mixed ups and downs. Market morale remained dispersed, and there was nothing exciting to report. As a result, each month's price rose or fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, due to unfavorable news from the yarn market, the cotton market was dragged down, and each month's price fell by 2.5 to 4.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Checks revealed that Tonghe sold 3,600 dan, Tonghu 2,500 dan, Fengtai 2,800 dan, Yuda 4,100 dan, Zhenda 2,200 dan, Yichang 2,200 dan, and Runkang 8,800 dan. Dafu bought 1,200 dan, Hengyi 7,300 dan, Jinchang 9,100 dan, Hexing 1,300 dan, Taixing 2,700 dan, Taichang 1,900 dan, Xinchang 2,600 dan, and Changhe 2,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Spot Cotton Consumption Remains Sluggish

Mills are not buying spot cotton. Sources included 1,090 bales of Yao cotton.

Many Long Positions in American Cotton Unwind

Export Permits for Indian Cotton Haven't Been Received from Japan

Yesterday, the opening price of American cotton was sluggish, with each month falling by 1 to 5 points. The issue of sales through loans remained uncertain, labor unrest worsened, Japan regulated foreign exchange, and buyers of various important goods, due to the easing of the European situation, unwound their positions to take profits, causing market prices to fall. Local bulls also engaged in resales. Fortunately, counterparts continued to buy March contracts, slightly reducing the downward pressure, and the market stabilized. Later, the stock market weakened, and large-scale selling from Western and New Orleans emerged, causing the decline to resume. By the time of closing, counterparts bought near-term contracts, showing a slight rebound. Spot goods fell by 4 points, futures fell by 4 to 10 points. English cotton spot goods rose by 4 points, futures fell by 1 point. Indian cotton exporters were anxious as they had not received permits from Japan for a long time and engaged in slight selling, which later strengthened. Pingguoer rose by 0.25 to 1 rupee, while Guangzhou and Bai Luoxi both rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is on the left (telegram of the 19th).

According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening price prediction for the 20th was: Bai Luoxi 226.5 rupees, Aomula 203 rupees, and Pingguoer 170.5 rupees, all rising by 1 rupee.

Osaka Yarn Spot Up, Futures Down

According to a telegram from Osaka on the 20th, spot yarn rose by 6 to 11 yuan. 16-count Fan faced yarn was 253 yuan, up 6 yuan; 20-count Goldfish yarn was 272 yuan, up 6 yuan; 40-count Five Star yarn was 400 yuan, up 10 yuan; 42-count Pheasant yarn was 398 yuan, up 11 yuan. Futures yarn fell by 0.5 to 2.1 yuan, with near-term at 272.5 yuan and distant-term at 256.4 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.1 to rise by 0.7 yuan, with near-term at 74.9 yuan and distant-term at 78.1 yuan.

### Piece Goods

Diminishing Interest in Hoarding Cotton Cloth

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was affected by the sharp decline in the domestic yarn market, with spot yarn falling by 3.4 yuan and futures yarn falling by 2 yuan. Cloth merchants were generally apprehensive. Although the Eastern goods fine cloth market was slightly firm the previous day due to a squeeze, the market soon reversed as the Tianjin merchants leaned towards selling, and selling pressure caused prices to fall back. Fine cloth fell by 5 to 7.5 fen per bolt, and grey cloth fell by 5 fen. Dyeing factories and mainland merchants bought on dips, with over 300 bales changing hands. It is noted that the trading volume the previous day was 1,400 to 1,500 pieces, mainly driven by hoarding mentality. The current sharp decline is due to the decrease in speculative buying. The local factory and British merchant Jardine's coarse cloth saw flexible movements due to scarce inventory, and futures contracts remained high, so prices were also firm. The decline was most pronounced in fine twill. The market continued to fall by 5 to 7.5 fen yesterday. Currently, due to seasonal factors, the demand for fine twill has decreased significantly. The price of Eastern goods fine twill has fallen below that of fine cloth. Although there are reports of local factory fine twill movements, the quota restrictions are severe, and the inventory of various factories is gradually increasing, causing the market to weaken more rapidly than other goods. Spring/Summer goods like striped plain silk crepe, linen yarn, and white ground satin continue to see orders for both futures and spot goods. Dark-colored printed goods, pique, thread twill, and shandong trading houses, local streets, zhejiang roads, wenzhou and taizhou trading houses saw some transactions.

### Securities

Yesterday's government bond market trended from weak to upward, mainly because a certain large buyer continued to sell in large quantities, and morale was weary due to the prevailing environment.

### Overview of Tea Exports in the 25th Year

Both Black and Green Tea Increase Significantly, Brick Tea Exports Plunge

According to statistics released by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the total amount of Chinese tea exported from Shanghai in the 25th year (including Hankou tea re-exported through Shanghai) was 297,174.76 quintals. Although it was still far behind the 23rd year by more than 73,000 quintals, it increased by more than 6,800 quintals compared to the 24th year, indicating that the external export of Chinese tea has turned back to the path of recovery. However, the future still depends on the efforts of the tea industry.

Regarding the export situation of various types of tea, the exports of black tea, green tea, and other teas have all increased compared to the 24th year, especially the increase in green tea was the largest. It is noted that green tea exports to Africa were quite strong last year. Today, it is the only sales market for Chinese green tea, and its development is on the rise. However, it is said that the green tea of a certain country is eager to seize the market there, and recently used dumping policies to actively expand sales. This is very worthy of attention by our tea industry.

The export of brick tea has declined significantly. It is noted that brick tea is mostly transported to the Soviet Union. In recent years, the Soviet Union has also had large-scale tea business operations, gradually trending towards self-sufficiency. Chinese tea lost this major customer, which suffered a major impact. The monthly export volume for the 25th year and the comparison of the total number of recent three years, and the national statistics are listed below for reference by those who care about the tea (unit quintal).

### Luo Siwei

— Su Zihan

Determination is Strength

Luo Siwei never did things ambiguously in his life. Whatever he got his hands on, he knew how to handle it, and handled it correctly. Luo Siwei hadn't read many books, but he had plenty of experience.

Luo Siwei had a bit of land, but not much. It was a square, neat piece that was pleasing to the eye. This piece of land was truly not bad. It had convenient water access, and yielded harvests of rice, wheat, and vegetables. Luo Siwei had grown to this age relying on this piece of land.

In the past, this piece of land was surrounded by similar fields, inhabited by farmers like Luo Siwei. But in the past few years, things had gradually changed. Good farmland was turning into grassland, ball fields, and "foreign houses." The "foreign houses" were all inhabited by "foreigners" with high noses and green eyes, increasing in number every day. Later, they recruited many Chinese students and established universities, universities, and something called Canada University.

These fields were sold for a good price. For example, a field worth one hundred yuan per mu could be sold for at least one hundred and fifty, sometimes even two or three hundred. The "foreigners" had offered three hundred and fifty yuan per mu for Luo Siwei's land, but Luo Siwei didn't care about the money and refused to sell. No matter how powerful the "foreigners" were, how much they could oppress people, he would never sell, and there was nothing they could do about it.

Over the past ten years, the land surrounding Luo Siwei had all become "foreigners'." But Luo Siwei didn't care, and continued to cultivate his field and spread his manure. The stench drifted from the grassland, intruding into the foreign houses.

Luo Siwei's land was right in the heart of this special zone. It was surrounded by very beautiful "foreign houses" and grassland, with a few thatched houses in the middle, which certainly didn't look very nice. The "foreigners" wanted to take this piece of land day and night, but money couldn't move Luo Siwei's heart, so they could only watch Luo Siwei spread manure on his field.

The "foreigners" hated Luo Siwei immensely. Upon hearing what someone said, they built a clock tower not far from Luo Siwei's thatched house. This clock tower cost a lot of construction, just the bricks alone cost tens of thousands. Finally, a clock tower stood tall on "Love Pond." This special zone was a place with beautiful scenery in Chengdu. On good days in spring and autumn, and on weekends, many people went to stroll there, including many "lovers," and many hooligans and prostitutes. So many people called this pond "Love Pond."

When Luo Siwei saw how tall the clock tower was, he was quite surprised at first. After carefully measuring it, he realized that the clock tower was exactly to the left of his thatched house. Luo Siwei immediately joked with himself, muttering, "Left Green Dragon, Right White Tiger, the Green Dragon raises its head. Good, I'll have good luck and make a fortune every year! You foreign devils, you miscalculated."

Luo Siwei continued his life as usual, cultivating his field and spreading manure, without paying any attention to them.

Would the "foreigners" give up from then on? No way. So every few days, people came to Luo Siwei's house to make trouble, using both soft and hard tactics. Fortunately, Luo Siwei had plenty of experience, and had made up his mind: he wouldn't sell! Wild horses couldn't drag him, a white knife in and a red knife out, it was all the same! He was determined not to sell!

At first, Luo Siwei didn't want to sell this piece of land, just thinking that it had been passed down from his ancestors, and that he could make a living off of it, so why sell it and get a reputation as a spendthrift. Later, one year, the "foreigners" suddenly wanted to build a wall around the area, blocking the small paths and damming the waterways, and everyone opposed it. Students often came to "Huaxi Dam" to give speeches, saying: This school is a major base for foreigners to invade southwestern China. Now they want to build a wall to make this place a fortress, a stronghold, when there is trouble in Sichuan and Kang. We can't let them build it.

Luo Siwei suddenly understood after listening, and thought to himself, "No wonder they keep wanting to buy my land, it's because they want to connect it into one piece, to make it easier to do things. Fine, now I'm even less likely to sell it. If the foreign devils cause trouble, I'll be an inside man and mess with them."

Luo Siwei's refusal to sell his land was no longer just because it was his ancestors' legacy.

That time, the "foreigners'" wall was not built, and the ones that had already been built were pushed down by the people.

This day was a beautiful spring day. There were no clouds in the morning, and the sun shone directly on the top of the clock tower. Luo Siwei sat outside his thatched house, smoking his leaf tobacco pipe. People were already active by "Love Pond."

The wheat was growing vigorously, and the cabbage and greens were also thriving, with white mixed with green, and green mixed with white, like flowers all over the ground, very beautiful.

The crops were good, and Luo Siwei was indescribably happy.

Just then, a person came along the road, turned at the small path, and walked towards Luo Siwei's thatched house.

As he got closer, Luo Siwei saw the person clearly, and cursed in his heart, "It's that guy again." He unconsciously spat out a mouthful of saliva onto the ground.

The person who came was Yuan Hua, Teacher Yuan, who worked as a runner for the "foreigners."

Although Luo Siwei was unhappy with Yuan Hua, the visitor was a guest, and the host couldn't help but entertain him, so he had to stand up and greet him: "Teacher Yuan, how are you! Please sit down." As he spoke, he pushed a bamboo stool over.

Yuan Hua also said with a smile, "Siwei, how are you! Let's all sit down." Both men sat down. When Luo Siwei saw Yuan Hua's smiling face, he thought to himself, "He must be here again to talk about buying the land."

Sure enough, after three or five sentences of small talk, Yuan Hua brought up the topic of buying the land. He said: "Siwei, I advise you to sell it. Look! Everything around you is the church's, oh no, it's all the school's. What are you doing with this little bit of land? They've already offered five hundred silver dollars per mu. Sell it."

Luo Siwei said, "I won't sell!"

Yuan Hua continued: "Five hundred silver dollars per mu, that's a great price! You couldn't find that price anywhere else in the world. The Zhu family over there initially didn't want to sell, but now I hear that as long as the price is good, they're still selling. Once they sell, you'll be the only one left with land here, which will feel even worse. Brother Siwei, don't miss out on a good price!"

Luo Siwei said loudly: "I won't sell!"

Yuan Hua smiled. Luo Siwei didn't look at him. Yuan Hua took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, and offered Luo Siwei one. Luo Siwei pushed it away with his hand: "I don't smoke!" But Yuan Hua lit one for himself.

Yuan Hua smiled and said again: "Old brother, the price is good, it's good to sell it."

Luo Siwei couldn't hold back any longer, jumped up and said: "Teacher Yuan, you're too long-winded! I said I won't sell, then I won't sell. Go ask around, I, Luo Siwei, am well-known in this area of Nantaisi. Whatever I say, that's what I do. I'm not someone who's greedy for money!"

When Yuan Hua saw how angry Luo Siwei was, he didn't get angry at all, but instead resorted to threats: "What if they cut off your water supply!"

Luo Siwei said: "If they cut off my water supply, I'll go to the Dike Works Association. They wouldn't dare!"

Yuan Hua said again: "What if they ruin your crops?"

Luo Siwei said: "Then there's no law. If they let them loose, a white knife goes in, and a red knife comes out."

Yuan Hua laughed again! "Old brother, sell it, I'll talk to the school director and get you a job."

Luo Siwei said angrily: "Get lost!" After saying that, he went to get the manure bucket, preparing to water the vegetables. He ignored Yuan Hua. Yuan Hua, feeling unwelcome, had no choice but to sneak away.

When Luo Siwei was watering the vegetables, he saw a "foreigner" walking past, covering his nose with a handkerchief. He felt triumphant in his heart, and a layer of smile floated on his face.

Even now, the piece of land in the center of this special zone still belongs to Luo Siwei.

### How to Study Philosophy (7)

— Yan Yilin

Authored by Wang Defu, published by Sanjiang Bookstore

㊈ Outline of the History of Philosophical Development The history of philosophical development can be roughly divided into three periods: first, ancient Greek philosophy; second, the philosophy of the period of religious rule; and third, modern philosophy. Ancient Greek philosophy was initiated by Thales of the Milesian school; he was born in Miletus and lived in the sixth century BC, and is known as the father of philosophy. He took water as the basic principle of all things; Thales' view of nature is of great significance. As for Parmenides, the founder of the Eleatic school, he regarded the "being" of matter and spirit as the only substance of the world, which implicitly contained the theory of skeptical ideas; and Pythagoras advocated the theory of reincarnation, which was completely returning to religious superstition. The fundamental opposition between the cosmology of the Milesian school and the Eleatic school led to the creation of a comprehensive movement by Empedocles in the middle of the fifth century BC, and then to Anaxagoras, Leucippus, and Democritus. In Democritus' view, sensation is the only source of knowledge, and thinking is the reflection of the senses and the impressions we get from the outside world. He was one of the most systematic materialists in ancient Greece. After that, Greek philosophy developed a theory of doubting nature and a tendency to pay special attention to human affairs. At this time, Protagoras, a skeptic, rose up, doubting the reliability of the senses, and gradually approached idealism. Then came a system of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc.; their theory of the origin of the universe is that spirit precedes matter, and their epistemology and methodology also take abstract conceptual principles as the starting point. After that, in terms of materialism, there were Epicurus and Celsus; in terms of eclecticism, there was Zeno of the Stoic school; and in terms of skepticism, there was Pyrrho. This is a general overview of the development of ancient Greek philosophy. Second, the philosophy of the period of religious rule, this period began before the Christian era and lasted until the Renaissance, with the Neo-Platonic school and the Neo-Pythagorean school. Philosophy had become a handmaiden of theology before the fourth century AD, with Christian theology as the only doctrine, developing into patristic philosophy and scholastic philosophy, which dominated the entire Middle Ages for more than a thousand years. Second, the revival of modern philosophy was in the 13th century with Roger Bacon. Materialism, revived by Bacon, became more thorough with Hobbes. British materialism in the 17th century, with Spinoza and Locke, solved the problem of knowledge in great detail and fully. In France in the 16th and 17th centuries, Descartes' philosophy emerged. He advocated the theory that spirit and matter became opposite to each other, which was completely the true color of dualism. The successors in the 18th and 19th centuries were the famous Berkeley, Hume, and Leibniz, who were champions of idealism in England and Germany. In 1724, Kant was born. He synthesized Plato's and Descartes' theory of innate ideas, synthesized Hobbes' and Locke's theory of sensation and empiricism, and also synthesized Berkeley's and Hume's pure sensationalism, pure empiricism, and the skepticism of the unknowability of things. He also took Leibniz's philosophy of acknowledging entities as the starting point, and also had naturalism. From Kant to Fichte, Schelling, and Mach, this was another debate between idealism and materialism. The last was Hegel, the greatest of the idealists, but his main influence was in the field of materialism. After Feuerbach, Marx, Engels, Lafargue, Kautsky, Plekhanov, Lenin, etc. were the most important materialist philosophers. This is a brief overview of the development of modern philosophy.

### Yuan Yingchang's The Peacock Flies Southeast and Others (3)

2. Other One-Act Plays

There are too many and too long monologues in this play, and the power of expression is weak in the key places of the plot.

(4)

The pauses in the play are to create an atmosphere of gradual tension. Although the play contains the meaning of expressing life, the trivialities of ordinary life are also inserted into the play, which is very undesirable.

In the first act, when the grandmother comes to the Jiao family, there is a conversation:

"Sister-in-law, I'll ask someone to bring tea for grandmother to drink, okay?

Mother: Good, you go. Also bring some oranges and chestnuts for grandmother to drink with the tea.

Grandmother: Don't bother! Let's talk.

Sister: It's no trouble!

Second act

"Sister: Then I'll trouble grandmother! (At this time, the maid brings in tea and fruit. To the maid) Has the mistress come in?

Maid: Just came in. Washing her face in the room.

Sister: Go and invite her, say grandmother has come to see her (the maid nods and goes out, the little sister serves tea and fruit to the grandmother) Grandmother, please have some!"

This technique may be used by the author as a pause in the atmosphere, but, strictly speaking, the most common thing to do in a play performed on stage is to repeat the interlude. At the same time, this kind of interlude is not the best way to cultivate the atmosphere.

Regarding the overall opinion, there are basically these four points, which have already exceeded what was planned to be said.

In short, the playwright's ambition to write is admirable, especially to recreate existing buildings with new perspectives. This attempt is rare, although there are many shortcomings in technique. However, we cannot ignore that this is an achievement from five or six years ago. Compared with the progressive modern plays, it is naturally inevitable that the form and method are backward, but it has its value in the history of modern drama.

A. Synopsis of Each Play

In addition to The Peacock Flies Southeast, there are five other one-act plays, namely Living Poet, Who is the Scourge, Frontline Soldier, A Kiss Before Marriage, and The Way of Man.

Living Poet, Who is the Scourge, and A Kiss Before Marriage are all comedies, and also contain satirical comedies. Frontline Soldier is a patriotic play, and The Way of Man is a tragedy about marriage problems.

Living Poet writes about a girl who has three love interests. In order to make the final decision, she asks the three young men to each write a poem at a Ronghui meeting. The one with the best poetic talent will be engaged to her. When writing the poem, one of the young men narrates a white cat being bitten by a yellow dog. The judges immediately conclude that this young man is a living poet. Because: A poet must have the personality of a poet, and a poet must have the emotions of a poet. Without genuine feelings and a noble and perfect personality... one cannot become a true poet, a living poet! Mr. Wang disregarded his own life today and rescued the weak and incompetent kitten from the mouth of an inferior dog. At the time of his personal victory or defeat, he was able to take care of the life of a small creature. In my opinion, this is not only a poet, but also a real living poet." This passage can be said to be the main theme of writing this play.

Who is the Scourge writes about a married woman who falls in love with her husband's friend. When she is about to divorce, she finds that the person she loves is jealous, disappointed, and returns to her original husband.

A Kiss Before Marriage is purely a comedy close to nonsense, because the story is definitely not something that exists in reality. However, on the whole, it does not fail to sing the praises of love.

Frontline Soldier writes about Zhang Zongchang, a warlord in the Republic of China, who does not join the revolutionary army. A small soldier on the Zunming army side has his family seized by Zhang's subordinates, threatening the small soldier to assist in the rebellion. The small soldier is not tempted by profit and would rather sacrifice the lives of his whole family to capture and present the traitor to military law. The main theme is that the comrades who participated in the revolution have firm beliefs and finally achieve spiritual victory.

The Way of Man is a common problem of marriage, family, and love that are intertwined. In other words, it is the problem of the confrontation between love and obligation. It writes about a student who abandons his original wife after returning to China and marries another student, forming a love family. He does not bear the responsibility of being a husband or a father, but only seeks personal happiness in life. In the end, his conscience suddenly breaks out, but his beloved son dies of illness and his wife commits suicide. It is all too late.

B. The Content of the Play and the Significance of the Times

Looking at the plays as a whole, whether they are tragedies or comedies, their purpose of satirizing the world and awakening people is consistent. In the society of six or seven years ago, after the May Fourth Movement, the communication between Chinese and Western cultures was at its peak. At this time, the theory of free love was also advocated. For a time, things like Who is the Scourge and The Way of Man were indeed not fabricated. Of course, those who were able to awaken and struggle out were comedies, otherwise they would lead to tragedies such as death, displacement, and madness.

The social dynamics in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China were like this, and the reflection in literary works was inseparable from this stereotype. These few one-act plays by Yuan Changying were no exception.

At the same time, while one side showed the ugly side, the other side was also praying for perfect and happy love and marriage. Living Poet and A Kiss Before Marriage cannot hide these messages.

After the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, the international situation was not as pressing as it is today. Eliminating warlords and building politics were the people's hope and the authorities' ideal. This hope and this ideal were not without the hope of being realized. Frontline Soldier can indeed represent the beliefs of the majority of soldiers and civilians at that time, and the realization of spiritual victory. The author has grasped this proposition.

### Income Tax Research Conference Began Yesterday Afternoon

188 Representatives Attended, Discussion Scheduled to Continue This Afternoon

The Income Tax Practical Problems Research Conference convened by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce opened at 2:00 PM yesterday. Members of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, including Weng Zhizhu, Director of the Shanghai Office of Income Tax Liang Hejun, Accountant Xu Yongzuo, representatives from various local Chambers of Commerce, and guild representatives, totaling 188 individuals, attended. Details are as follows:

Conference Proceedings

The meeting was called to order at 2:00 PM. First, Yan E-sheng, Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, reported that a total of 195 representatives had registered for the Research Conference. These representatives included those from the Chambers of Commerce of Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Wuxian, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Changshu, Qingpu, Kunshan, Shaoxing, Wujin, Jiaxing, Shanghai, and other twelve Chambers of Commerce, the Nanjing Commercial Tax Regulations Research Association, the Wusong and Nanshi sub-offices affiliated with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, 107 guilds, and five store members, totaling 127 units. It was then requested to nominate five individuals for the Research Conference Presidium. Qian Sunqing, Wang Jiean, Gu Sumin, Shi Chunshan, and a representative from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce were nominated to form the Presidium. The opening ceremony was then officially held, and after the ceremony, the Chairman delivered the opening address, followed by addresses from Liang Hejun and Weng Zhizhu, and then an address from Accountant Xu.

Chairman's Address

Jin Runxiang, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative in the Presidium, delivered the opening address, stating, "Today is the day of the opening ceremony of the Income Tax Research Conference. I would like to briefly explain the origins of the Chamber's initiative to establish this Research Conference. As the world evolves, all matters become increasingly complex and specialized, and so does the tax system. Merchants engaged in commerce are not inherently familiar with national tax laws, and even minor errors or omissions in procedures may result in penalties. Therefore, the payment of customs duties is typically entrusted to customs brokers, who are experienced and proficient. While entrusting agents may incur some expenses, the procedures are significantly simplified. However, customs duties are indirect taxes, and thus the method of entrusting customs brokers for payment can be applied. As for direct taxes such as business tax, because they are based on the amount of business income, the amount of tax payable is related to the business secrets of a store, and it is no longer possible to entrust others to handle it. Therefore, today, every word and sentence of the tax law should be regarded by merchants as matters closely related to their business, and they must not be as indifferent as before. I still remember that before the implementation of the current Stamp Tax Law on September 1, 1935, the Chamber, because its regulations were different from before, was deeply concerned that merchants would not be able to fully understand it, and had convened a meeting of various industries to study it before the deadline. Now, two years have passed, and there are still many merchants who have not conducted a widespread and in-depth study, and even have not read the tax law provisions. Whenever they need to know how much a certain draft should be stamped, they temporarily inquire by telephone to the Chamber, or even guess blindly, resulting in investigations, detentions, and penalties that inevitably occur from time to time. All of these can be avoided, but merchants themselves delay and make mistakes. Although the stamp tax is a relatively trivial direct tax, it has a history of more than twenty years since its implementation in the early years of the Republic of China. Merchants should have developed the habit of paying taxes, and the provisions are relatively simple and do not have profound meanings. Even when it is applied, they are still at a loss, not to mention the income tax, which is a recent event. Merchants are not familiar with the tax payment procedures, and the matter involves cost accounting, which is almost twice as complicated as the stamp tax, which is based on the amount of the tax. Therefore, in view of the past, the Chamber intends to prepare merchants in advance, so there is the opening of the "Income Tax Research Conference." Also, because the Chamber has the task of leading merchants to jointly study the advantages and disadvantages of the tax system, the scope of those who come to the conference to study is not limited to representatives of various industries in the city. All Chambers of Commerce on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are welcome to send representatives to participate. Fortunately, all parties recognize that the implementation of the income tax is of utmost importance to the business community, and those who send personnel to participate in the research are very enthusiastic, which is a testament to the vigorous efforts of our business community. The Chamber is very fortunate in this regard, and Accountant Xu Yongzuo is willing to sacrifice his valuable business time to preside over the conference and study matters every day, which is especially enthusiastic for public welfare and commendable. The Chamber and the listeners express their deep gratitude to him. In addition, the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance, as the head of the tax collection, also came to the conference today to provide sincere guidance, which is especially the compass for today's researchers. The Chamber and the listeners can all obtain many valuable insights and should express their honor and gratitude."

Liang's Address

㊀ Liang Hejun, Director of the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance, stated, "Distinguished representatives, I am deeply honored to be able to participate in this research conference today with the leaders of Chambers of Commerce from various places. All the taxes in our country in the past were indirect taxes, and the income tax is a direct tax. Why does our country want to implement the direct tax of income tax? Simply put, it can be said that from the perspective of the country, the income tax is a national crisis tax. Although the term "national crisis tax" does not exist in the financial science of various countries, in 1798, when Britain and France were at war, Britain began to implement the income tax. The United States also created and implemented it during the Civil War for wartime finance. In addition, Germany, France, and Russia all implemented it during wartime. We all know what a serious situation our country is currently in. We also know that the largest source of revenue for our government is the salt tax and customs duties. However, in times of national crisis, people will not increase their consumption of salt, and the salt tax will certainly not increase. As for customs duties, it is painful to say that in peacetime, for every extra point of customs duties collected, we shed an extra point of blood and sweat. Therefore, the increase in customs duties is not rationalized. Moreover, when a national crisis occurs, whether there will be difficulties in transportation and whether foreign goods can come as smoothly as in peacetime are all problems. Then, customs duties are certainly more unreliable in times of national crisis, let alone an increase in revenue. Everyone can understand the seriousness and dangerousness of the environment our country is currently in. In this autumn of crisis, the significance of the country's implementation of the income tax is not difficult to understand. Therefore, in times of crisis, the income tax is the largest source of tax revenue for the government. After the crisis passes, it is also the only good tax system, because the first is that the method of taxation is absolutely fair and equal. In fact, we pay more tax for more income. In theory, it can also cultivate the concept of patriotism among the people. In the past, the government had plans to implement the income tax for a long time, but because of property registration, population statistics, etc., there were too many things to do, and it could not be implemented for a while. Now, the environment is becoming more and more dangerous, so this good tax that can cope with the dangerous environment has to be resolutely implemented. The country is our country, and it is our responsibility to serve the country. Paying a share of taxes to the country is fulfilling the obligation of the people. Supporting the income tax is supporting the country. However, it is not easy to promote it if we do not understand the content of the tax system. Therefore, starting today, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is presiding over the meeting here. I dare say that the results of the research will have a great impact on our country. I hope that all the representatives present will conduct in-depth research and give us as much guidance as possible." ㊁ Weng Zhizhu, a member of the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance, stated, "Regarding the significance of the income tax, Director Liang has already explained it in detail just now, so I will not repeat it. However, I have a few reports. When the financial conference was held in 1934, I felt that there was no way out of the entire financial problem in China. Subsequently, the conference decided on three steps: 1. Abolish miscellaneous taxes and levies, 2. Determine local budgets, 3. Consolidate old taxes, 4. Promote good taxes. At that time, I deeply believed that in order to improve the national economy and put finance on track, it would not be possible to achieve anything without following this approach. It has been two years and six months since then, and although there has been no significant effect, there has also been a considerable amount of progress. It is estimated that the result of abolishing miscellaneous taxes and levies is about 55 million yuan. The budgets of various places, except for the three northeastern provinces, Xinjiang, and other places that are in fact difficult, have been completed in more than 1,300 counties. Now, we should handle the work of promoting the good tax of income tax. The income tax is a tax that is generally practiced in various countries. In the beginning, it is always felt to be difficult. The national education of our country is relatively shallow, the statistics of various industries are still incomplete, and the accounting systems are different. Difficulties are inevitable. Fortunately, the government is striving to standardize and rationalize the tax laws and collection procedures. On the one hand, the people hope to abolish miscellaneous taxes and levies, and on the other hand, they should do their best to support and promote the good tax of income tax. Although the income tax law in our country is not the best law in modern countries, I firmly believe that after a considerable process, there will be considerable progress. This depends on the joint discussion and contribution of opinions from various industries, and the government is happy to accept them."

Research Steps

After Director Liang finished his address, Accountant Xu Yongzuo reported on the Chamber's initiation process and the subsequent research steps. It was decided to divide it into four days: the first day to study income from profitable businesses, the second day to study income from salaries and remuneration, the third day to study income from securities deposits, and the fourth day to study the relationship between income tax and accounting. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce and Accountant Xu presented ten lectures on income tax and accounting, as well as a copy of the provisional regulations and implementation rules on the spot. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM and announced that it would continue at 2:00 PM on the 21st.

### Bankers Association Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday

Discussed Income Tax Payment in Detail, Requested Amendment of Unworkable Points

The Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Bankers Association held an executive committee meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to discuss the income tax payment issues raised by the subcommittee. The details are as follows:

Subcommittee Listened to Report

The matter of the banking industry paying income tax on deposit interest has been discussed several times in the past, and there are basically no problems. However, for the sake of prudence, the collection procedure needs to be studied in detail. After several consultations by the income tax subcommittee, it has been decided to send Cai Chengxin of the Bank of China and Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association, to the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance to meet with Director Liang Hejun to discuss the procedures for collecting income tax on banking cases (only the banking industry, the previous report that it was the banking and money industry was a misrepresentation). At the same time, in order to be simple and complete, a new form will be formulated and handled. On the 19th (the day before yesterday) at 5:00 PM, the industry subcommittee specially convened a meeting to listen to the reports of Lin and Cai. More than ten representatives from fifteen banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, attended. After discussion, it was decided to submit the discussion points to the Executive Committee for handling.

Four Important Points Handled Separately

The Executive Committee meeting was held at the Association's office at 5:00 PM yesterday. All fifteen Executive Committee members attended. Chairman Chen Guangfu first asked Lin Kanghou to report, and then discussed the various points raised by the subcommittee on the collection of income tax, and discussed them in detail. The main points were summarized as follows: ㊀ For points that are no longer problematic, such as interest on government bonds, they should be paid in accordance with the regulations and notified for handling. ㊁ For points that are still in doubt, the Executive Committee should submit them to the Legislative Yuan for interpretation. ㊂ For points that cannot be handled, the Executive Committee should submit them to the Legislative Yuan for amendment. ㊃ Points that are not subject to tax, such as deposits between banks, can be exempt from tax. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

### American Officials and侨 in Shanghai Celebrated Roosevelt's Re-election Yesterday

US President Roosevelt was re-elected. The inauguration ceremony was held yesterday afternoon (Shanghai time was 1:00 AM this morning). In addition to the US Consulate and the Detective Office taking a day off, flags were flown to celebrate. The American Association and the American Chamber of Commerce jointly organized American officials and citizens in Shanghai to hold a grand banquet at the American Association on Fuzhou Road at 11:30 PM last night to celebrate. More than 500 people, including US Consul General Gauss, Detective Hill Meek, and Commander of the US Marine Corps in Shanghai, Paras, attended. During the banquet, Roosevelt's inaugural address was listened to live on the radio, and the celebration continued all night, adjourning at about 1:00 AM this morning.

### He Rang Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Sino-Siamese Trade

Fire Rice Mills Decline, Need for Improvement in Chinese Goods Sold to Siam

He Rang, Secretary to our Commercial Commissioner stationed in Siam and concurrently Committee Member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, recently came to Shanghai from Siam to inspect the latest situation of domestic commerce. Yesterday afternoon, he also visited various domestic goods factories in the city to work on improving communication between domestic goods and Siam. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency paid a special visit to He at his hotel yesterday to inquire about the latest situation of Sino-Siamese trade. According to him, Sino-Siamese relations have always been friendly. After our country's delegation to Siam for inspection, the relationship has become even closer. There are a large number of Chinese people living in Siam, more than 2.5 million, with a long history, and most of them are engaged in commerce. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the universal economic downturn around the world, there has been no significant development. Siam is a rice-producing country in the world. Many overseas Chinese in Siam are engaged in the rice industry, namely the so-called "fire rice mills." There are more than 60 of them in Bangkok, the capital of Siam, and often hundreds of smaller fire rice mills scattered in the countryside. Only one is run by foreigners. However, due to the increase in the number of fire rice mills in the countryside last year, the grain produced was not enough for work. In addition, the import tax on foreign rice from Guangdong Province increased, and the sale of Siamese rice to China not only became unprofitable but also incurred losses. Therefore, the transaction was minimal. In the past, 45% of it was shipped to Guangdong via Hong Kong. As a result, the specialized fire rice mills run by overseas Chinese have declined. The second special product of Siam is teak wood. Last year, the business was very good. There should be no problem with the sale of domestic goods to Siam, as there are many overseas Chinese in Siam who are happy to use domestic goods. During my return to China this time, I visited domestic goods companies yesterday and was very pleased to see the progress of the products from various factories. Furthermore, when the Nanyang Inspection Group went to Siam for inspection last year, a grand exhibition was held, and domestically produced products had a good impression on overseas Chinese. Therefore, the future of domestic goods is bright. However, what must be noted is to find ways to reduce costs and make the goods more refined, so as to compete with Japanese goods. Although Siamese business has developed recently, it is still in the minority. Japanese businesses in Siam are working very hard and are very accommodating in their business, such as paying the price of goods in one month, and using their low prices as a selling point. Although most of the consumers are also overseas Chinese, their encroachment on the market is worth noting. In the future development of Sino-Siamese trade, the development of transportation is also an important measure. There are currently no direct shipping lines between China and Siam, and the convenience of cargo transportation is not as good as that of Japan. In order to develop the domestic goods business, overseas Chinese in Siam have organized the Siamese Chinese Domestic Goods Company, and a preparatory committee has been established and is actively underway. Mr. He will stay in Shanghai for another day or two before returning to Siam.

### Five German Medical Experts Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon

Serving as Professors at Tongji University and Physicians at Municipal Hospitals

According to the Continental Press, Dr. Weng Zhilong, President of Tongji University, stated yesterday that five German medical experts will arrive in Shanghai soon to serve as professors at Tongji University and physicians at the new Shanghai Municipal Hospital. The surnames of these five people have not yet been announced. Their travel expenses and salaries are borne by the German government. They include experts in surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, pathology, and dermatology, all of whom are well-known in the German medical community. It is understood that Tongji University recently reached an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau that the hospital will be run by the university, so that medical students in the university have the opportunity to experiment. Therefore, President Weng consulted with Mr. Kriebel, the German Consul-General in Shanghai, and the German government provided these five medical experts. As for the hospital building, it has been completed for several months. It is now planned to officially open in March of this year. It could have been earlier, but due to the strike in the American shipping industry, the ordered equipment could not be transported for a while, so it had to be postponed slightly. However, the outpatient department of the hospital has already opened, and about 60 people are treated every day.

### Wang Chonghui Stays in Shanghai to Treat Nasal Disease

Will Take Office in Beijing Immediately Upon Receiving Orders from the Government

According to the Central News Agency, Wang Chonghui, the newly appointed member of the National Government, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago to continue treating his nasal disease. There is no definite date for when he will go to Beijing to take office. According to Wang, he is staying in Shanghai to seek medical treatment and wash his nose because his nasal disease has not yet been cured. The appointment of the National Government member has not yet arrived. He has decided to go to Beijing to take office after receiving the order.

### Cheng Tianguo Went to Beijing Yesterday Morning

### Chinese Cultural Construction Association Sends Telegram Urging Punishment of Rebels, Suppression of Bandits, and Resistance Against the Enemy

Telegrams from All Circles Are Also Recorded

According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese Cultural Construction Association sent a telegram yesterday, which stated: "The Central News Agency forwards to all newspapers, schools, and organizations across the country: The most urgent task for the country at present is unity. Only unity can resist foreign enemies, and only unity can plan construction. This is not only the case for our country today, but also the path that must be taken for the revival of nations in ancient and modern China and abroad. Therefore, today, anyone who plots secession and undermines unity, regardless of their reasons, is a public enemy of the nation. Zhang Xueliang, the chief culprit of the Shaanxi Incident, has committed countless crimes that harm the country. The people of the country have long found it difficult to forgive him lightly. Our Central Government has been broad-minded and hoped that he would reform himself. Over the past ten years, we have been accommodating and trusting him, and hoping that he would serve the country. This is obvious to everyone. Even after the Xi'an rebellion, we still thought of politely sending the leader back to Beijing, reducing the sentence and pardoning him. We have been benevolent and righteous to the utmost, and there is no further criticism. However, for more than ten days, the troops have been resisting in corners, and the villains have been disobeying orders. The atmosphere of disobedience has filled the Northwest. Who is responsible for this and caused this? The Northwest is a base for national defense. Our Central Government has been doing its best to build it in the past three or four years, developing transportation and managing industries. The initial foundation has fortunately been roughly laid, but it has been ruined by this upheaval. The fundamental foundation has been completely destroyed. Now, if we want to restore the old appearance, we don't know how many more days and how much more energy it will take. Zhang Xueliang, as a person who is heavily responsible for suppressing bandits, has actually made the absurd move of colluding with and surrendering to bandits. He verbally advocates resisting Japan, but in reality, he is destroying the foundation of national defense against the enemy. Ordinary people only know that his kidnapping of the commander-in-chief is the greatest crime, but they don't know that colluding with bandits to plot secession, surrendering to bandits to destroy construction, undermining unity, and destroying national defense are directly criminals of the anti-enemy movement and moths of national salvation work. If this can be forgiven, what cannot be forgiven? If this can be pardoned, what cannot be pardoned? The failure of the country is due to the evil of officials. The ancient teachings are clear and should be taken as a lesson. If we still give preferential treatment to such evil officials, it means that we value private feelings, distance ourselves from public opinion, worry about mutinous soldiers and rebellious generals, and despise laws and disciplines. If we follow this line of reasoning, what generals will not be afraid to rebel and what soldiers will not be afraid to mutiny? In addition, the red atmosphere in the Northwest is gradually spreading, the people are displaced, and industries are declining. If we do not plan to sit and wait for it to spread, I am afraid that in the future, we will not only have no soldiers to use, but also no food to raise. This association believes that the right way to save the country today is nothing more than three things: Punish rebels to clarify discipline, suppress red bandits to stabilize people's livelihood, and strengthen national power to resist foreign enemies. If the national policy is highly suspended and resolutely implemented, unifying to resist insults will be achieved in no time. If we are still indecisive and hesitant, then before the discussions are settled, the red bandits will cross the Tongguan and move east, and the pseudo-bandits will definitely invade the Sui border. May I ask you gentlemen who are in power, how will you talk about suppression and how will you talk about resistance? North of the Yellow River, will it not be sent to be the second Spain? What will the future generations say? The members of this association look at the difficult times and are extremely angry and in pain, unaware that their words are so urgent. You gentlemen have high aspirations and broad vision and must have true knowledge and insights. We hope that you will generously express your opinions and hope to move the Central Government's hearing. In this critical moment, we look forward to it very much and pray very much. The Chinese Cultural Construction Association and its branches in various provinces and cities jointly kowtow. The New Sound News Agency stated: The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation jointly sent a telegram to the Central Government yesterday, which stated: The Central Party Department of Nanjing, the National Government, and the Military Commission, please note: Last year's Xi'an Incident caused national grief and anger. The chief culprit should be punished according to the law to strengthen discipline and thank the people of the country. However, the government's order stated that because he escorted the chairman safely back to Beijing, he was given preferential treatment and ordered to make up for his crimes and cover up his past mistakes. The Central Government was broad-minded, benevolent, and gracious, hoping to preserve national strength and cultivate people's livelihood. However, Yang Hucheng and others not only did not know how to be grateful and repay kindness, but instead resisted orders, claimed troops, colluded with bandits, and made trouble, causing the red flames that were about to be extinguished to spread again, and the disaster victims after the robbery were heavily wounded. Harming the people and the country, the world is heartbroken. We humbly ask the Central Government to launch a large-scale crusade, severely suppress and eliminate them, so as to curb the chaos and boost the country's prestige. We cannot help but wait for orders with great urgency. The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation jointly kowtow. The Municipal Security Public Team Party Affairs Guidance Committee sent a telegram to the Central Government yesterday, which stated: The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, please note: The Xi'an Incident caused national anger and hatred. Zhang Xueliang was the real culprit. Our Central Government was broad-minded and made peaceful decisions, repeatedly giving preferential treatment to give the barbarians a way to reform themselves. Unexpectedly, the jackal's nature has become habitual, and they have not repented. Not only did they not know how to be grateful and repay the country, but they also asked Zhang to fabricate secrets and order his subordinates to occupy the territory and make trouble. Yang colluded with bandits and communists and resisted the troops, causing the initial form of unification to be frustrated. The fathers and elders in Guanzhong suffered from the red flames. If they are treated with tolerance, it will only cause the disease of paralysis. Therefore, we telegram and ask the meeting to make a decisive decision, quickly bring Zhang to justice to maintain national law, and quickly suppress Yang and other troops to quell the source of chaos. We are in a state of panic and anxiety. The Party Affairs Guidance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Security Public Team of the Chinese Kuomintang kowtows, 哿印.

### The Strike Wave in the National Pharmaceutical Industry in the French Concession is Becoming Increasingly Serious Yesterday

The Attitude of the French Municipal Council is Extremely Tough; More Than 100 Trade Associations Declare Resistance; The Municipal Government Has Sent Personnel to Negotiate with the French Consulate

According to the New Sound News Agency, the strike wave in the national pharmaceutical industry in the French Concession is becoming increasingly serious due to the French Municipal Council's lack of concession. In addition to declaring assistance, 160 trade associations in the city, including the salted fish industry, have also petitioned the authorities to conduct negotiations quickly. It is reported that the municipal government has sent Secretary Geng Jiaji to conduct negotiations with the French Consul General. The Pharmaceutical Industry Association is deeply afraid that someone will take the opportunity to sabotage during the strike period, and has formed a maintenance team to maintain order. The details are as follows:

The Continued Strike is Becoming Serious

The national pharmacies in the French Concession, such as Darenhang, Guangshengtang, and Taishantang, have not yet had their water and electricity restored, so they are still on strike. Yesterday, the French Municipal Council also sent personnel accompanied by detectives to various pharmacies to prevent the posting of strike notices, and stated that strikes to resist donations would affect public security and would be arrested by the police. The person in charge of the Municipal Council also declared to the outside world that the drug tax was approved by the Board of Directors and had been notified for collection long ago, and there was no possibility of cancellation. As for the move to cut off water and electricity, it was out of necessity because the pharmacies in the concession were on strike to resist donations. If the pharmacies in the concession can abide by the regulations, they can be restored at any time. There is no indication of concession, which is why the situation is becoming more and more serious.

The Municipal Government Sends Personnel to Negotiate

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency went to the Social Affairs Bureau to interview Wu Hengru, the head of the Second Section of the Bureau. According to him, regarding the French Municipal Council's collection of drug taxes and cutting off the water and electricity of national pharmacies such as Guangshengtang, the Bureau immediately forwarded it to the Municipal Government after receiving the report from the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association and conducted negotiations with the French Municipal Council. It has also been heard that the Municipal Government has sent Secretary Geng Jiaji to conduct negotiations with the French Consulate.

The Second Special District Jointly Requests the Withdrawal of the New Donation

The Citizens' Union of the Second Special District also held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to promote the resolution of this case. Tao Ran and Cen Zhiliang from the Pharmaceutical Industry Association were sent to attend and report. At the same time, representatives from the salted fish, pepper, clothing, fresh pork, and other industry associations also attended the meeting and demanded strict negotiations. It was decided to send a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting the cancellation of the initial donation and the prompt restoration of water and electricity for those that have been cut off, and that no more power outages be used in the future to avoid accidents.

The Pharmaceutical Industry Association Forms a Maintenance Team

The Pharmaceutical Industry Association is deeply afraid that unscrupulous elements may take the opportunity to cause trouble during the strike period, which may affect order. It has specially selected twelve cadres to form a maintenance team, which is divided into six districts, with two people in each district. Starting today, they will go to various striking pharmacies to serve as comfort and discipline inspectors. The association has also scheduled to hold the 17th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at 2:00 pm tomorrow to discuss prudent coping measures.

Various Trade Associations Require Three Items

More than 160 trade associations in the city, including the salted fish industry, flower and tree industry, Qinglan cloth dyeing industry, clothing industry, fresh pork selling industry, leather making industry, construction industry, Fuyang printing and bleaching industry, shoe industry, hoe industry, homespun cloth industry, gray cloth dyeing industry, rayon industry, noodle restaurant industry, south goods industry, bamboo industry, fresh pork processing industry, candle industry, thermos bottle industry, tanned leather processing industry, fresh medicine industry, matte yarn dyeing industry, tofu industry, cotton ginning industry, barber industry, and kitchen industry, jointly submitted a letter to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to assist the national pharmaceutical industry and requested that serious negotiations be conducted with the French Municipal Council as soon as possible, requesting: ㊀ Restore water and electricity unconditionally on the same day, ㊁ Retain the right to claim compensation for strike losses, ㊂ Guarantee that the same situation will not occur again in the entire district in the future, so as to maintain commerce and calm public anger.

Issue a Declaration of Unanimous Assistance

More than 160 trade associations, including the salted fish industry, also issued a declaration to provide unanimous assistance. The original text reads: The French Municipal Council often uses cutting off water and electricity as a tool to coerce shops to achieve its extraction. This association, etc., has repeatedly received petitions from members in the district requesting relief, and has long been preparing to protest seriously to seek relief from this pain. However, due to the bleak market conditions and the sorrow of the people, if the protest is ineffective, it will inevitably be followed by practical actions. We are sincerely afraid that it will be difficult to recover once it is launched and will heavily burden our critically ill commerce. Today, the national pharmacies in the district, due to opposition to the arbitrary donations imposed by France and the oppression of power outages, are motivated by righteous indignation and endure the greatest pain and implement a full strike. This association, etc., based on the righteous position, expresses its most sincere sympathy. If the French Municipal Council can carefully weigh the gains and losses and clearly understand the difficulties of commerce, and restore the cut-off electricity and fire on the same day, it will be a great fortune for both parties. If it is necessary to adhere to one end and drive it to the end, this association, etc., should follow the request of the members in the district and stand up as a backing. Without achieving the goal, we will fight to the end. This is hereby declared.

Notice from the French Concession Authorities

Yesterday, the Tianfa Police Station sent a notice asking for publication. Here is a verbatim copy: Notice from the French Concession Authorities to National Pharmacists: National pharmacists in the French Concession have recently been instigating a wave of opposition to the authorities' collection of illegal taxes, and have been issuing reports and printing declarations in various ways. It has been found that the newspapers and declarations contain many destructive and inflammatory properties, and the absurdity of the content is self-defeating. ㊀ The pharmacist's license is a completely legal license that has been formally adopted by the Municipal Council in 1936 and 1937. ㊁ The tax rate for this license is extremely low, ranging from 10 yuan to 25 yuan per year (so only 8.3 yuan to 2.8 yuan per month), far less than that paid by foreign pharmacists (from 23 yuan to 48 yuan). ㊂ Regarding the suspension of electricity, the taxes levied by the concession authorities on residents are originally commensurate with the benefits of the public facilities they receive. If a portion of the residents bear the cost of all public facilities and allow the remaining residents to be exempted from obligations and violate the responsibilities they tacitly assume to the administrative authorities, how can it be allowed? ㊃ The French Municipal Council has extremely demonstrated its gentle attitude and has agreed to reduce the first year's (1936) license donation by 50%. Since it cannot go any further, as for the wave instigated by a small number of people, the French Concession authorities cannot tolerate it and will punish it in accordance with the law and maintain public order. It is the responsibility of the police station to take all measures to maintain it, so that the freedom of work can be guaranteed.

### Long-Distance Telephone Service Between Shanghai and Jiujiang and Nanchang is Open

Long-distance telephone service to nine provinces and ten cities is about to be completed.

### Patrick Returns to Shanghai

Mr. Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credit Guarantee Bureau, returned to Shanghai on the 18th due to the urgent matters of the important officials in Shanghai and officially began his work. In recent days, he has met with British business leaders to consult on the industrial, commercial and financial situation in Shanghai. According to his assistant, Mr. O'Lae, Mr. Patrick has not yet decided on his itinerary to visit various places. It was originally planned to go north first, but since Ambassador Xing Xuchen has already met in Beijing, the trip to Tianjin can be postponed.

### A Veteran Writer From Japan, Shimazaki, Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon on His Way Back Home

Yamamoto Sanemitsu Accompanied the Ship

Shimazaki Toson, a veteran writer representing Japan at the World PEN Congress, passed through Shanghai at 6:00 yesterday morning with his wife, Shizuko, on the Japanese post office ship "Haruna Maru" on his way back home. Yamamoto Sanemitsu, president of the Japanese Reconstruction Society, who was staying in Shanghai, went to the ship to welcome him and invited Shimazaki to land and visit the city center. He only stayed in Shanghai for a few hours and then returned to the country on the original ship at 1:00 pm. Mr. Yamamoto also returned to Japan on the ship. It is reported that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi originally planned to invite Mr. Shimazaki for a talk, but due to time constraints, Mr. Shimazaki was unable to stay in Shanghai to pay his respects, and has asked someone to politely decline to Mr. Kong on his behalf.

### Self-Employed Income Tax is Calculated and Taxed Every Six Months

Approved by the Income Tax Office

Shen Liren, a chartered accountant at the Shanghai Chinese Accountants' Office, recently represented his self-employed clients. According to the provisions of Article 7 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, "Those whose income is irregular or temporary shall calculate and tax the amount of income for each month," and Article 26, Paragraph 2 of the Implementing Rules, "Second-class income shall be paid monthly," it seems not very fair. He specially submitted a document to the Shanghai Income Tax Office requesting to change the calculation of taxes based on the total income for one year, and to pay every six months or one year. He has now received a reply stating that from January 1 of this year, the total settlement will be made every six months, and the average amount of income for each month will be taxed.

### China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau Ordered to Close Completely

Zhang Yi Once Served as General Manager, The Statement of Temporarily Maintaining the Status Quo is Incorrect

The China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau was previously ordered by the National-owned China Merchants Bureau to be completely closed and suspended by the end of 1936 in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Communications. Regarding the recent situation of the Inland River Bureau, according to the person in charge of the China Merchants Bureau, when the Bureau was ordered to close the Inland River Bureau by the deadline, the Inland River Bureau reported that it was based on the request of merchant Zhang Yi Zeng that after the Inland River Bureau was closed, the merchant would rent the ships to operate, etc. At that time, the closure procedures of the Inland River Bureau were not ready, and the Bureau reported to the Ministry of Communications that the deadline for the closure of the Inland River Bureau was extended to January 15, 1937. At the same time, the merchant's request to rent ships for operation was reported to the Ministry for approval. Later, the instruction was received to still order the complete closure and suspension, and the Zhang Yi Zeng rental of ships to continue navigation was not approved. The Bureau has ordered the Inland River Bureau to comply with the order. It is not true that Zhang Yi Zeng served as the general manager of the Inland River Bureau, and it is also reported that Zhang requested the Bureau to temporarily maintain the status quo of the Inland River Bureau, and was approved by Deputy Manager Shen of the Bureau, and it was decided to go to Beijing that night to request various sections from the Ministry, which are not true.

### The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau Ordered Shipping Companies to Register Yesterday

The Deadline is Approaching, Comply Quickly to Avoid Misunderstanding

In order to rectify the shipping industry, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated the Rules for Registration of Steamship Industry and promulgated and implemented them on December 9 last year. The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau also ordered the shipping industry under its jurisdiction to comply with the rules. Because it has been more than a month overdue, most shipping companies are waiting and watching. The Bureau specially issued a notice to all steamship companies and firms yesterday, ordering them to quickly apply for supplementary registration to avoid misunderstanding. Here is a special exploration of the original text of the notice: In order to announce the matter, the Rules for Registration of Steamship Industry have been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Communications on November 9 last year, and the Bureau has also sent the rules to the Shanghai Steamship Industry Association and the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Industry Association for transfer to various steamship industries for compliance. In accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Rules, the deadline for supplementary registration for existing steamship companies and firms is six months from the date of promulgation of the Rules. It has been more than a month since the date of promulgation of the Rules, and various steamship companies and firms have not yet come to apply for supplementary registration. The deadline is approaching, and all existing steamship companies and firms should comply quickly to avoid misunderstanding. In addition to sending letters separately, this announcement is specially made for public knowledge.

### The Central Machine Factory Was Ordered to Prepare for Transfer

The Executive Yuan Meeting Decided to Transfer the Central Machine Factory of the Ministry of Industry to the Ministry of Railways for management. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about Lu Weipu, the preparatory director of the factory, yesterday, and was told that regarding the transfer, the order of the Ministry of Industry has been received, and the formal transfer can be made as soon as the Ministry of Railways sends personnel to Shanghai.

### Yang Feng Telegraphs Suiyuan Regarding Disaster Investigation Process

The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association received a telegram from Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong reporting on the inspection and relief process, saying: To the esteemed Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association: Fen et al. departed from Xinghe, 180 li away, for Jining to investigate the disaster area of the county. One-fourth of the entire county is affected. The location is intertwined with Taolin. Relief workers investigating Taolin can also investigate Jining. The most severely affected war zone in Taolin is Honggeyuan, whose northeast is surrounded by overlapping mountains. Bandits and puppets from Shangdu, numbering four to five thousand, used airplanes and artillery for cover, fully armed, to invade and occupy the mountain peaks and launch fierce attacks downwards. The defending national army had only one company, and several hundred members of the public defense and service corps resolutely resisted in the trenches, day and night. One continuous stream of reinforcements arrived. Fortunately, there were weapons, and they were eventually able to repel the attackers. Three-fourths of the destroyed civilian houses and the Catholic church were also heavily damaged. Many people were displaced and have not returned. Relief friends set out in four groups. We stayed for one day and went to Taolin City to meet the county magistrate, then returned to Jining Zhuozishan, and returned to the province last night. After a brief rest for one day, we will go to Sui. This is the general situation of Bailin Temple, Great Temple, Wulanhua, Siziwang Banner, Wuchuan, and other places. The relief funds of 20,000 yuan have been remitted. The first batch of relief clothing has arrived in Ping, but has not yet arrived in Sui, which is too slow. Respectfully reported, Feng Xuefen and Yang Mingsheng kowtow. (Xinxin News Agency)

### Charity Organizations Relief Association to Raise 80,000 This Month

Separate Letters Soliciting Donations from Various Organizations and Individuals

The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association, after receiving a telegram from the association's Feng and Yang, stating that the disaster in Suiyuan was exceptionally tragic and that relief was urgently needed, immediately convened its third executive meeting and resolved to raise 80,000 yuan before the end of this month to remit to Sui for disaster relief and to save the affected people. In addition to appointing Qu Wenliu, Li Dachao, and other seven people to be responsible for soliciting donations, yesterday, it sent a reply to various organizations and individual members who had already pledged donations but had not yet paid, as well as those who had not yet pledged donations, stating: Respected Sirs, At the third executive meeting of this association on the 16th of this month, the relief funds of this association were discussed and it was resolved that those who have already pledged donations but have not yet paid will be sent letters and representatives will be dispatched to collect them in installments and that all funds will be collected before the end of this month. Those who have not pledged donations are requested to determine the amount of their donations, record them in the register, and send them to the relevant parties. Respectfully, we hope that you, for the relief funds of this association, will indicate the amount of donations, whether pledged or solicited, before the end of this month. We eagerly await your response.

### Flour Sales for All Gangs Increase Sharply, Domestic Flour Merchants All Profit

Years of Losses Slightly Compensated. Two Batches of Foreign Wheat Continue Loading to Arrive in Shanghai

Dagong News Agency reports that since the sales of flour from the Northern and Southern gangs have increased sharply, the number of vehicles in each factory has recovered and production has been stepped up. Regarding the raw materials for flour production, each factory, in addition to setting up shops in domestic production areas to purchase and use, has also ordered seven ships of foreign wheat from Australia, Canada, Chicago, and other places, totaling more than 53,000 tons, which arrived in Shanghai the night before last and were unloaded and stored in various warehouses. Goods are picked up with a single ticket. According to the designated distribution method, they are transferred to Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Danyang, Nanjing, and other domestic manufacturers for use. Dagong News Agency reporters learned that since the September 18th Incident, after the Northeast market was seized by invaders, the flour industry in our country suffered a setback, and losses have been significant over the years. Those with a shortage of capital have experienced economic stagnation, closure, and business suspension. Those with slightly thicker capital also felt difficulties in turnover under this blow. Fortunately, our country had a bumper harvest last year, and overseas wheat-producing areas were barren, and prices rose sharply. Japanese flour mills could not grind due to cost reasons, so our country's flour mills took the opportunity to rise. In the Northern and Southern gangs markets that were once seized, a large amount of Chinese flour was transported and sold, and the long-standing chronic diseases were healed. Therefore, most flour mills last year were profitable. Although past losses have not been fully recovered, there has been considerable compensation, and it is expected that there will be continued progress in the future.

### Miscellaneous Grains Industry, People's Food Shops Solicit Donations for Airplanes

In addition, for free donations, various shops in the Southern City have contributed 11,000 yuan, and various shops in the Northern City have contributed 4,000 yuan. The remaining amount will be collected by various miscellaneous grains gangs, such as the fishermen's gang, the miscellaneous grains trade guild, the Cantonese Shenshoutang, the Zhenjiang gang Jiqitang, and the oil cake factory guild. This is being actively promoted.

### Fire at Medicinal Herb Warehouse in Huayuan Lane Causes Nearly 200,000 Yuan in Losses

Warehouse Shared by Wan Maoxing and Tong Kang Two Medicine Stores. Fire Took Five Hours to Put Out. Rescue Was Extremely Difficult

At around 6 p.m. yesterday, a warehouse shared by Wan Maoxing and Tong Kang, two medicinal herb stores at No. 42 Huayuan Lane outside Dadongmen in the Southern City, suddenly caught fire. The fire spread rapidly. Although the firefighters tried their best to extinguish it, it had not been completely extinguished by around 11 p.m. It is estimated that the losses of the two stores are close to 200,000 yuan. Details are recorded below.

Shared Warehouse The address at No. 42 Huayuan Lane, Dadong Wharf Street outside Dadongmen in the Southern City, is an old-style mansion with a total of twelve spacious rooms upstairs and downstairs. The house is jointly leased by Wan Maoxing at No. 99 Xiangua Street inside Dadongmen and Tong Kang, a medicinal herb store at No. 99 Wangmiao North, Waixiangua Street, as a warehouse. It has been many years since then, and no accidents have occurred.

Sudden Fire Usually, each of the two stores sends five or six people to take turns guarding the warehouse every day. At 6 p.m. yesterday, all the guards in the warehouse left the warehouse for dinner. When they returned to the warehouse after dinner at 6:30 p.m., they suddenly found a fire in the warehouse, so they immediately alerted the fire brigade, and a fire engine was dispatched to rescue it. However, the fire was already out of control, and the alley was extremely narrow, making rescue extremely difficult. The firefighters had no choice but to urgently smash open the walls of Yucheng at No. 46 on the right and Xingfa at No. 40 on the left and shoot water from three sides.

Huge Losses When the reporter of this newspaper rushed to investigate, neighbors nearby claimed that the warehouse had been fully stocked with goods recently. When the fire broke out, no one on the left or right knew about it until the firefighters arrived and smashed the walls to shoot water. Therefore, as of 11 p.m., when this newspaper went to press, it had not been completely extinguished. It is estimated that the losses of the two stores in this fire are about 200,000 yuan. There are more than a thousand pieces of goods in the warehouse. Even the cheapest medicinal material is worth two or three thousand yuan. It is easy to imagine the price of other finer and more expensive items.

History of the Two Stores Wan Maoxing Medicine Store has been in business for more than 80 years and is one of the best in the Chinese medicine industry. It is said to be a joint venture established by shareholders, and the general manager is Zhuang Zhihong from Ningbo. Tong Kang Medicine Store has been established for 15 or 16 years and is a sole proprietorship established by Du Xianqing from Ningbo. Both stores have fire insurance for the jointly leased warehouse. Wan Maoxing is insured by Good Times Insurance Company, with an insured amount of more than 20,000 yuan. Tong Kang is insured by Siming Insurance Company, with an insured amount of only more than 10,000 yuan. The cause of the fire is currently under strict investigation by the police station in charge.

### Zhu Xinyuan's Abortion Leads to Illness

Police File Lawsuit

Zhu Xinyuan, a local woman residing at No. 15 Shanhai Pass Road, is 22 years old and works as a female worker in the Yihe Silk Factory in Dawang Temple. She has no husband. Because Zhu Xinyuan was unaccustomed to sleeping alone, she had an affair with Wu Landi from Shaoxing. She secretly became pregnant. Fearing that her mother, Zhu Chen, would find out, she paid 21 yuan to Yang Zhong from Zhenjiang at No. 215 Changping Road through her little sister Tan Cuidi to have an abortion in November last year. Although the fetus was aborted, Zhu Xinyuan became ill and became more and more serious. It was not until the 3rd of this month that her mother sent Zhu Xinyuan to Guangren Hospital, where it was confirmed that she was ill due to an abortion. She immediately reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which ordered detective Cui Jinyong to arrest Yang Zhong and send her to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit against Yang Zhong and Zhu Xinyuan according to the law. Because Zhu was hospitalized for treatment, the hearing was postponed. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the defendant Zhu Xinyuan had not yet recovered and requested the court to question her at the hospital. Subsequently, Zhu Chen claimed that she was 48 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at No. 15 Shanhai Pass Road. Zhu Xinyuan is my biological daughter and works in the Qihe Silk Factory. At the beginning of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, she suddenly became ill. I didn't know it was because of an abortion at first, until recently, when I saw her illness getting worse, I sent her to the hospital and found out that it was caused by an abortion. When questioned, the defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Chen Maoxuan to appear in court to represent them. Judge Huang ruled that the case would be postponed for seven days, and it was also scheduled to go to Guangren Hospital at 3 p.m. yesterday to question Zhu Xinyuan's confession.

### Bravely Capturing Thieves, Shot by Thief

Robbery in Sanliqiao, Pudong

Feng Zhen's home at No. 24 Jiandelili, Sanliqiao, West Pudong, was broken into by three thieves at 2 a.m. yesterday. One thief wearing gray cloth guarded the second door, while the other two thieves went upstairs. One thief wearing blue cloth held a pistol and warned Feng's wife not to make a sound, while the thief wearing black cloth robbed the house. They stole two gold rings and a呢大衣 and went to Zhoujia Street through the back alley. This was heard by Xu Jiufu at No. 43 next door, who bravely grabbed an iron rod and chased after them. The thief shot him in the upper part of his right knee. At that time, the Nanmatou Police Station learned of the incident and immediately dispatched patrol officers to arrest the thieves but failed. They immediately sent the injured Xu Jiufu to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. They also found a four-inch pistol bullet on the ground and sent it to the Kuangqiao Police Station for safekeeping, awaiting the arrest of the thieves for investigation.

### Sheng Yuchang Accused of Issuing Bad Checks

Court Summons Unserved. Check Address and Resend

Sheng Yuchang, the grandson of the former Qing Dynasty's Palace Guardian Sheng Xingsun, previously issued a check for 5,632.50 yuan from Shanghai Continental Bank dated December 15, 25th year, to Wu Zhaoji and Wu Li, Cantonese from Sihui, and crossed out the payer's name on the check, so the check had to be collected with a guarantee from another bank. However, Wu and others did not have a bank to deal with, so they handed the check to lawyer Xu Shihao for collection. Unexpectedly, when it was due, it was rejected. Wu and others then hired Rong Zhenlong as their agent to file a lawsuit against Sheng Yuchang in the First Special Court for issuing bad checks, requesting punishment in accordance with Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and attached a civil lawsuit requesting the recovery of the check amount. The court immediately issued a summons and sent it to Sheng at No. 22 Central Building, Jiujiang Road, as listed by the plaintiff. However, the place was an empty house, so it could not be served. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. The plaintiff's lawyer explained the process and stated that the defendant's address was B22 Central Building and requested that it be sent again. The court approved and ordered a change of date for the hearing.

### Lawyer Li Jichuan Accused of Seduction

Verdict on the 25th

When lawyer Li Jichuan lived in Yongfengfang, North Sichuan Road, he had an ambiguous relationship with Qu Yinsong, the wife of his neighbor Feng Weichen from Guangdong. Feng initially lacked evidence and endured in silence. Recently, after Li moved away, Qu's temptation became even greater, and she did not return home all night. After Feng investigated and confirmed the matter, he hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Li in the First Special District Court for seduction. A hearing has already been held, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened the court for a continued hearing. The defendant's defense lawyer, Chen Wenshuo, still requested that the hearing be closed to the public, but the court did not consider it necessary and did not approve the request. Then, the plaintiff Feng Weichen was questioned. He testified that he and Qu Yinsong were officially married. As for Qu's seduction by Li, although he had heard about it earlier, he was half-doubtful. It was not until Qu did not return home all night and he dragged out Li's letter to question Qu that Qu admitted it. They had secret meetings in the Nanjing Hotel, the New Asia Hotel, and other places, and the tea servers of the hotels could testify. Subsequently, according to Qu Yinsong, the first time she had intercourse with Li was on December 29th at the Nanjing Hotel. She returned home that night. The second time, she stayed in New Asia for one day. Li suggested moving to Dadong. In total, she was raped six times, all arranged by Li. When questioned, Li Jichuan denied everything, saying that Qu was actually Feng's concubine. They signed a cohabitation agreement at lawyer Yan Dajue's office on December 22nd, 22nd year. On the same day, Feng and his ex-wife Guan Huifang also signed a divorce agreement at lawyer Yan's office. The letter from the plaintiff to Qu was not written by me and can be identified. Because Qu felt that she was not treated well after living with Feng, she once came to discuss divorcing Feng. I inquired and learned that they were not husband and wife, so there was no need for a divorce. Later, because they were neighbors, I did not want to handle the matter and refused the request. Unexpectedly, Ma then held a grudge and fabricated accusations. After mutual arguments between the lawyers of the two parties, Judge Pan ruled that the verdict would be announced at 3 p.m. on the 25th of this month.

### Lushan Maru Busts Traffickers

Rescues Five Children

The day before yesterday evening, Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the China Women and Children Relief Association, together with Huang Songsheng and Zhou Zenghua, detectives from the Customs Water Police Station, went to the Lushan Maru, a China-South shipping vessel at the Nissin Company Pier in Laobaidu, Pudong, to investigate. Inside the ship's cabin, they caught sight of a middle-aged woman leading five boys of various sizes with suspicious behavior. They immediately interrogated her. The woman claimed to be Zhao Zhang, 37 years old, from Henan. Three of the children were her own sons, and she did not know the other two. The detectives then interrogated each child separately. Zhang Ayun, 15 years old, from Siyang, had a deceased father and a mother who farmed in the countryside. Liao Genquan, 13 years old, from Jiangxi, had a father named Liao Tongsheng who ran a bamboo shop somewhere in Tilanqiao. Wang Daogen, 13 years old, from Jiangwan, had a father who was killed by stray bullets during the January 28th Shanghai War when he did not have time to escape. His mother had remarried and was missing.

### Zheng Pengmei Witnesses Wife's Adultery

Angrily Gathers Crowd to Capture. Court Investigates and Sentences

Zheng Pengmei (also known as Zheng Hongqin), a 33-year-old man from Wenzhou living at No. 19, Lane 268, Metcalfe Road, worked as a waiter in the nearby Tomson Apartments. Seven years ago, he married a woman surnamed Huang from his hometown. Huang, who is now 25 years old, had a good relationship with Zheng after they got married. They had a son named Dahua, who is already four years old. However, Chen Youzhen, a 32-year-old man from Wenzhou who worked as a butler for a foreigner at No. 24 Baisai Zhong Road, was also from the same hometown as Zheng Pengmei and in the same industry, so they knew each other. At around 11 p.m. the night before, Zheng Pengmei returned home from outside and suddenly saw his wife Zheng Huang having intercourse with Chen Youzhen in the bedroom. He was filled with jealousy and gathered a crowd to capture both the adulterer and the adulteress. They took them to the Zhangjiazhai stove shop to negotiate. Zheng initially demanded 300 yuan, but finally settled on 80 yuan, wrote an IOU, paid 16 yuan in cash, and dispersed. Unexpectedly, Chen Youzhen was unwilling and immediately reported to the Xinzha Police Station. After investigation by detectives Wu Changkai and Wang Qishan, Zheng Pengmei, Zheng Huang, and Chen Youzhen were arrested and detained in the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit against Zheng Pengmei for extortion under Article 346, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and against Zheng Huang and Chen Youzhen for adultery with a married person under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. The court declared that the hearing was closed to the public because the case concerned morals. As a result, Chen Youzhen was sentenced to three months in prison, Zheng Pengmei was sentenced to 30 days of detention for obstructing freedom, with a two-year suspended sentence. As for Zheng Huang, because she did not withdraw the complaint, the case was not accepted.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Reduction Plan

Board of Directors Resolves to Change a Portion

After the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council passed the reduction plan proposed by the council's Staff Economic Committee, many opinions were received from council members, which have been sent to the committee for consideration. Now, the committee has adopted some opinions and proposed several revised recommendations. When the council's Board of Directors met on the 20th of this month, it passed each of the revised recommendations. The revised points are as follows:

㊀ Regarding retirement savings, the committee originally recommended that exchange allowances would not be given on the interest generated from retirement savings under the new rules. It is now approved, as requested by the council members, that exchange allowances will still be given on the interest generated from retirement savings under the new rules.

㊁ Some current "B" category staff members hired from Shanghai originally had the hope of being reclassified into "A" category in the future. After five years of service, they can enjoy the privilege of applying for long leave. According to the amendment, this type of staff member will be treated the same as staff members holding "A" category appointments and "B" category staff members hired from abroad and can also apply for long leave after five years of service. However, the new rules on exchange allowances and travel expenses apply to those who follow.

㊂ According to the new amendment, staff members who can apply for long leave between July 1, 1937, and December 31, will have their salaries during their long leave paid at the exchange rate of one Chinese national currency yuan equivalent to one shilling and six pence in British gold, limited to 700 yuan. Staff members who can apply for long leave in 1938 are limited to 600 yuan. Staff members who can apply for long leave in 1939 are limited to 500 yuan. The exchange rates are the same as above. The original new rules still apply to staff members who can apply for long leave after 1939, i.e., their salaries during their long leave will be paid at the exchange rate mentioned above, limited to 400 yuan.

㊃ According to the amendment, the salaries of the current members of the Russian Company of the Merchant Corps, except for officers, will not be reduced immediately, but there will be no salary increase within one year. The annual salary increase for acting corporals and soldiers will be changed from 3 yuan to 4 yuan. The salary scales for captains and adjutants are revised as follows: Minimum Annual Increase Maximum Salary Salary Captain 207 yuan 14 yuan 276 yuan Adjutant 230 yuan 9 yuan 184 yuan

㊄ According to the amendment, current employed health inspectors, if they have passed all the council's examinations and hold a certificate from the Royal Sanitary Institute of Great Britain, may apply for seven months of long leave and two months of "research leave" after five years of service. The council will provide funding to go to the United Kingdom. After that, for every five years of service, they may apply for seven months of long leave, but the new rules regarding travel expenses apply to those under the same time. Health inspectors employed in the future may apply for their first long leave after five years of service if they have accumulated enough short leave to apply for long leave in order to participate in the Royal Sanitary Institute of Great Britain's meat and food inspector examination. The council will provide funding to go to the United Kingdom. During the first long leave (including the "research leave" period), the council will pay 30 weeks of salary. If they participate in the aforementioned examination and fail, they must return three weeks of salary. There will be no salary increase and no further "research leave" may be applied for until they pass the examination. Subsequent long leave will be handled in accordance with the new rules.

### Xing Zhigang Requests the Prohibition of Misappropriating Special Funds for Cooperative Dredging

Zhoupu Pond in Pudong is a major river for transportation between Shangnan and Liang counties. Yesterday, Xing Zhigang, the Fifth District Chief of Shanghai County, opposed the misappropriation of special funds for cooperative dredging and requested the Nan Hui County Chief to stop it. The document stated: "According to the New Pudong Daily of the previous issue, the Zhoupu City River Dredging Committee proposed how to raise funds for the project and resolved to request the county government to borrow 500 yuan from the Shanghai Cooperative Dredging Zhoupu Pond fund. This is very surprising. The special fund for the Zhoupu Pond river works in Shanghai County was donated by Shanghai County to Nan County during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty to generate interest and use it for the downstream dredging of Zhoupu Pond. The principal and interest were retained, and Shanghai County no longer dispatched labor to ensure its long-term use. Shanghai and Nan Counties jointly informed the higher authorities and were approved and each filed their cases. They also jointly erected a stone tablet stating that the special fund should be protected and managed in accordance with the regulations to ensure long-term prosperity and benefit. This was recorded on the tablet for permanent compliance. Fifty years have passed since then, regardless of how the national system has changed, the special fund for cooperative dredging of the river works cannot be moved without actual use for downstream dredging. Moreover, it has been recorded in the new county annals of Shanghai and Nan Counties, and the monthly report of the Public Funds and Property Management Office in the New Nanhui Daily also has a separate item for the special fund for Shanghai Cooperative Dredging Zhoupu Pond to make it clear. Therefore, it cannot be borrowed under any circumstances. Moreover, Zhoupu is the leading town and commercial center of Nan County. Dredging the city river is ⑴ to facilitate transportation and develop business; ⑵ to discharge water smoothly and clean drinking water. All shops and residents in Zhoupu City will surely enthusiastically contribute upon hearing the news of the dredging, and there is no need to misappropriate the special fund for downstream dredging of Shanghai County to avoid causing misunderstandings among the people of Nan County and hindering the established case. Therefore, I specifically present the situation to you, requesting your review and approval, and promptly order the Zhoupu City River Dredging Committee to strictly prohibit the misappropriation to protect the special fund and maintain the established case. I am deeply grateful."

### Interesting Anecdotes of a Smoker in Prison

Making the "Immortal in the Belly" Laugh and Worrying the Woman in the Village

Chen Jinsheng, the old purser of the Tianlu Tea and Food Shop in this city (from Shuangdunmiao Village, Wutang Township, Jiading County), one night at midnight, suddenly pretended to go out to urinate, wearing only a single layer of clothing, and never returned. The people in the shop immediately searched for him in all directions for several days without any news. They notified his family, and his wife also inquired in many ways after hearing the news, but could not find him. It happened that the Mi family in Zhangjia Village, Zumao Mound, in that area, specialized in calling back the dead and looking at incense heads, and they were generally called "Immortal in the Belly." Ordinary ignorant men and women believed in them, so Chen's wife also invited them to her home to inquire about the survival of her husband, providing incense and candles and burning paper ingots. The "Immortal in the Belly" pretended to yawn several times, and his stomach made noises. After a while, he said, "Your husband has left the world and is now in the Senluo Hall." Chen's wife wept and begged to see him. Then, the "Immortal in the Belly" falsely claimed that "Your husband has arrived," and spoke nonsense. At this time, Chen's wife kowtowed like pounding garlic, and the "Immortal in the Belly" said, "The time limit has arrived," and then took his leave. Chen's wife knew that her husband was dead and immediately set up a memorial tablet to summon his soul, wearing mourning clothes. She hired monks and nuns to transcend his soul, but when the drums and cymbals were sounding, the postman delivered a letter from her husband, saying that one night he went out to smoke opium and was arrested by the police. He is now detained in the Caohejing Prison and described the various experiences of his arrest. His wife then knew that he was still alive and quickly dismantled the spiritual tablet and tidied up the ritual ground, burning a lot of firecrackers. For a while, it was spread far and wide as an interesting anecdote.

Everyone in the construction and brick-and-mortar industries knew Er Guniang. Seven or eight years ago, she hired a bookkeeper, Lu Yongxiang, who was five or six years younger than Er Guniang. He was not particularly handsome, but he wore Western suits and leather shoes and liked to dress up, so Er Guniang considered him a "boy toy" and had an affair with him. Now, Er Guniang is suing Lu Yongxiang for theft in the Local Court. According to Er Guniang, she has reimbursed Lu Yongxiang with more than 20,000 yuan over the years. Now that she is old and has lost her beauty, she has been abandoned. On November 2nd of this year, Lu borrowed money and, taking advantage of her absence, led several people to break into the upstairs room, damaging the door and stealing 970 yuan in cash and more than 140 yuan in clothes, etc. She immediately questioned Lu, who admitted it, and the maid Qin Wangshi can testify. Lu Yongxiang lived at No. 15 Zhangjiazhai, Zhongshan Road, Jiaotong Road, and requested to be detained, etc. Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court yesterday, but the defendant did not arrive, and the hearing was rescheduled to January 27th.

### Young Woman Marries a Rich Man and Disregards Her Poor Mother

Even Expelling and Insulting Her Greatly - Fined 100 Yuan by the Court

Shen Manyun, a famous Shanghai tycoon, known as Shen the Millionaire, owns over a hundred new-style buildings in Xincheng Li, Xicang Road, behind the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in the city, which is just a small part of his property. His eldest son, Shen Zurong, lives in the Doupai Mansion, No. 24 in that lane. Shen Zurong married Shen Hu, daughter of Old Woman Hu Xu from Taicang (given name Ruizhu, age 22). Old Woman Hu Xu, widowed, lost her eyesight due to excessive grief, making her 50 years old and causing her to wander destitute in Nanxiang. Her son, Hu Zhonglin, is a clerk at a money shop in Doushi Street and is also married. Old Woman Hu Xu, thinking that her children might help her survive and knowing that her son was at her daughter's house, went to her daughter's house in heavy rain, soaked to the bone, seeking to see her children and beg for a living. However, her daughter cursed her mother as a pig, saying her words were like farts, and cursing her mother to die sooner rather than later to avoid living in this world, and even drove her out. Filled with anger and indignation, the old woman hired lawyer Liu Xiang to file a complaint in the local court, accusing her daughter, son, and son-in-law of violence and disrespect to elders. She stated that her late husband had left a small fortune, but most of it was spent on raising their children, especially to provide her daughter with a dowry when she married into a wealthy family, spending the remaining five or six thousand yuan entirely on her trousseau. As a result, she was left penniless and disabled, unable to support herself. She accused her daughter of being snobbish and urged the court to punish her severely. The prosecutor suggested reconciliation, but Shen Hu refused to yield to her mother, so she was prosecuted. During the trial, Hu Zhonglin showed some filial piety and offered to support his mother, begging for forgiveness. However, Shen Hu remained stubborn despite Judge Lu Hongze's persuasion. Therefore, yesterday, the judge ruled that Shen Hu was guilty of insulting elders and imposed a light fine of 100 yuan.

### Trafficking of Women into Prostitution Case Is a Large-Scale Organization

Lu Jiale and Others Are the Main Culprits - Verdict to Be Announced on the 25th

Zhang Fengying, a 14-year-old girl from Wuxi, recently came to Shanghai from her hometown and stayed with her aunt Zhu Juzhen at No. 21 Mao Hai Road, intending to find work in a cotton mill. She suddenly disappeared on November 7th last year and was abducted to Qingdao, then resold to the Lebaoshan Wife Brothel at No. 12 Zhimiangou, Dalian, to become a prostitute. Because the girl was young and not fully developed, she was temporarily kept at the brothel. Subsequently, Chinese detectives Feng Qishan and Xia Shutang of the Hongkou Police Station arrested the suspects Liu Fengsheng, Zhang Changbao, Lu Jiale, the woman Liu Zhao, the woman Zhang Chen, and Yu Junxiang (also known as Xiao Yu), who turned himself in, at No. 304 Gongping Road and in Wusong Road, Qingdao, and Dalian. These ten men and women were separately escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation. This newspaper has reported this several times. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Public Works Department stated that Yu Junxiang was arrested outside the courtroom during the recess. The reason was that Zhang Fengying was lured out by Liu Zhao and then taken by her son Liu Fengsheng to Zhang Changbao's brokerage, where they colluded with Ling Defu and Yu Junqing. Ling and Yu then took the girl by boat to Qingdao and then to Dalian to be sold as a prostitute. After receiving the money, they promised to give him thirty yuan. He returned to Shanghai first, and after the case was cracked, he came to the court that day to inquire about the news, still hoping to get the thirty yuan, which led to his arrest. The defendants in this case are a large-scale organization. Lu Jiale, Wang Runzhi, Ling Defu, Yu Junxiang, and Zhang Changbao are the main culprits who specialize in trafficking women, and the rest are accomplices. He requested that they be severely punished. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive and contradictory testimonies, blaming each other. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody separately and scheduled the verdict for the 25th.

Commentary

### Commentary on the Guangjiu Railway Express Accident

— Zinan

The cause of the Guangjiu Railway Express accident is still under "investigation in Guangzhou to clarify the truth." The "truth" awaits the report after the "investigation meeting." However, based on the current telegrams and imagination, we can generally believe that the fire was caused by "rosin-based toys." According to the quick telegram in this newspaper on the 17th, "the cause was two baskets of chemical toys placed in the third-class carriage toilet. The train's shaking caused a fire, which burned down to the lubricating oil of the wheels, and the rapid speed of the train and the wind quickly ignited three carriages." Although this account differs slightly from the Reuters telegram on the 18th, they can supplement each other. According to the Reuters telegram, "the fire was caused by a passenger accidentally touching a rosin-based toy with fire, which quickly spread to various luggage..." It is clear that there were many rosin-based toys, but whether the fire was caused by "shaking and catching fire" or "a passenger accidentally touching it with fire" still needs investigation. However, judging from common sense, the latter is more likely.

Regardless of how the fire started, let's look at the casualties. According to the authorities' announcement, "the tragedy resulted in a total of 77 deaths and 35 injuries." However, according to the Reuters telegram, "the number of victims has exceeded 105." Whether it is 105 or 77, it is truly speechless that such an unprecedented tragedy occurred on a railway that was always considered well-managed.

According to our imagination, the cause of this tragedy was due to negligence and carelessness. Whether it was "two baskets of chemical toys" or "sulfuric acid stored in the washroom suddenly exploded (Reuters telegram on the 17th mentioned this)," leaving dangerous items carelessly in public areas where passengers come and go is negligence of duty, even before the tragedy occurred. If the item was brought in privately, whether by a passenger or a train employee, the manager should have the responsibility to investigate its source!

What is even more unfortunate is that "the driver did not notice the fire until it had spread to the third carriage and then stopped the train." If the driver had not noticed it and continued driving at high speed, the tragedy would have been even more unimaginable. The reason the driver did not know for a while was that "there was no emergency alarm system in the carriage, so it was impossible to warn the driver." The reason there was no alarm system was that "it was feared that passengers would unknowingly pull the alarm rope, so this equipment was not installed."

Because of the fear that "passengers would unknowingly pull the alarm rope," "this equipment was not installed." This reason is as naive as "avoiding eating for fear of choking." Looking at the alarm equipment in other public places, there seems to be no "passengers unknowingly..." situation. Therefore, whether the lack of alarm equipment on the train is due to fear of "passenger ignorance" is worth pondering!

The lack of alarm equipment makes me think about why the fire did not occur in the first-class carriage but in the third-class carriage. I really can't bear to think about this issue, but I want to ask a question: Are there or can there be dangerous items such as "chemical toys" or "sulfuric acid" stored in the washrooms or toilets of the first and second-class carriages?

It is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. However, for this tragedy, in addition to hoping that measures will be taken to prevent such incidents from happening again and that the lives of third-class passengers will no longer be treated as child's play, we also hope that the cause of this disaster will be thoroughly investigated!

The railway authorities may have a reason for their negligence and tolerance, but for their own safety, passengers cannot ignore this tragedy.

### Pilgrimage to the Snake Temple

— Nanou

Most people who have been to Penang have visited the Kek Lok Si Temple. Kek Lok Si Temple is an ancient Chinese-style place, not very unusual, and I didn't find it very interesting when I went there. This time I went to Penang because the ship back to China passed through here and only stayed for half a day. My old friend Lao Rong entertained me: "Would you like to go somewhere for fun?" He asked me this after we had eaten at a curry restaurant opened by a Jilining person. Penang was not unfamiliar to me, I had come here specifically to play before. I said I didn't want to go to Kek Lok Si Temple and these other places. If there really was nowhere to go, then it would be good to just stroll around the streets here. I really like the quiet and peaceful atmosphere of the streets of Penang. When I was walking towards the coast with a yearning for a foreign land, weren't the star-like eyes of the Nyonyas ① half-hidden in the window seams on the second floor so charming? Although that trip to Penang was two years ago, it left me with an unforgettable impression.

Lao Rong thought for a moment and suddenly slapped the table and shouted, "I've got it! I've got it! You haven't been to the Snake Temple yet!"

"Snake Temple?" I felt it was too bizarre, and I had never heard of the Snake Temple before. So he told me that the Snake Temple could definitely give me a little stimulation, and the customs there were indeed not very ordinary. We calculated the time and felt that it was still very sufficient, so we hired a car and went to the Snake Temple.

In the speeding car, Lao Rong told me about the situation of the Snake Temple. Since it is called the Snake Temple, there must be snakes inside. Lao Rong said that some of the natives of Penang worship snakes, treat them as gods, not only dare not harm them, but also pray to them and kowtow to them. I know about the primitiveness of the minds of the natives of Southeast Asia. In the history of human culture, the superstition of backward nations is still an incomprehensible fact. At this time, I was indeed a little excited, and with a curious heart, I hoped that the car would drive to the gate of the Snake Temple as soon as possible.

What kind of place is the Snake Temple? When I arrived there, it was so different from what I had imagined! The temple building was small and dilapidated. Compared with the magnificent Kek Lok Si Temple, it was really too far apart. I followed behind Lao Rong step by step and approached the temple gate. From inside, there came a strange fishy smell. On the temple gate, the shadows of snakes appeared. These were some small green snakes. I was stunned and almost cried out. Lao Rong laughed and said, "Don't be afraid, snakes don't bite when they become gods!" However, I have always been afraid of snakes. Now, on the one hand, I don't want to go in anymore, and on the other hand, I am driven by curiosity and hope to go in and see what kind of situation it is. I finally went in with Lao Rong. Looking around, the light was very gloomy. The shadows of snakes filled the beams, shrines, drum racks, candle holders... These snakes were entangled there, motionless, smoked by the strong smell of incense. Occasionally, when one moved, my nerves would tremble. I could never be as calm as Lao Rong. In front of the altar, a native was devoutly kowtowing, muttering something I couldn't understand. Later, Lao Rong asked him, and the answer he got was that his son was sick and had seen two doctors.

## Page 18

He had not improved after seeing them, so he came here to ask for the protection of the gods. This native had a wrinkled face that had been overwhelmed by life. Although I sympathized with him in my heart, I doubted whether his prayers would be effective...

There is nothing to see in the Snake Temple. And the time for me to board the ship was approaching, so Lao Rong and I left the Snake Temple and still took the original car back.

This time I passed through Penang, I only saw Lao Rong and went to the Snake Temple together. If I had known that the Snake Temple was such a place, I would rather have taken a walk on that quiet street, bathing in the sunshine.

### In Front of the Hotel

— Menghua

Autumn days are short. Small shops in the town close their doors for the night right after dinner. The muddy dirt road is completely dark. On the main road into town, only the Yucheng Hotel is still open, its grayish-yellow light cutting through the darkness of the road.

At the first square table inside the hotel entrance, three people are talking in hushed voices. Anxious expressions make their faces even gloomier.

"It's time already. Could Leper have run into trouble?"

What follows is total silence. The evenings in Nomura are desolate, with stray dogs barking yelping.

A gust of west wind blows through the street, raindrops falling on the puddles in the street, making a low, lonely sound, like the chattering of small fish.

Like a ghost, a shadowy figure appears. The newcomer is wearing a palm-fiber raincoat, covered in yellow mud, and he is Leper. He approaches the counter, rests his chin on his hand, takes off his dripping bamboo hat, revealing a head of messy hair and a pale, convulsing face, drops of water dripping from the edge of his hat...

The three seated guests, sensing an ominous premonition, fall silent, their eyes timidly fixed on him.

"They chopped him!" Leper cries out in a voice like tearing silk.

The shopkeeper sitting behind the counter immediately removes his hand from the abacus, stares and asks:

"What? Jin Sheng was chopped! Speak, Leper."

Leper shuffles over and sits on a bench, scratching his sparse hair violently with both hands, small white flakes falling down like snow. Suddenly, he raises his head, rolls his eyes: "Alas, they chopped him off this morning!..." He says, bowing his head, his feet stamping the ground incessantly.

They are all too familiar with this experience. What is unfolding before them is a scene that chills the bone. Hanging on a wooden pole next to the station is a small wooden cage, inside which is stuffed a swollen head with bared teeth and eyes like a dead fish, and drops of bloody water dripping from the butchered neck.

Then the entire hotel becomes as silent as death. People are lost in cruel memories. Before the shopkeeper's eyes, a familiar customer appears. He drops twelve copper coins on the counter and says:

"Shopkeeper Liu, give me a string of four-wen liquor!"

He never kept an account, and was the most law-abiding farmer in town, but now his head has been chopped off. In front of his eyes, the shopkeeper seems to see a headless corpse exposed to the wind and rain, the body swollen by the rain, with crows pecking at it. The shopkeeper's whole body goes into a spasm, and he says to himself in a low voice:

"What kind of world is this; someone like Jin Sheng also gets chopped, it's really..."

Echoing the barking of stray dogs and the sound of dripping rain, a wail is heard in the distance.

The four drinkers suddenly raise their heads and listen attentively.

"It's Jin Sheng's mother! Listen!" says the person sitting next to Leper.

The crying gradually gets closer. Disordered footsteps, the sound of feet stepping in puddles, suddenly ring out: "My Jin Sheng! You return my Jin Sheng! What crime did he commit? What crime did he commit? May you be struck by lightning! May Heaven pursue you! ... Ah... ah... Help! They snatched my Jin Sheng... Help... help... me..."

"She still doesn't know Jin Sheng has been chopped! Poor thing, really too..." says the shopkeeper.

A woman wearing a black short jacket is running out of town, waving her hands. Her duck-like, hoarse voice keeps echoing in the congealed air.

Like a homeless ghost, she floats past the entrance of the Yuxing Hotel, her hair falling over her chest.

It's raining, dogs are barking………

### The Magic of Photovoltaic Cells (Electric Eyes) (Part 1)

— Te

A young woman hurried into a public building. She walked up to a drinking fountain, looking for a switch or a button, wanting to drink some water to quench her thirst. After searching for a while, she couldn't find one. She lowered her head casually, and the water immediately spurted out, as if waiting for her. She secretly marveled. A nearby elevator attendant smiled at her and also lowered his head towards the fountain, and the water also came out for him. So he explained to the young woman: "This is because your head broke the light. Anyone who comes here to drink water, as long as they do this, the water will spurt out. They call this thing a 'photovoltaic cell' - Photoelectric cell."

That tightly pressed little photovoltaic cell, only a few inches tall, can automatically distinguish colors; open the doors of garages; prevent theft; extinguish fires; it seems to be a very magical thing. The "Aladdin's Lamp" used in the new era industry also adopts this method.

Astronomers use it to measure and compare the light transmitted from the stars to the Earth. Factory owners use it to report fires and prevent thieves. Detectives use it to curb the activities of robbers. Aviators use it to measure the height of fog on tethered balloons to ensure flight safety. Transportation experts use it to set up signals in the suburbs.

This "electric eye" has indeed almost endowed machines with human intelligence. Consider how it prevents prisoners from escaping from prison: If a prisoner quietly climbs over the wall, a gun hidden in the dark will automatically fire at him, and the alarm bell on the wall will also sound. This is because at one end parallel to the prison wall, there is a small beam of light that constantly shines on a photovoltaic cell installed at the other end. When the prisoner enters within the range of the photovoltaic cell's line of sight, he blocks the light, so the current stops. The resulting impulse will activate a mechanical and electrical device, which can also emit a large light or make machine guns fire continuously.

Light shining on certain metals or metal oxides will knock electrons loose, and those electrons will flow through a tightly closed current channel. This is the principle of the photovoltaic cell, which is only about the size of a dried nut.

The history of the photovoltaic cell is closely related to the study of the power of light and its effects. It is quite amazing that 2,000 years ago, it was discovered that only half of the light shining on an object is reflected, and the other half is absorbed by the object.

The basic principle of the new era photovoltaic cell was invented in 1887 by the German physicist Hertz. He noticed that a spark gap was affected by the light emitted from another gap while experimenting with spark emission.

In 1889, Elster and Geitel devoted themselves to applying this theory to practical use. After 30 years of research, they combined their work with that of Armstrong, Geeshal, and others, and succeeded in creating the incredible devices we have today.

### Zhao Huishen From "Thunderstorm" to "Street Angel"

In the past few days, the China Traveling Theater Troupe is once again preparing to stage Mr. Cao Yu's masterpiece "Thunderstorm." In the past, it has also rehearsed this script, and the performance results have won the supreme praise from people in Shanghai and audiences who love drama from all over. This is certainly not accidental. The script is profoundly written, the acting skills of the China Traveling Theater Troupe are superb, and the hard work has contributed to it. We have only infinite respect for this group of artists who are striving for the development of Chinese theater!

I think that audiences who have seen "Thunderstorm" on stage will definitely be familiar with the name Zhao Huishen: She is the pillar of the China Traveling Theater Troupe and a female writer with considerable cultivation. In "Thunderstorm," she played a stepmother—Fanyi—her deep expression and insidious personality vividly portrayed a typical stepmother, leaving an indelible impression in the audience's minds. Established a noble and glorious evaluation on the stage.

Now, Ms. Zhao Huishen, after repeated consultations with the Star Film Company, has taken on a major role in Yuan Muzhi's new work "Street Angel." In the play, she is a prostitute who has experienced the vicissitudes of life and hardships. In the deep night, in the cold wind, she stands on the side of the road every night, with tearful smiles and hopeful hearts, soliciting passers-by, in order to win the favor of the procuress and solve the minimum of hunger and cold.

How painful is the heart of such a woman living an inhuman life under the heavy pressure of society! Isn't this her own wish? The cannibalistic system of real society forces her to succumb to this non-professional occupation.

Undoubtedly, with Ms. Zhao's past success, it is very suitable to play this role struggling to survive in the sea of people. Her calm and composed expression will make "Street Angel" have better results.

### "Tarzan Escapes"

Simultaneously Released in Nanjing and Greater Shanghai

Tarzan has been away from the audience for a long time, and today he meets with the people of Shanghai simultaneously in the Grand Shanghai and Nanjing theaters. There are endless strange monsters in the film, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has put a lot of effort into the production. Photographers and actors have gone through hardships, went deep into the wilderness, and their lives were almost in danger several times. In the film, the veteran Tarzan, John Weissmuller, fights fiercely with ferocious lions, fights fiercely with giant crocodiles, and competes with strange bats. The situation is tense and extremely thrilling. The scenes such as flirting on the shore and bathing in the water are more thoroughly depicted than in the previous "Tarzan and His Mate". In addition to the old partner, the superstar Maureen O'Sullivan, there are also superstars such as Penny Tayham and William Henry.

### Star Opened Yesterday

Designed and built by "Star"

The Star Ballroom, which has been rumored for a long time to be reorganized, was officially opened at 4:00 PM yesterday by Miss Zheng Qian'er, a famous lady from Shanghai, with the band playing the Chinese national anthem. It is said that since Mr. Hu Maer took over the reorganization, he has spared no effort to greatly improve all the equipment of the Star. The ballroom was transformed by Mr. Wu Yaqing, an architect of the Star Film Company, together with the Star Design Department, into the latest era-type two-wheel rotation style. The walls are dyed in light water colors, like a "green" palace. The dancers were hired by the Star owners from major dance halls, and the band hired the famous band of Du Lun from the Great Shanghai Dance Hall to accompany the performance day and night. All the facilities can be called the crown of small dance halls in Shanghai.
