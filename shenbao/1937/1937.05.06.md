After the meeting, the members carefully studied it, and after more than an hour, the case was amended in principle. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 5th)

[Nanjing] The principles of amending the Land Law, totaling twenty-three articles, were fully passed by the Central Political Council on the 5th. The full text is recorded as follows: 1. Land should be classified according to its use (such as arable land, forest land, pasture land, fishing land, etc.). The names of land types used in this law should be unified. 2. It should be clearly stipulated that the state should establish land banks and issue land bonds in order to implement land policies and regulate land distribution. 3. It should be clearly stipulated that the central government may formulate separate regulations on the following items in order to support owner-farmers, and specify local conditions for reference: 1. The minimum area of arable land that an owner-farmer household should have and restrict its disposal. 2. Restrict the maximum amount of debt on self-cultivated land. 3. Inheritance measures for self-cultivated land. 4. The provisions of the land court should delete the land court attached to the municipal and county judicial organs at the time of the first land ownership registration, and the second instance will be concluded. 5. Land surveying and land registration should be compiled into one volume. Regarding land surveying, there should be general regulations in this law. 6. The registration order should be simplified, and the announcement period should be shortened to one to three months. The registration fee should be appropriately reduced. The types, styles, and recording methods of registration maps and documents should be deleted, and the central land administration agency should be granted the power to issue regulations. The certificate of rights issued by the land administration agency should be the sole evidence of the right. 7. In the first registration, disputes concerning land rights should be clearly stated that they should be mediated by the competent land administration agency first. If you do not agree with the mediation, you may appeal to the land court. 8. When the land owner is not the head of the household during land registration, the name of the head of the household should be noted. 9. Land for which no one applies for registration may be registered as state-owned land according to law. 10. Housing relief should be a regular provision. There is no need to stipulate the preparation of houses. 11. When arable land is leased to absentee landlords, or the tenant has been farming continuously for more than five years, and the landlord is not a farmer, or is not old, weak, orphaned, or living off the land, the tenant may request the collection of his arable land according to law. 12. The arable land lease contract should be reviewed and registered by the competent land administration agency. 13. In order to alleviate the burden of land rent, the maximum amount of land rent should be clearly stipulated as 8% of the land price after registration, but the tenant may pay with agricultural products instead according to custom. 14. Only organizations with large-scale land reclamation can cultivate wasteland, and land reclamation agencies may be established to handle it, and land banks may be added to assist. The provisions for substitutes in the original law should be deleted. 15. After reclaiming wasteland, the reclaimers should obtain land ownership free of charge and be granted a tax exemption for a considerable period of time. 16. Land consolidation is the main facility for land administration agencies to promote land use, and should not require the consent of the owners. Article 218 of the original law should be deleted, and the sentence "The improvement of arable land due to irrigation, drainage, or other agricultural needs" should be added, and land consolidation may also be carried out. 17. The mutual compensation of consolidated land shall be calculated on the basis of location. 18. Declare the land price as the statutory land price (all clauses of the original law on estimating land prices have been deleted). Before the declaration, the land administration agency may first refer to the standard land price determined by the land income and cloth price in the most recent five years and announce it as the basis for the declaration. Land owners may increase or decrease by 10% with reference to the standard land price. If they do not declare according to law or do not declare, the standard land price will be used as their land price. 19. Reserved. 20. In special construction areas, if the land tax revenue increases more than the original amount due to the sharp increase in land prices, it may be approved to allocate the increased part to compensate for the construction costs. The land value-added tax without transfer in this area may be levied six years after the start of construction. 21. Within the actual amount of land value appreciation, the value appreciation obtained by land owners through labor and capital as special improvements and the special expenses already paid should be deducted. 22. When the state collects land to implement land policies or build railways, water conservancy, and national defense equipment, it may enter the land to work before issuing compensation, and land bonds may be used for compensation or installment compensation. 23. The collection tax procedure and procedures should be as simple as possible. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 5th)

### Central Government Holds Commemorative Meeting Yesterday for the 16th Anniversary of the Establishment of the Revolutionary Government

Chairman Lin Leads Everyone in Saluting and Delivers a Speech, Expressing Admiration for the Spirit of Premier Sun's Difficult Creation

[Nanjing] The 5th is the anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, that is, the anniversary of the Premier's assumption of the title of Extraordinary President in the tenth year of the Republic. The whole city of Beijing is flying flags to celebrate. The central government and the National Government held a joint commemorative ceremony in front of the Premier's mausoleum at 9:00 AM. Military police were densely deployed outside Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The attendees included Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Ji, Li Yuying, Shao Lizi, Li Wenfan, Deng Jiayan, Zhang Qun, Wang Luyi, Xiao Zheng, Gan Naiguang, Wang Zizhuang, Wen Yiyou, Li Siji, Zhou Qigang, Miao Peicheng, Duan Xipeng, Liu Jiwen, and the heads of various departments of the National Government, such as Ju Zheng, Wang Longhui, Jiang Zuobin, Niu Yongjian, Wu Zhongxin, Wang Yongbin, and Ma Chaojun. Also in attendance were civilian officials with a rank of senior expert or above such as Wei Huai, Chen Qicai, Wang Qijiang, and Wang Zixian, military officers with a rank of colonel or above such as Gu Zhenglun, Chen Jiliang, and Ma Xiang, and party affairs workers with a rank of director-general or above, totaling about 500 people. At 9:00 AM, the music was played and the ceremony began. Chairman Lin presided over the ceremony, leading everyone in saluting the Premier's portrait. After a moment of silence, he delivered a speech. After the speech, all Central Committee members paid homage to the mausoleum, and then the ceremony ended and the meeting was dismissed. The outline of Chairman Lin's original speech is as follows: Today is the most glorious and valuable page in the history of our Party and the Republic of China, and it is worthy of our special commemoration. In the sixth year of the Republic, the Northern Government destroyed the law, and the Premier immediately went to Guangdong to protect the law. First, he quelled the rebellions of Mo Rongxin and others, and then advocated the establishment of a formal government. In the tenth year of the Republic, he convened an extraordinary meeting of the National Assembly, passed the organization outline of the Republic of China government on April 7, and elected the Premier as President on the 10th. The Revolutionary Government was established. The significance of the Premier's assumption of the title of President that day can be divided into two points, internal and external. First, from the internal aspect: First, since the Northern Government was illegally produced at that time, it could not represent the country. In order to promote the spirit of the rule of law, it was necessary to reorganize a central government. Second, without a legitimate government, there was no clear direction for those above and below, and the country was bound to disintegrate. In order to promote national unity, it was necessary to build a legitimate central government. Third, at that time, the country was in a chaotic situation and the people's interests were not guaranteed. In order to relieve the people's suffering, it was also necessary to organize a government with the people's interests as the premise. Fourth, the Beijing government destroyed the covenant law, and the foundation for the existence of the Republic of China was shaken. In order to consolidate the foundation of the Republic of China, it was even more important to combine a legitimate central government. The Premier said in his inauguration oath at that time, "I swear to devote my efforts and sincerity to save the Republic of China, remove obstacles, promote unity, and consolidate the foundation of the republic." These few words are the reasons for the establishment of the Revolutionary Government that day. Second, from the external aspect, at that time, the Beijing government borrowed heavily from foreign countries, harming the interests of the country. If we did not reorganize a legitimate central government, we would not be able to stop their illegal actions and cut off their relationship with foreigners, so as to guarantee the interests of the country. Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Government on that day, the Beijing government has also been more cautious in all its actions, and the interests of the country and the people have been guaranteed invisibly, and the revolutionary forces have gradually consolidated, and the Northern Expedition has been completed. In less than two years, the country was unified. To this day, the foundation of the government has been consolidated, but in the final analysis, it is the foundation laid down sixteen years ago today. Now, when we commemorate this great anniversary, we cannot but express our infinite admiration for the spirit of Premier Sun's difficult creation and the will of the comrades and compatriots to sacrifice and struggle in those years.

### Xu Baohua Escapes from Danger Yesterday

Arrives in Hangzhou for a Short Rest; Publishes Account of His Escape

[Nanjing] Xu Boyuan has escaped from danger in the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway kidnapping case. Xu Baohua also arrived in Hangzhou at 1:00 PM today and rested at the Qi family's residence in Chengtou Lane. After bandaging the wound on his leg, he reported his escape to the Security Bureau at 6:00 PM. When reporters visited, Xu personally came out to meet them, wearing a dark green silk padded robe and holding a bamboo cane. Although he had been in the bandit's den for nearly twenty days, he was in good spirits and showed no signs of exhaustion. (Special dispatch from the 5th)

[Hangzhou] Xu gave a detailed account of his escape to the reporter. A brief record is as follows: Xu said that after Mr. Xu Boyuan's escape on the 28th of last month, he himself was in the bamboo forest near Dawu Mountain. He had originally intended to take the opportunity to escape, but he was discovered by the bandits and grabbed by the hand, leaving him with no choice. That night, he was still driven into the mountain forest to rest. Later, he was escorted by three bandits through the night towards Xiaofeng and Anji counties. Afterwards, they spent their days in high mountains and dense forests, and traveled at night to avoid being searched by military police. They changed locations up to five times in a few days. The weather was constantly raining, and he was wearing a short blue cloth shirt and trousers given to him by the bandits, soaked to the bone. He was exhausted to the extreme. When walking at night, he stumbled at every step, and both his knees were injured. Sometimes he could not eat for a whole day. He encountered troops nine times while escaping at night. Six or seven times, he avoided them when he saw the flashlight beams of the troops. Two or three times, the two sides exchanged fire. Because they had been surrounded by troops, the bandits were exhausted. On the night of the 2nd, they escaped to the border of Xiaofeng and hid in a thatched shed. They had been running all day to get just one meal, and they dried their wet clothes in the shed with thatch. The shed had three doors and two rooms. At dawn, he suddenly heard the bandits in the next room talking secretly and loading their guns. At that time, he thought that he was in danger and had no choice but to resign himself to fate. Later, he heard several gunshots in the distance, which soon subsided. He went out through another door to investigate and then escaped along the original route. Wearing a bamboo hat and holding a bamboo cane, he rested against a tree because it was dark. Then he took advantage of the moonlight to continue on his way. Seeing a signpost, he realized that he had reached Pai Tou, not far from Moganshan. He hired a rickshaw to Sanqiaobu, which was already 10:00 PM. At 11:00 PM, he changed to a car to Hangzhou. Both his hands are injured. He plans to go to the hospital for recuperation tomorrow or the day after tomorrow and then report to the head office of Jin Cheng Bank in Shanghai before returning to the Beijing branch. According to Xu's reply to the reporter, he only has an elderly mother and a younger sister at home. This time, he completely relied on the troops to rescue him from danger and did not use any other methods. (Wang Daily News)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Wishing the Nation to Exert Efforts in Disaster Relief

Disasters and our country seem to be bound by an inextricable fate. Although last year was hailed as a bumper year, many places still experienced food panics. Now, the Guangdong rice shortage problem has not been completely resolved, and droughts and spring famines in Shandong, Anhui, Qinghai, Guangxi, ***, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces have been reported one after another. The disaster area in Gansu Province covers more than ten counties, and the disaster victims are hungry and have no clothes, and even fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boys and girls are still exposing their lower bodies. More than seventy counties in Shaanxi Province have been affected by the disaster, and the disaster victims mostly fill their stomachs with tree bark, roots, and stone powder. More than ninety counties in Henan Province have been affected by the disaster, with more than nine million disaster victims, some of whom are selling their wives and children to seek food. More than sixty counties in Guizhou Province have been affected by the disaster. Rivers are dry and wells are depleted. Not only is the land cracked and irrigation is difficult, but even daily drinking water for residents is difficult to obtain. More than two million disaster victims are eating tree bark and grass roots. The disaster situation in Sichuan Province is even more serious than in Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, and Guizhou provinces. The disaster area covers more than one hundred and ten counties, with more than thirty-five million disaster victims. The number of people starving to death in Chongqing alone is fifty to sixty per day. Such a serious disaster deserves serious attention.

The root cause of these disasters is due less to the weather and more to the poverty of the countryside. Today, the general farmers in our country are so poor that they are unable to improve farming techniques and prevent the occurrence of disasters. This is undeniable. Therefore, even occasional abnormal weather is bound to cause huge disasters.

The possible consequences of disasters are not only the displacement of farmers, the increasing abandonment of land, and the increasing bankruptcy of the countryside, but also the more worrying fact that the young and strong disaster victims will take risks and disrupt local security, causing the precious national defense forces to have to waste their efforts on domestic bandit suppression work, as in the past.

In the past, people often regarded disaster relief as a charitable undertaking. This is certainly true, but in today's serious national crisis, it should not be viewed as such. The current situation cannot allow our country to be陷in the quagmire of banditry again. We cannot sit idly by and watch the tens of millions of compatriots in the disaster area without food and clothing. We deeply hope that all the people of the country will regard disaster relief as the greatest obligation and do their best to raise relief funds. At the same time, we hope that the government will raise as much money as possible and use the method of labor relief to carry out water conservancy construction in the disaster area, so that the disaster victims can be relieved and disasters can be prevented.

### Friendly Atmosphere Prominent at London Banquet Celebrating Sino-British Friendship

Eden Praises China's Revival Achievements; Special Envoy Kong Receives Warm Welcome from British Government and Public

[London] After Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy of China participating in the coronation of the British King, and his delegation arrived in London, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the delegation. More than forty people were invited to participate, including key figures from Britain and France, such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, Chief Economic Advisor Leith-Ross, and former Ambassador to China Cadogan. Mr. Eden delivered a speech on the spot, praising the achievements of Chinese leader Chairman Chiang, saying that anyone with a little imagination cannot fail to be amazed by the tremendous revival of China, which is particularly welcomed by the United Kingdom because the friendship between China and the United Kingdom has a long history. Furthermore, China's ability to revive itself from the difficulties and hardships of ten years ago proves the strength of the Chinese nation's own activity and its ability to adapt to the environment. Eden also mentioned Ambassador Guo's good influence in Sino-British friendly relations and the respect of the people of London for Ambassador Guo, saying that Ambassador Guo has created a special position in London and has gained our love. Ambassador Guo said while raising his glass to celebrate with the guests: "When the Chinese art exhibition was held in London last year, all Chinese people felt proud of being Chinese, but today it is the opposite, because today the Chinese people in London almost doubt that they are not Chinese but British, because they deeply feel the lovableness of the new British king and queen, and unconsciously rejoice with the British and the people of the world." Guo also said that the Chinese congratulatory special envoy to the British king is not only the vice president of the Executive Yuan, but also the 75th generation descendant of the sage Confucius. It is especially difficult to have both beauty and participation in the grand ceremony of the British monarch's abdication by the descendants of the Chinese saint. Even Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan is not a stranger in the UK, because Chen has many friends in the British Navy. Guo also expressed his honor and gratitude for the presence of the British Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 4th)

[Nanjing] According to information from diplomatic circles, according to a telegram report from Guo Taiqi, our ambassador to the United Kingdom, Special Envoy Kong and his party are extremely welcomed by British government and public figures. Kong's actions and speeches after arriving in the UK have been published in major headlines by all British newspapers today.

[London] Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy of the Chinese government specially dispatched to attend the British King's Coronation Ceremony, and members of the Chinese delegation, are said to be traveling to France at the end of May after attending the Coronation Ceremony, and then departing from France to travel to Belgium, Italy, Germany and other countries. Members of the Chinese delegation recently met with a reporter from the Havas News Agency and gave a speech, stating: "Since the establishment of the National Government of China, political stability has been unprecedented, and all political and economic construction undertakings have been gradually promoted according to pre-planned plans, with remarkable results. China's foreign trade has therefore increased day by day, because in recent years, reforms have been implemented in the banking system, transforming the China Communications Bank and the Bank of China into national banks and adopting the same system as the Central Bank, with the result that the control and circulation of national currency has become increasingly smooth." Regarding the relationship between China and Japan, a key member of the Chinese delegation did not want to say much, only explaining the recent visit to China by the Japanese economic investigation group: "The Japanese economic investigation group, led by the president of the China Trade Association, Er Yu Rangji, director of the Yokohama Specie Bank, traveled and investigated in China for a long time, and its purpose was to investigate on the spot the possibility of developing the economic ties between China and Japan, but no negotiations were held. Even if there were occasional talks between Chinese and Japanese people during the period, they were absolutely not formal in nature. A few days after the completion of the Japanese investigation group's mission, the Chinese delegation set off for the UK. Therefore, it is still too early to understand the results of the Japanese investigation group's investigation at present. As for China, it has always been prepared to find ways to promote relations between China and Japan, but only on the basis of mutual equality between the two countries."

### London's Traffic at Risk of Complete Shutdown Amid Coronation Celebrations

Streetcar Workers' Strike Shows No Sign of Resolution; Tram Workers Express Sympathy and Assistance

[London] During this coronation celebration, no fewer than one million tourists have gathered in London from all over the world, so there is a great fear of a complete shutdown of traffic here.

Now, tram and trolleybus workers also have a tendency to join the strike to express sympathy to the public bus workers, so the traffic problem is in a precarious state. It was previously reported that after the public bus workers went on strike, both sides behind the scenes had been conducting mediation, and it was said that it would come to an end by this weekend. Now this hope has obviously become a bubble. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 5th)

It is reported that the anarchist rebels have occupied the suburbs of Barcelona and demanded that the Companys government resign and transfer power to them. The Companys government then arrested a large number of anarchist members, and the anarchist rebels entered the city and engaged in street fighting with the militias and police.

[Rome] According to an official announcement here, German Foreign Minister Neurath and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held an hour and a half of talks at the Palazzo Chigi this afternoon. The two sides' opinions were very harmonious, and a complete agreement was reached on various issues. (4th, National Maritime Telegram)

[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano recently met to reaffirm what is called the Rome-Berlin alignment. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that the exchange of views between the two sides can now be considered complete. The interests and goals of the two countries are the same, so the two governments have decided to continue to pursue harmonious policies on various major issues and will continue to work towards broader cooperation with other countries to ensure the necessary conditions for achieving greater and more stable political and economic security in Europe. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters dispatch)

[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath held talks with Foreign Minister Count Ciano this afternoon. Political figures stated that the talks between Germany and Italy this time were of a peaceful nature, and the rumors of a military alliance between the two countries are not true. After the talks are concluded, a communiqué will be issued to deny the various rumors to the outside world. As for the political axis between Germany and Italy, it is the foundation of a new European organization, which is open to all countries. Regarding the situation of the talks between Germany and Italy, people are now increasingly convinced that the two countries intend to adopt a moderate attitude. Some people believe that Italy hopes that when the League of Nations holds a temporary meeting at the end of this month, all countries will recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and therefore adopt a cautious attitude. In addition, some observers say that the purpose of the talks between Neurath and Ciano is to determine the attitude of Germany and Italy towards the current issues in Europe. The "Stampa" recently mentioned the recent plan of German Defense Minister General Blomberg to come to Italy, saying that "Germany and Italy do not intend to conclude a military alliance, but it is not appropriate to miss the opportunity at the present time, because the majority of people in European countries are now immersed in a crusading ideology." We must not delay and make mistakes because of following old ways. "In short, the era in which we live is one in which military and economic issues are the basis for peace and justice."

### Japanese Railway Workers Brewing a National Strike

Living is Difficult, Demanding Wage Increases; Labor-Management Negotiations Reportedly Reach Understanding

[Tokyo] The wage increase demand movement of the Tokyo Railway Bureau workers, which suddenly broke out yesterday, resulted in the labor side adopting sit-in tactics and conducting all-night negotiations. As of 6:00 AM on the 5th, Vice Minister of Transport Kiya had submitted to the Control Committee that (1) wage increases would be implemented before June 15, (2) the amount would be more than 5 million yen, and (3) within the possible scope of railway finances, the wishes of the workers would be accommodated. An understanding has been reached on the third condition, so the Control Committee decided to monitor the authorities' attitude in the future and ordered all members to stop occupying the bureau building at 10:00 AM. After a concrete plan is made, negotiations will be held with the authorities. (5th, Allied Press dispatch)

[Tokyo] The Workers' Committee, an organization of 200,000 employees of Japanese national railways, held a meeting in Odawara Town, Kanagawa Prefecture, on the 4th to discuss the issue of demanding wage increases due to the recent rise in prices and the difficulty of living. Those attending the meeting on that day were workers' representatives from the Shinbashi Transportation Office under the Tokyo Railway Bureau. Workers' representatives from the other seven national railway bureaus also held separate meetings on the 5th to discuss this issue. At the meeting on the 4th, there was a large gap between the amount that the railway authorities planned to increase and the workers' demand for a 30% wage increase. The workers' representatives angrily withdrew from the meeting and went to the Kyunai Club in Tokyo that day to hold a workers' congress, resolving to submit a petition and declaration to the Railway Ministry demanding wage increases, and dispatched a Control Committee member to personally hand them over to Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo. However, because the committee member was unable to meet with the Minister, the purpose was not achieved. Therefore, more than 1,000 workers united and began to fight. The attitude of the Tokyo workers is bound to affect the other workers' committees that are holding meetings across the country from the 5th. The National Railway Workers' Union actually carried out an unprecedented general strike in the autumn of Showa 4, which caused a sensation. Today, eight years later, a labor dispute has occurred again due to rising prices. The future development of the situation is not optimistic. (5th, Allied Press dispatch)

### Improving Treatment of Japanese Army Workers

[Tokyo] The army authorities are the first to increase the wages of workers in government-owned industries, setting a model for treating workers favorably. This time, specific plans for revising regulations regarding limiting working hours, education, treatment, etc., will be implemented within days. The living conditions of the 100,000 army workers will be greatly improved in both material and spiritual aspects through the revision of these regulations, and the quality and skills of each worker can be improved. As a result, it is expected that productivity will increase, and in the event of an emergency, the genuine ability of the national army will be displayed as the backbone. The army's intentions are quite noteworthy. (5th, Allied Press dispatch)

### More Than 100 Generals, Including Hishikari, Enlisted in the Reserves

[Tokyo] The Army Ministry announced an official appointment on the 5th, stating that General Takashi Hishikari and 144 other reserve army generals were enlisted in the rear service on the 1st of last month. (5th, Allied Press dispatch)

### Fujian Merchants Refuse to Sell Smuggled Goods Movement

Fuzhou Silk Industry in Extreme Decline; Nine Stores Determine Not to Sell Inferior Goods

Fuzhou Correspondence: A certain country's rayon-woven silks are recently being transported by a trading company established by Taiwanese people and sold at low prices in the Fuzhou market, greatly affecting domestically produced genuine silk fabrics. It is found that before the 20th year of the Republic of China, there were a total of 107 silk and cloth stores in Fuzhou, with a turnover of nearly 10 million yuan. Over the years, due to the drastic drop in prices and the decline in business, in addition to those that have closed down, there are only 52 stores left. Among them, they are divided into two factions: those who have joined the trade association and those who have not. Last year, the total turnover of silk and cloth in the city was 6 million yuan. In addition to the 2.7 million yuan accounted for by the members of the Silk and Cloth Trade Association, smuggled goods, wholesale sales by foreign merchants, stores that have not joined the association, and peddlers accounted for as much as 3.3 million yuan. Judging from the current situation, this year's sales of rayon products will definitely be higher than last year, and the sales of domestically produced silk fabrics will definitely be lower than last year. Currently, stores that have not joined the association sell smuggled goods entirely. Although they have joined the Silk and Cloth Trade Association, many stores are driven by profit and blatantly disregard the association's sanctions, selling smuggled goods. For example, Hwa Shing, Shin Lung, Kwang Hwa, and Jen Kee in Nantai, and Qian Chang, Hsieh Tai, Wu Kwang, and Hsiang Sheng in the city are all well-known silk and cloth stores that have joined the trade association and are all selling rayon products on a large scale. In addition to selling in the city, they are also transporting them to various counties in eastern and northern Fujian for sale. The reason is that the tariff on rayon fabrics produced by a certain country is low, and the cost is very light. If they are smuggled, the cost is even lighter. The price difference with domestically produced products is huge, so they are very easy to sell in the market. In recent months, they have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, spreading throughout the interior. Because of the severe social attacks, the nine silk and cloth stores Yun Chang, Ta Sheng, Ping An, Shin Chi Chun, Shin Chieh Fu, Tung Fu, Chieh Fu, Tung Chang, and Chao Hsin on Taijiang Road jointly issued a declaration, stating that they will refuse to sell smuggled and inferior goods to fulfill the patriotic duty of merchants. At the same time, the National Goods Promotion Association also sent a letter to the nine stores, urging them, saying, "Smuggled goods undermine the national economy and hinder the promotion of national goods. All of our countrymen should strictly refuse them in order to resist strong powers and uphold righteousness. We have learned that your store has publicly declared that it has unanimously banned such goods with other stores on this road, and we deeply admire your patriotic enthusiasm. The members of this association have always believed that if we want the nation not to decline, we must start with merchants not declining. Your actions are truly commendable and can be a model for all industries. We hope that in the future, you can take it a step further and specialize in national goods. We sincerely offer our encouragement and hope that you will follow this advice." The Silk and Cloth Trade Association also plans to advise all members of the trade to stop selling smuggled goods and rayon products in order to jointly save the crisis of the Silk and Cloth industry. It is not known whether it will succeed.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Fengtai

The Station Has a Japanese Military Police Unit; There is Also a Japanese Barracks West of the Station; Residents are Uneasy Due to Constant Drills; Koreans Roam Around Everywhere

Beijing Correspondence: Fengtai is 18 li from Beijing and occupies an important position in transportation. After the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese garrison troops was resolved through negotiations last year, our troops moved to the south of the railway. Military organs such as the battalion headquarters and company headquarters were also withdrawn. Only the 5th Detachment of Military Police Inspectors of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters remained. The Japanese troops have repeatedly asked the detachment to move out of the town, but the person in charge of the detachment has repeatedly stated that it has not yet been moved. The reporter went to Fengtai for business the other day, and after talking to local related personnel, he learned about the recent situation in the area, which is described as follows:

After our troops moved to Fengtai, Japanese soldiers with guns patrolled the town, and Japanese soldiers also inspected the station platform. After repeated negotiations, the Japanese soldiers on duty in the town have now been withdrawn, and no Japanese soldiers are seen inspecting the station. However, there is a Japanese military police unit at the station and a Japanese barracks west of the station. The Japanese flag is raised high every day. Those who have not been to Fengtai do not know to whom the place belongs. It is heartbreaking and unbearable to witness. Although the Japanese soldiers on duty have been withdrawn and their attitude is not as barbaric as before, drills are conducted at any time, regardless of the time or location. In recent months, every night, there have been dozens or scores of people, either going to the station or in the town, practicing machine gun shooting. Residents are startled several times a night and mostly close their doors at night. After 9:00 PM, there are hardly any pedestrians on the streets. Sometimes, the Japanese troops fire dozens of blank shots. When our officials questioned them, they said that it was just a drill. There are about a thousand Japanese soldiers stationed in the area. Because the barracks have not yet been added, they have not been increased. However, Koreans are everywhere, totaling more than 400 people. Almost all the inns and residences are inhabited by Koreans. Their task is to observe all our actions and to conduct illegal business in Fengtai. Behind Fengtai Main Street, there is a Wu Feng Theater, which is set up by Koreans and built with straw sheds. They invite lower-level actors to perform old dramas every day. Each person is given a ticket worth 10 cents, which can be used to enter the theater. However, you must first buy a ticket outside the door before you can enter. The door of the theater is no more than five feet wide, and Koreans guard the door. Those without tickets are refused entry. Most of the people who watch the drama are local ruffians. The authorities have already understood this situation and believe that the theater is built with straw sheds, which is prone to fire and can also hide traitors. In order to maintain security, it has been decided to ban it, which will be implemented in the shortest time. In addition, when Japanese soldiers are drilling, the melons or sorghum planted on the people's land are often trampled and destroyed. The people cannot bear the disturbance and have submitted petitions to the authorities, requesting negotiations to stop it. It is reported that this petition has been submitted seventeen or eighteen times. The responsible authorities in the area have asked the Japanese army headquarters stationed in Fengtai to pay attention and stated that our country is an agricultural country and farmers should be protected, hoping that such actions will not happen again to avoid harming the people's lives.

### Jiangxi Province Divides Areas to Suppress Remnants of Bandits

Two Commissioners are Sent to Each Area to Supervise the Suppression of Bandits by Various Local Defense Forces

Nanchang Correspondence: After the banditry in Jiangxi Province was quelled, there are still scattered bandits lurking in the deep mountains and appearing in remote areas to pursue their old tricks of arson, murder, and robbery. The central government established the Fourth Border Area Director in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the Provincial Border Area Director in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border area to unify the complex task of suppressing bandits in order to avoid them fleeing from one area to another. The scattered bandits in various places are to be cleared by the local security command forces and police forces. It is learned that in the eight administrative districts of the province, such as Wuning, Tonggu, and Xiushui in the first district, there are still hundreds of remnants of the bandit Yan Tugie and Chuan Qiutao rampaging everywhere. In the second district, such as Pingxiang, Yichun, Wanzai, Fenyi, and Shanggao, there are also scattered bandits echoing the bandits in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border area. Ninggang, Yongxin, Lianhua, and Anfu in the third district were deeply bandit-infested in the past. Anfu County Magistrate Zhu Mengzhen died for the country in March. Xinfeng, Xunwu, Anyuan, and Sannan in the fourth district were previously occupied by the bandit Ye Jianying, and there are still remnants scattered. Fuliang, Wuyuan, De'an, and Leping in the fifth district are bandit areas on the border of the four provinces. More than a dozen Leping road police officers were killed by bandits. Hengfeng, Qianshan, Yiyang, Shangrao, and Guangfeng in the seventh district are included in the four-province suppression area. Guangze and Lichuan in the seventh district were once frequented by the bandit Huang Dao. In the eighth district, the bandit roots at the junction of Huichang and Yudu have not been completely eradicated. None of the above districts lack large-scale bandits who can confront the army, but their actions are erratic, which disturbs public order, and they should be suppressed as soon as possible to avoid causing disturbances. Therefore, the provincial government has decided to send two suppression supervisory commissioners to each administrative district to go to the bandit areas, and the district security commander will supervise the local defense forces to focus all their efforts on the suppression work. At the same time, they will supervise the local government to improve the Baojia organization, strictly check household registration, pay attention to disaster relief for farmers, the protection of self-renewal, and the recruitment of refugees, so that production can be restored and people can live in peace and industry.

### Suzhou Water Police Arrest Scrap Metal Buyers

Scrap Metal Intended to Assist Foreigners: Hu Huanghe and Others Arrested

Suzhou Dispatch: Hu Huanghe, who runs a general store outside Panmen, Suzhou, was entrusted by others to secretly purchase a large amount of scrap metal, along with Qi Yunjie, Li Guantai (also known as Li Xiaosizi), Wu Hongren, and others, intending to transport it to Shanghai, where it would be resold to a certain party for the purpose of manufacturing armaments. It is rumored that a central agency for purchasing scrap metal is located in Shanghai. The matter was discovered by the First District Detective Team of the Water Police, who dispatched detectives to successively arrest Hu Huanghe, Qi Yunjie, Li Guantai, and Wu Hongren at locations including Nantongzimen outside Liumen and the Hexing Coal Depot outside Jinmen. They also seized approximately five to six hundred dan of scrap metal and lead. The suspects and the confiscated scrap metal were handed over to the Jia headman for safekeeping. On the 5th, the suspects were handed over to the district office. The interrogation is currently underway. District Chief Ke, believing that the suspects bought scrap metal to assist foreigners, has ordered them to be transferred to the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Office for interrogation.

The South Bank Wharf suffered significant damage. One of the plum blossom piles in front has already been washed away, and the remaining one is likely to be destroyed as well. Cracks of about two inches have been discovered on the pontoon bridge and the main body of the wharf, creating a dangerous situation. The Xiaoshan Qianjiang Ferry Office has reported this and requested funds for repairs.

The Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, in order to find ways to prevent and control them, specially sent inspectors Zhu Hongmei and Cui Botang from the Provincial Entomology Bureau to Shaoxing yesterday to conduct field surveys in places such as outside Wuyunmen. If many *Erysiphe graminis* DC. fungus diseases are found, such as barley *Erysiphe graminis* DC. fungus disease, will spread most severely and will cause reduced activation, wheat loose smut disease, too, is very common, and the kernels will all turn into black powder. Dry and dead stalks disease can also cause this disease to be unable to ear. The specimens of these diseased wheat stalks have been collected and brought back for research.

### Gleanings from the Yunnan Journey (7)

— Bejuan

Day 15 (April 19): This morning, we left Zhijiang along the upper reaches of the Yuan River (Wu River) and arrived at Huaihua County, which is the protruding part of Xiang Province. The area is inhabited by both Han and Miao people, and there is little production. The county has a population of over 94,000. Chairman He Yunqiao saw us off to this place. Some members of the group requested Mr. He to inscribe words in their booklets as a souvenir. He found a writing brush from the school after a long search. He also requested a scroll from Mr. He Sui and Mr. Zheng Yue, and another piece of calligraphy from Mr. Tong Xingbai. After Mr. He and Group Leader Chu Minyi performed a set of boxing and swordplay each in Yuanling, the people of western Hunan were extremely excited, saying that the officials from the capital today were very close to the people, which was a pleasant surprise. The highways in Hunan Province are fewer than those in Jiangxi Province but more important, so there is a monthly surplus. Many trees are planted along the roads. Hunan Province's civil training is best done with the team training which is the most spirited, so the people feel that they do not need an army, and the teams have the ability to defend against bandits on their own. This is the consolidation of local revival. At 12:15 PM, we left Huaihua and followed the Wu River to Dianyu Fort, which is the border between Hunan and Guizhou. We first entered Yuping County, Guizhou Province, with a population of over 20,000, 70% of whom are Miao people. Commissioner Hua Guang of Yuping, which produces reeds, gifted each of us a pair. The flutes are male and female and produce different sounds. After another 25 kilometers, we arrived at Qingxi, which has a population of over 16,000. After another 20 kilometers, we arrived at Sansui, which has a population of over 74,000. There is an American church and a young American missionary, who wears Chinese clothes and lives in the county. The Miao people of Sansui are fond of "lusheng" music. A band came out to welcome us, with each person playing a lusheng ranging from three feet long to twelve feet long, arranged in order. The sound of the lusheng is tragic and similar to the sound of the Mongolian bagpipes. There is also a "copper drum," which is popularly believed to be a relic of Zhuge Liang. The Miao women's dance and the rhythm of the drum are similar to the rhythm of the "blues" dance. This Miao music can also be used in Shanghai dance halls and is compatible with the beat. There is a high ground between Qingxi and Sansui, which is Honeycomb Mountain. The horizontal elevation is over 800 meters. After passing Sansui, we entered the eastern foot of the mountain in the high ground of Guizhou Province. From Gunma to the top of the mountain, there are fourteen levels of winding roads. The highest point, as measured by a barometer, is 1,110 meters (over 3,000 feet in Zhichi). The steepest point is at road marker number 287 between Hunan and Guizhou (i.e., 287 kilometers from Guiyang). We then descended the steep mountain and passed through Kuli Ping and Meizi Yan before arriving at Zhenyuan. Zhenyuan has a population of about 30,000, with fewer than 20,000 living in the county seat. There is the "Qinglong Cave" scenic spot, built in the Longqing period of the Ming Dynasty and completed in the Wanli period. The surrounding mountains are majestic, and the Wu River flows beneath it. There is a long bridge connecting the two banks. There are over ten pavilions along the cave. The Longevity Palace enshrines Yang Si (the god of water). We were divided into different parts of this famous scenic spot. Zhenyuan historically was an important town between Guizhou and Hunan. The Wu River connects to the Yuan River and Changde, which is a must-pass route by water. During the early Qing Dynasty, Wu Sangui led his troops with 3,000 ships along the Wu River to Changde, claiming that he would arrive in three days, but now it takes five days even when the water is fast (upstream, it is indefinite for one or two months). During the Protection War in the sixth year of the Republic of China, the generals of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan believed that Tang Jiyao, Li Liejun and others had held meetings here and that over 300,000 soldiers had passed through. Therefore, the number of households in the town was 5,000. During the warlord infighting in the fifteenth year and the passage of the Communist Party Zhu De and Mao Zedong in the seventeenth year, the population was reduced to only over 100 households. Later, some gradually returned, and there was a gradual increase in sojourners from Sichuan and Hunan, bringing the total to 1,900 households. The troops of Yueh-He (He Long) passed through Qingxi westward two years ago and did not enter Zhenyuan, so it was not devastated. Zhenyuan has a Catholic and a Jesus Church each, eight or nine German and American expatriates, and five Muslim families. Wang Zengshan, a member of our group and a legislator, mentioned that he is a Muslim who studied in Constantinople for five years. He still practices Islam and finds it inconvenient to eat with the others. Mr. Wang is from Linqing, Shandong, and has lived in Beijing for a long time. Muslims in various places know his name, so co-religionists in various places came to visit and give him fruits and snacks. Mr. Wang did not keep them for himself but gave them to the cooperative in the same car for everyone to enjoy. This is also a commendable thing. The scenery of Zhenyuan is beautiful, and we originally planned to stay for another day.

Day 16 (April 20): In Zhenyuan, this day happened to be Mr. He Sui's fiftieth birthday. Mr. He has traveled all over the world, and his knowledge and cultivation are admired by all. Therefore, sixteen people in the car set up a banquet in a small Sichuan restaurant in the street to celebrate. Mr. He improvised over a dozen paintings to repay everyone. Mr. Cheng Jian, a consultant to the Hunan government, also joined the banquet. Mr. Cheng was also a member of the group and had helped Chairman He Yunqiao take care of things in Hunan, so he knew many members of the group. In the afternoon, everyone bought a boat to travel on the Wu River. Some attended the welcome meeting from all walks of life to watch the Miao dance. After the dance, Group Leader Chu kicked a shuttlecock for about ten minutes, which greatly pleased the residents. Zhenyuan had never seen a movie before. Car number 18 in our group is the New Life Propaganda Team of the Lishi Society, which carries a movie projector. All sectors asked for a screening to broaden their horizons. The movie car had already shown movies six or seven times along the way in Jiangxi and Hunan. This was the first time after entering Guizhou. That night, there was a sudden heavy rain, and the performance was interrupted halfway through. Today is the sixteenth day of our journey, and the people and cars are safe and sound. Car number 14, the vegetable oil car, is driven by Mr. Zhang Shiwang. Peanut oil is used between Beijing and Wuwei, rapeseed oil between Xuancheng and Jingdezhen, camellia oil between Jingdezhen and Nanchang, and cottonseed oil between Nanchang and Changsha. Tung oil is used between Changsha and Guizhou. All of them can be used properly, and they can only reach the dining and accommodation location every day. It can be seen that the vegetable oil car test has been successful. I would like to tell the future shareholders of China's automobile manufacturing plants that they can invest with confidence. However, vegetable oil cars are equipped with diesel engines and cost more than 6,000 yuan, which is almost twice as expensive as gasoline cars. Moreover, the average price of vegetable oil on the road is 1.7 yuan per gallon, which is three or four times more expensive than diesel (diesel is 0.27 yuan per gallon). This is not cost-effective in peacetime, but it can be relied on without fear when imported goods are cut off in times of emergency. (It is estimated that 150 gallons of oil will be used for the 3,000 kilometers between Beijing and Yunnan.)

### Revolutionary Government Established

City Party Headquarters Convened General Assembly Yesterday Morning; All Agencies and Organizations Displayed Flags in Celebration

Yesterday (the 5th) was the 16th anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government and the assumption of office as Extraordinary Grand President by the General Manager. The City Party Headquarters commemorated the General Manager's fearless spirit by holding a memorial meeting at the headquarters' auditorium at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and ordered all sectors of the city to observe a day of remembrance. Banks and schools were closed, while government agencies continued to operate as usual. The details are as follows:

Venue Arrangement

The venue was the auditorium of the City Party Headquarters. The national flag of the party and a white cloth banner with the words "Representatives from All Sectors of Shanghai Hold a Memorial Meeting for the Establishment of the Revolutionary Government" were displayed in front of the main entrance. The national flag of the party and a portrait of the General Manager were also displayed in the center of the auditorium, with slogans pasted on both sides. The atmosphere was solemn and respectful.

Attending Representatives

Lou Zhaoding of the Navigation Administration Bureau, Qiu Hongzao of the Local Court, Yu Zhenhui of the City Farmers' Association, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Huang Kegui of the Education Association, Huang Xianggu of the French Concession Taxpayers' Association, Du Mengsen of the Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, Zhang Sheng of the Farmers and Workers' Livelihood Improvement Association, Zhu Shide of the National Goods Maintenance Association, Hu Shouqi of the Southern District Citizens' Association, Wang Jinqi of the Interviewing Reporter Friendship Association, Wei Yisa of the General Headquarters of the True Jesus Church, Zhao Zhenhui of the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Yu Yaoqiu of the Binshan Fellow Villagers' Association, and over 200 representatives from Minli Girls' High School, Wuben Girls' High School, New Asia Middle School, and various agencies and organizations attended. Chairman Jiang Huaisu, recorder Du Mengsen, master of ceremonies Zhang Hanyun, after performing the rituals, the chairman first reported.

Chairman's Report

Chairman Jiang Huaisu reported, saying that today is the anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. Some people think that May is ominous, but in fact, May is the most worthy of celebration. As the saying goes, adversity makes a nation strong. We can struggle and survive in hardship and difficulty. It is useless to be merely depressed and sad. If we are timid and do not know how to be excited, then there is no hope. May 1st is International Labor Day, a day for the world's workers to awaken, adjust their work spirit, and revitalize world industry. May 3rd is the day when the Northern Expeditionary Army clashed with the Japanese army in Jinan. Therefore, we have learned a lesson and realized that we cannot rely on foreign aid. May 4th is the day to overthrow national traitors and demand national liberation. May 5th is the anniversary of the General Manager's assumption of office as Grand President and the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. At that time, the European War had just ended, and various countries advocated co-managing China. The General Manager, seeing that crises were lurking everywhere, believed that if he did not take this action, China would be in danger of losing its sovereignty. May 7th and May 9th are both national humiliation days. What we are striving for now is also to eliminate shame. May 30th is the anniversary of the tragic incident that occurred in this city. This action is the resistance of the Chinese people to foreign oppression. Looking back on the May anniversaries, they are all beneficial to the nation. Sixteen years after the General Manager assumed office as President in Guangdong, China has reached such a state. Today we commemorate May 5th with the concerted efforts of the whole country, continue the General Manager's fearless spirit, and take on the responsibility of saving the world.

Slogans

1. The establishment of the Revolutionary Government is the day the Chinese people see the light again. 2. The General Manager assumed the post of President to reorganize the revolutionary front. 3. Commemorate May 5th and use the General Manager's fearless spirit to eliminate all evil forces. 4. Commemorate May 5th and complete the General Manager's unfinished legacy. 5. Commemorate May 5th and eradicate the Red Peril. 6. Commemorate May 5th and support unification. 7. Long live the Three Principles of the People. 8. Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party. 9. Long live the Republic of China.

### Three Labor Strikes Resolved; Work Resumed Yesterday

Yunfei... Jinxin... Tannery

Yunfei Drivers: According to *Xin Sheng News*, after the American Yunfei Automobile Company drivers' strike, the Social Affairs Bureau approved the dismissal of Zhang Daxin, Wang Gendi, Zhou Abing, and six others. Liu Zhigang, Zhu Weichang, and Wang Jiaan, the standing directors of the Automobile Drivers' Union, advised the workers to follow the orders of the party and government agencies and resume work. All the workers accepted the advice and went to the headquarters of the Daxi Road Company at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, led by the standing directors of the union, and resumed work. The company's taxis fully resumed operations at around 8:00 AM.

Jinxin Workers: According to *Dagong News*, the Jinxin Silk Factory on Yangshupu Road in eastern Shanghai has more than 400 workers. Previously, due to demands for improved treatment, a strike occurred, and the employer dismissed 13 workers, including He Yao. Subsequently, regarding the silk weaving strike, the Social Affairs Bureau ruled that wages should be increased by 10% across the board and ordered the workers to resume work. The factory workers also obeyed the order and resumed work, but the factory refused to allow those who had been dismissed to enter the factory, resulting in the failure to resume work and a stalemate in the strike. The matter has not been resolved until recently. Recently, the case was jointly decided by party and government agencies. Among the 13 dismissed people, except for the five people including Lou Zongfang who were allowed to be dismissed, the other eight people including He Yao were allowed to return to work. The Social Affairs Bureau separately ordered both parties to comply. After the instruction was issued, both labor and management expressed dissatisfaction. Zhou Xuexiang, the acting chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, convened a general meeting of the workers and earnestly persuaded them. The workers then expressed their acceptance and negotiated with the employer for a resolution. Now all the workers have decided to resume work this morning, and the factory has also opened on time. The dispute has been completely resolved.

Tannery Workers: According to *Dagong News*, there are more than 40 tannery workshops and more than 2,000 workers in the area of Taiyangmiao in Zhabei in this city. Recently, because the workers planned to organize a trade union to seek unity, workers were successively dismissed, reaching over 100. The remaining workers expressed dissatisfaction and went on strike at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday. Subsequently, Zhou Qigui, a member of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Xin Zha Sub-bureau, which is in charge of the area, implemented mediation. Eight measures were formulated and announced for reconciliation. All workers resumed work as usual starting yesterday morning.

### Cheng Jingsheng Flew Back to Shanghai Yesterday

Discussing Measures to Relieve the Guizhou Disaster

Cheng Jingsheng, a member of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, was previously dispatched by the Executive Yuan to Guizhou Province to oversee relief efforts. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Chongqing and will proceed to Nanjing immediately to report on his mission. He provided a detailed account of the disaster situation in Guizhou Province and the planned relief measures, which are summarized below:

Serious Disaster Situation: Guizhou Province is entirely mountainous, with barren land and limited agricultural production. In good years, there is barely enough food to eat. Water conservancy is nonexistent. Except for the Wu River, Qing River, and Pan River, which provide some irrigation, the province relies entirely on rainfall. However, there has been a continuous drought for five years. Recently, there has been no rain for three months, and the spring harvest is hopeless. The majority of the disaster victims are digging up and eating fern roots, tree bark, and "Guan Yin flour" (a type of starchy food). Their faces are pale, and they are barely clothed. Young women use broken Shen pine needles to make skirts to cover their waists. When asked questions, they are breathless, with tears streaming down their faces. The situation is too terrible to describe. There are also disaster victims who carry fern roots and crawl over a hundred miles to find work. If they run out of fern roots halfway, they simply collapse and die.

Disaster Victim Statistics: Seventy-four counties in the province have been affected by the disaster. After excluding twelve counties with minor damage, there are still sixty-three counties in urgent need of relief and rehabilitation. Among these, Chishui, Bo, Zunyi, Yang, Tongzi, Renhuai, Guiyang, Anshun, and twenty-one other counties are the most urgent. The total number of disaster victims is 2,721,276, which accounts for 30% of the province's population of nine million.

Emergency Relief Measures: (A) Relief Distribution: To meet the needs of the disaster-stricken counties, while taking into account the resources of the central government and society, it has been decided to first use 200,076.9 yuan converted from public bonds previously allocated by the central government to purchase 14,000 dan of rice in Zhijiang, Hunan, and transport it to Guizhou for distribution in the counties with the most severe food shortages. Soup kitchens will be established in Guiyang, Zunyi, and Anshun, where disaster victims are gathering. (B) Emergency Relief: Emergency relief will also be implemented immediately, with strict investigations to ensure that aid is given to those who need it most, saving lives and not supporting poverty. The Provincial Relief Committee will follow the central Relief Committee's procedures for emergency relief in the twenty-one severely affected counties. The minimum budget for this emergency relief is 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. The central government has now allocated 300,000 yuan in two installments for emergency relief, leaving a shortfall of half the required amount. It is urgent to continue requesting funds and to solicit donations from the public. (C) Agricultural Relief: Farmers in the province are unable to survive. In the Huangping County area, tens of thousands of farm cattle have been sold out of the province. Farm cattle are the only lifeline for farming families. Without cattle, their lives are over. It is planned to allocate a small portion of the emergency relief funds to purchase seeds locally and distribute them for replanting.

Planned Public Works Relief: The Wu River, Pan River, and Qing River in the province are the only sources of drought prevention water. However, their estuaries are silted up, and their effectiveness is minimal. Terraced fields are located on mountains thousands of feet high. Without ponds and dams to store water, even if there is rainfall, mountain floods cannot be retained, and irrigation is difficult to implement. It is planned to use a small amount of relief funds to build ponds and wells extensively. It is estimated that this will require at least 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, including labor contributions.

Centralized Relief Efforts: The province has now concentrated its efforts, with Chairman Gu leading the entire provincial government and local gentry in carrying out relief work. The Provincial Relief Committee has been expanded. Chairman Gu concurrently serves as the chairman, Civil Affairs Director Cao Jingyuan as the director of the General Affairs Group, former Chairman Zhou Gongshou as the director of the Relief Group, Finance Director Wang Zhengying as the director of the Fundraising Group, Construction Director Wu Jiawei as the director of the Public Works Relief Group, and former Standing Committee member Tang Xingsi as the director of the Audit Group. Acting Chairman Han Deqin, Secretary-General Yan Changwu, Party Committee member Huang Guozhen, Education Director Zhang Zhihan, Headquarters Chief of Staff Yu Huamu, and gentry members He Yushu and Wang Mo, along with twenty-one other members, are responsible for handling the relief work. The inaugural meeting was held on the first of this month.

Rainfall Situation: There was no rain in the province in March. However, on October 20, the night Cheng Jingsheng arrived in Guiyang, there was thunder and lightning, and heavy rain poured down. It continued to rain for a week without clearing. Although the spring harvest is hopeless in eastern and northern Guizhou, summer corn can be replanted. However, disaster victims are struggling to find food, and there are no seeds. Therefore, agricultural relief is also extremely necessary. However, there has been no rain in western Guizhou, along the route to Yunnan, and in southern Guizhou. The disaster situation is severe.

### The Coal Industry Association Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Transfer of the Liujiang Mine

Resolved to Telegraph the Executive Yuan and Relevant Ministries to Stop the Transfer

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association learned that the Huashang Liujiang Coal Mining Company had decided at a board meeting to reluctantly transfer the property rights of its Heishan Yao Coal Mine and railway to the Taiji Company. The association believed that this was a matter of national importance and held an emergency meeting at its headquarters on Tianjin Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. All executive committee members were present. Chairman Pan Yisan first reported on the encroachment of the company's Heishan Yao Mine and the national implications of the transfer. They then discussed measures to prevent the transfer. As a result, they immediately telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, requesting them to stop the transfer of the Liujiang Coal Mine to Taiji to protect national enterprises. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Overseas Chinese Youth Aviators Xu Qixing and Chen Yian from Java Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Flying Their "Java Travels to China" Airplane

They Said They Enjoyed Flying Back to Their Motherland for Sightseeing

Xu Qixing and Chen Yian, two young overseas Chinese aviators from Java, arrived in Shanghai yesterday as part of a long-distance aviation trip to sightsee in their motherland. They departed from Batavia on the 28th of last month, passing through Singapore and other places, and arrived in Hong Kong on the 3rd of this month. After staying in Hong Kong for two days, they flew to Shanghai yesterday morning, arriving at Longhua Airport at 4:05 PM. A large crowd welcomed them. The two plan to stay in Shanghai for a short time before traveling to Nanjing for sightseeing. Details are as follows:

Welcoming Party: Those who went to Longhua Airport to welcome them yesterday included the Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, G.W. Boissevain, Deputy Consul H. Riemens, Consul Yang Lianshan, Java Mailboat Company Deputy Manager G.C. Mann, Longhua Airport Station Manager Li Jianghua, Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau representatives Hou Can and Liu Zhuchu, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Shanqing, Mr. and Mrs. Ding Wushi, Jing Qiankun, Yang Zhisheng, Lv Weifan, and other overseas Chinese and Dutch residents in Shanghai, as well as friends of Xu and Chen, totaling more than forty people.

Arrival in Shanghai: The "Java Travels to China" small private plane, piloted by Xu Qixing and Chen Yian, arrived at Longhua Airport at 4:10 PM yesterday. The plane was not very large, so its ascent and descent were very agile. At about 4:08 PM, a roaring sound was heard in the sky. In less than two minutes, a beautiful small blue and white plane was seen landing on the grass. It did not circle in the air and landed very quickly, showing Xu's skilled technique. After landing, the plane slowly moved to the end of the station and stopped. Zhang Shanqing, the daughter of Song Faxiang, our Consul-General in Batavia, and Mrs. Ding Wushi, an employee of China Aviation Corporation, went to the front of the plane to present flowers. Xu and Chen smiled and thanked them. They then got off the plane and shook hands with Chinese and foreign people to express their gratitude. They then went to the China Aviation Corporation station for a short rest before taking a car to the International Hotel to stay. The plane is a monoplane with twin engines, similar in size to ordinary mail planes. However, it is beautifully painted in striking silver and dark blue. The fuselage has the letters W2Walraven and PP.K.KKH, and the tail has the words "Java Travels to China". The plane is currently temporarily stored in the China Aviation Corporation hangar at Longhua Airport.

Xu and Chen's Conversation: Xu Qixing and Chen Yian, the two young aviators, spoke with the welcoming party next to the plane with smiles on their faces amidst the cheers. According to a reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency, they said that they grew up overseas and this was their first time returning to their motherland. Therefore, they specially flew back to their motherland in this plane for sightseeing and to observe the construction and scenic spots. After taking off from Batavia and arriving in Hong Kong, they originally planned to fly to Shanghai yesterday (the 4th). However, they stayed in Hong Kong for a while due to business and were unable to make the trip. They started at 7:50 AM this morning (the 5th) from Hong Kong, without stopping along the way, and landed in Fuzhou at 12:00 PM to refuel and have lunch. At 12:30 PM, they flew directly from Fuzhou to Shanghai. Because the weather was bad today, the flight was slower. If the weather was good, they could have arrived here at 2:30 PM. The reporter then asked about their future plans and impressions of returning to the country. Chen Yian said that they had always missed their motherland and were happy to be back in the embrace of their motherland. After arriving in Hong Kong, they only landed in Fuzhou, and did not visit other places, so they could not say much about them. However, from the plane, they saw that the places they passed were mostly beautiful, which was very gratifying. After arriving in Shanghai, they plan to stay for a few days before going to Nanjing for sightseeing. As for whether they will tour the whole country, it will be decided in the next few days. They are very grateful for the warm welcome they received in Shanghai.

Brief Biographies of the Two: The reporter investigated the brief biographies of the two overseas Chinese young aviators as follows: (1) Xu Qixing is 29 years old, married, and grew up in Java. He is the son of a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman. His father runs a catering business and has established large-scale companies in the Netherlands and Java, called Melbabcn in Dutch. The capital is very strong and the profits are high. It is the largest store in the Netherlands. Xu graduated from the Dutch Indian Aviation Club in 1931 and is very familiar with flying techniques. Because his family has been doing business in the Netherlands for three generations, he obtained a special permit from the government to fly his own plane to various places. Therefore, his skills have improved over the years. (2) Chen Yian is 24 years old, unmarried. According to Chen, his parents are also in business in Java, and he just graduated from a British aviation school. Therefore, he has not yet decided on his future career. However, he is very interested in flying and also grew up in Java. The reporter saw Xu and Chen at the airport yesterday. They were both strong, with dark red skin, and were short, stocky, and full of energy. It was also learned that Xu's wife also came to the motherland with him, but the plane only has two seats, so she may travel by ship.

### Shanghai Customs' Negotiation with Japan Delayed Without Reply

This Municipality Seized Smuggled Copper Coins – Over 14,000 Catties

Regarding the incident of Japanese ruffians assaulting customs officers, the Shanghai Customs Office filed a protest with the Japanese Consulate-General last week, along with five demands. The Japanese side has yet to respond. According to a senior official at the Shanghai Customs Office, Customs Commissioner Robert L. Smyth lodged a protest with Yoshioka, the Acting Consul-General of Japan in Shanghai, last Tuesday. The Japanese side has been using the excuse of consulting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo for nine days, but has still not responded. Customs officers have held repeated informal meetings, but have yet to come up with any concrete and effective solutions. The main reason is that the Shanghai Municipal Council police cannot enter the Yuihisan Wharf, leaving the customs officers without protection and often assaulted by Japanese ruffians. Armed anti-smuggling cannot be effectively carried out. The three customs officers who were assaulted have not yet recovered. The smuggled copper coins seized by the Shanghai Customs Office, excluding those taken away by the Japanese Consulate, have reached over 140 dans, totaling more than 14,000 catties. There is also a large amount of other miscellaneous goods.

### The Food Transportation and Marketing Bureau Hosted the Press Last Night

Zheng Baozhao Reported on the Work Situation

The Food Transportation and Marketing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, established in Shanghai last winter, first began investigating the production and sales of food nationwide. Parts of it have already been completed, and unified methods are being planned to regulate the people's food supply. The Bureau, in order to make all sectors understand the significance of the Bureau's establishment and the situation of the work, specially hosted the local press at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge last night. During the event, Director Zheng Baozhao gave a speech, stating that the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of the four ministries of industry, internal affairs, transportation, and railways, as well as the Rural Reconstruction Committee, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. They drafted a provisional organizational charter for the Food Transportation and Marketing Bureau, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation and approval. It was also instructed that all items in the charter be promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Finance. At that time, the Ministry of Finance immediately began preparations, and in April of the 24th year, the Executive Yuan revised and approved the organizational charter of the Bureau. On November 25th of the 25th year, the Bureau began operations in Shanghai. The Bureau's responsibility is to manage the nation's food supply and to regulate surpluses and shortages. Therefore, after the establishment of the Bureau, it first prepared a general outline of the work plan and listed investigation as the basic work. Without accurate statistics, it would be difficult to know the surpluses and shortages, and it would be difficult to adjust the plan. Even if there was a basis, it would still be difficult to conform to the facts. The Bureau paid special attention to this point and successively dispatched experts to various provinces for on-site investigations. Those that have been completed are Guangdong, Fujian, Anhui, and Hunan. Those under investigation are Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Personnel are also stationed in Guangzhou, Jiaohu, Changsha, and Tianjin to study changes in the market prices of rice, wheat, and flour, and to seek stabilization measures. Other provinces and cities are also preparing investigation methods and will dispatch personnel for investigation in the near future, in order to complete the nationwide food transportation and marketing situation investigation in the shortest possible time and create an entire plan. Then there will be a basis for engaging in other work. The Anhui Provincial Department of Finance and Construction, in order to increase the transportation and marketing of national rice, plans to organize an inspection delegation to visit Guangdong Province. It has been agreed with Jiangxi and Hunan provinces that a meeting will be held in Anqing on the morning of May 1st. The Bureau reported and was approved by the Ministry of Finance to send Transportation Section Chief Hong Ruitao and Investigation Section Chief Lin Xichun to participate, and put forward two points of view: "Stabilizing Rice Prices" and "Improving Rice Quality" for the meeting to study together. The above-mentioned points are all important matters, and I would like to report them to you. There are many other matters that cannot be listed due to time constraints, and I hope for forgiveness. In short, the Bureau is serving the country, society, and the people. All matters that should be handled within the scope of our responsibilities will be carried out in accordance with laws and regulations, the ㊀ will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, ㊁ the leaders' speeches and spirit, and ㊂ the instructions of our superiors, and we will work hard to achieve our goals, even if there are complaints and resentments, we will not refuse. However, this matter is of great importance and involves many relationships. The Bureau's colleagues have limited abilities, and there may be negligence from time to time. I hope that you will guide us at any time and provide strong assistance so that the Bureau's work can be carried out smoothly. This is not only the Bureau's good fortune, but also the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit from it. Yan Duhe then delivered a speech of thanks, stating that he was very grateful for the hospitality today. The Food Transportation and Marketing Bureau takes regulating the people's food supply and stabilizing food prices as its main purpose, which is very important for the people's livelihood. Our country is based on agriculture, but every year there is a huge import of food. Even in the event of a bumper harvest, there are no good measures, resulting in an imbalance of surpluses and shortages. What Director Zheng reported is what the people of the country are happy to hear. Mr. Zheng previously served in the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Beining railway bureaus and has made many contributions to the people's livelihood. Now that he is in this position, he will surely make many contributions to the food aspect of the people's livelihood. Mr. Zheng can be said to be a practitioner of the people's livelihood, etc. The event ended at 10:00 PM in joy.

### Statement from the Third District Silk Weavers' Union

Rumors of Detective Shooting Workers to Death are Untrue – Silk Workers from Various Districts Go to Express Their Condolences

According to the Dagong News Agency, yesterday, the news of a worker at the Hongchang Silk Weaving Factory on Connaught Road being injured by a detective was published in various newspapers.

Zhang Banxi, the business director of the Union, received the reporter and said that the reports in the newspapers were slightly different from the facts. The workers were injured by the Hongchang Factory Director, contract household etc., who threw bricks and tiles down from the roof. There was no conflict with the detectives. When the detectives arrived, the workers had already dispersed. The number of injured people was only 34. Except for Xu Lan, an employee of the Qinle Factory, whose injuries were the most severe and life-threatening and is still staying at Baolong Hospital, all others were bandaged and completely discharged from the hospital the day before yesterday afternoon.

### Korean Independence Party Member Baek Myeong-gyu Surrenders to the Japanese Consulate

The Shanghai Japanese Daily Newspaper reported that the core members of the Korean National Independence Revolutionary Party, which is active in Shanghai and Nanjing and has been monitored and searched by the Consulate General, have reached ten. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Baek Myeong-gyu, a member of the Special Task Force of the National Revolutionary Party, a group of unruly Koreans in Nanjing, suddenly came to Shanghai to surrender. According to Baek's confession, two factions within the National Revolutionary Party were locked in a standoff, with the general situation as follows: ㊀ The Yireol Corps system under Kim Won-bong advocated a communist approach. Kim established a Lenin School in Beiping, with Han Wei-jian and An Gong-quan as key members. However, the Lee Cheong-cheon faction opposed this faction, adhering to a purely nationalist stance and seeking Korean independence. ㊀ The National Revolutionary Party's movement funds were received with the assistance of a certain party and controlled by Kim Won-bong. Kim lived an exceptionally lavish life with these funds, while the Lee Cheong-cheon faction received very little, leading to dissatisfaction among the Lee faction. ㊂ The central goal of the group's movement was that all personnel dispatched to Manchuria and Korea were selected by Lee Cheong-cheon. The Kim faction opposed those isolated from the Baek faction, and the dispatch expenses were often decided unilaterally by Kim. ㊃ On July of the eleventh year of Showa (1936), they planned an anti-Japanese movement in the French Concession to destroy the Consulate General and induce the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations. There was an original oath with Kim Mu-bong to provide assistance from a certain party in exchange for a reward of fifty yuan. Therefore, all of Kim's actions were motivated by money. Baek Myeong-gyu was introduced by Cheon Li-hyang, a core member of the Hwanan Korean Youth League and the Black Terrorist Group, and entered the Yireol Corps cadre training class led by Kim Won-bong. Later, he was reassigned as a special task force member. However, due to differing ideologies between the Kim and Lee factions and Kim Won-bong's dictatorial and tyrannical rule, a major internal conflict arose. Shortly thereafter, Baek switched to the Lee faction but was monitored by the Kim faction. One day, he was imprisoned in a room and severely beaten. He took advantage of an opportunity to escape to Shanghai.

### Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries Not to Suspend Business at Will

Do Not Dismiss Workers Without Reason

Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all industry associations, stating: "Regarding the instruction No. 2829 of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party received on the 3rd of this month, which stated that the Public Letter No. 7100 of the People's Training Department of the Central Executive Committee stated, in brief, that disputes between labor and management should not be resolved by resorting to strikes or lockouts unless mediation has failed, causing harm to both labor and management. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby request your compliance. Based on this, it has been found that labor unrest has been occurring frequently in this city recently, causing harm to both labor and management.

### China Tea Company Established in Shanghai

Hires British Technician Wei Chun as Consultant

According to the Central News Agency, the China Tea Company held an inaugural meeting in Beijing, elected directors and the company's general manager, and convened the first board meeting. After passing all regulations and the company's business guidelines for the first year, the official and commercial representatives from various provinces who attended the meeting in Beijing have completed their work and left Beijing. Manager Shou Jingwei also returned to Shanghai. This morning (the 5th), he met with reporters and said that the head office is located in Shanghai, and the address has been leased and is being actively arranged. Business can begin around the 10th of the month. Branch offices will be established in various provinces. Fujian will focus on the branch office and establish a small-scale refined tea factory as an adjunct. Hubei Province will establish a factory in Hankou, focusing on the factory and attaching the branch office to it. Zhejiang and Hunan provinces will focus on tea plantations and establish a small-scale tea factory in Pingshui, Zhejiang. Other provinces such as Anhui and Jiangxi also have organizations for improving production and marketing and will cooperate with local authorities. Furthermore, to improve the technology, it was decided to jointly hire the British technician Wei Chun as a consultant with the Ministry of Industry's Central Agricultural Experimental Institute and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank. He will be telegraphed to come to China, and his term will be two years.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise

Shanghai's Rice Reserves are Approximately 200,000 Dan. Surplus Grain from Central China is Being Transported to North China for Sale.

Since the tax-free import of foreign rice from Guangdong Province was approved by the Central Government, resulting in a surplus of domestic grain, people have been in a state of panic. Since the beginning of the new year, rice prices have been falling. Therefore, various river rice merchants in the interior have stopped shipping due to heavy losses. Currently, only twenty or thirty ships from the north and south are arriving, averaging about 4,000 dan of rice transported to Shanghai per day, a decrease of six or seven tenths compared to the winter of last year. Recently, merchants involved in sales and transshipment have gradually become active, but the supply from the interior is still weak. Therefore, the city's rice reserves are limited. As a result, after entering this week, market prices have risen by three or four jiao continuously. Judging from the current situation, the price will inevitably increase further when the new crop is not yet available. It is now found that the city's rice reserves, including those of various merchants, total approximately 160,000 to 170,000 dan. Based on Shanghai's daily sales estimate, this can still maintain the people's food supply for more than a month. Now, the grain originally planned to be transported from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces to Guangdong Province for sale has been suspended due to the tax-free import of foreign rice in batches. It will be transferred to Shanghai in succession and then transshipped to Qingjin, Yan, and other places for low-price sale.

### Japanese Troops Erect Military Telephones on North Sichuan Road

### Commander Yang Hosted a Banquet for Xu Jingtang Last Night

### Difficulties in the Shipping Industry

High Commodity Prices and Steel in Excess Demand. Japanese Shipbuilding Statistics Show a New Record.

A reporter from Xinxin News visited a tycoon in the shipping industry yesterday to inquire about the difficulties in the shipping industry. It is understood that such encounters are indeed international. All shipowners in the world are suffering the same pain. The reason for this is the persistently high commodity prices. From July 1936 to January of this year, ocean freight rates increased by an average of 58%, an increase that is only one-third of that in 1920. Since February of this year, the soaring of the steel market has been the main reason for the increase in shipping costs. The demand for steel in countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Japan is endless. Judging from the needs of the past few months, there is a trend of demand exceeding supply. Even scrap iron is the same. The world's shipbuilding industry has developed exceptionally due to actual demand. According to recent statistics from the Japanese shipbuilding industry, there are currently 140 ships under construction, totaling 996,85 tons of displacement. New ships are constantly being built, and the total tonnage is enough to exceed the shipbuilding record during the war. Steel is the mainstay of ships, and the cost has increased exponentially, which is alarming. Therefore, shipowners from all over the world have successively increased freight rates in order to maintain their survival and inject capital into their businesses. However, China is an industrially backward country, and most of the materials needed by the shipping industry rely on foreign countries. At a time when international commodity prices are extremely high, the difficulties faced by China's shipping industry are hundreds of times greater than those of other countries.

### Two Criminals in Bad Check Fraud Case Sentenced

Huang Yimin, a Cantonese man, and Wang Yuqing, a Sichuan woman, who lived together in room 12 of the Jing'an Villa No. 3, Jing'an Temple Road, defrauded a gray-backed overcoat worth 342 yuan from the Hongxiang Clothing Company on Nanjing Road on February 16 of this year using a bad check from the Pudong Bank. The clothing was then pawned for money. Subsequently, the Hongxiang Company verified with the Pudong Bank that the check could not be cashed, and reported the information to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. It was not until October 27 that Chinese Detective Ma Chengmo arrested Huang Yimin and Wang Yuqing and handed them over to the First Special Court for prosecution on charges of fraud. The case had been interrogated twice and adjourned. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang sat in the Second Criminal Court to continue the hearing. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the case was adjourned because the two defendants refused to confess, and the stolen goods could not be found. When questioned, Huang and Wang gave evasive statements. Judge Pan found that Huang Yimin was a repeat offender and had recently been released from prison. Huang Yimin was sentenced to five months in prison for joint fraud, and Wang Yuqing was sentenced to three months in prison.

### Youth Forges Chiang Kai-shek's Business Card in Attempt to Obtain Official Position; Case Concluded After Interrogation

Ten Business Cards Printed, Nine Destroyed; Wu Zhenming Sentenced to Detention Pending Pronouncement of Sentence

Wu Zhenming, a native of Funing, Jiangbei, is currently 20 years old and resides at No. 8 Derun Lane, Chang'an Road, Zhabei. He is a third-year student at the Law School on Jiangwan Road in this city. On April 5th of this year, he suddenly had a whimsical idea and forged Chiang Kai-shek's business card, writing "Immediately assigned to work" and affixing the seal of "Chiang Kai-shek." He went to the municipal government to visit the acting mayor, Yu. Acting Mayor Yu discovered that the person was acting nervously and ordered the police to arrest Wu Zhenming and hand him over to the local court for interrogation. Prosecutor Wang Jiamei, after a clear investigation, filed a public prosecution in accordance with Articles 219 and 216 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Yu Lide presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. After the judge took his seat, he ordered Wu Zhenming, who was in custody, to be brought to the court. He stated that he was 20 years old and a law school student. The judge asked, "On April 5th of this year, you took a forged business card of Chiang Kai-shek, writing that you should be immediately assigned to work at the police station, and went to visit Acting Mayor Yu. Is this true?" The answer was, "Yes, it is." The judge asked, "Where did the business card stamp come from?" The answer was, "I asked a printing shop to make it." The judge asked, "How many forged business cards did you make in total?" The answer was, "Ten in total." The judge asked, "What about the other nine business cards?" The answer was, "They were burned." The judge asked, "What material was the stamp made of?" The answer was, "Wood." The judge asked, "Is the stamp still there?" The answer was, "It was burned along with the cards." The judge asked, "You took a forged business card of Chiang Kai-shek to visit Acting Mayor Yu with the intention of being assigned to work at the police station, is that correct?" The answer was, "No, that's not it. Because I had finished writing a book on improving police administration, I first submitted it to the National Government for approval. Because I hadn't received a reply for a long time, I was anxious and forged Chiang Kai-shek's name seal to see Acting Mayor Yu, asking him to recommend me to the police station to see Director Cai." At this point in the interrogation, the judge ordered Wu Zhenming to copy the text of the card in court. Prosecutor Wang Jiamei took the stand to present his arguments. Then, Lawyer Wei Weiqing rose to defend the defendant for a long time, requesting the presiding judge to consider his youth and impose a lenient punishment. The debate concluded, and the date for sentencing was set. The defendant was returned to custody to await the verdict.

### Attempted Robbery at Yang Family Residence Foiled; Thieves Descend from Skylight Using Ropes

Owner's Son Shot and Wounded by Robbers; Iron Tools Left Behind by the Gang Recovered

The residence of Chen Tingzhang, son of the late wealthy merchant Chen Guichun, at No. 188 Yang Family Residence Road, Pudong, was coveted by robbers due to the substantial inheritance he possessed. At 3:00 AM yesterday, six thieves suddenly arrived. They climbed over the bamboo fence in the northwest corner, scaled the roof, and descended into the kitchen through the skylight using ropes. Two thieves stood guard outside, while four thieves were about to enter the room to rob. When they opened the side door, the ten or so guard dogs kept by the Chen family barked wildly. Tingzhang himself lived in Puxi, so he was not at home. His eldest son, Jia Ding, who was only 21 years old, was lying down in the front hall. Hearing the noise, he knew there was a robbery and got up, grabbed a hunting rifle, and rushed out to try to capture the robbers. He fired a shot to warn them. Hearing the gunshot, the thieves panicked, suspecting an ambush. As they were about to break down the door to escape, one thief went the wrong way and ran to the front hall, where he was caught by Jia Ding. The thief had no gun, and Jia Ding was too strong for him. Jia Ding shouted for help. A thief with a gun came and, taking advantage of the close proximity of the two, fired two shots. One bullet hit Jia Ding in the left back and exited on the right side. Wounded, Jia Ding let go of the captured thief, who escaped. Jia Ding fired two more shots with the hunting rifle in pursuit. Some of the thieves appeared to be wounded. They pried open the lock of the side door and escaped. The family members immediately rushed the wounded man to Pudong Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the Pudong Police Station, which dispatched police officers to search for the robbers. But the robbers had gone far and could not be traced. The police then went to the Chen residence to inspect for clues and found four pieces of ironware, one bullet clip, one live bullet, two spent cartridges, and a fake mustache left behind by the thieves. It was learned that the thieves had all come in disguise. Fortunately, no property was stolen. The evidence was taken to the station for investigation. The bullet left in the wounded man's back was not deeply embedded and was removed with surgical forceps on the spot. After a brief dressing, he was transferred to Shanghai South Hospital in the South City for treatment. Because the injury was minor, he would soon be discharged from the hospital.

### Stolen Fountain Pen Used as Collateral for Meals

Zhang Zhiyuan Charged with Theft; Sentenced to Detention with a Two-Year Suspension of Sentence

Chen Xianjing, a 30-year-old Cantonese man engaged in the construction business, had his office on the sixth floor, room 626, of the Continental Commercial Building on Nanjing Road. At noon on the 28th of last month, he went alone to the Wufulou Restaurant across from the Great World on Minthiniyin Road in the French Concession for a meal. Because it was hot, he took off his Western-style work clothes and hung them on the wall hook. Coincidentally, Zhang Zhiyuan (27 or 28 years old, also Cantonese), who was sitting next to him, was also eating. He was dressed in a fashionable Western suit, looking like a dandy young man. The meal cost over nine jiao. Zhang had no money on him and was thinking of a way to get away. He spotted a fountain pen worth more than ten yuan in the pocket of Chen's Western-style coat hanging on the wall hook. Taking advantage of the fact that no one was paying attention, he stole Chen's fountain pen, went to the counter, and said that he had forgotten to bring his wallet and would use the fountain pen as collateral until he could get some money to redeem it. The cashier, believing Zhang's sincere words, temporarily accepted the collateral, and Zhang left. When Chen finished his meal and put on his clothes, he discovered that the fountain pen had been stolen. He questioned the waiter and argued. The cashier overheard and came forward to state that a young man in a Western suit had used the fountain pen as collateral. He showed the pen to Chen, who immediately recognized it as the stolen item. He paid one yuan to redeem the pen and left. The day before yesterday afternoon, Zhang Zhiyuan actually brought a one-yuan bill to Wufulou to redeem the fountain pen. He was detained and the police were notified. After an investigation by the detectives, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday. Judge Zhu Zhizhe interrogated him. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case and filed a charge of theft. Zhang Zhiyuan confessed that he was a student at a high school attached to a certain university in Nanjing. This time, he came to Shanghai for fun and ran out of money, so he had no choice but to resort to this plan. The court verified the confession and sentenced Zhang Zhiyuan to fifteen days of detention with a two-year suspension of sentence.

### Radio Broadcasting Association Submits Petition Regarding the Recovery of Six Radio Stations

This city banned various radio stations and ordered the Telegraph Bureau to recover them at a price. However, the estimated price was too low, which violated the intention of the Ministry of Communications. The Radio Broadcasting Association was asked to argue reasonably. Therefore, a temporary executive committee meeting was held yesterday, and it was decided to submit another petition to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The original text is as follows: "Petition for the early recovery of six radio stations at the full price. Your association was ordered by Decree No. 28831 of your bureau to notify the six radio stations, including Tongle, to negotiate the recovery of machinery and equipment at a price on the 19th. Now, according to the statements from the radio stations, their representatives went to the Telegraph Bureau on that day to negotiate. Engineers Nie, Shen, and Wang presented the estimated prices, which were unexpected. For example, No. 121 and No. 845, the vacuum tubes were originally worth more than one hundred yuan, but were estimated at only twelve or thirteen yuan. The Philips microphone was originally worth more than two hundred yuan, but was estimated at only forty yuan. The Dahua 1,500-volt electric meter was originally worth more than ninety yuan, but was estimated at only twelve yuan. Other machinery and equipment were also underestimated, which is unreasonable. Furthermore, the losses of the antenna, livelihood, and staff were all ignored. It is found that the engineers also operate wireless electrical appliance businesses and are familiar with the prices of wireless electrical appliances. It is unfair and unreasonable to recover at such a low price, disregarding the capital of merchants, and it violates the original intention of the Ministry of Communications to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants and recover at a fair price. Therefore, we read to submit to the Ministry of Communications to argue reasonably, maintain the original number, and recover at the full price as soon as possible to avoid prolonged time and increased losses. The petition is to Bao, Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau."

### Further Arrests in Jiangsu Bank Robbery and Murder Case: Two Masterminds Apprehended

"Young Master Ren" Has Already Confessed Unequivocally; Wang Abing Remains Evasive

On February 3rd of this year, at around 5:00 PM, as the Jiangsu Bank branch at 339 Xinzha Road was preparing to transfer over 7,000 yuan in cash to the head office, robbers, having prior knowledge, broke in armed. The robbers attempted to steal the cash but failed. The robbers opened fire, killing the gatekeeper Shi Jinzhi and injuring bodyguards Gu Wenlin and Jiang Ziqin, before fleeing in different directions. Subsequently, Chief Detective You A'gen and Detective Lu Gengsheng of the Laozha Police Station arrested twelve or thirteen robbers, including Chen Changfu, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, Shi Amao, and a woman named Chen Li, at locations such as 44 Xinzha Road and 520 Hart Road. They were sent to the First Special District Court, where they identified the masterminds as "Young Master Ren" (also known as Zhang Yiqing, Ren Wenhai, Ren Hanzhang, Little Ren) from Yangzhou and Wang Abing (also known as Liu Bingkun, Zhang Zhensheng) from Hubei, who were still at large. Eventually, the violent robbers Zhang Shaoqing and Zhao Jinrong were sentenced to death, and the others received prison sentences. Wang Abing and "Young Master Ren" were arrested separately in the Yangshupu Pingliang Road area and in Tianchang County, Anhui, and were repeatedly interrogated by the First Criminal Court. "Young Master Ren" was represented by volunteer lawyer Bei Yingqing. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. It was found that Ren drove the car that transported the robbers to the robbery, while Wang Abing monitored a Chinese police officer near a bridge on Wuzhen Road. Initially, he firmly denied involvement, but after repeated questioning by the court, he eventually claimed he had been fooled by someone. Wang Abing continued to offer evasive testimony. Judge Feng ordered him to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to a later date for debate.

### Pharmaceutical Industry Petitions Yesterday Regarding Difficulties in Advertising Inspections

Obstacles to Prior Submission for Inspection Have Not Been Concretely Resolved

The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association has been informed by the Municipal Health Bureau that regarding the management of Chinese and Western medicine news advertisements, it has requested the Shanghai News Inspection Bureau to designate Wednesday afternoons from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM as the time for reviewing medicine advertisements. Those wishing to advertise must submit two copies of the original advertisement to the News Inspection Bureau for review. Those who violate these rules and publish advertisements without authorization will be fined 20 yuan or more, depending on the severity of the violation, and their business license will be revoked. The association found this extremely difficult to implement and urgently convened a meeting of its executive and supervisory committee. It was decided to request the Health Bureau not to conduct prior inspections but to crack down on advertisements found to be in violation of regulations, thereby balancing legal principles, commercial interests, and both parties' concerns.

### Maid Referred by Agency Steals and Flees

Ni Jingzhen, 27, from Wuxi, works in a foreign firm and lives at 28 Ruyi Lane, Jinjiafang, within the city. On the first of last month, he hired a nanny through the referral agency opened by Di Ajin from Liyang at 184 Guangqi Road. Di introduced Qian Hongmei, a young woman from the same hometown, to Ni's home. Unexpectedly, after only twenty-two days, the young woman stole money, clothing, and other items and fled without a trace. Ni discovered the theft, estimated at several hundred yuan, and brought the referral agent Di Ajin to the Laobeimen Police Station, ordering him to find and return Qian Hongmei, or else compensate for the losses. As a result, Di diligently searched. Until yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, Di encountered Qian Hongmei in the French Concession and immediately arrested her and brought her to the Lujiawan Police Station. Upon questioning, it was found that the case originated inland. Detective Zhang Chonglin was immediately dispatched to transfer her to the Laobeimen Police Station. After questioning, Qian Hongmei confessed to the theft and was found to possess eleven yuan and five jiao, a wristwatch, a briefcase, and several pieces of clothing. As the case concerned theft, she was sent to court for trial.

### Settlement Reached in江南 Bank Suspension of Business Debt Case

Two Managers Repay 10% of Deposits; Creditors Agree to Abandon Pursuit

In recent years, numerous banking and finance businesses in this city have suspended operations due to the impact of the economic downturn. Among them, disputes involving companies like Tongyi Trust, Mei'hua Bank, and Yikang Qianzhuang have continued unresolved, as previously reported. The Jiangnan Bank in this city, since declaring the suspension of liquidation, recently had depositors Zhang Zhonghou, Ding Zhendong, Ding Wangruo, and others from Chuansha file a civil lawsuit against the bank's managers Qian Zhixiang and Xia Zhijun in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, seeking repayment of the remaining 45% of their deposits, which amounted to over 17,800 yuan, as well as the agreed-upon interest. They also requested that the court order the bank's entire board of directors to bear joint and several liability for the repayment. The court accepted the case, and Judge Luo Can of the Fourth Civil Court repeatedly heard the case. The defendants, Qian Zhixiang and Xia Zhijun, also retained lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent them in their defense. After discussions, the court adjourned the case for the two parties to conduct an out-of-court settlement. The case resumed hearing the day before yesterday, with Judge Luo presiding again. After negotiations between the two parties, the defendants Qian and Xia agreed to repay an additional 10% of the deposits, amounting to 1,784 yuan, to the plaintiffs Zhang Zhonghou, Ding Zhendong, and Ding Wangruo, who would receive it separately. The remaining amount would be voluntarily waived by Zhang Zhonghou and the other two, and they would no longer have any claims against the entire board of directors of Jiangnan Bank. The settlement was thus reached, and Zhang and others surrendered all deposit books to Qian and Xia for retrieval. This brought an end to a long-standing financial dispute.

### Bethel Nursing School Prepares Filing Procedures

The Shanghai Bethel Hospital and Nursing Midwifery School, founded by female doctor Shi Meiyu, was established in 1896 after Dr. Shi graduated from medical school in the United States and returned to China. She founded a women's and children's hospital in Jiujiang, Jiangxi, setting a precedent for Chinese nationals founding women's hospitals and becoming the first Chinese woman to study abroad. The Kang-Liang faction of the late Qing Dynasty recorded this. Dr. Shi has always held the principle of not seeking fame and has been working diligently to treat patients and teach students for over forty years. The Bethel Hospital in Shanghai also has a history of seventeen years, having trained over a thousand nurses and midwives. The hospital has already been registered in accordance with regulations and now intends to register the affiliated nursing and midwifery schools as well. A board of directors was established in accordance with the registration procedures. The first meeting of the board of directors was convened at the school yesterday. In addition to the founders Shi Meiyu and Shi Meichengzhi, the directors include Wu Tiecheng, Mrs. Song Ziwen, Mrs. Chen Jian'an, Mrs. Zhao Jinqing, and Ms. Wu Zheying.

### Woman Wang Heying Accuses Wu Zhihao of Abandonment

First Special District Court Lacks Jurisdiction; Judge Rules Case Inadmissible

Wu Zhihao, from Ningbo and the former manager of the Ningbo Industrial Bank, was recently sued by Wang Heying from Cixi, represented by lawyer Chen Xingmin, in the First Special District Court on criminal charges of deceiving her into marriage and seduction, and malicious abandonment. Wang, who was originally a married woman, took a teaching position at Yangzhi Primary School due to financial difficulties. The defendant was the school's director and took the opportunity to seduce her, resulting in the loss of her virginity. Her former husband found out, and she divorced him at the defendant's urging. She then lived with the defendant and gave birth to a son named Yuan Xin three months later. At that time, the defendant provided her with a deposit book from the Shanghai National Products Company, paying her 100 yuan in national currency each month to cover her living expenses. However, the defendant became unfaithful and abandoned her and her son, refusing to provide for their support. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit, including a civil suit, seeking the return of a loan of 1,500 yuan and monthly living and educational expenses of 100 yuan until the age of 30, totaling 36,000 yuan. The case had already been heard once, but the defendant did not appear, and the hearing was adjourned. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard again by Judge Huang Musheng in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant, Wu Zhihao, sent lawyer Xue Jiaqi to court, who filed a countersuit for false accusation and presented various evidence, claiming that the plaintiff was actually the defendant's concubine, but they had officially separated on September 5, 1934, permanently severing family ties. Last year, the defendant, seeing the plaintiff's poverty, repeatedly requested assistance and provided 300 yuan, which was also documented in writing. Judge Huang questioned the plaintiff about the details of the case and the location of the abandonment. As the location of the abandonment was in the Milu Road, Ximen, which was not under the jurisdiction of the court, he ruled that the case was inadmissible.

### Lake Bandit "Big Belly" and Others Transferred to Zhejiang Water Police Bureau

After escaping from prison last December, he reunited with Guo Xiaoxizi, Sun Wengui, and others to rob residents along Tai Lake. Recently, they fled to Shanghai. Bao Yuxing, the captain of the Fourth Team of the Zhejiang Inland Water Police Bureau, in cooperation with Lu Liankui, the chief inspector of the Public Concession Police Headquarters, and detectives Liu Shaokui and Wang Chengying, arrested Pan and the other three suspects, as well as Pan's wife, Pan Zhu, and Guo's wife, Guo Jiang. A large quantity of stolen goods was seized, and two rifles, four Mauser rifles, five shotguns, 468 rounds of ammunition, and 16 shotgun shells were seized in Kunshan Sanjiangkou and Bailianpu. The suspects were interrogated and detained by the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court held a hearing. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the case was the result of a request from the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police for assistance in the arrest. The bureau has now requested their transfer, which the police agreed to. However, five shotguns, sixteen rounds of ammunition, a flashlight, and a hunting knife were stolen from Meisheng, a foreigner who was a staff member of the Public Works Department, and he requested that they be returned to him. Judge Qian verified the information and ordered that the five suspects, along with the evidence, be handed over to the Zhejiang Provincial Inland Water Police Bureau for further investigation and prosecution. The stolen shotguns and other items belonging to the foreigner Meisheng were ordered to be returned to the victim.

### Abduction and Sale of Women Investigated

Ni Baokui, a 23-year-old from Taicang, and his wife, Ms. Lu, 19 years old, resided at No. 67, Ruifuli, Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. On October 29th, Ni invested capital and partnered with Ms. Pan Zhang (38 years old) from Pudong to open the Luxiangyuan Teahouse in Jiumudi. Ni, occupied with managing the business at the shop, did not return home often. Unexpectedly, Ms. Wu Shen, a woman from Jiangyin residing at No. 134, East Zilaihuo Street, colluded with Xia Xinda and secretly lured Ni's wife, Ms. Lu, away. They sold her to Zhou Hongsheng (27 years old) from Pudong, residing at No. 519, Lujiabang Road in the South City, to be his wife for 120 yuan. After seeing the payment made in room number 4 of the Yuebin Hotel in Eight Immortals Bridge, Zhou immediately took Ms. Lu back to live with him. Ms. Lu, upon learning that she had been sold, secretly escaped and returned home a few days ago. Zhou Hongsheng, claiming that Ms. Wu Shen and others had committed fraud, reported the case to the French police the day before yesterday, leading to the arrest of Ni Baokui, Ni Lu, Wu Shen, Xia Xinda, Pan Zhang, and others. They were sent to the Special Number Two Tribunal, where Judge Chen Shuoying presided over the preliminary hearing. Due to the police requesting an extension for investigation before prosecution, the court reviewed the report and interrogated the defendants. They were notified of a three-day postponement for further investigation and then returned to custody.

### Acknowledgement

The Ministry of Railways' compilation of the "General Statistical Report of the Republic of China National Railways for the 24th Year of the Republic" has now been printed and published. The content has been slightly expanded compared to previous editions, covering railway facilities, finance, operations, transportation, personnel, and various statistics, each with explanations and accompanied by diagrams, making it suitable for review. In particular, the table on commercial cargo transportation statistics, which previously only listed the general categories of goods, now provides detailed classifications of goods with major items listed separately for statistical purposes. This not only facilitates the review of transportation trends but also provides insight into the economic conditions of rural areas. Overall, the statistical achievements of the 24th year show clear progress in the facilities of various railways. We received a complimentary copy yesterday. Thank you.

In our newspaper's local news section on April 27th, it was reported that the Sino-American Regular Air Service's first flight had begun carrying mail and that commemorative stamps were issued. We have since learned that the Postal Administration did not print separate commemorative stamps but only applied a special commemorative postmark to the mail. We hereby make a correction.

### Serial Comic Strips

— Zhou Ge

Children are often fascinated by old serial comic strips, leading to "runaway" escapades. Where do they run away to? To Mount Emei to "seek the Dao and visit immortals." The repeated occurrence of such escapades is nothing more than a result of children's pure emotions and their intense hatred for the injustices of the present society. Feeling powerless to eliminate these injustices, they develop admiration for "sword immortals and martial heroes," the "supermen" who specialize in fighting injustice. If they could learn their "martial arts," emitting a beam of white light from their mouths or throwing a dart that pierces through people, they could vent the frustration in their hearts, how wonderful! The popularity of serial comic strips among elementary school students is not without reason.

Recently, three students from the Confucius Temple Elementary School in Nanjing, due to their fondness for reading serial comic strips, became obsessed. One day, they agreed to run away, intending to disappear without a trace. Later, they all sent letters to their families, expressing their intention to go to Mount Wutai to cultivate themselves and learn the Dao. The Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau, upon learning of their strange actions, determined that they were caused by their usual fondness for reading serial comic strips. Therefore, it banned the printing and publication of such comic strips by various bookstores and simultaneously issued orders to all schools to pay attention to students' actions and to explain the absurdity of the content of the comic strips to prevent future occurrences.

Because such serial comic strips are now extremely harmful, several years ago, artists and a generation of popular writers enthusiastically advocated for new serial comic strips. However, after the high-minded discussions of the theorists, not a single so-called new serial comic strip has appeared. We know that humans, living in this world, need both material and spiritual nourishment, with the latter occupying an important position. If people lack spiritual nourishment, the terror of life is unimaginable. Although children are young, their thirst for spiritual nourishment is the same. Therefore, banning serial comic strips is inappropriate; instead, they should be replaced with new serial comic strips. We should mobilize children's artists, children's writers, elementary school teachers, and bookstore owners who are enthusiastic about this movement. Of course, we hope that the government will provide enthusiastic assistance to the development of this movement. At the same time, the artists and writers who once spoke grandly about new serial comic strips should work together to promote the more rapid development of this movement in order to save our future generations. In this way, banning absurd serial comic strips and replacing them with fresh serial comic strips is like a child originally eating rotten, stale food and then being provided with fresh food. Otherwise, banning the rotten, stale food, saying that it is harmful to health, while not providing fresh food, is equivalent to starving them to death.

Let me shout again: "Save the children!"

### What I Saw in Jining

— Kang Zi

When the painted train arrived at Jining Station, it was exactly 2:00 AM. We were wearing leather overcoats and "Gadang boots" (note), and we still couldn't resist the cold air, let alone in the middle of the night. At the same time, Jining is about a thousand feet higher than Guihua, and the cold air rushing in from the north made us all shiver. The fingers hiding in leather gloves became numb and then painful. Our feet kept tapping, stepping on the concrete platform, but our toes were still frozen to the point of almost bursting.

The train that dropped us off continued south, and the platform gradually became quiet. The station staff also went into the station building. We couldn't find anyone from the hotel to pick up guests, so we had to push one of our companions to follow a shrinking porter, walk to the town to call someone from the hotel to carry the luggage.

But the companion who returned showed disappointment with a dry laugh.

As a result, several of us had to carry our own luggage, wading through the cold night on rough and uneven roads, slowly groping our way to the Tai'an Inn. Everyone at the inn was sound asleep. The innkeeper, who was awakened by us, reluctantly led us into a small room with a cool kang. A small coal stove in the corner emitted a trace of heat.

"Are there no other rooms?" We couldn't help asking.

"You still want to change rooms? Be grateful you have a place to sleep, friend."

The answer didn't come from the innkeeper, but from our companion who had booked this small room.

That night, several of us lay on the cool kang, wearing overcoats and Gadang boots, in a jumbled mess. Because we were too tired, we finally managed to sleep until the next day.

Early in the morning, we took our letters of introduction and left the Tai'an Inn, stepping onto the streets of Jining.

Jining is also known as Pingdiquan, a very important defense location for Suiyuan. The enemy had tried several times to break through our defense line from Xinghe and Taolin into Pingdiquan. But because our defense was solid, the enemy failed several times. In such an important defense location, we could find no tension or panic, except for the countless air-raid shelters along the road. The passersby were like those we saw in Guihua: wearing wool overcoats and leather hats, strolling leisurely on the street.

Jining's most prosperous commercial area is undoubtedly Yimalu (First Road). Here, there are Nanhai goods stores, restaurants, and grocery stores. Looking at the customers coming and going, one can tell that business here is quite good. However, there is not a single rickshaw to be found on the street.

At the reception center on Sanmalu (Third Road), we met Su Kaiyuan, the garrison commander of Jining. Commander Su was still young. When he saw us young lads and the letter of introduction, he was delighted and led us around to various places.

What interested us most was visiting the defensive fortifications in the western suburbs. Beforehand, Commander Su repeatedly instructed us:

"You can't take pictures here! This is military law, please forgive me!"

"We know, we know."

Some of our companions, to show their firm obedience, put away their cameras. But Commander Su still thought that wasn't enough:

"At the same time, please don't write about the images you saw after the visit in your articles. If you reveal the secrets of the defensive fortifications, it would be equivalent to doing free espionage for the enemy."

These words made us all laugh.

After visiting the defensive fortifications, Commander Su led us to the open space at the station, pointed to the peaks surrounding Jining, and told us why Jining was so important militarily. At this time, a team of machine gunners happened to be practicing in the open space. We got permission and took some photos. Near the station, we also took some photos of the brothers carrying coal.

The enthusiastic brothers were still shouting:

"Everyone stand still and let them take pictures!"

Jining is an important defense location, but it is also a place full of vitality. Unfortunately, we were rushing to Datong, so we only stayed in Jining for a few hours.

(Note) Gadang boots are a type of wool-lined boots specially made in Suiyuan, which can prevent cold and frost.

### Broad Beans

— Liu Wang

Today, at a friend's simple banquet, I encountered freshly ripened broad beans. On a clean plate, there were small, tender green things, like emeralds adorning a white velvet treasure box. Seeing them, I couldn't help but feel a greedy desire.

Broad beans, for me - a wild child who once lived in the countryside for more than ten years and always mingled in the fields - evoke an even stronger sense of familiarity.

(Yes, I am so familiar with it, but how strange it is now!)

From the tip of my tongue, I recall fragments of my childhood life. Those days were so lovely! Although the torment of the secular environment has numbed my senses, when the past events resurface in my mind, it is still enough to make me excited and proud. It seems that only at this time do I dare to lift my head and say to people:

"Arrogant people of power, don't underestimate others too much! My life is not always gray. A period of green days in the past also shone brightly for a time!"

That was when the broad beans were bearing heavily in late spring and early summer. We little rascals (those dear childhood companions) would spend all day in the fields. No matter how busy the family was raising silkworms, they couldn't find us to do any light work.

We would secretly pluck many broad bean pods, hide in the mulberry fields with sparse green leaves, or in the wheat fields with long waves, busy peeling out the large, bursting fruits. Those who were not quick at peeling had to split the bean pod to take out the bean. Clever people only needed to fold the bean pod with three fingers, and the bean would immediately jump out. Some people even used both hands at the same time, both lightly and quickly.

Once the broad beans were all peeled, we would put them into a small pot brought from home. On one side, we would dig a gap in the field ridge, just enough to fit the small pot. At the same time, some people would pick up firewood, regardless of mulberry branches or weeds, all of which were found. Others would fetch water from the river and pour it into the pot. In addition, some people would secretly bring salted meat or yellow croaker from home and put them into the pot together.

We would light a fire, burn the firewood, half burning and half extinguishing, letting a wisp of green smoke linger in the fields. Watching the smoke fly away, the partners would jump with joy, so someone would hum a mountain song, and someone would do somersaults in the wheat field.

When the mulberry branches and weeds were burned out, and a pile of ashes filled the gap in the field ridge, everyone would rush to open the pot lid. Many mischievous eyes would be wide open, staring unblinkingly into the pot.

"Can we eat it?"

"Taste it first and see!"

Saying it's tasting, but everyone is rushing to grab it. (Really, who is willing to wait until it is cooked a little more? Saliva has already dripped to their toes.) Regardless of whether the broad beans are raw or cooked, many people use their fingers as chopsticks, picking them up quickly. Before one bean is chewed, the second and third are already put into the mouth. As a result, their little mouths are stuffed full, and their cheeks are bulging, looking like pufferfish. They don't care if the beans burn the tip of their tongue, they just grab, they just stuff, and the tears fall in strings to their lips, swallowing them together with the beans into their throats.

Time flies so fast. Now, thinking about it, these green years, shining with the brilliance of joy, have irretrievably passed away forever. Eating the freshly ripened broad beans at a friend's banquet (those familiar but already strange little things), I can't help but feel lost for a long time.

### Sai Jinhua

— Chen Hezhi

Fifteen

Sai Jinhua's gold was all robbed by the Qing soldiers. The long journey was far, and her small feet were frail. How could she walk? The road was also rugged, and it was raining, making the road even more muddy and slippery. And her shoe soles were all worn out, her legs had no strength, her energy was exhausted, and she was suffering from hunger and cold. She called to heaven, but there was no response; she called to earth, but there was no door. But those corrupt officials of the Qing Dynasty who specialized in scraping the fat from the people had already fled without a trace when they saw the foreign soldiers coming. How could they care about the death of ordinary people!
