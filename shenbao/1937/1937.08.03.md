### Japan Actively Prepares for War

[Nanjing] Japan's attempt to annex our country by force has long been determined. All war preparations have become more active than at the beginning of the July 7th Incident. Observers of the Sino-Japanese situation here believe that Japan's large-scale invasion of our country is imminent. The following facts are clear evidence of their large-scale invasion of China: ⑴ After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese cabinet adopted a high-pressure policy toward China and decided to send troops, immediately passing a temporary military budget of 100 million yuan. Recently, the scope has been expanded, and another 300 million yuan has been added. Japan's finances have been on the verge of bankruptcy for years. If there was no intention to wage war, why would they increase military spending in this way? ⑵ Some reservists have already been mobilized. The wartime organization of the divisions coming to China has been completed, and the reserve soldiers have all joined the army and departed with the troops. It is reported that over 100,000 reservists on the island of Kyushu have received mobilization orders. Among them, about 70,000 are planning to depart for China immediately. So far, the total number of conscripts in the three regions of Kyoto, Kobe, and Osaka has reached over 60,000. The Korean Railway has suspended ordinary freight transport since the first of this month. The tension of the military transport situation is self-evident. ⑶ All personnel from the Japanese Consulate in Chongqing have left the country. The consulates in Shashi and Yichang also falsely claimed that the market was deteriorating and notified our officials that they would all leave within one or two days. ⑷ Our officials and people have always maintained peace with the Japanese residents, as usual. However, Japanese residents in various places have voluntarily returned to their country one after another. It is not difficult to imagine that this is in preparation for war against us. ⑸ Japanese planes arbitrarily bombed and massacred innocent people in Peiping, Tianjin, and other parts of North China, which is infuriating to all Chinese people. Recently, they have repeatedly flown reconnaissance missions over major locations in central and southern China. Yesterday, Japanese planes were spotted in Luoyang, Huiyang, and other places. There is no doubt that they are reconnoitering our situation in preparation for war. ⑹ Japanese warships have been actively transporting troops and military supplies in the North China region for days, extremely busy. In Qingdao alone, there are more than a dozen transport ships. In South China, the main task is to demonstrate power. In Shantou, they made unreasonable demands on our local authorities yesterday. After being sternly rejected by our side, they transferred a large number of warships from Taiwan to carry out threats. Japanese naval attaché Honda, when visiting Commander Chen Hai, even stated that the Japanese fleet would take free action in central and southern China when necessary. Their intentions are well known. ⑺ Japanese companies in China, such as Nisshin Steamship Company, have suspended routes to Chongqing and Yichang. The warehouses of its Shanghai headquarters are also being closed down at an accelerated pace. In addition, yarn factories in Shanghai and Qingdao have vacated a large number of houses to prepare for stationing troops. The remaining able-bodied men among the Japanese residents in various places, excluding the foreigners who have withdrawn to their home countries, are organizing volunteer corps to prepare for harassing our side. There are about 700 such able-bodied men in Jinan alone, and the numbers are even greater in Qingdao and Shanghai. Overall, the above-mentioned activities of the Japanese side indicate that they are deliberately escalating the situation and that war is inevitable. The Chinese people can only be determined to sacrifice and resist to the end, and strike back at those who strike us. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)

### Tianjin City Reduced to Scorched Earth

### North-China Daily News Reiterates Impartial Viewpoint

Japan Relies on Military Force Instead of Diplomacy
Even a Hundred Tongues Cannot Deny Their Culpability

The North-China Daily News published an editorial yesterday entitled "Misunderstanding," criticizing the recklessness of the Japanese military that led to the tragedy in North China. Although empty talk is futile and wasteful today, only iron and blood can achieve the final solution. Only such arguments from a third party can prove that even if the Japanese try to confuse right and wrong with their sophistry, they will ultimately not be able to blind the intelligence of the world. Even those who are usually pro-Japanese occasionally speak out against them. The following is a translation of the original text:

The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to France, Sugimura, told a French journalist that Japan's primary objective in North China is economic. His words are indeed accurate, and his sincerity cannot be doubted. This aligns with the approach taken by Japan's defenders, who seek to explain the current crisis. They argue that Japan's intention to establish economic cooperation in North China to strengthen the Japan-Korea-Japan group was intensified by China's provocations. They enumerate Japan's recent adoption of "new concepts," as well as the moderate speeches of Hirota, especially former Foreign Minister Sato, and the gradual easing of Japan's actions in China for more than a year, blaming China's lack of response. They also claim that Japan once allowed China to develop its national unity and carry out its economic construction, but China then showed signs of overconfidence in its own abilities and carelessly handled its relations with Japan, encouraging or at least not restraining anti-Japanese elements. In other words, China mistakenly believed that Japan's moderation was weakness, so the Japanese had no choice but to take self-defense actions in North China. The Japanese army maintains the "Jidong Autonomous Government" without any ambition for land, but merely wants to make it a cleanup place for large-scale smuggling or "special trade" in order to correct the heavy tax system in China and help economic cooperation, etc. Judging from General Kashii's rapid appointment of Chi Tsung-mo to succeed Yin Ju-keng as the head of Jidong, and the participation of the Security Maintenance Association in the management of the Tianjin-Beijing area, Japan's control of Hebei is now a "fait accompli." However, the Japanese still insist that all these arrangements are intended to provide a beneficial mechanism for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and to provide North China with a better government. Who would believe this?

If Japan had not engaged in various activities in and outside North China after the September 18th Incident, these arguments would be more convincing. It is a pity that they have now been refuted by the facts. The short-term "Security Committee" established after the September 18th Incident to handle local autonomy, and the conditions for its appointment, are now being applied to the "Security Maintenance Association," which is the same as before and without any difference. It is important to know that this kind of organization, due to the obedience of the Chinese officials who are commissioned, often reveals its rupture and failure in the face of the provocative power of the Japanese who regard themselves as masters. Judging from the surnames of the people who were chosen to be appointed as Japanese officials in Tianjin and Tongxian today, it is impossible to believe that North China can avoid the changes that Manchuria has suffered in the past. In other words, the Japanese government, like the September 18th Incident, firmly stated that it was determined to avoid occupying land, but this determination will be invalidated by the natural consequences of the actions of the local Japanese army. Therefore, even if the Japanese government wants to make efforts to dispel the impression that the general public has of the fight at Lugouqiao, no matter who fired the first shot, the Japanese army has become an aggressor, and even a hundred tongues would not be able to justify it. Moderate speeches have their value, but if they are not supported by actions, they are just empty words. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say now that General Kashii has disregarded the moderate approach taken by the Tokyo authorities. His so-called "severe punishment of the tyrannical Chinese army" has been consistent with his words and deeds, and he has acted without restraint. The beauty of the "new concept" of Sino-Japanese relations in Tokyo has been destroyed by the appalling stubbornness and occasional tyranny of the Japanese army stationed in various parts of China, but it is still blind. The Japanese have a complete misunderstanding of the current crisis. These Japanese cannot be blamed for having any other ambitions than the desire to treat China with a friendly and equal spirit. The tragedy of the situation lies in this point. The reason for this is that the propaganda of the wicked children has promoted the expansion of even the slightest dispute to serve their interests in the country, hoping to provide evidence for their usual claims that the Chinese have "anti-Japanese" feelings and engage in "anti-Japanese" activities. As for the main points of contention between the Chinese and Japanese governments, no one cares about them.

Both the Chinese and Japanese governments are willing to implement economic cooperation. However, China wants to clarify the political situation in North China before taking practical steps to fulfill common needs. Japan believes that this kind of explanation is not necessary and only wants to immediately conclude a factual agreement without involving political disputes. Both sides' observations may be reasonable, but according to the opinions of impartial observers, if Japan thinks that it can cut through the Gordian knot with one stroke, then it is not being fair. Whether the Nanjing rumor that the Central Army will take large-scale resistant actions against the Japanese army can be verified by facts, this section can be temporarily disregarded. Even if this is not true, when the Japanese government is seeking the best way for the Chinese government to make its people recognize the invasive capabilities of the Japanese army's occupation of Chinese territory, and is making efforts to consolidate its governance in the north, has it ever considered whether the hope of fundamentally establishing friendly relations between China and Japan has progressed as a result? If it is said that the Chinese government has failed to understand Japan's more "moderate" policy, giving the Japanese warlords a new excuse to disbelieve that this policy can be effective, then has it ever tried to pursue a strategy of economic cooperation and make genuine diplomatic efforts to eliminate differences between the two sides? Some Chinese spokespersons may have overestimated the progress of their government in recent years due to momentary pleasure, causing the Japanese to eloquently claim that China mistakenly recognized Japan's endurance as weakness. However, how can Japan, a dignified great power, waver and be undecided in planning its policies because of this frivolous excuse? If the Japanese government had seriously considered its policies, would there be absolutely no way to eliminate the threat of such accidental events affecting the success of its policies? What is the opinion of the critics on the Nanjing government's inability to realize the urgency of the crisis that began on July 7th? And the Japanese taxpayers now have to bear the huge cost of maintaining the large army in China, and they will definitely complain about the poor handling of Sino-Japanese relations by their country's military and politicians. This kind of complaint is caused by the publication of Tokyo's officialdom and semi-official circles, which makes them misunderstand the overall situation greatly. Japan's diplomatic authorities have never had the freedom to deal with negotiations, because they have been disabled by the military.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Far East War and the US Attitude

— Hua

Since Japanese imperialism created the Lugouqiao Incident and launched a large-scale invasion of our North China, international attention has immediately shifted from the West to the Far East. At the same time, we are in the middle of launching a war of resistance, and we are very concerned about the attitude of the world's major powers towards the war in the Far East. Some people believe that the current attitude of countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union towards the war in the Far East is relatively cold, which seems to be beneficial to the aggression of Japanese imperialism. This observation seems to be correct on the surface, but it is not actually the case. Let's just look at the United States, the most powerful force in the Pacific. In the past two weeks, although the implementation of the Neutrality Act has been mentioned from time to time, Washington officials and many important members of Congress believe that it is not yet the time to implement the Neutrality Act, and that this bill would only be beneficial to Japan and detrimental to our country, so they also believe that there is no reason to implement it.

According to news reports a few days ago, Pittman, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US Congress, made a statement opposing the implementation of the Neutrality Act, arguing that the implementation of this bill would greatly hinder the US President's power to mediate wars and protect overseas Chinese. Pittman is one of the strongest opponents of Japanese aggression against China in the US Democratic Party. He once strongly condemned Japanese imperialism as an "international robber." His influence on US policy towards the Far East is naturally not to be ignored. According to yesterday's newspaper, Senator Lewis also made a statement opposing the implementation of the Neutrality Act. At the same time, "The New York Times," which represents the most powerful force in the US public opinion circle, stated a few days ago that "the implementation of the Neutrality Act would actually put the United States in the position of an ally of Japan, because the Japanese Navy controls the Western Pacific and can obtain a sufficient supply of military supplies, while China has neither ships nor cash and cannot obtain this kind of assistance." On the 1st of this month, the newspaper supplemented Pittman's opinion, stating that "the traditional foreign policy of the United States towards the Far East is to safeguard China's territorial integrity and the Open Door Policy... If the United States is not prepared to safeguard overseas rights, bear its own responsibilities, and does not distinguish between right and wrong between victims and aggressors, it is precisely reducing its power as a major world power."

We can believe that the expression of such opinions by the US government and public opinion shows that the United States is by no means willing to stand idly by in the face of the Far East war, and is prepared to take positive action at any time. China and the United States have maintained a long-term friendly relationship. The huge potential for the development of the Chinese market is deeply recognized by the American people. Although current US trade and investment in Japan far exceed the amount in China, the United States still occupies the first place in China's current foreign trade. The amount it occupies is even greater than the combined amount of the United Kingdom and Japan. Currently, American aircraft and automobile industries regard China as the most important market. If China is ravaged by the military forces of Japanese imperialism, then the huge potential for the development of this market will also be eliminated by the Japanese warlords.

The above facts can show that the United States cannot sit idly by in the face of Japanese imperialism's barbaric aggression against our country, whether in terms of morality or interests. The current apparent coldness of the United States is only because the United Kingdom is indecisive, which makes it have to act cautiously. In fact, to solve the threat of the war of aggression suffered by the Far East under Japanese imperialism, on the one hand, it lies in our country's insistence on resistance, so that Japanese imperialism cannot gain the slightest benefit. On the other hand, it also lies in the cooperation of the powerful peaceful countries along the Pacific Rim to jointly restrain the Japanese aggressors. Mrs. Taboui, a famous reporter for the French "Business Report," once said, "There is only one way to preserve peace in the Far East. That is the intervention of the great powers, especially the United States... Only the great power of the United States of America is enough to make Japan hesitate in the path it has taken." The observation of this famous reporter is correct. Philtert, the American secretary of the Pacific Academy, also said in a pamphlet, "Imperialism can be satiated by success or starved by failure... Therefore, to achieve the success of a positive anti-war policy in the Far East, there is a prerequisite. That is, the great powers that are concerned with the situation in the Far East should cooperate to take joint action." We believe that although the United States currently adopts a policy of waiting and seeing towards the situation in the Far East, it is still constantly promoting this kind of international joint anti-aggression action. This can also be seen from the recent visit of the US fleet to Vladivostok.

Naturally, we want to hope that countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will quickly take joint action to resist the aggressors. We also need to make greater efforts ourselves. First, we should answer the aggressors with the most resolute resistance. Second, we should obtain the assistance of all friendly countries with active diplomatic activities.

### Japanese Troops Violate Tianjin French Barracks, Protest Lodged with Japan

French Newspapers Express Outrage Unanimously Kashii has Apologized to French Commander

[Paris] According to a telegram from Shanghai received here, Kashii, the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in North China, has expressed his apology to the commander of the French garrison in Tianjin for the recent Tianjin incident, and has guaranteed that the Japanese troops will never interfere with the free traffic between the French Concession and Dongjuzi. (Guomin Haitong telegram from the 2nd)

[Nanjing] Paris, Haitong telegram, the newspapers here reported that the French ambassador to Japan has been ordered to protest to the Japanese government for the Japanese troops' violation of French sentries in Tianjin and the cutting of telephone lines between the French Concession and the arsenal. Also, French Foreign Minister Dalbos has talked to Japanese Ambassador to France Sugimura about this matter, and the newspapers hope that it can be resolved immediately. (CNA telegram from the 2nd)

[Paris] Regarding the clash between Japanese troops and French soldiers at the Tianjin East Railway Station, the newspapers have commented on it one after another. The communist organ newspaper "Humanité" stated that "The Japanese army even injured French soldiers. This kind of crime is a very serious international dispute. France cannot just protest. Its Far East policy should also be clearly announced. The French government led by the Popular Front should especially condemn China's invasion. Moreover, when Tianjin was bombed, French soldiers were attacked for performing international missions, so it is impossible to stand idly by. On the contrary, the proposal submitted by our Foreign Minister to the League of Nations, advocating strengthening the League of Nations, would no longer have any meaning." The far-right "Le Petit Journal" stated that "The bloodshed of French soldiers is a serious problem. The Japanese authorities in Tianjin must know this very well. After the incident, they immediately informed our embassy in China that they would give a satisfactory solution. It is easy for this kind of incident to occur in times of chaos, and it can be settled with compensation and apology." (CNA telegram from Havas on the 2nd)

### More Than 20 White Russians Destroy Soviet Consulate General in Tianjin

Plainclothes Japanese Rogues Also Participated Soviet Consul Visited Horinouchi, but was Refused a Meeting Baoski Has Lodged a Protest with Hidaka

[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources, the Soviet Consulate General in Tianjin, in the Third Special District of Tianjin, moved its entire staff to another location after the outbreak of the war in Tianjin. At about 9:00 PM on the 1st, more than 20 White Russians went to the consulate and greatly damaged the interior. All the furniture and sundries were in a state of disrepair. (CNA telegram from the 2nd)

[Nanjing] Since the illegal occupation of Tianjin by the Japanese army on July 30th, the place has become a world of violence, where robbery and pillaging are rampant. According to news from the Soviet side, the Soviet Consulate General has also suffered the same fate. At 9:00 PM on August 1st, the Japanese army's reconnaissance team and plainclothes team, with the permission of Major Take of the North China Japanese Garrison Headquarters, carried rifles, bombs, and submachine guns, attacked the consulate, destroyed the doors and windows, and used a heavy truck to transport away property. The consulate is located near the site of the Japanese Army Department. No one else is allowed to pass, but the heavy truck full of property from the Soviet Consulate General was allowed to pass by the Japanese army and transported to the Japanese Concession. After this incident, the Soviet Consul in Tianjin asked the leader of the Tianjin Consular Corps to convene an emergency meeting to discuss how to deal with it, but the Japanese Consul avoided attending. It is heard that the Soviet government believes that this matter trampled on Soviet-Japanese relations and attaches great importance to it. Baoski, the Soviet ambassador to China, lodged a serious protest with Hidaka, a councilor of the Japanese Embassy in China, on the 2nd. (CNA telegram from the 2nd)

[Tianjin] Today, a large team of White Russians, holding hand grenades and pistols, attacked the Soviet Consulate, and carried away the documents in the consulate in large trucks. The Soviet Consul had received a warning in advance and has now requested assistance from the Consular Corps. The request has now been forwarded to the Japanese consular authorities for processing. The attackers destroyed the interior of the consulate and the ornaments on the front door of the consulate, and tore the Soviet national flag to pieces. The consulate is located in the former Russian Concession, opposite the British Concession. This morning, a group of Russians, unknown to which party they belonged, lingered around the consulate. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)

[Nanjing] According to a reliable report from a certain party, the Japanese army, through plainclothes teams, went to Tianjin last night to destroy the Soviet Consulate General and carried away a large number of properties and documents in trucks. The Japanese side believes that this move was very successful and plans to carry out the same action in Shanghai, using White Russians to pretend to be Trotskyists to attack the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai. However, because the matter was not kept secret, the Concession authorities had already taken strict precautions in advance, and the trick was unsuccessful. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)

(TASS Shanghai News) The Tianjin Soviet Consulate, located in the Third Special District, has been without protection since July 30th, when the Chinese troops withdrew and the Japanese troops occupied the district. At that time, White Russian spies hired by the Japanese intelligence agency, Bastiugin, Osipov, Shadushin, etc., tried to take the opportunity to break into the consulate and massacre the staff. At 9:00 AM on August 1st, they finally obtained permission from the Japanese North China Garrison Intelligence Department, led a number of White Russians and plainclothes Japanese rogues, and broke into the consulate with pistols, rifles, bombs, and light machine guns, destroyed the gate, and carried out the objects in the consulate and transported them to the Japanese Concession in a car. The former Chinese police station near the consulate was already stationed with Japanese soldiers and prohibited pedestrians from passing through, but they turned a blind eye to this matter and allowed the car to pass. Before this car occurred, Soviet Consul Smirnov had visited Japanese Consul Horinouchi, but the Japanese Consul refused to meet him. Mr. Smirnov then changed his visit to Mr. Kichi, a senior official of the Japanese side, and told him that someone was plotting to destroy the Soviet Consulate, hoping to stop it. The officer replied that he had heard of this rumor at the Consular Corps meeting on July 30th, but he could not do anything about it, because his telephone had been cut off, and just as he was talking, the attack on the consulate had already occurred. The Soviet Consul immediately invited consuls from various countries to hold a consular corps meeting, but the Japanese Consul also refused to attend. The Soviet Consulate was then robbed. The robbery of the Tianjin Consulate confirms that the telegram on July 25th said that the Japanese side hired spies from Russia to conspire to attack the Shanghai Soviet Consulate, which is by no means fictional, and is an organized anti-Soviet provocation by the Japanese side. Soviet Ambassador Baoski has now lodged a serious protest with Hidaka regarding the above-mentioned incident. (The 2nd)

### Central Authorities' Two Weekly Memorial Services Featured Important Reports from Lin and Wang

Wang Claimed: Lushan's Second Phase of Discussions Reached a Consensus. Lin Spoke: Understanding the Current Situation is Essential

[Nanjing] The Central Party Headquarters held its 87th weekly memorial service at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Feng Yuxiang, He Yingqin, Chen Shaokuan, and other staff members from various central departments and committees, totaling approximately 700 people, attended. Under the leadership of Standing Committee Chairman Wang Zhaoming, ceremonial procedures were followed. Wang then reported on the proceedings of the Lushan Talks. The original text of Chairman Wang's report is as follows: "Fellow comrades, Mr. Chiang and I initiated the Lushan Talks with the original intention of exchanging views on various political, diplomatic, economic, and educational issues with influential figures from the intellectual and industrial sectors nationwide, and to engage in thorough discussions. In early July, the first group of guests arrived on the mountain successively, but the Lugouqiao Incident occurred at this very moment. All the guests felt that the nation had reached a critical juncture of survival, and their sense of unity became even stronger. At each gathering, we heard pronouncements emphasizing the priority of the nation above all else, and we also learned that Mr. Chiang was increasingly busy with government affairs. Everyone advocated shortening the duration of the talks. In the first joint discussion, I provided an introduction to political issues, the full text of which has already appeared in various newspapers, so I will not repeat it here. In the second joint discussion, Mr. Chiang announced the policy direction for the current situation, which deeply moved everyone and was unanimously supported. The full text has also appeared in various newspapers, so I will not repeat it here. Subsequently, Mr. Chiang returned to Nanjing first and entrusted me with continuing to invite guests for joint discussions. In total, there was one additional discussion on political issues. All discussions have been carefully recorded by the Secretariat and are currently being compiled under the guidance of Secretary-General Zhang. They will be published as a volume soon for everyone's quick perusal. In addition, some guests who were unable to fully express their views during the discussions submitted their detailed opinions in writing, which will also be included in the volume. This is a general overview of the first phase of joint discussions. As for the second phase of joint discussions, the situation became even more serious. Everyone felt that the nation and the people, as indicated by Mr. Chiang, were on the verge of a final crisis, and all discussions focused on this point. At that time, guests who arrived successively on the mountain were invited for two separate discussions, followed by two joint discussions. Many famous and candid remarks were made regarding the current situation. Regarding political, economic, educational, and other issues, the guests conducted separate studies, and each group appointed one or two individuals to systematically organize their findings, which were then submitted in writing. This is a general overview of the second phase of joint discussions. In the future, the records of the first and second phases will be combined and published for reference. In short, the opinions expressed by the guests during these two phases, some of which were individual expressions and some representing groups, were of great benefit to the progress of politics, diplomacy, economics, and education. I plan to study them in detail with Mr. Chiang, and if there are any opinions that must be specifically proposed and requested for adoption and implementation by the Central Government, we will handle them with due care, so as not to disappoint the hopes and efforts of these two phases of joint discussions. As for the third phase of joint discussions, it has been postponed due to the current situation, and the location has not yet been determined." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

[Nanjing] The National Government held a weekly memorial service at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. Yu Youren, Bai Wenwei, Zhang Ji, Li Wenfan, and other officials from the National Government and various ministries and committees, totaling approximately 400 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he delivered a report on "The Necessary Understanding of the Current Situation." The meeting adjourned after the speech at 9:30 AM. The original text of Chairman Lin's report is as follows: "Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the situation has become increasingly tense. In this tense situation, in order to cope properly, the government must establish a consistent policy and remain steadfast. However, the most important thing is that the people of the whole country must have a clear understanding of the current situation. This understanding is essential for us when facing major events. Therefore, today I am specifically raising this issue to discuss with you. Our grand policy for building the nation has always been very clear. This clear policy is what is proclaimed in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session: to seek self-preservation internally and co-existence externally. To achieve the goals of self-preservation and co-existence, we must, of course, advocate peace. Originally, self-preservation meant relying on our own strength and planning for survival, while co-existence meant seeking survival together with friendly nations around the world. To seek self-preservation, we must rely on construction, and to seek co-existence, we must rely on international cooperation. Both construction and cooperation require peace to be achieved. Therefore, our advocacy of peace is not only due to our nation's inherent love of peace in a passive sense, but also in a positive sense, it further demonstrates that our advocacy of peace is based entirely on sincerity and is not forced in any way. However, on the other hand, while advocating peace is our basic national policy, if our territorial sovereignty is violated, or even endangers the independent survival of our entire nation, then we have no choice but to rise up and resist in order to safeguard the independent survival of our nation. Because territorial sovereignty is an essential element of a nation, its integrity must not be infringed upon in the slightest. Otherwise, the nation will lose its basis for survival. Therefore, this kind of resistance is purely based on self-defense. If even this right of self-defense is taken away from us, would we still be a nation? Therefore, although we advocate peace, peace has its limits, which is when the independent survival of our nation is endangered. In order to exercise self-defense, we have no choice but to rise up and resist. This kind of resistance not only does not conflict with peace, but is precisely the means to achieve true peace. Because without resistance, there will only be destruction, so how can we talk about peace? As for this extraordinary situation, there are two points that all parties in the country should pay full attention to. First, we must trust the government. The government's national policy has always been consistent, and all measures are based on the interests of the entire nation. In this extraordinary situation, I hope that all parties in the country will fully trust and support the government. If we can do this, we can achieve national unity and unleash great power to cope with the current crisis. Second, we must remain calm. The current situation has reached a final critical juncture. Everyone must strictly abide by discipline and be prepared at all times to obey the government's orders and sacrifice for the country to defend our nation and fulfill our duties. All colleagues serving in government agencies should pay even more attention. We must be a model for the people of the whole country, perform our duties according to the law, and ensure that political efficiency is not affected in the slightest. If we can do this, we will have fulfilled our responsibilities. As for the overall national policy, the government has already made a decision, so we must refrain from arbitrary speculation to avoid affecting public order. The above two points, although seemingly ordinary, are of great importance. I hope that everyone will pay full attention and put them into practice." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

### The World Cannot Ignore the Sino-Japanese Conflict

British Newspaper Says Foreign Secretary Continues to Pay Attention to the Situation Despite Parliament's Recess

[London] The British Daily Telegraph commented on the parliamentary recess today, saying that the Far Eastern situation must continue to be monitored by the Foreign Secretary. At the very least, a peaceful resolution should still be sought. For both China and Japan, the outside world absolutely cannot pretend to be indifferent to the war that is destroying North China. At a time when war clouds are looming over Europe and Asia, the holiday period must be a period of monitoring. Although Foreign Secretary Eden recently said that the situation was better than twelve months ago, the general picture is still uncertain. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd)

### Causes of Earthquakes in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong

Epicenter Seemed to Be in Northern Jiangsu and Anhui, Caused by Fractures in the Mountains

[Nanjing] Two earthquakes occurred in the Jiangsu and Anhui area on the 1st. According to a report from the Central Meteorological Observatory, the observatory's seismograph began recording at 4:36:50 AM on the 1st. Because the epicenter was relatively close, the tremors were also huge, so some of the instruments were shaken out of range. The direction was northwest, about 400-500 kilometers from Nanjing. The epicenter seemed to be in the Kunranglu area in northern Jiangsu and Anhui. At 6:42:06 PM, the seismograph recorded the second earthquake, with similar intensity and from the same source. The larger aftershocks were also reported. According to the person in charge of the observatory, the boundary line between the mountains and plains in southwestern Shandong Province originally had a northwest-southeast trending fault, with obvious fractures in between. This fracture zone extends southward to northern Jiangsu and Anhui. The tremors seemed to be caused by the impact of the fractures, so the tremors were particularly strong in Xuzhou. Only a few people in Nanjing felt a slight tremor. Logically, western Shandong should also have felt the earthquake. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

[Nanjing] The Central Meteorological Observatory's seismic instrument measured the results of the earthquake on the 1st and determined that it was caused by fractures in the mountains of southwestern Shandong Province and was not related to volcanoes. There should be no further occurrences. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)

[Jinan] This morning at 4:30 AM, 6:30 AM, and 6:48 PM, there were a total of six earthquakes, one after another, throughout the province. They moved from southwest to northeast, with sounds like thunder. Houses collapsed and people were injured in Jining. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)

[Jinan] On the 1st, earthquakes occurred in most parts of the province and counties, with the west and south being the most severe. Reports have been received from Jining, Heze, Wenshang, Dongping, Pingyin, Huimin, Linbang, Dexian, Laiwu, Huantai, Tai'an, and Liaocheng. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st)

[Kaifeng] In Henan, an earthquake suddenly occurred at 4:30 AM on the 1st. Residents were awakened from their sleep. It lasted for about one minute before stopping. There was another slight tremor at 7:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

### Typhoon Affects the East China Sea Area

[Nanjing] The typhoon reached the southwestern part of the Ryukyu Islands on the afternoon of the 2nd, located between 125 degrees east longitude and 25 degrees north latitude. It is still moving northwest, but its movement is slow, with a speed of 16 li per hour. A strong wind and rain have now occurred in the East China Sea, and the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian will also be affected. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

### Rain in Xi'an Causes Flight Delays

[Xi'an] Rain has been falling in Xi'an since 2:00 AM on the 2nd, and it has not stopped by the evening. The Xi'an-Chengdu flight was delayed due to the rain and did not arrive in Xi'an until 5:30 PM. The Shanghai-Shaanxi flight took off eastward at 5:40 PM, but returned to Xi'an at around 6:30 PM due to poor weather. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

### Nanchang Municipal Government Established

[Nanchang] The Nanchang Municipal Committee has been reorganized from a county into a municipal government, and preparations have been completed. It was officially established on the 2nd. Mayor Gong Xuesui returned to the province from Lushan on the evening of the 1st and went to the office to attend to official duties at 7:00 AM on the 2nd. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

### Foreign Church Land Lease Agreement Form

[Nanjing] The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Interior, together with the Ministry of Justice Administration, held a meeting on July 30 to discuss revising the permanent land lease agreement form for foreign churches, which was then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The agreement form is as follows: "Land Lessor: [Name], from [Village/Township] in [County], [Province]. Hereby leases the following piece of land located at [Location] (if there are houses, the number of rooms and style should be listed), totaling [Area] with clear boundaries: east to [Boundary], west to [Boundary], south to [Boundary], north to [Boundary]. Through the intermediary of [Name], the rent price has been agreed upon as [Amount] Yuan. The lessor and lessee will jointly submit this agreement to the local competent authority for approval and, in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Rental of Land and Buildings by Foreign Churches in the Interior, permanently lease the land to the [Nationality] [Church] for the construction of a church or for other uses.

### Paris and Berlin Hold Rallies on the Anniversary of the Outbreak of the European War

Fang Zhenwu Said China Actively Resists Aggression; Russian Newspaper Said Willing to Join Hands with Peaceful Forces

[Paris] Today is the 22nd anniversary of the outbreak of the European War. The World Peace Conference initiated a grand public rally in the Vincennes Forest in the suburbs, which was personally attended and presided over by Education Minister Zay and Sports Director Lagranges. General Fang Zhenwu, former commander of the Fifth Army of the National Revolutionary Army who participated in the war of resistance against Japan in Chahar Province, delivered a speech in Chinese, which was translated into French by a member of parliament. His words appealed to "European brothers" in an impassioned and poignant manner, moving everyone who listened. He stated, "China is fighting against the war of aggression, and our cause is just and our arguments are reasonable. China has always had great hope for the League of Nations. After the September 18th Incident, Geneva actually condoned Japan, allowing it to satisfy its evil demands in 'Manchuria.' This has inevitably disappointed the Chinese people. However, China still expresses its trust in the League of Nations and, more importantly, in the democratic countries of the world. Moreover, today's China is not comparable to the China of 1931. Japan's attempt to attack it again is a serious mistake. We now have 2 million well-equipped soldiers in the new-style army, and 450 million people are prepared to sacrifice themselves for national liberation. We must achieve final victory. The Chinese army is an army of justice and peace, and China's victory is also a victory of justice and peace." After the speech, the audience applauded for a long time.

Next, Viscount Samuel, leader of the opposition Liberal Party in Britain, delivered a speech, saying that peace and freedom must be defended with full force. He then made a humorous analogy, saying that if sheep passed a resolution advocating vegetarianism, but wolves held a different view, would such a resolution be effective? His conclusion was that the British people firmly believed that the peace and stability of the world depended on the close cooperation and friendship of the three major democratic countries of the West: Britain, France, and the United States, as well as the Soviet Union.

Next, former French Prime Minister Peng Gu represented and spoke, also saying that the friendship between Britain and France was necessary, as evidenced by historical facts. If Britain, France, and the Soviet Union were united, with the addition of the United States, the foundation of peace would be unshakable. He also said that there was no mutual hatred between nations, but it was our government that made it impossible for nations to love each other. Finally, representatives from various countries spoke in turn, and the conference announced its adjournment in an impassioned atmosphere until dusk.

[Moscow] Newspapers here unanimously commemorated the anti-war and anti-fascist festival, publishing many articles. The News published an editorial stating that the potential of the world's people to oppose war and uphold peace is many times stronger than that of fascist aggressors. The heroic Spanish people are working hard to resist the fascist attack, and the French masses have repeatedly defeated the Dela Rocque faction to protect democracy. Chinese national liberation fighters are resisting aggression with force. All of these are part of the forces defending peace and resisting the deadly enemies of mankind. Facts have proven that wherever the masses unite to form a united front, fascism will be defeated. The people of the world know that their efforts to defend peace will be supported by the Soviet working masses, because the Soviet Union is the only country that is fully committed to promoting the happiness of mankind. No matter how its neighbors to the east and west provoke it, the Soviet Union's policy of peace will never change. The Truth stated that the international situation is extremely serious. Fascist aggressors have completely revealed their faces and are engaging in small wars to prepare for future large wars. They will not hesitate to use any means of intimidation, provocation, sabotage, and terror, and will not hesitate to use money to buy spies, traitors, and assassins. On the other hand, since the founding of the Soviet Union through the October Revolution, it has strived to guarantee peace and expose the insidious plans of the challengers. The power of the Soviet Union is extremely great. This point is recognized not only by its friendly countries, which recognize the Soviet Union as a pillar of peace and a pioneer of true democracy, humanity, and culture, but also by its deadly enemies. This country, which possesses the most democratic constitution, aviation heroes, and a powerful Red Army, and which is led by the genius leader of the workers, Stalin, is truly invincible. If fascist adventurers dare to attack our socialist motherland and the fortress of world peace, they will undoubtedly be defeated. There is no room for compromise with aggressors. The so-called policy of non-interference and the policy of localizing war are very terrible, because concession to aggressors will not only fail to delay the war, but will make it break out even faster. This is known to the whole world. (TASS dispatch on the 1st)

[Moscow] The local newspapers, in their discussions of the anniversary of the outbreak of the World War and the International Anti-War and Anti-Fascist Day, mostly provided detailed accounts of the current international crisis. The News reported that the main challengers who had formed the so-called "Anti-Comintern" agreement had all implemented open aggression. The current political situation had reached an extremely serious crisis, and a new imperialist massacre could break out at any time. Moreover, compromise with the aggressors was an extremely great danger, which would only make the aggressors even more rampant. The Truth stated that, with the open connivance of the bourgeois democratic powers, the German and Italian fascists were attempting to turn Spain into a training ground for preparing to attack Britain and France and launch a new war to redistribute markets. Germany was causing chaos throughout Europe, destroying France's allied Little Entente, and turning Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Greece into sources of raw materials and manpower, as well as military-economic appendages, in preparation for annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia.

In the Far East, the Japanese militarists were working hard to implement their plans to annex North China and enslave hundreds of millions of Chinese people. The Nine-Power Treaty had been torn to shreds, and the so-called "Open Door" principle had become a dead letter. They were attempting to place the fait accompli of their occupation of North China before Britain and the United States. At the same time, they were constantly provoking incidents on the Soviet and Mongolian borders. These crazy Japanese militarists, the fascists, were recklessly playing with fire, forgetting that if they dared to invade Soviet territory, they would undoubtedly crush their own skulls.

In the Mediterranean, Britain, which had previously held sole power over the sea, was bowing its head to a gang of Italian pirates. The cannons of the German and Italian interventionists were openly aimed at Gibraltar. The international situation was so tense that it could be described as extreme. The Red Army newspaper Red Star stated that the foundation of the Soviet Union's international policy was a policy of peace. The Soviet people had no need for war to achieve their great goals. We deeply knew that we were not fighting for peace alone. Our government was willing to join hands with all those who were willing to fight to consolidate world peace. (TASS dispatch on the 1st)

[Berlin] Today is the anniversary of the outbreak of the European War. Tens of thousands of representatives of veterans from the participating countries of the world held a commemorative rally at the World Games venue here. The organizer was the Welfare Association for Fallen Soldiers of the German National Socialist Party. The rally passed and issued a declaration to safeguard peace. German Defense Minister Blomberg delivered a speech, emphasizing the unity of the German troops who participated in the war and Germany under National Socialism. German youth leader Schirach also represented the rising stars of Germany in attending the meeting. Other countries that sent representatives to participate included Austria, Britain, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. In addition to Blomberg, German speakers included Berlin Mayor Bolti, Youth Group Leader Schirach, and Welfare Association President Oberlinderdober, all of whom vigorously emphasized Germany's enthusiasm for peace and the mission of participating soldiers in world cooperation. French Federation Chairman Pigou delivered a response in German on behalf of the various delegations, saying that Europe could no longer have a second war that would destroy world culture. What the participating soldiers longed for and needed was world peace. (National Maritime Telegram on the 1st)

### Excerpts of Exchanges Between Britain and Italy

The Mediterranean Agreement to Take Effect; the Western European Pact Could Spur Negotiations

[Rome] Foreign Minister Count Ciano received British Ambassador to Italy Sir Eric Drummond today. Well-informed Italian sources claim that Ambassador Drummond, after being away from his post for several days, returned to Rome yesterday. He exchanged private views with Foreign Minister Ciano on the current situation. This action has no bearing on the exchange of messages between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas, 2nd)

[Rome] The Italian government has formally announced that the semi-official Stefani News Agency's London branch has resumed operations as of yesterday. Reporters from other newspapers stationed in Britain will travel to London within the week. British newspapers had vehemently opposed Italy before the coronation of King George VI in May of this year, and the Italian government immediately ordered reporters stationed in Britain to return home until now. (Havas, 2nd)

[London] Regarding the reconciliation between Britain and Italy, well-informed British sources have officially stated that in early July, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini believed that his country might come into conflict with Britain. During the first week of that month, he sent a handwritten letter of eight pages to German leader Hitler. The content stated that Britain's policy in the Mediterranean had aggressive implications and asked for Germany's opinion. He urged that Germany issue a declaration to aid Italy, in which case war could be avoided; otherwise, if war broke out, Italy would suffer a crushing defeat, and Germany would also follow suit. This was subsequently discovered by the British government, and Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech to the House of Commons on July 19 to reassure Italy: "After receiving certain information from a certain source, I solemnly guarantee that the English language does not contain words equivalent to 'revenge'." Recently, British Prime Minister Chamberlain also personally handed a letter to Italian Ambassador Grandi, asking him to convey it to Prime Minister Mussolini, and reiterated the guarantee made by Foreign Secretary Eden, but on the condition that Italy respect freedom of Mediterranean traffic and the current situation there. In addition, Chamberlain suggested that the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany hold a meeting in London in October of this year to establish a Western European Pact. All relevant countries must hold talks in preparation. Chamberlain also said that he had originally intended to travel to Rome to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini, but was unable to do so due to his official duties. (Havas, 2nd)

[London] The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent wrote an article discussing the possibility of a meeting of the signatories of the Locarno Pact—Britain, Germany, France, and Italy—stating that British Prime Minister Chamberlain had already proposed this meeting, and that it would likely open in London in October. The correspondent claimed that Chamberlain had instructed Foreign Secretary Eden to sound out Germany and Italy on this proposal. The correspondent also mentioned the possibility of Eden visiting Rome. It is said that German Foreign Minister Neurath and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano may both attend this meeting, but Ciano's participation would likely be conditional on the recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. The correspondent said that Chamberlain hoped to clarify various disputes in Europe and believed that signing a new Western European Pact was the best way. (Kuomin News Agency, 2nd)

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Italian Ambassador Grandi a few days ago to discuss Mediterranean and European issues. The Prime Minister also handed a letter to the Italian Ambassador to be delivered to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, expressing his admiration. Those responsible are still adopting a reserved attitude regarding this matter. However, Grandi requested a conversation with Prime Minister Chamberlain today, presumably to deliver Prime Minister Mussolini's recent letter to Chamberlain. Well-informed sources hope that Chamberlain's letter to Mussolini will allow the Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement, signed by Britain and Italy in January of this year, to be re-enacted and believe that Britain's various proposals for the Mediterranean and European affairs, as clearly stated by Foreign Secretary Eden, will not be changed by the exchange of documents between the British and Italian leaders. (Havas, 1st)

[Rome] Italian officialdom and diplomatic circles today are expressing that opinions among various countries regarding the non-intervention plan have gradually become less divergent. Although Soviet Russia has refused to compromise on the belligerent rights of the Spanish rebels, the international monitoring plan may still be salvaged. The most optimistic development appears to be the note from British Prime Minister Chamberlain to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, indicating that Britain is prepared to peacefully resolve various issues between Britain and Italy. Some believe that Britain is prepared to recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and recognize the belligerent rights of the Spanish rebels. This action by Britain seems to be due to the rebels' continued victories and the increasing weakness of European unity. At the same time, the crisis between China and Japan also seems to be the motive for Britain's desire to resolve European issues as soon as possible. (Kuomin News Agency, 1st)

### Various Newspapers Speculate on the Possibility of Anglo-Italian Rapprochement

The Issues of Spain and Abyssinia May Also Be Resolved Consequently

[London] Following the exchange of messages between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, various newspapers here believe that there is a good possibility of rapprochement between Britain and Italy. The Times also published a commentary stating that Prime Minister Mussolini's letter to Prime Minister Chamberlain has likely indicated that the Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement, signed by Britain and Italy in January of this year, should be put into effect. In addition, Foreign Secretary Eden's long declaration in January should also be used as a basis for resolving the general problems of the Mediterranean and Europe. Prime Minister Chamberlain's reply naturally expresses the same wish, believing that the current misunderstandings between Britain and Italy should be dispelled. The Daily Mail reported that one of the reasons for the failure of Britain and Italy to approach each other is Britain's non-recognition of Italy's conquest of Abyssinia. Regarding this, British Prime Minister Chamberlain has recently informed the British government that it intends to express its approval of the legal recognition of the Italian Empire at the general meeting to be held on September 10 this year. The Morning Post reported that since the Abyssinian incident, there have been countless outstanding issues between Britain and Italy. Now that there is an opportunity to resolve these outstanding issues, it would be a great pity to let it slip. As for the rumor that Foreign Secretary Eden is about to visit Rome, as far as we know, the authorities currently have no such plan. The Liberal Party's Manchester Guardian stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain is now sending a letter of friendship in his personal capacity to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in order to re-affirm the principles contained in the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement of January this year. The current situation is the same as in January this year. Britain hopes to eliminate the points of disagreement with Italy, but whether in London or Rome, Britain is very different from what it was in January. When the Anglo-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement was signed, Italian expeditionary forces were continuously heading to Spain. The signing of the Gentlemen's Agreement was intended to resolve this issue. Now, however, Italian troops are fighting alongside the Nationalist forces in Spain, which has become a fait accompli and is one of the most serious disputes between Britain and Italy. For the present, if the relationship between Britain and Italy is to be improved and made lasting and effective, it must be sought outside the Spanish war. This is indeed the same tendency in London and Rome. The Labor Party's Daily Herald condemned Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for engaging in anti-British conspiracies in Palestine and for attempting to restore the ancient territory of the Roman Empire, making Syria a province of the Empire, and including Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine all in it. (Havas, 2nd)

### Philippine Flood Disaster

[Manila] Continuous rain in the Philippines has caused widespread flooding, rendering most of Luzon Island's harvest hopeless. Countless houses have been washed away, and numerous people have drowned. Five floating corpses have been discovered.

The Army Ministry issued an order today appointing Infantry Colonels Kato Morio and Motogi Hogo as members of the Ordnance Headquarters.

To strengthen the military police, the Army Ministry has decided to abolish the existing Gendarmerie Training School and establish a Gendarmerie School. The school ordinance was promulgated on July 31. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)

### Last Batch of Japanese Residents in Shantou Departed Yesterday

Documents from the Japanese Consulate in Shantou Had Already Been Shipped to Taiwan; Japanese Warships and Planes Repeatedly Discovered in Chao-Shan Waters and Airspace

Shantou Correspondence: The situation here is becoming increasingly serious. On July 28, the fourth batch of Japanese residents was gathered at the Great East Ice Factory, and steamships dispatched by the Japanese warships Matsukaze and Harukaze took them to the Fukien Maru, which left Shantou that day. The Japanese residents who had not yet left Shantou were gathered at the Japanese Consulate on Shen Zhao Road and were scheduled to return to Keelung aboard the Hong Kong Maru on August 2. This is the last batch; after this, Japanese ships will no longer sail to Shantou, expressing their determination. Missionaries from various countries in Chaozhou and Meizhou have been gathering in Shantou under the orders of their respective consuls in preparation for retreating to safe areas if necessary. On the 29th, the Mingsheng Steamship passed through Shantou from Shanghai en route to Hong Kong. Many people from all walks of life purchased tickets to leave Shantou. The ship, which originally carried 400 passengers, now carried 800 passengers. On the 30th, the Sichuan and Haitan ships passed through Shantou en route to Hong Kong, each carrying over 1,300 passengers. There was no room to stand in the cabins. Ticket prices rose two or three times, but they were still difficult to obtain. As for those who moved inland to take refuge, they were like a tidal wave. The price of Hong Kong paper currency rose sharply as a result, and grain prices also rose. The scene in the market was like being in a wartime state. On the afternoon of the 30th, Chen Huanzhang, chairman of the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, specially convened representatives of various guilds to discuss measures to maintain order in the market during the emergency period. They also resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting it to quickly exempt the import tax on foreign rice so that the people could purchase and store it sufficiently. They also requested the government to negotiate with the British and American consuls, requesting them to quickly empty the oil stored in the Mobil Oil Company, Asia Petroleum Company, and Texaco oil depots in Qilu and transport it inland for storage to avoid danger during wartime. The merchants also quickly formed a rescue team and asked various community support groups to assist in the organization and to enlarge the air defense rescue team. Edo, commander of the Japanese 5th Destroyer Squadron, accompanied Yamazaki Seiichi, the Japanese consul in Shantou, to meet with Mayor Huang on July 28, making unreasonable demands: ㊀ The municipal government must ban the people's anti-Japanese support associations and disband patriotic groups; ㊁ Barge transport workers must load and unload passengers and goods for Japanese ships; ㊂ Chinese workers employed in various Japanese shops must resume work, and all porters must transport goods for Japanese people; ㊃ Chinese merchants must not discriminate against Japanese people buying food and must fully supply tap water. The municipal government replied that the government could not interfere with the people's patriotic actions. As for tap water and food, they are still being supplied as usual. Our government has always treated the protection of foreign residents equally, etc.

When the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the Japanese immediately transferred merchant ships operating on the South China line, such as the Tangshan Maru, Fengshan Maru, Lushan Maru, Daikyu Maru, Shengjing Maru, Koshu Maru, Songshan Maru, Chiri Maru, Mexico Maru, and Chicago Maru, to North China to transport troops, leaving only the Hong Kong Maru, Guangdong Maru, and Fukien Maru operating on the Taiwan, Amoy, Shantou, and Hong Kong lines to transport Japanese residents back to Taiwan. Currently, four-fifths of the Japanese residents in Shantou and Guangzhou have left the country. Important documents from the consulate and the accounting books of various Japanese merchant firms were all transported to Taiwan a few days ago. All of these actions are extremely noteworthy.

Recently, foreign warships have often been discovered in the waters of Chao-Shan, in teams of two or three. Sometimes they are docked at Dongshan Brothers Island, or Zhao'an Budaiao, or Nan'ao Wuyu. At night, they repeatedly use searchlights to illuminate our coastal villages. Sometimes silver-gray planes fly out from the waters where the warships are located, circling the border between Fujian and Guangdong, passing through Meixian, Heyuan, and the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River in a circular reconnaissance before returning to the sea. Every time they arrive at a city, they fly low to take photographs. At noon on the 30th, planes with silver-gray wings and red sun emblems circled over Heyuan City for about five minutes. Du Qing, the magistrate of Heyuan County, immediately sent urgent telegrams to Guangzhou and Shantou to report. (July 31)

### After the Outbreak of the War in Hebei, the Volunteer Armies in Northern Manchuria Are Highly Active

Taking Advantage of the Transfer of the Kwantung Army to Pingjin; Launching Attacks in Different Directions; Heavy Casualties Among Japanese Troops

Harbin Correspondence: Volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast, hearing that the Japanese army had invaded Pingjin and that war had broken out, and that the Kwantung Army had been transferred to support the operations inside the Pass, believed that the Japanese forces in the Northeast at this time were weak. They took the opportunity to become active. The information on the volunteer armies in Northern Manchuria is recorded as follows:

The Japanese troops stationed in Northern Manchuria to maintain the puppet regime are the garrison troops under the command of the Okamura Detachment in Harbin. In recent days, due to attacks by volunteer armies, they have had few peaceful days. On July 17, near Lijiiawaizi, about seven kilometers west of Nantianmen in Fangzheng County, volunteer army leaders Ming Yang, Ji Feng, Zhou Ren, and others joined forces with more than 300 troops and engaged in battle with the Urayama Detachment of the Japanese Saeki Detachment for four hours. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses. Endō Eizaburō and Tanichi Heizo, infantry privates from Fukushima Prefecture in the Saeki Detachment's Nakazawa Detachment, were killed, totaling more than 15. There were also many wounded, including privates Kobayashi Shunichi, and Dojima Kan. Also, the Sakai Detachment engaged in battle with a joint force of about 140 volunteer troops led by the volunteer army leader Kyushu in the northern area of Yuanbaohe in Bin County at around 10:00 PM on July 16 for one hour. Both sides suffered losses, but the details are unknown. Also, on July 19, at dawn, the Fujibayashi Detachment surrounded about 140 volunteer troops led by volunteer army leader He Cai in Daziying, Bayan County. The volunteer troops bravely broke through the encirclement, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses.

### Jinan After the Fall of Pingjin

People Are Excited and Concerned About the War; Japanese Businessmen Have Already Ceased Operations

Jinan Correspondence: After the Hebei War broke out and Beiping and Tianjin fell successively, Jinan, close to Hebei and bordering the Bohai Sea to the east, is constantly affected by the war. The current situation in the market is reported as follows:

Citizens Are Concerned About the War

On the 28th, after the outbreak of the Battle of Pingjin, the news spread, and people were extremely nervous. In the afternoon, various newspapers obtained news from the Central News Agency that our army had recovered Fengtai and Langfang. At the same time, the radio station broadcast a report. The whole city was immediately elated. Various newspapers originally planned to issue extra editions, but they were stopped to avoid stimulating the public, as advised by the government. However, people from all walks of life called the newspaper offices to inquire about the news incessantly. However, the next day, the news of Song Zheyuan's withdrawal to Baoding was announced. Since then, news of the war has been pouring in, and the public has been paying close attention. The circulation of various newspapers has increased greatly, and the public reading rooms are especially overcrowded. Lecture halls use current events as the subject of lectures every day, and many people listen to them. From this, we can see that the citizens are concerned about the war.

Japanese Residents Have Completely Left Shandong

Most of the Japanese residents in Shandong are in Qingdao, about 20,000 people. There are about 100 along the Jiaoji Railway Line. In Jinan alone, there are about 1,600 or 1,700 people. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Japanese residents along the Jiaoji Railway Line and in Jinan have been moving to Qingdao one after another, mostly women and children. On the 30th, the Japanese specially chartered a train from the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, which departed from Ji'dong. All the Japanese residents along the way were able to get on the train and go to Qingdao to board ships to return to their country. It is said that by now, Japanese residents along the Jiaoji Railway Line have completely withdrawn. In Jinan, only one or two young people are left to guard the doors of Japanese shops. The population is only a few hundred.

Overview of Railway Transportation

There are very few passengers traveling north on the Jinpu Railway these days. On the 30th, the northbound express train only went to Cangzhou. Another slow train from Cangzhou went to Yangliuqing. On the 31st, it was heard that our side had a significant advantage in the battle in Tianjin, and the location of through traffic is expected to improve. Passenger trains from Jinan to the south are very crowded, with many family members of military and political personnel, some returning to Henan and some going to Jiangsu. Comparatively, there are more people going to Henan. Women, children, and luggage are extremely crowded. The travel time cannot arrive according to the original scheduled time. The Jiaoji Railway from Qingdao to Jinan is still in a normal state, but freight traffic is less than usual.

Transactions in Various Industries Are Sluggish

After the start of the Tianjin War, banknotes from the China, Communications, Agricultural, and Hebei banks in Tianjin are not easily circulated. Banks in this city do not accept them. On the afternoon of the 30th, Tianjin Communications Bank banknotes could be used for shopping, but Hebei Provincial Bank banknotes were still rejected in the market. As for transactions in various industries, the grain industry association mainly deals in wheat. From the 30th, various flour mills stopped buying due to the situation, so the grain industry association's situation was sluggish and grain transactions were rare. The most cotton was bought by the Toyo Cotton Spinning Factory. Usually, several thousand bales could be traded in a day. Now, the foreign firms have stopped buying for several days in preparation for returning to their country. Chinese spinning mills also buy less cotton. No one cares about lotteries.

Support Associations Have Been Established

The Education Community's Joint Association of Secondary Schools and above and the Provincial Joint Association of Elementary School Teachers have telegraphed President Chiang one after another a few days ago, requesting him to send troops and vowing to support the four proposals of the Lushan talks. They also telegraphed Song Zheyuan to resist the enemy and defend the territory. Students have also organized anti-Japanese support associations and issued declarations. They originally planned to report to all walks of life at the Lixia Pavilion of Daming Lake on the 30th, but it was not held due to police interference. (July 31)

### 松江

Consulting on Stabilizing Prices

Since the outbreak of war in Hebei, prices here have risen accordingly, especially for daily necessities such as rice, wheat, vegetables, tofu, coal, kerosene, and rice straw, greatly affecting the livelihoods of ordinary people.

However, due to rising prices, rice merchants are still actively selling and transporting rice out of the county. The Support Association for Resistance Against the Enemy is paying close attention to this matter and has consulted with the county authorities on measures to stabilize prices and prohibit the export of rice and grain to stabilize public sentiment.

### Conducting National Salvation Donations, the Support Association for Resistance Against the Enemy Writes to Various Trade Associations to Determine the Outline for Donations

The Collection of Huge Sums Depends on Collective Strength; Items of Value Are Accepted

The Shanghai All-Circles Support Association for Resistance Against the Enemy, considering that we are at the final juncture and the government has the determination to fight to the last inch, our people should contribute all they have to relieve the national crisis.

The association has determined the work outline of the fundraising committee and has sent letters to various trade associations to jointly assist in the implementation. The original text of the letter and the work outline are recorded below:

Letter to Various Trade Associations

Esteemed colleagues, the country has reached its final juncture. There is no survival without resistance. The launch of resistance may not happen in a day, and the duration of resistance must be sustainable and must rely on strength. The accumulation of strength cannot happen overnight. In view of this, the association has launched a national salvation donation, has issued a declaration, designated collection agencies, appointed custodian committee members, and published announcements in newspapers. All circumstances are hopefully understood. However, this matter is of great importance and is related to the fundamental salvation of the country. In terms of time, it must be long-lasting; in terms of space, it must be universal; and the collection of huge sums must rely on collective strength. A copy of the work outline is now enclosed. It is hoped that your association will actively discuss fundraising methods and implement them quickly. Furthermore, select nine to twenty-one representatives, so that the association can send letters of invitation to serve as fundraising committee members for national salvation donations in various industries. National salvation is an arduous task. The final victory depends on perseverance. Please do not be overly excited by the situation at hand or unduly disheartened. Encourage colleagues to shoulder the great responsibility together. This is what we hope for. Wishing you all the best.

### The French Concession Police Authority Issues a Notice, Responsible for Protecting Public Security

Printed Bilingual Notice in Chinese and English, to Be Issued and Posted Today

The French Concession Police Authority, in view of the recent severe escalation of the Sino-Japanese situation and the panic among the people in this city, has printed a bilingual notice in Chinese and English to strive for order and tranquility within the concession. The general content is that it will absolutely be responsible for protecting all public security issues within the French Concession. The notice will be issued and posted today.

Mrs. Chen Xing

The Anti-Enemy Association in Hebei Province will start the war. The brave soldiers on our front line who are fighting for the survival of the nation need supplies, which rely on the support of the people in the rear. The Shanghai office of the 29th Army received hundreds of sets of short shirts and pants donated by Mrs. Chen Xing, the vice president of the Central Bank, and two large bundles of medicinal cotton gauze donated by the Zhenjiang China National Products Company yesterday. These items are extremely important for the front line and have been transported to the front for use.

New Medicine Industry

The National New Medicine Industry Federation and the Shanghai New Medicine Industry and Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, considering that the enemy is using artillery and airplanes in the Tianjin area, throwing bombs and bombing, and the affected military and civilians are in urgent need of rescue and medicine should be prepared, have jointly formed a special committee. Representatives have been elected to serve as committee members, divided into general affairs, supply, investigation, and donation groups, specializing in handling this rescue matter.

### A Gentleman from the Economic Community Returns to Shanghai from Lushan, Talking About the Determination of Senior Military Officers to Resist the War

Japan Is Trapped in Financial Difficulties, the War Will Be Difficult to Sustain, If We Can Persevere, Victory Will Belong to Us

The Shenshi News Agency reports that a gentleman from the economic community in this city, who participated in the Lushan Talks, returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to the talks in Lushan, he had met and talked with many senior military officers, all of whom were extremely indignant at the Japanese invasion of North China and had the determination to sacrifice themselves and were willing to go to the front to resist the war. Although the enemy has many airplanes and artillery, we can bravely fight hand-to-hand, and the enemy cannot use such machines. During the European War, the troops of various countries on the battlefield, including supplies and ammunition costs, required about eleven yuan per person per day. Now that the currencies of various countries have depreciated and prices have risen, the requirements are even higher. Even at one yuan, if the Japanese participate in the war with 100,000 people, they will need one million yuan per day and three hundred million yuan per year. If the number of people increases, the cost will naturally increase accordingly. Japan's economic and financial situation is also nearing exhaustion. If we engage in a long-term war of resistance, Japan's finances will also be difficult. Moreover, among military expenses, military equipment and bullets are the largest items. Even if Japan issues more banknotes, it will be difficult to maintain the supply of equipment and ammunition. As for the fact that Japanese goods cannot be sold in our country as a result, its national treasury revenue and expenditure will deteriorate further. Someone has calculated that during the European War, an average of 60 shells only injured one person. If our country is prepared to sacrifice one million people, the Japanese will have to spend 60 million shells. In terms of military equipment, it will be difficult to sustain. We are not concerned about sacrificing ourselves to defend the country. Even if the Japanese kill ten enemies with one, the deaths and injuries of 100,000 people will have a serious impact on the country. Therefore, it is most important for us to resist the war for a long time. If we can persevere for one or two years, even if there is no military victory, the actual victory will still belong to us.

Official Notice

The Exchange issued two notices: ㊀ The Ministry of Finance instructed, "The government's public debt credit is well-established. The Ministry has consistently strived to consolidate debt credit, which is well-known both domestically and internationally. Recently, some unscrupulous individuals, lacking understanding of the overall situation, have sought to profit by taking advantage of opportunities, causing fluctuations in the bond market and affecting finances, which is deeply regrettable and must be strictly prohibited to maintain the bond market and stabilize finances. It is hereby stipulated that from the 2nd of this month, the lowest bond price standard for various transactions of the unified public bonds due in August and September shall be 70 yuan for every 100 yuan face value of types 'E' and 'D'.

### Typhoon Strikes Ningbo and Shanghai Coasts; Shipping Suspended

If the Wind Direction Does Not Change, It Will Strike This Port This Afternoon; Over Ten Chinese and Foreign Merchant Ships Halt Mid-Voyage

A powerful typhoon from the Pacific Ocean, as of yesterday afternoon, the storm was only 460 nautical miles from Shanghai. All ships from Shanghai to the Zhejiang coast have been suspended since 5:00 PM, due to the Jianghai Customs hanging a black ball warning of an approaching storm. The Ningbo liners and others have stopped running. It is expected that the typhoon will reach Shanghai this afternoon. The details are as follows:

Typhoon Location

This typhoon originated in the Pacific Ocean, blowing from Taiwan and Ryukyu. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the typhoon was moving northwest from the East China Sea to Ryukyu. Currently (referring to 3:00 PM yesterday), the storm was at 125 degrees east longitude and 25 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, with wind force ranging from 7 to 10, a rare and ferocious intensity. If the direction does not change, it will blow directly to Ningbo. At 6:00 PM, the Xujiahui Observatory continued to report that the typhoon circle was 30 nautical miles wide, still located at 25 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude. From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, it remained in the same location, appearing to move slowly, but the direction remained northwest. The location is between Ryukyu and the South China Sea islands, approximately 460 nautical miles from Shanghai. If the direction does not change, it will strike Ningbo this morning and Shanghai by noon. However, considering that it did not move forward for four hours yesterday afternoon, perhaps this port can be avoided.

Hanging Ball Warning

At 4:45 PM yesterday, the Jianghai Customs, having received a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, learned that the typhoon's force and breadth of its circle were unprecedented. Its direction was from Ningbo to Shanghai, a very dangerous situation. They first hung a black ball on the Customs rooftop to report the impending storm, indicating that the typhoon was 100 nautical miles away. If it were within 100 nautical miles, two black balls would be hung. If it were approaching Shanghai, three black balls would be hung, and a cannon would be fired. After the black ball was hung, the Huangpu River issued an emergency warning of an approaching storm to prevent any major danger. After 5:00 PM, all small sampans, civilian boats, cargo lighters, and small steamers in the Huangpu River were moved to the small harbor around Gaochang Temple, with some going to Suzhou Creek to avoid danger. Merchant ships at the docks also doubled their mooring lines to prevent accidents such as dragging anchors.

Ningbo Liners Suspended

At 4:00 PM yesterday, the Taikoo Ning-Shao and other companies' New Beijing and New Ning-Shao Ningbo liners had already loaded cargo and passengers and were preparing to depart. By 4:45 PM, with the Customs hanging a black ball warning, the two companies decided to suspend the New Beijing and New Ning-Shao ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The shipowners were notified, and passengers who had boarded were informed of the reason for the suspension, which was to avoid the typhoon. Many passengers who had boarded temporarily returned to their Shanghai residences. The Wenzhou-Taiwan liner Zhoushan was also suspended. Other import and export ships that telegraphed to seek shelter and anchor mid-voyage included the China Merchants Bureau's Haili, anchored off Black Ox Island outside Wenzhou, and the Tonghua, anchored outside the Wusongkou. Over ten other foreign merchant ships from Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and others also anchored mid-voyage to seek shelter.

### Eurasia Kunming-Chengdu Flight Crashes in Kunming

Passengers and Mechanic Injured; Ministry of Transportation Handles Aftermath

Eurasia Airlines' large aircraft No. 18 on the Kunming-Chengdu route, piloted by a German pilot, took off from Kunming Airport at 12:20 PM on the 1st, carrying 13 Chinese and foreign passengers (including two Westerners). Unexpectedly, just over two minutes after takeoff, it was forced to land suddenly. The aircraft was damaged, and the passengers were injured. A New News Agency reporter visited the company's general manager, Li Jingzong, and secretary, Zha Zhenhu, yesterday morning to inquire about the cause of the accident and the handling of the aftermath. According to them, the company had received a report from the Kunming station chief.

Cause of the Accident

The accident was due to a problem with the engine. Just over two minutes after takeoff, a sudden obstruction occurred, forcing the aircraft to land. In addition, Kunming's terrain is high and dry, and the air is thin, making it difficult to control. As a result, the aircraft hit civilian houses during the descent, and the fuselage was severely damaged. Seven passengers sustained minor injuries, and the pilot, Heidangge, was also slightly injured. The mechanic was seriously injured, and the others sustained minor abrasions. They have been transported to Kunming Hospital for treatment. After receiving the telegram, the company immediately began to:

Handle the Aftermath

㊀ Telegraph the Kunming station chief to instruct on everything, such as immediately arrange special planes to take passengers to Shanghai for treatment if they wish to be treated in Shanghai. Otherwise, they will remain in Kunming for treatment. ㊁ Report the accident to the Ministry of Transportation. ㊂ Notify the insurance company to send personnel to inspect the extent of the damage to the aircraft. ㊃ Investigate the injuries of the passengers and compensate for the losses and bear all medical expenses during the treatment period in accordance with the company's regulations. After the aircraft No. 18 was damaged, another aircraft has been dispatched to replace it, so the Kunming-Chengdu route is now operating as usual.

### Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Requested Announcement of Measures to Punish Unscrupulous Merchants Yesterday

Meeting of No Private Sales Committee to Discuss

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Committee Against Private Sales, stating that the Coal Industry Association had inquired about whether there were any sanctions or guarantees against unscrupulous merchants in the industry who were invited to join the Committee Against Private Sales. The original letter is excerpted as follows: "We received your letter requesting that we forward it to relevant industry associations to lead them in pledging not to buy or sell private goods. After we forwarded the letter as requested, we received a reply from the Coal Industry Association on the 31st of this month, stating that they had received your notice of July 26th to earnestly carry out the pledge to complete the no-private-sales movement. We wholeheartedly agree with this patriotic movement and are willing to collectively exert effort to achieve practical results. If only a pledge not to buy or sell private goods is made, and no sanctions are imposed on those who violate the pledge, then this move would be futile. If there are sanctions but no guarantees, it would also be ineffective. In the past, when Liu River coal was seized by Taiji Company and transported to Shanghai under the name of Hebei coal for sale, unscrupulous merchants sold it. At that time, our association had a pledge, but it turned out that unscrupulous merchants had also joined. When we discovered the violations and imposed sanctions in accordance with the association's charter and resolutions, the unscrupulous merchants were able to enlist the support of powerful individuals to obstruct our sanctions. The appeals to various ministries and departments of the National Government remain unresolved. These painful facts from the past are documented and verifiable. Every time we think about it, we still regret it. Therefore, we are sending this letter to inquire with the Committee Against Private Sales regarding the sanctions and guarantees to be implemented. We would greatly appreciate a detailed reply to facilitate our handling of the matter." After receiving the letter, the Committee Against Private Sales will convene a meeting on the 4th to discuss detailed measures to punish unscrupulous merchants.

### Silk Factories Stop Work One After Another Due to the Impact of the Situation

Stop Buying Raw Materials and Sales Have Decreased Significantly; Domestic Sales Have Fallen by 100 Yuan per Load

After Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces banned the export of dried cocoons, Shanghai's silk factories ran out of raw materials. Hongchang and other factories were forced to stop work. The Silk Factory Association and the Silk Industry Unions of the 4th and 6th districts telegraphed to appeal for the revocation of the ban. A New News Agency reporter learned from the silk industry yesterday that recently, due to the severe situation, domestic silk factories have stopped buying raw materials, resulting in a sharp decline in the domestic sales of factory silk, almost to a standstill. The price has fallen from 850 yuan to 750 yuan per load. As for the foreign silk market, it remains quiet, at about 730-740 yuan per load. At the same time, because eight or nine of the silk factories are located in Zhabei and Hongkou, the number of workers going to work in the factories every day has decreased due to the impact of the situation, so the silk factories have stopped work one after another.

### Cement Company Requests Promulgation of Standard Cement Specifications

The cement industry has a history of several decades in China, but the testing methods and quality standards have not been promulgated in China and are still based on foreign regulations, resulting in confusion and inconsistency. The Chinese Shanghai Cement Company believes that this not only leaves manufacturers and consumers without clear guidelines, but also has a significant impact on national prestige. Therefore, it has compiled a draft specification with detailed explanations, printed it into a special booklet, and submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for review and promulgation. Regarding the standard sand used in cement testing, suggestions have also been made based on years of research. The original text of the company's submission to the ministry is copied below:

Submitting a report on the results of standard sand research and a draft of national Portland cement standard specifications, respectfully requesting review and promulgation to provide a standard and enhance national prestige. It has been found that all countries in Europe, America, and Japan have specifications for cement testing methods and quality standards, promulgated by the government for the entire country, so that manufacturers and consumers have guidelines to follow. Although the cement industry in China has a considerable history, such specifications have not yet been promulgated. As a result, factories in the same industry have always followed foreign regulations as the basis for expressing the performance of their products. Some use the British system, some use the German system, and some even use both the British and German systems, resulting in confusion and inconsistency. Although most factories now use the British system, its unit of calculation is different from our national system, which inevitably leads to the problem of cutting the feet to fit the shoes. Moreover, the standard sand used for testing must be ordered from abroad. Is it convenient for general testing or research? Is it appropriate in terms of national economic principles? It is also a question. It is believed that our country's industry is currently determined to innovate, and the standardization of industry should be strived for in order to improve the quality of products through comparison, which is a consistent proposition of both the government and the people. If the above situation is followed, not only will the goal of standardization be difficult to achieve in the industrial field, but also the impact on national prestige is not insignificant. Our company has forgotten its limitations and, in September of the 23rd year, proposed to companies in the same industry to jointly formulate national cement standard specifications and submit them to the government for review and promulgation. Regarding the selection and manufacture of standard sand, each company was responsible for sampling and research to facilitate progress. Although no agreement has been reached, our company has always believed that this work is the duty of those engaged in the cement industry, and we are willing to contribute our modest efforts as long as it is helpful to the matter. It has taken several years, and the determination has not changed. It is believed that the formulation of national cement standard specifications should be based on the collection of domestic sand for the selection and manufacture of standard sand. Given the vast territory of our country and the many sources of sand, it is difficult for our company to collect samples for research on its own. Therefore, in July of last year, we submitted documents to your ministry and the Ministry of Railways and Education, requesting assistance. Your ministry approved Mining Letter No. 15381, instructing various mining companies to send sand samples, and also instructed our company to submit test reports for reference, as the Central Industrial Testing Institute of your ministry was also testing the raw materials, in order to achieve the effect of collaboration. The Ministry of Railways approved a circular ordering various railway bureaus to investigate and collect samples for testing, etc., each on file. At the same time, our company contacted academic institutions, groups, and universities across the country, requesting them to send samples on their behalf. Our company also sent personnel to various places to investigate and collect samples within the scope of its knowledge. As of December of last year, thanks to the support of various railway bureaus, mining companies, and groups, a total of 66 kinds of sand samples were received. Our company first analyzed and tested the standard sand of various industrially advanced countries to study the necessary conditions for its quality as a basis for selecting and manufacturing our own standard sand. At the same time, it was determined that the source of this sand should be abundant, the location should be appropriate, and the price should be low, so as to facilitate progress and convenient application. With this goal in mind, the received sand samples were subjected to long-term research. The results showed that the sand sample sent by the Tongxing Stone and Sand Factory in Zouxian, Shandong Province, notified by your ministry, was the most suitable. After refining, its quality was comparable to that of British standard sand. Zou County is quite close to the province and the capital, the location is appropriate, and transportation is convenient. Later, our company sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections and placed a large order. The source and price conditions also met the set conditions. Since then, our company has believed that the selection and manufacture of standard sand has been solved to a considerable extent before other more suitable sand is found. We then proceeded to draft cement standard specifications. The main points are to measure the current situation and habits of China's cement industry, and to refer to the regulations of various countries and the existing drafts of our country, carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages. All terms and units of calculation are aimed at facilitating understanding by the Chinese people and conforming to our national system. The "Draft Standard Specifications for Portland Cement," "Explanatory Notes for the Draft," and "Research on Standard Sand" have now been completed. We are aware that the above draft and research results may not be comprehensive in their assumptions and views. However, we believe that industrial standard specifications are being planned and established by your ministry, and a humble opinion may be helpful as a small stream contributing to the soil. Academic research has no end, and the needs of the times may change. Our company will continue to work hard with its original intention to contribute to the future of the cement industry. In addition to reporting future research results for selection, we will first state this in detail and send 20 kilograms of Zou County sand refined by our company, along with two types of printed materials, 10 copies of each type. Respectfully requesting your ministry to review and verify and send the above sand to the Central Industrial Testing Institute for testing. At the same time, we earnestly request you to consider domestic cement, which is an important industry in our country, and promptly review and promulgate standard specifications as soon as possible to provide a standard and enhance national prestige. Awaiting instructions and respectfully complying for the sake of public convenience. Respectfully presented to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry.

### The Public Works Department Will Re-Register Rickshaw Pullers

The Public Works Department of the Public Concession stipulates that each rickshaw should be registered with four pullers. However, whether the registered pullers actually pull the rickshaw has not been investigated. As a result, more and more registered pullers do not pull the rickshaw but go elsewhere or change their profession, causing rickshaw owners to feel the pain of having rickshaws but no pullers. Negotiations for improvement have been ineffective. Now, Yin Zhiling, director of the Special Zone Rickshaw Owners Association, has earnestly negotiated with the relevant authorities of the Public Works Department to improve the rickshaw puller system. The improvement of the rickshaw puller system has been approved by the last board meeting. Mr. Yin has received a formal letter from Mr. Philippe, the director-general of the Public Works Department, stating that he accepts Mr. Yin's request to improve the registered rickshaw puller system. The re-registration of rickshaw pullers will begin on October 1st. Each rickshaw will have four pullers, all of whom will be formally introduced by the rickshaw owner and must pull at least 15 shifts per month. In the future, each rickshaw owner must report the number of registered rickshaw pullers who pull 15 shifts per month and their mobility, so as to ensure that the number of registered rickshaw pullers is sufficient to control the number of rickshaws pulled. All rickshaw owners are delighted to hear this and will hold a meeting tomorrow at the association to notify all rickshaw owners and lessees to comply.

### Another Thief Arrested in the Case of the Robbery of a Dancing Girl's Home

At 4:35 AM on December 12th last year, the home of dancing girl Chen Lindi at 431 Bazilu was invaded by multiple thieves, who robbed her of gold jewelry and legal tender worth 243 yuan. She fought and escaped. Later, the police arrested two suspects, Lu Bingbing and Jiang Zhaofu, and sent them to the First Special District Court for punishment. The remaining accomplices could not be apprehended. The day before yesterday, the Municipal Police Bureau arrested Zhang Fafa, a thief in the case, who confessed that his accomplice, a woman named Lu Meimei from Tongzhou, was hiding in a house at 232 Hartung Road in the Concession. Zhao Zigan, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Police Station, secretly went with a Western detective to the address and arrested her, taking her to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, requesting an extension to bring Zhang Fafa to court for a joint trial. When questioned, the defendant admitted to participating in the robbery, but only acted as a lookout outside the door. The rest of her confession was evasive. Judge Zhong Qing ordered her to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### The End of the Debate in the Case of a Chinese Medicine Doctor Falsely Accusing His Wife of Adultery; Judgment Pending

Fierce Arguments Between Lawyers from Both Concessions; Order in the Court Almost Disturbed

Wu Shaoqin, a Chinese medicine doctor from Nanhui, accused his wife, Wu Jiangshi, of adultery with a relative at the Municipal Police Bureau. The bureau dispatched detectives Chen Weibang and others to catch them in the act.

They Found Nothing

As a result, Jiangshi and Chen sued Wu for false accusation at the Local Court. Prosecutor Wang investigated and determined that Wu Shaoqin had intentionally made a false accusation and filed a public prosecution according to law. Yesterday, Judge Wu continued the trial. First, detective Chen Weibang was questioned. He testified that he and his colleague, surnamed Jiang, were ordered to catch them in the act, but they did not catch anyone and did not search for evidence. Then, the local patrol chief Gao Yucheng testified that the detectives came and went with us. Later, Wu Jiangshi's daughter-in-law, Wu Tangshi, said that there were judgments from previous lawsuits between her mother-in-law and father-in-law at home and wanted to

Bring them as Evidence

So the patrol officer called me to accompany her to get them. At that time, Wu Shaoqin still refused, etc. At this point, Wu Tangshi testified that she was 26 years old and was at her mother's house on that day, while her mother-in-law was at my mother's house. Later, when she heard that her mother-in-law was sick, she wrote a letter, and I came back, but the matter had already happened. The next day, my mother-in-law called me to get a package of evidence, including judgments, which was refused by Wu Shaoqin. Later, it was taken to the police station and shown to the patrol officer, and then handed over to my mother-in-law, etc. At this point, Wu Shaoqin testified that this package of things was not a judgment but slippers and clothes, which were destroyed by them. Moreover, I went to my own home to

Catch them in the Act, But Could Not

And that was the end of it. Why do you want to prosecute me? The judge said, "You went to your own home, why did you want the police detectives to accompany you? This is the result of your accusation at the police station." Wu replied, "I am being sued, and I still have to catch them in the act?" At this point, Wu Jiangshi and Chen Zhisheng, etc., separately hired lawyers to file civil lawsuits, requesting legal action and publishing an apology to restore their reputation. During the trial, the plaintiff's lawyer and the defendant's lawyer argued fiercely, almost disrupting the order. The plaintiff also attacked the defendant's lawyer, saying that he was helping a false accusation and could not act as a defense lawyer. After the judge stopped them, the debate was concluded, and the judgment was pending.

### Pregnant Woman Run Over and Killed by Car

Later, Patrolman No. 997 spotted her and sent the injured woman to the hospital in an ambulance. However, she died before reaching the hospital due to her serious injuries. It was heard that she was about six months pregnant.

Lawyer Wu Guotai, known as Tieshan, was 80 years old and a native of Jiangpu, Jiangsu. He joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association as a member in September of the 7th year of the Republic of China and was the oldest member of the legal profession. He also excelled in calligraphy and painting and was devoted to public welfare. He was also a veteran member of the Kuomintang. Since the summer of this year, due to old age and weakness, he had been suffering from illness. However, when the Tianjin Incident broke out and the war broke out, his patriotic heart was cut, and his pain increased sharply. Medicine was ineffective, and he suddenly died at his residence at 79 Dajing Street, Jiu Mu Di, the day before yesterday. After the Shanghai Lawyers Association received a report from Shen's family yesterday, it reported the withdrawal from the association to all levels of the court in accordance with the regulations.

### Jiang Zhao Zhou, Accomplice in Sun Shaoqing Case, Indicted

The Crimes Committed are Exactly the Same as Jiang's; One Interrogation Was Conducted Yesterday, and the Hearing Was Rescheduled

Sun Shaoqing, a former patrolman, and Jiang Zhao Zhou, a lawyer who incited litigation, formed the Shuguang Law Firm to solicit lawsuits and extort money by means of intimidation. Over the years, they have gained no less than tens of thousands of yuan. Recently, Lu Liankui, the Chief Inspector of the Public Concession Police, and Liu Shaokui, the Detective, received accusations from Fang Nianxuan and others. They also obtained Sun and Zhou's solicited lawsuits and

Extorted Money

In Detail, including: ㊀ Shi Daoshi sued Shi De for defamation, resulting in a settlement of 40,000 yuan; ㊁ Cheng Lichuan sued Zhao Yuting's son, settled for 30,000 yuan; ㊂ Zhang Abao sued Xu Maotang and his son for adultery, without prosecution, settled for 18,000 yuan; ㊃ Zhu Fangshi sued Ying Yuwen, settled for 3,000 yuan; ㊄ Sun Wushi sued Wu Dengying for property division, settled for 60,000 yuan; ㊅ Wu sued Yang Heqing for seduction, settled for 50,000 yuan; ㊆ Jiang Guopei sued Jiang Yangshi for property division, obtained 50,000 yuan; ㊇ Cheng Fangshi

Sued Jiang Xingjie

Obtained 60,000 yuan; ㊈ Lu Zhushuang sued Lu Kouzeng for property division, obtained 67,000 yuan; ㊉ Pan Xueyan sued Xu Maotang for abandonment, obtained 30,000 yuan; ㊉㊀ Ma Chenshi sued Ma Honggen for property division, not yet settled; ㊉㊁ Chen Jiancheng sued Chen Chunan for property division, no settlement method; ㊉㊂ Xu Yuying sued Ji Juemi for rape, no money obtained, etc. Lu arrested Sun and his wife, Sun Zhu, and handed them over to the First Special District Court for trial. Sun was sentenced to five years in prison, and Sun Zhu was sentenced to one year in prison. The appeals

Were Also Rejected

Although both filed third-instance appeals, Sun Zhu's third-instance appeal was rejected because it had exceeded the statutory period and no statement of reasons had been submitted. Jiang Zhao Zhou was on the run at the time. Now, Detectives Zhang Yunhong and Yang Xiguang arrested him in Nanjing and handed him over to the First Special District Court for detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court heard the case. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, saying that the "Shu" character in Shuguang Law Firm was the same as the "Shu" character in the name of another defendant, Jiang Shu, and that Fang Nianxuan and others had

Provided Evidence

Therefore, the defendant's case was exactly the same as Sun's case. Therefore, he was also prosecuted under Article 157, Paragraph 2, and Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Jiang Zhao Zhou claimed that the Shuguang Law Firm was established by lawyer Yang Liufeng in the 20th year and was first located at No. 1 Meilanfang, Beile Road, and later moved to No. 424 Poplar Road, where I lived. He is now the director of the Military Law Department of the Aviation Commission. I have absolutely nothing to do with it. He completely denied the accusations made by the police about him and Sun Shaoqing extorting money by intimidation. After Judge Feng questioned him, he ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### Eradicating Traitors

– Parker

The term "traitor" was probably coined not too long ago. However, the history of traitors in China is "never-ending." Hong Chengchou, who came from the ranks of successful candidates in the imperial examination, bowed and declared himself a subject once captured, shouting "Long live the Emperor" to the Qing Emperor. Qin Hui sued for peace by ceding land, and Zhai Ruwen cursed him as a spy for the Jin people. Regardless of their form, these figures can probably be considered "typical traitors."

Currently, figures such as Zheng Xiaoxu and Yin Rugeng have once again taken the stage as puppets, serving the enemy and not knowing the meaning of shame. However, people who are unwilling to be slaves will eventually rise up. When the security team in Tongzhou revolted, Yin Rugeng became like a turtle in a jar. It is now said that he has been executed. This news is gratifying enough. What is gratifying is not only the capture of the traitor but also the "heart that yearns for the Han." It is believed that in the near future, such righteous events will continue to occur among the oppressed.

When launching a full-scale war, the elimination of traitors is indeed an important and urgent task. History has given us many valuable lessons. The fall of a country is definitely not solely due to "external troubles" but to "internal worries." Because of internal worries, not only is the power of the soldiers fighting on the front lines dispersed, but they also take the opportunity to disrupt the rear and give the enemy an opportunity to exploit. The past can only be temporarily left unsaid, but the future is indeed worthy of our concern. We not only hope that the government authorities will use their greatest power to eliminate traitors, but we also hope that every citizen will understand the horror of traitors destroying the country and resolutely take on the responsibility of reporting and eradicating them. To show its determination not to succumb, the government should immediately take "action" to defend the country and gain the support of the people. A large-scale crackdown on traitors should be the starting point of this "action" because it fully demonstrates the government's determination to resist the enemy!

However, there are indeed many types of traitors, large and small, overt and covert, and they are extremely difficult to identify. Those who are exploited by the enemy to create chaos in the rear belong to the overt category. They are easily identified, and it is not very difficult to eradicate them. Only those traitors who belong to the covert layer still appear to be patriotic on the surface but are actually betraying the country. They have beautiful wives and concubines and countless wealth that they have plundered. Once the war breaks out, wouldn't all of this be reduced to ashes? Therefore, they desperately advocate peace. Peace is another name for submission. "Anyone who speaks of peace again will be beheaded!"

Hasn't Chairman Chiang clearly declared that he is "unwilling to spare any sacrifice"? Unwilling to spare any sacrifice is a sign of determination not to succumb. If there is no desire to succumb, then there is only war. How can these large and small traitors, who only seek personal gain and ignore the nation's survival, have the face to speak of peace again? Piercing their false masks and exposing their secrets will be the common responsibility of the government and the people in the future. Under the watchful eyes of the public and the pointing fingers of the crowd, their treacherous plans will be impossible to implement. And we believe that there are only a few real big traitors, and other ignorant people are being exploited. It is easy to make them realize their mistakes. As long as a full-scale war is launched, the opportunities for the enemy to threaten and lure will be reduced. At that time, the people of the whole country will stand on one front to fight for the survival of the nation and engage in a desperate struggle. From any point of view, the final victory will surely belong to us.

### Useless to Just Feel Indignation

— Jie Ren

During the "January 28th" Incident, the Oriental Library was destroyed by enemy artillery fire. Watching our cultural essence turn to ashes in the blazing flames, we felt extreme indignation, but all we did was feel indignation. Now, Nankai University has also been destroyed by enemy artillery fire. Our renowned cultural institutions are being destroyed by the enemy one after another. Can we only feel indignation?

We express our indignation, but this indignation will never end. The enemy is plotting against us, and its consistent policies are evident everywhere in politics, economics, and culture. The enemy deliberately sabotages our political, economic, and cultural construction. It's not just the Oriental Library and Nankai University. What's the use of our indignation? Absolutely useless!

Today, every citizen should have a minimum level of awareness: the enemy is deliberately trying to destroy us. There is absolutely no possibility of complacency. Besides resistance, we have no other path to take. Haven't we learned enough lessons? Are we still unenlightened to the very end?

The Central News Agency reported on July 30th about Nankai University being bombed by the enemy during the Tianjin battle, stating: "Since 1918, teachers and students in the classrooms have almost daily heard the enemy's shooting and aircraft sounds. However, due to Mr. Zhang's advocacy of strict training and saving the nation through study, the spirit of diligent effort has remained consistent. Regarding general impulsive patriotic advocacy, they have always maintained a calm and cautious attitude. Now, they are not even considered by the violence. This clearly proves the enemy's determination to fundamentally destroy our culture." What does this mean? Even the most stubborn people should awaken.

Under the enemy's iron heel, hoping for any "consideration" is fundamentally a dream, and the facts have long shattered this dream. Nankai University, which "always maintained a calm and cautious attitude toward general impulsive patriotic advocacy," is now "not even considered by the violence" and has been bombed. We should have a great sense of alert. Let's not dream of anything anymore. Thinking that concession can appease the situation is no different from seeking survival in the tiger's mouth. Do you really think it won't swallow you? Right now, there is only resistance. There is no other path.

We don't need to just feel indignation about the enemy's atrocities, because feeling indignation alone is useless. We need to retaliate with equal force and further drive the enemy out. That is the fundamental solution. The sacrifices are inevitable. Without sacrifice, there will be no achievement. May everyone remember this sentence. We are about to sacrifice everything and fight the enemy to the death! We must sacrifice everything and fight the enemy to the death!

### Anticipation

— Chen He

### A Corner of the Metropolis

— Jie Ren

Our second landlord is a small clerk in the tram company. His being a second landlord is not for comfort or to show off his wealth, but to make a little money and gain some small advantages. Therefore, this small three-story building is filled with all kinds of large and small mezzanines, in the stairwell, under the roof, everywhere. He himself lives in extremely bad rooms, while renting out the good ones to colleagues.

His family, like the large and small mezzanines in this building, is large. The sounds of babies being held, crawling on the ground, crying, filled this stuffy old house. For a period, his younger sister also moved in. She and another older sister originally worked in a Japanese cotton mill in Zhabei. She was fired for singing a few songs. She was only sixteen or seventeen years old, wearing a very fitting short coarse cloth outfit, her hair parted into two small braids, tied with black silk cloth. She exuded a completely innocent naivete.

Soon, we became familiar, and she often stuck her head out from her dark and stuffy mezzanine, jokingly, as I went up and down the stairs:

"Mr. Chen, any news?"

I shook my head, indicating there was none. "Aren't you going to work?"

"No! The factory doesn't want me anymore!" She smiled and retracted her head again.

In the evening, I returned home tiredly, and always ran into her at the entrance of the alley, carrying a package wrapped in paper, heading towards a stuffy street. It wasn't until late at night that she returned humming popular songs. She made the stairs groan loudly, slammed the mezzanine door shut, and while yawning, loudly sang the March of the Volunteers. Finally, she was exhausted, quiet, and rapid breathing replaced everything.

One morning, she abruptly pushed open my door and came in. I was already up. She handed me a newspaper in her hand and stood solemnly in the middle of the room, not saying a word.

"What's the matter?" I curiously stopped brushing my teeth.

"In our North China," she said softly and solemnly. "In our North China, the Japanese cannons are sounding!" Her thin, bright red lips trembled. "We usually hope that the War of Resistance will happen, but now that it has suddenly started, I am a little disappointed. Mr. Chen, do you think we will resist?…………"

I looked at her firmly and calmly. Her entire face was pale.

"We will resist. Don't you believe it? You just watch, we will resist," I replied.

She gave me a doubtful look and silently retreated.

I didn't see her all day. In the afternoon, I went out for a small errand, and at a street corner, someone suddenly stopped me. I looked up and it was her. Her face was red, sweat was pouring down, and she was holding a large bundle of propaganda materials. She handed me one, bowed her head low, and said:

"Mr. Chen, you are right, we will resist!"

Then, like a whirlwind, she disappeared into a crowd. I walked on, repeating: "We will resist."

When I returned home, it was around ten o'clock. The second landlord was shouting at his wife, his face full of anger, and the tenants were gathered at their door, quietly watching the continued development of the argument. I inexplicably returned to my room, wanting to sort out my thoughts for the day. The door opened and one of the tenants came in.

He simply told me the reason for the commotion:

The second landlord's younger sister went out with people to publicize Japan's acts of aggression and was caught by the detectives in the police station. She called her brother from the police station, and he bailed her out.

"But this girl doesn't know what's good for her," the tenant continued. "She and her brother were on their way home from the police station when they ran into some old comrades who were out doing propaganda. 'You go back alone!' she said to her brother, and ran off to find her comrades. Her brother saw that something was wrong and took her home, afraid that she would run away again, so he tied her up with a rope and locked her in the room. Who knew that when people weren't paying attention, she had bitten through the rope and ran out." Finally, he concluded: "This child is terrible, she lost her job for this kind of thing!" He said, satisfied and sneering, and left.

Remembering her excited, happy face, "We will resist!" I couldn't help but smile!

### Roar

— Chang Feng

The wind howls, the waves roar, the hot blood surges! Tens of thousands of compatriots, countless eyes – one goal: all towards the distant North China, stirring up an endless tide of grief and indignation! The shame of Fengtian has not yet been cleared, and new aggression has come again. We have been forced to the "final moment"! Why not resist? What are we waiting for? Listen! The roar of the entire nation! Has resounded through every corner. The invaders' artillery fire has awakened every compatriot! We vow not to be humiliated, not to be slaves of a conquered nation! We do not seek temporary peace, nor do we talk about unequal peace! We only have the resistance of iron and blood to maintain the integrity of our land and sovereignty! We only have the resistance of iron and blood to maintain the survival of the entire nation! (Half-hearted support)

say. "She and her brother wanted to go home from the police station, and on the way they ran into some old comrades who came out to promote - you go back alone! She said to her brother, and moved her feet and ran to find her companions. Her brother saw that something was wrong and took her home, fearing that she would run away again, so he tied her with a rope and locked her in the room. Who knows when people were not prepared, she had bitten the rope and ran out." Finally, he concluded: "This child is terrible, and she lost her job because of this kind of thing!" He left, satisfied and sneering.

Thinking of her excited, happy face, "We will resist!" I couldn't help but smile!

### Coast

— A Qiu

When the coast of Yantai was still three li away, the steerage class was already very chaotic. Several passengers who were seasick, pale-faced, looked up from the deck with expressions of joy, asking if we had reached the coast yet, and then collapsed again, covering their heads. Some children who saw the sea for the first time were lying on both sides of the deck, and joy made them forget the cold of the morning wind and the fear of the waves. The sailors, familiar with it as if it were their own home, pointed to a mountain lying in front of them, nonchalantly comforting some anxious people, saying: "Go around this mountain, and Yantai will be on the other side."

The coast of Yantai soon lined up in front of us. The small, delicate red houses set off against the sky-blue sea, like a beautiful scene of Chicago or the Rhine in an oil painting. The distant mountain peaks were painted in the back like a patch of gray light smoke. Two seagulls had not left our sight since the ship started, and now they were circling around the sides of the ship again. The coast of Yantai gradually became clear, and the gray ant colony was moving on the dock. The first impression the coast of Yantai gave us was joy, freshness, and the scent of the sea.

When we stepped onto the dock, several friends were already greeting us. Meeting friends on an island made us feel particularly happy, and the grievances we had suffered in the cabin for the past few days were also lightly dispelled.

As dusk approached, we took a sampan to find a place to stay in the city, because the dock was quite a distance from the city streets. Several fishing boats full of cargo passed us one by one, and from their lazy songs, we felt a sense of weariness, like a contagious disease. The setting sun also sank into the western sea.

Dimly, we used the mysterious tone of a stranger to inquire about the prosperity of this mysterious place from the boatman. We listened, estimating in our hearts the unexaggerated statements uttered by this middle-aged man, and his expressionless face gave us great disappointment. This place had nothing but some fishermen. Finally, this honest boatman coldly looked at us and said: "You came from Tianjin, what is there to see here!"

When we re-embarked on the coast, the sky was very blurry. Looking towards the opposite shore or a little further away, the sea and the sky were connected, turning into a faint gray-black. The only embellishment in the gray-black was the scattered sails, like stars. In the nearby area, the masts stood like a forest, swaying in the silvery air. I don't know which country's warship had grandly turned on its lights, and the lights were reflected from the sea, illuminating a large area of the sea. In this boundless desolation, this was the only embellishment. Our desolate sea!

We walked along the coast of Yantai towards our lodging, until this coast could no longer be seen.

### Face Spectrum

— Shou

(Nanjing, 1st dispatch) According to reports from relations in the capital: Two organizations have appeared in Tianjin. One is that Bian Shoujing received a telegram from Zhang Zizhong; he informally assumed the position of mayor at the Jinde Society on the afternoon of the 31st and internally appointed Shen Dijia, Nie Xiangxi, Lu Nansheng, etc., to serve as directors of the city's bureaus. The second directed puppet organization is the so-called local security maintenance association, which was established at noon on the 1st. The members are Gao Ling, Wang Zhulin, Wang Xiaoyan, Shen Xianwu, Fang Yaoyu, etc., eleven people in total. Most of these people were picked up by Japanese military police in separate cars on the morning of the 1st. The meeting was held at the National Hotel at noon, with Gao as the chairman. It is said that they will work at the Hebei Mint on the 2nd and draft a public notice to appease the people, which will be issued on the 2nd. At the same time, they will handle the restoration of traffic and the stabilization of local affairs. It is found that the above two organizations have no connection. It is feared that the former will not be able to perform its duties due to lack of Japanese support.

According to Reuters Tianjin dispatch: The Tianjin Security Maintenance Committee has been established, with Gao Ling as the chairman. The new police chief, Li Jingyang, summoned the police on the 31st and instructed them to wear winter black uniforms and continue to serve as usual to avoid confusion with the yellow-gray uniforms of the security team.
