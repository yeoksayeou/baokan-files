### Our Troops Automatically Withdrew to the First Line of Defense According to Plan

The purpose is to get rid of the threat of enemy naval gunfire. The new positions on this line have been carefully arranged. The enemy once attacked Liuhang but was repelled by our forces.

Central News Agency reports that a spokesperson for our army stated that since the beginning of the Shanghai battle, our side has actively taken the offensive in areas such as Hongkou and Yangshupu, and the enemy's positions have become increasingly cramped. Our side had long anticipated that after the enemy reinforcements, they would inevitably repeat the old trick of January 28th, using the superior naval firepower along the Yangtze River estuary to cover the landing. Our army had already decided on a plan for operations along the river, launching courageous attacks at the time of their landing to inflict heavy losses and prolong their time. After they landed, they would be prevented from communicating with each other. Now this plan has been implemented step by step. The losses suffered by the enemy are unprecedented. Now that the goal has been achieved, since the day before yesterday, we have automatically withdrawn to the first line of defense according to the planned schedule. The purpose is to gradually get rid of the threat of enemy naval gunfire and introduce them to land-based positional warfare. Our army's new positions were arranged last night. There will be major developments in the war from now on.

Reliable sources report that since the situation in Yanghang and Yuepu became tense, our army has immediately held on to the new positions and built solid defensive works to avoid the enemy's naval power and vowed to annihilate the enemy's strength through land warfare. Now our army, from Qingyun Road and Baziqiao in Zhabei, to Jiangwan and Miaohang, to a certain place two miles west of Yanghang, to Luodian, the new positions have been completely arranged, and we are waiting in battle, vowing to inflict heavy damage on the enemy and weaken their land combat strength.

### Our Troops in the City Center Moved to the North Station, Jiangwan, and Sheng Yi Area

If the enemy attacks again, they will be severely hit. The remnants of the enemy in Luodian are still being strictly blocked from advancing.

Central News Agency reports that in the Battle of Yanghang, our loyal and brave soldiers fought the enemy's artillery fire with their flesh and blood, fighting fiercely for two days and nights. The front lines advanced and retreated repeatedly. Although our army had heroic sacrifices, the enemy suffered even heavier casualties due to taking the offensive and being severely hit by our forces. It is estimated that the enemy's deaths and injuries are at least three thousand people or more. After our army retreated from the Yuepu-Yanghang line, they have held firmly to the new positions in the Qijia浜 area, relying on fortifications. At the same time, the enemy, due to heavy casualties, urgently needs to reorganize and dare not advance again. Therefore, the battle in that area has become quiet yesterday. However, due to the changes in the Yanghang front line, the positions of our city center in the Yinxiang Township and Yangshupu area have become prominent and easily surrounded by the enemy. In military terms, this is an extremely unfavorable situation. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, our army moved to the first line of defense from the North Station to Jiangwan in an orderly formation yesterday morning, and took a defensive posture. The positions on this line have long been built into solid fortifications. If the enemy attacks, they will surely be able to rely on the terrain to give them a serious blow. As for the remnants of the enemy in Luodian, they are still being strictly blocked by our army and will definitely not be able to advance.

### Observations of Military Officials

The goal is to strive for final victory. The advance and retreat of small pieces of land are not worth paying attention to.

According to a military official who spoke to the reporter, his observations on the Shanghai battle are: The Shanghai battle has lasted for thirty-two days since its outbreak yesterday. Our army is determined to fight a long-term war and strive for the final victory, resisting the enemy's invasion, and fighting fiercely for more than a month. The magnificence of the spirit and the greatness of the achievements have chilled the enemy's courage and shocked the world. At the beginning of the war, our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy with a heroic posture. Important enemy positions in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas were repeatedly captured by our army, destroying the old and rotten with the force of a landslide, as if breaking bamboo. Our army's vanguard once advanced far to the Huishan Wharf, cutting off the enemy's communication. We were fully prepared to take it down in one go and attack the enemy camp directly. However, the enemy continued to reinforce and harass various places along the river and coast, containing our army's offensive, resulting in failure to achieve success. When the enemy's reinforcements landed in Luodian, Yunzaobang, and Zhanghuabang on the 23rd of last month, they first used enemy naval guns to bombard our land, trying to prevent our army from entering the line of fire. Therefore, it was impossible for our army to fundamentally prevent the enemy from landing. However, our army had a magnificent spirit and irresistible momentum. Every time the enemy landed and had not yet gained a firm foothold, they would quickly attack and inflict heavy damage on them. Therefore, the enemy in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, Wusong, and Luodian areas could not connect and meet from beginning to end. The remnants of the enemy in the Luodian area were surrounded by us, which was especially embarrassing. In the fierce battles of the past three weeks, the enemy's deaths and injuries exceeded 20,000. The severity of the injuries was far above our army's. However, the enemy's forces operating in Shanghai include six army divisions, about 10,000 marines, more than 130 warships, 300 aircraft, more than 1,000 cavalry, and mechanized units. Among them, the enemy's warships are equipped with a total of 700 large-caliber guns, and the firepower is the most powerful. Since Baoshan was broken by enemy naval gunfire and our Yao Zixiang camp was completely heroically sacrificed, the Yuepu-Xingyanghang line, our army's positions have lost their barriers. However, our army can still fight the enemy fiercely for two days and nights, inflicting heavy injuries on them before retreating. The magnificence of the spirit and the courage of the operation are far beyond what the enemy can compare. As for the retreat of the positions in the Yinxiang Township area of the city center, it was entirely to avoid being surrounded by the enemy. This is a strategic step that must be taken and is not surprising. Looking at the enemy's annihilation in the Jungong Road area in recent days, we can know that if our army makes progress on the entire line, the area will be very easy to recover. Now the first line of defense held by our army on the entire line has been built long ago, the positions are extremely solid, and they are far away from the river, and the enemy's firepower of more than 700 guns has completely lost its effectiveness, which is extremely beneficial to us. If the enemy attacks again, they should know that the strength of our loyal and brave soldiers cannot be underestimated. In short, our army is determined to fight a long-term war in order to strive for the final victory. We are not arrogant in victory, and we are not discouraged in defeat. At present, the advance and retreat of small pieces of land are not worth paying attention to in the entire war situation.

### The Enemy Army in Yanghang Attacked Liuhang

Our army strictly defended the original front line. The enemy has retreated to the western suburbs of Yanghang.

Yesterday, the enemy used all its strength to advance westward from Yanghang, attempting to spy on Liuhang. Our army built defensive works in the new positions near Donglu, strictly rejecting the enemy's invasion. The sound of guns and cannons gradually became dense in the morning, and contact occurred on the front line. It stopped after ten o'clock. It was heard that the enemy's attack had been repelled to the western suburbs of Yanghang. Our army strictly defended the original front line, waiting for an opportunity to attack. On the Zhanghuabang side, 2,000 enemy troops attacked Sitang River yesterday. After resisting by our defending soldiers, the two armies approached before long, and were about to engage in close combat. Our army protruded from the front line and used broadswords and hand grenades to fight back, killing many enemies. The enemy was defeated and retreated, and our army did not pursue, but advanced into the South Sitang River.

### Our Army in Yuepu is Waiting for an Opportunity to Counterattack

Central News Agency reports that the enemy on the Wusong side, since the 10th, has used strong artillery fire to attack our Yanghang line. Yanghang Town has become a scorched earth under intense artillery fire. After several counterattacks by our army, it safely moved to the new front line. The enemy, with heavy casualties, is also reorganizing and replenishing, and has not dared to advance. Therefore, the battle on that line was silent the night before (12th). Fresh troops have been transferred to prepare for a counterattack. As for Yuepu, due to the local environment of Yanghang, it also abandoned the original front line and held on to the new positions, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, in order to coordinate with the front of Yanghang.

### The Battle of Luodian and Liuhe is Silent

Central News Agency reports that the enemy in Luodian, the day before yesterday (12th) in the afternoon, used small guerrilla teams to attack us in separate ways. Our army bravely fought back. The enemy's small team leader, Jing San, was killed on the spot. A diary was found on his body. It was learned that the enemy in Luodian was the Twelfth Division of Weiliumi. The line between Luodian and Liuhe was relatively silent the night before last.

### A Large Number of Enemy Troops Landed Yesterday

Central News Agency reports that before dawn yesterday morning, two enemy merchant ship-transformed transport ships sailed into the Huangpu River. One, the "Tottori Maru," docked at the Osaka Wharf, and about 1,000 enemy troops landed. The other, the "Kasa Maru," docked at the China Merchants Bureau Zhongzhan, unloading military supplies, which had not been completed until 6 pm yesterday. After 1 pm, three more enemy transport ships, the "Tenyo Maru," the "Tairiku Maru," and the "Totai Maru," successively sailed in and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, Osaka Wharf, and Huangpu Wharf, respectively. In addition to about 2,000 enemy troops landing, a large number of heavy military equipment, such as tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery, and other military supplies, were continuously transported. The enemy's continuous reinforcements in Hongkou and Yangshupu are expected to have fierce counterattacks in those areas within days.

### Enemy Planes Bombed and Sunk Three Refugee Boats in Beixinjing Again

The Yujidun River surface was almost blocked by corpses. The number of deaths and injuries was more than 300 again.

(Special report from this newspaper) Yesterday afternoon at about 4 o'clock, several enemy planes flew to Beixinjing, a non-military zone, and wantonly bombed. At that time, six civilian boats full of refugees were seen passing through the Suzhou River surface at Yujidun, about seven or eight miles west of Beixinjing. The enemy planes dropped four heavy bombs, causing three of them to be sunk. At that time, the innocent refugees tragically drowned and the corpses of those who were bombed to death. The river section was almost blocked. The number was more than several hundred. The tragic situation was unbearable to witness. The water patrol detachment in charge immediately sent police to take care of it. Because the place is located in a remote rural area, the transportation is very inconvenient. In addition, after the enemy planes dropped the bombs, they stayed for a long time and frequently flew low to strafe with machine guns. Therefore, the ambulances of various charitable organizations in the city could not go to rescue. It was not until about 9 pm last night that two trucks went to carry more than 40 injured refugees and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment.

According to a report from a rescue organization, yesterday afternoon, the International Refugee Camp and the Suzhou Association hired a Gongxin small steamer to tow a dozen civilian boats to Jiaxing. Another Xie Mao steamer towed twelve pairs of boats to Suzhou. At 4:30, when they were about eight miles west of our Beixinjing, two enemy planes suddenly flew low to scout and circled several times, and then dropped two heavy bombs. At that time, the boats towed by the Gongxin and Xie Mao steamers were untied separately. The enemy planes dropped two more bombs. At that time, a total of three civilian boats were sunk, and the number of deaths and injuries totaled more than 300. The rescue team rushed to rescue and sent the injured to Renji and other hospitals for emergency treatment. The situation was extremely tragic.

According to the Central News Agency, enemy planes bombed and sank three refugee boats in Beixinjing yesterday and destroyed six others. They were towed by small steamers heading to Jiaxing. Another small steamer heading to Suzhou left later and was fortunate enough to escape.

### Yesterday's Situation of Enemy Ships Mooring

About forty ships in the Wusongkou area. About forty ships in Shidong and Liuhe.

Central News Agency reports that according to the results of the reporter's investigation yesterday, there are about sixty enemy ships in the river area around Wusongkou (from the Qiujiang Wharf to the Lion Grove), including about forty cruisers, destroyers, and gunboats. The rest are transport ships converted from enemy merchant ships. The number of enemy ships in the river area around Shidong and Liuhe has increased sharply in recent days, and the total number should be more than forty. It is expected that fierce battles will occur there within days. As for the enemy ships in the Huangpu River, in addition to the five transport ships, there are a total of twelve enemy ships. The mooring situation is as follows: One destroyer No. 21 and one destroyer No. 11 at the Mitsubishi Wharf (this ship was originally No. 17, and suddenly the number "11" was added to the stern. The enemy ships change their numbers from time to time, which can be seen from this.) One destroyer No. 3 at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, one floating gunboat each of Nos. 40, 36, 22, 17, and 10, one floating destroyer each of Nos. 9 and 7, one flagship Izumo floating gunboat No. 3, and one destroyer No. 18 floating gunboat No. 1, a total of twelve ships. All the ships in the Huangpu River were very quiet yesterday. Only the enemy ships outside Qiujiang Wharf fired westward to bombard our positions.

### A Glimpse of the Enemy Planes' Rampage Yesterday

Specializing in destroying commercial and civilian houses and burning property unrelated to combat.

Dozens of enemy planes wantonly bombed Zhabei, Nanshi, Pudong, and Nanxiang all day yesterday, and the situation was extremely tragic. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Pudong

Yesterday afternoon at about 1:40, two small teams of six enemy planes flew to the Bailianjing area of Pudong and dropped more than ten bombs. Then, at about 3 o'clock, five enemy planes flew again and dropped more than thirty bombs. A total of about fifty bombs were dropped in two times. The China Alcohol Factory across from the Dalei Company warehouse in that area was hit by more than twenty bombs, and the factory was bombed and destroyed. (The factory is about three or four miles around and has only been open for three years.) Eighteen bombs hit the nearby countryside, destroying thirty or forty civilian houses. Seven or eight bombs also hit the Yitai Coal Warehouse South Warehouse. Two bombs were also dropped at the South Wharf of Pudong, destroying dozens of bungalows. Although the Dalei Warehouse was fortunate not to be hit by bombs, its walls were damaged by shrapnel, with bullet marks. There were more than thirty workers and civilians injured. Dozens of people were killed on the spot. The injured were sent to the Pudong Red Cross Society in that area for rescue and treatment.

The area near Lujiazui in Pudong was attacked by two enemy planes dropping multiple incendiary bombs at about 4 pm yesterday. The civilian houses there immediately caught fire, and the fire spread fiercely for a while, with billowing smoke soaring into the sky. By about 4:30, two more enemy planes flew to drop two bombs. By about 5:30, the fire subsided slightly, and then it was extinguished.

Nanshi

At 1:30 yesterday afternoon, enemy bombers flew out, totaling seven. Four of them flew to the Bailianjing area of Nanhupu Dongnan Huangpu, and the other three dropped more than ten bombs in the Xuejiabang rice wharf and Dama Wharf area of Nanshi. However, very few exploded. After bombing the wharves along the Huangpu River in Nanshi, the enemy planes dropped bombs outside the Dadongmen and Xiaonanmen near the city, lasting for two hours. At about 4 pm, three enemy bombers reappeared over the ring city and dropped seven or eight bombs on the side near the wharf outside the eastern half of the city. The area of No. 16 Dongmen Road was also hit by two bombs. The Nanhua Commercial Tram Company at the Nanshi Station and the Xinpu Yutang on Guohuo Road were each hit by two bombs, but there were few deaths and injuries.

Zhabei

At about 7 am yesterday, five enemy planes flew to the Gonghe Xinlu area of Zhabei and dropped more than a dozen incendiary bombs. The Zhenanli area was the first to be hit and immediately caught fire. The fire was raging for a while and spread rapidly, making it impossible to control. Although the fire brigades of Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Zhabei drove to the scene to put out the fire, it was difficult to put out the fire because the river water was scarce. Then, at about 11 o'clock, fires broke out on Jinling Road and Datong Road, etc., and the situation became more intense. The fire brigades of the northwest and second districts of Hunanqu and the second district of Dongjiadu also opened the alarm and drove to the scene to help put out the fire bravely. Later, there were as many as four fire sites in that area, from East Datong Road to the western Jinling Road Maigen Road Station warehouse, and the fire area spread for several miles. The fire was only slightly suppressed until about 5 pm.

Nanxiang

Nanxiang Town has been bombed by enemy planes for several days in a row, and the essence has already been turned into scorched earth. However, on the morning of the day before yesterday, seven enemy planes bombed the Xianghua Bridge and South Street in the town, which are known for their mutton and small steamed bun markets, for an hour. The most prosperous South Street Xianghua Bridge in the town has been completely turned into scorched earth, and many civilians have been killed and injured.

### Big Fire in Hongkou and Yangshupu Yesterday

Yesterday morning, houses in the Yinxiang Township area of Yangshupu were hit by shells and burned fiercely. The fire spread again and subsided slightly at noon. At about 3 pm, civilian houses in the Hongkou Wusong Road North Sichuan Road, Laobazi Road, Outer Hongqiao, and East Xihuade Road area suddenly caught fire, with smoke soaring into the sky and sparks splashing everywhere. The situation was extremely fierce and had not been extinguished until about 6 pm.

### Rescue Work is Urgent and Requires Cooperation Between Officials and the Public

Lack of medical equipment for wounded soldiers. The Chinese people should donate generously as soon as possible.

The North China Daily News said that the war correspondent, Mr. Tertman, vividly recorded the plight of the Chinese wounded soldiers. The North China Daily News had also commented on this matter before. Mr. Tertman's testimony made it even clearer. This is the urgent responsibility of the Chinese citizens of Shanghai and cannot be shirked. The achievements of the Red Cross workers have been warmly praised by Mr. Tertman. However, a large amount of money is currently needed to purchase the necessary and extremely scarce items for treating the wounded soldiers. It is understood that those Chinese who respect their country and reputation will be able to express sympathy for this action and donate generously. In the past, other countries also felt that the medical comfort items needed by the wounded soldiers were actually insufficient depending solely on official sources, and still needed to be supplemented by sources outside the official ones. The Red Cross was actually established when it felt that the official power was limited. Although Shanghai is now suffering from war, it is still rich in resources. It is hoped that enthusiastic and powerful Chinese people will quickly rise up to assist the Chinese groups that are currently concerned about the wounded soldiers, so as to reduce the shortcomings. Mr. Tertman's remarks describing the loyalty and bravery of the Chinese soldiers have been confirmed by various independent parties. A gentleman once went to the wounded soldiers' hospital and heard a Chinese soldier with a lung injury ask his commander when he could go home. Upon questioning, his so-called "home" was the trenches on the front line. Alas, those who have such a spirit of loyalty and bravery, after being injured, cannot obtain the basic methods of medical treatment and rescue due to simple equipment. This will be a sin for the Chinese compatriots who stand by and watch.

### The British Chargé d'Affaires Will Go to Beijing This Morning

Notified both China and Japan before departure. Western newspapers reported secret talks with Kawagoe.

Central News Agency reports that British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen has not recovered since being injured by Japanese planes. The British government has specially appointed Mr. Holman, a counselor of the embassy who is on vacation in England, to come to China at full speed. During the ambassador's recovery period, he will serve as the chargé d'affaires. Mr. Holman has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. In order to pay a visit to our diplomatic authorities, he specially took a car to Beijing with military attaché Fraser at 3:30 this morning. It is expected to arrive at about 2 pm. It is said that in order to avoid accidents, Mr. Holman notified both China and Japan before departure and painted the British national emblem on the top of the car.

The North China Daily News reported that Mr. Holman, the former counselor of the British Embassy in Beiping and now the British chargé d'affaires in China, visited Mr. Kawagoe, the Japanese ambassador to China, at his residence in Shanghai at 10:30 on the morning of the 12th for a secret talk of one hour. The issues discussed were not disclosed. Mr. Holman is scheduled to take a car to Beijing with Mr. Fraser, the military attaché of the British Embassy, on the 14th. According to reports, Mr. Holman joined the British Embassy in 1934. When Sir Cadogan handed over and returned home, Mr. Holman took over the duties of the embassy before Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen took office. Mr. Holman served in the British Army in the European War. In 1919, he worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Recently, due to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's injury, he rushed to Shanghai to handle diplomatic affairs on behalf of the Duke. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately reviewed all diplomatic files overnight in order to obtain clues to the overall situation.

### Battalion Commander Mei Zhiwei Heroically Died

Battalion Commander Mei Zhiwei of a certain battalion in Pudong was unusually loyal and brave. He always took the lead in battle. In the Pudong area, he would always strike and repel the enemy's coming to spy on them. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, enemy ships used dense artillery fire to cover the army and attempted to land at the Mitsubishi Wharf in Pudong. Our army calmly responded to the battle. Battalion Commander Mei also led the machine gun team to strafe. The enemy soldiers were unsuccessful. During the fierce battle, Battalion Commander Mei was unfortunately injured by a shell. He was escorted by the rescue team to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. Due to serious injuries, he died on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, that is, at 1:30 pm on the 12th. When he was dying, he still asked about the front-line battle situation. He died with such a heroic spirit. His name will last forever.

### The 18th Session of the League of Nations Assembly Opened Yesterday

The Prime Minister of the West Served as Temporary Chairman and Delivered a Speech. The Obligations of the Sacred Covenant Should Be Respected. No Representatives From Italy and Abyssinia Attended.

[Geneva] The 18th regular session of the International League Assembly opened at 11:25 this morning. Representatives from 44 countries attended. Neither Abyssinia nor Italy sent representatives to attend. The chairman of the Executive Yuan, Prime Minister Negrin of the Spanish Republican government, served as temporary chairman and delivered an opening speech, which said: "Spain's belief in the League of Nations has not been shaken at all, and it is even more so than in the past. However, the various sacred principles of the League of Nations Covenant, most of which have been repeatedly violated, are regrettable. I think that revising the covenant may not make the implementation of the covenant more convenient, because the organization of the League of Nations and the respect for its covenant are all from the will of mankind. The politicians of some countries often hesitate to fulfill their covenant obligations, then even a very perfect covenant will not help." He continued, "The League of Nations is still very active. The work carried out by the League of Nations in the past year, such as the autonomous system of the two cities of Yaan in Syria, the Palestine issue, the raw material issue, and the economic issue, are too numerous to mention." In conclusion, he said, "The main principles of the League of Nations Covenant are nothing more than two points: good faith and respect for international constraints. Then the General Assembly adjourned until 5 pm and reopened. At that time, it will vote to elect the Chairman of the General Assembly. (Central News Agency, Havana, 13th, Havas Electric)

[Geneva] Delegations from various countries have arrived here today in order to participate in the opening ceremony of the 18th session of the League of Nations Assembly. The Spanish National Army has also sent an informal delegation here. The issue of recognition has arisen, but this delegation will do its best to mobilize friendly countries sympathetic to the National Army to support its overthrow of the government on the issue of re-electing the Spanish government as a member of the Executive Yuan. Indian representative Agha Khan will be elected as the Chairman of the General Assembly, but Prime Minister Negrin of the Spanish Valencia government will deliver the opening speech in the capacity of acting chairman, but only discuss international events in general, without mentioning the Spanish civil war. After that, the General Assembly will vote secretly to decide the issue of Spain's qualifications as a permanent member of the Executive Yuan. Whether it can obtain the necessary two-thirds majority at that time is still a question. Although the agenda of the General Assembly today is entirely ceremonial, the Far East issue will definitely be one of the main topics. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters Electric)

### I Officially Lodge a Complaint with the League of Nations

To Halt Japanese Aggression, Please Take Appropriate and Effective Measures

[Nanjing] External Affairs News: On the 12th of this month, our country's delegation to the League of Nations, headed by Chief Delegate Gu Weijun, submitted a formal letter of complaint to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The original text is as follows: "I am now instructed by my government to respectfully request your Secretary-General to take note of the fact that Japan is using its army, navy, and air force to invade China with all its might, and is continuing to do so. This constitutes an act of aggression against China's territorial integrity and political independence. As China is a member of the League of Nations, this action clearly constitutes a case to be dealt with in accordance with Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Furthermore, the grave situation created by Japan's acts of aggression also falls within the scope of Article 11 of the same Covenant and is thus a matter of concern to the entire League of Nations. As for the facts of this case, please refer to the Statement of Facts sent to the League of Nations by the Chinese Government, which has been forwarded by the League of Nations to all member states and to the Advisory Committee established by the Assembly of the League of Nations on February 24, 1933, in accordance with Article 3, paragraph 3 of the Covenant. In view of Japan's current relationship with the League of Nations and its actions in China, the Chinese Government believes that Article 17 of the Covenant is also applicable. However, all resolutions passed by the Assembly and the Council of the League of Nations to date regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute shall not be affected in their continued validity and binding force. I, on behalf of my government, request the application of Articles 10, 11, and 17 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and submit to the Council of the League of Nations a clear account of the situation as stipulated in the aforementioned articles, proposing appropriate and necessary measures to take appropriate and necessary action." (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)

[Geneva] Special dispatch from Havas News Agency's diplomatic correspondent: The main purpose of the Chinese government's complaint to the League of Nations is to revive the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues established by the Extraordinary Assembly of the League of Nations in 1933. This committee was composed of twenty-three countries: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, Portugal, Ireland, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, and Canada. After its revival, its greatest benefit would be that the United States could also participate. The legal advisors of the Chinese government advocated re-filing this complaint because Japan declared its withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27, 1933. Therefore, China must submit the complaint again in order to invoke the provisions of Article 17 of the Covenant regarding conflicts between member states and non-member states. In addition, the Chinese government has also invoked Articles 3 and 10 of the Covenant. According to Article 3, the Assembly of the League of Nations may deal with any matter affecting world peace. Therefore, if the Council submits a draft resolution to the Assembly after discussing the complaint submitted by China, the Assembly only needs to convene the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues instead of forming another committee to handle it. In this way, the main purpose of the Chinese government, which is to promote a common policy of the major powers such as Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East, can also be achieved. Article 10 of the Covenant concerns respecting and maintaining the territorial integrity and political independence of member states, which the Chinese government has also invoked. Its benefit, from a purely theoretical perspective, is that after accepting China's complaint, the Council will certainly invite Japan to undertake the obligations of a member state in accordance with Article 17 of the Covenant in order to resolve the dispute, but Japan may not accept it. Chinese sources here recently claimed that the reason for China's complaint is to hope that "the League of Nations can proclaim to the major powers the obligations that they should bear." This hope is not extravagant. Recent probes of opinions from various parties have led to the firm belief that this can be achieved. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th, Havas)

### A Full Account of Japanese Military Atrocities: Full Text of Our Supplementary Statement

Wanton Attacks on Non-Combatants, Use of Poison Gas, Extinction of Humanity

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a formal statement to the League of Nations on August 30 regarding the facts of Japanese aggression and atrocities, and translated and published the full text. On the 7th of this month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, sent by telegram from our representative office to the League of Nations, which was delivered to the League of Nations on the 12th. Now, the full text of this supplementary statement is translated as follows: Since the Chinese Government submitted its first statement to the League of Nations on August 30 regarding Japan's aggression against China, Japan's aggression against China has become more serious and brutal. The lives and property of non-combatants, and even the lives and property of people from third countries, have been wantonly trampled upon, with extreme cruelty. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the Chinese Government believes that it is necessary to submit a supplementary statement, and especially hopes to pay special attention to the following important facts: ㊀ Military and political situation: Since the Japanese Marines created the Shanghai war on August 13, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have continued to reinforce, and the situation has become increasingly tense. It is estimated that in addition to the original 10,000 Marines, the Japanese army has reinforced Shanghai with a total of five divisions, equipped with the latest weapons and a large number of military aircraft. Japan is determined to contain China's first commercial port, so despite China's acceptance in principle of the proposals of third countries regarding the withdrawal of troops (including warships) from both sides, it has brazenly refused. The current battle in Shanghai has caused great sacrifice of life and property, and the confrontation between the large armies of both sides is a life-and-death battle. The battle in Shanghai is bound to be prolonged. As for North China, after the Chinese army fought bravely to defend the key point of Nankou for about two weeks, it was finally attacked by the Japanese army using poison gas, and the Kwantung Army of Japan invaded from Rehe. The Chinese army will inevitably be attacked from both sides and had no choice but to withdraw. Japan took advantage of the situation to invade westward, occupy various cities along the PingSui Railway Line, and occupy Zhangjiakou, the capital of the province of Chahar. The Chinese army in Zhangjiakou was also forced to withdraw on August 27. On September 4, the Japanese side declared that it would organize a puppet organization called the "South Chahar Autonomous Government" in the area. There was continued warfare on the northern sections of the PingHan and JinPu Railways. The strength of the Japanese army in this area is estimated to be nine divisions, no less than 150,000 men. As for the area around Tianjin and Beiping, which is under Japanese control, the order is chaotic and people are panicked. Ten foreign missionaries in Beiping were once held hostage. The Japanese military also admitted that Japanese soldiers in Beiping had repeatedly committed looting incidents and are now trying to prevent them. In order to destroy China's coastal commercial ports, Japan has now expanded its air force activities. As for South China, on August 31, Japanese aircraft used six or seven aircraft to bomb Guangzhou. On the same day, Shantou and Zhangzhou were also attacked. On September 3, after Japanese warships bombarded the Xiamen fort, Japanese seaplanes bombed Xiamen City again. On September 6, Shantou was bombed again by Japanese aircraft. In fact, throughout China, with the exception of a few provinces, there are few that have not been ravaged by the Japanese air force. When Japanese air force personnel carry out bombing and devastation, they make no distinction between combatants and non-combatants. These brutal actions will be described in detail below. ㊁ Japan Declares a Blockade of the Chinese Coast: On August 25, the Japanese Navy declared a blockade of the sea area from Shanghai to a point south of Shantou, prohibiting Chinese ships from sailing. Although Tokyo claimed that it would not interfere with the "peaceful trade" of third countries, Nobu Atsuhira, legal advisor to the Third Fleet of Japan, which is fighting in China, declared to the press that Japanese warships patrolling the blockade waters were ordered to stop foreign ships for inspection and stated that if the Japanese side considered that foreign ships were carrying contraband of war, the Japanese side might apply a "right of first purchase." On September 5, the Japanese side further announced that it would expand the blockade area, extending from Qinhuangdao in the north to Beihai in the south. As a result, the entire coastline of China is de facto under blockade. At the same time, the Japanese naval authorities announced that the Japanese side reserves the right to inspect the nationality of all ships in Chinese territorial waters and requested that all foreign shipping companies notify the Japanese side of the movements of their ships in Chinese territorial waters. ㊂ Japanese Aircraft Bomb the Red Cross: Although Japan is a signatory to the 1929 Geneva Convention, its troops in China have brazenly violated the provisions of the Convention and have repeatedly ravaged the Red Cross, which is engaged in humanitarian work to rescue wounded soldiers. Dr. Yan Fuqing, head of the Chinese Red Cross, gave a statement to the press on August 29, stating that the Shanghai Red Cross had a total of 30 ambulances, of which 7 were destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The Red Cross emblem is very easy to recognize, but Japanese aircraft often deliberately pursue Red Cross vehicles and sometimes even throw bombs at them. On August 18, the Zhenru Red Cross Hospital was bombed by Japanese aircraft. Fortunately, the wounded soldiers had been transferred in advance. Only one stretcher bearer was killed and one doctor and three rescue personnel were injured. The next day, the Nanhsiang Red Cross rescue team was bombed by Japanese aircraft, killing two wounded soldiers and injuring four team members. The atrocities of the Japanese army in shooting Red Cross personnel in Luodian on August 23 were even more inhumane. At that time, 43 rescue team members were rescuing wounded soldiers when they were suddenly surrounded by the Japanese army, who tore off their Red Cross emblems from their white uniforms, forced them to kneel down, and shot them. One doctor and four nurses were killed on the spot. Only three nurses escaped in the meantime, and one of them was shot and injured by the Japanese army while escaping and died the next day. The whereabouts of the other team members are still unknown. The brutality of the Japanese army has made the work of the Red Cross extremely difficult. Currently, most of the staff's work behind the lines must be carried out at night to avoid danger. As for the Japanese claim that Red Cross ambulances were carrying ammunition, it is completely unfounded. The Chinese Red Cross is very cautious in the use of the Red Cross flag. All 30 ambulances have been specially authorized by the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession to pass through the concessions. Before they set off for the war zone, they were thoroughly inspected. Therefore, the Japanese side's deliberate bombing of Red Cross hospitals and ambulances cannot be concealed by any pretext. ㊃ Wanton Attacks on Non-Combatants: There are many cases of Japanese air force indiscriminately attacking non-combatants. Here are a few examples to show the brutality of the Japanese army. On August 17, about ten Japanese aircraft attacked Nantong, 80 miles from Shanghai, and dropped six bombs on the American Church Hospital, which hit the main building and caused a fire, killing two Chinese doctors and two nurses, and injuring many people, including two American nurses who were on duty. On August 28, twelve Japanese aircraft attacked Nanshi, Shanghai. Nanshi is a densely populated residential area for civilians and has no Chinese troops or positions. Japanese bombs landed densely near the South Railway Station, killing more than 200 innocent civilians and injuring 500 others. Most of the victims were refugees waiting for trains to leave Shanghai, especially women and children. On August 31, Japanese aircraft bombed the public bus station in Dachang Town, killing and injuring hundreds of people on the spot. On the same day, Cangzhou, about 70 miles south of Tianjin, also suffered the same tragedy. Hundreds of civilians were killed and injured by Japanese aircraft. On the morning of September 5, sixteen Japanese aircraft attacked the western side of the Shanghai Public Concession, and Beixinjing, which is not a war zone. Many houses were destroyed and many people were killed and injured. When Japanese aircraft were flying over the area, they saw two sailboats full of refugees in the Suzhou River, and they immediately bombed them. One was bombed, killing 40 people and injuring 60. The other was strafed by aircraft machine guns, also killing many. ㊄ Japanese Military Wantonly Destroys Cultural and Educational Institutions: Since the outbreak of the war, the Japanese military has paid special attention to Chinese educational and cultural institutions, selecting them as targets and wantonly destroying them. Nankai University and its affiliated middle school, which are well-known, were set on fire by the Japanese army. This was one of the earliest atrocities after they occupied Tianjin. Since then, schools at all levels, partially or completely destroyed by Japanese air force bombing, are too numerous to mention. Nantong Zhongying Girls' School, Nanchang Baoling Fang School, Agricultural College, and Rural Normal School, Nanjing Central University and its affiliated experimental school, Orphans' School, and Wusong Tongji University are the most prominent. It is especially noteworthy that all the schools attacked by the Japanese air force, with the exception of Tongji University, are far away from the war zone and have nothing to do with the war. Even Tongji University is not in the actual war zone, and there were no Chinese troops stationed inside when it was destroyed. The actions of the Japanese army in Chinese territory in the past few weeks, as described above, are sufficient to prove that Japan is determined to expand its aggressive actions throughout China, and its goal is to destroy China's political institutions and eliminate Chinese culture in order to realize its dream of conquering the continent. Even more, according to the facts mentioned above, it can be seen that the Japanese military, when invading Chinese territory, has absolutely disregarded all international public law, treaty provisions, and humanitarian creeds, ignoring legal and moral considerations, resorting to unchecked violent trampling, and indulging in the dream of conquest, relying on massacres and destruction. Not only is the life of our 450 million Chinese people in danger, but also the world's culture and security are precarious, and the future is unthinkable. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Radio Address to America

[Nanjing] (Continued from yesterday) The Japanese warlords have already shown the world that they brazenly disregard their international credibility, shaming their former samurai in the afterlife and diminishing the noble spirit of Bushido. Yet, after the world has witnessed their ugly deeds, they shamelessly remain unashamed. The real reason for this is their confidence that no world power dares to oppose them. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, the Japanese warlords are striving to carry out their conquest plan, confident that they can destroy China and, in time, exclude Western culture and commercial power. If we Chinese do not stop them, they will conquer China and establish a Japanese empire on the mainland to disrupt the world. Since they have already destroyed international morality, their mainland empire will be based purely on force. At the very least, Japan intends to dominate the Eastern countries in order to further manipulate international actions and policies. Since Japan harbors such ambition, it is not surprising that they openly question why China dares to resist. Premier Konoe's accusations are also inevitable. In the past, when China succumbed meekly, all countries were surprised why China did not resist. Today, the situation is exactly the opposite. China has begun to resist, fighting for sovereignty, for survival, and for the dignity of treaties, yet other countries sit idly by while their rights and interests in China are being destroyed by Japan, and their expatriates in China are forced to relocate and become refugees. Is this not a strange thing? This passive acceptance by other countries is what the Japanese military is most pleased to see, for they believe that the prestige of Europe and the United States in the Far East has been effortlessly swept away by the Japanese. Therefore, we are bewildered and feel that this is a sign of cultural collapse. Do you not see the Japanese planes dropping bombs all over the place? The enemy ships on the Yangtze River stretch for dozens of miles, with countless cannons and machine guns. The Chinese people are being slaughtered miserably. Do you not see homes and markets destroyed by arson or reduced to ashes by bombing? Do you not see blood flowing in the fields and corpses piled up like hills? Do you not see thousands upon thousands of Chinese and foreign refugees screaming in terror, hoping to save their lives? Woe to my Chinese people, millions of women and children, who have seen their homes destroyed and have nothing to wear and nothing to eat, and have become homeless and helpless. And when they try to leave Shanghai to escape this catastrophe, the tragedy becomes even more horrific. Just a few days ago, thousands of refugees gathered at the South Station in Shanghai, waiting for trains to leave, when Japanese planes appeared overhead and dropped bombs at will, scattering the flesh and blood of three hundred innocent people, with over four hundred injured. There were no soldiers near the station. There is absolutely no reason for such a massacre. The Shanghai-based British newspaper, the "North-China Daily News," described this barbaric act as "a crime of wantonly killing human beings, whose cruelty could not be more extreme." A few days later, when many refugees were taking trains to leave Shanghai at Songjiang Station, a few miles from Shanghai, they were attacked again in the same way, resulting in another three hundred people being shattered to pieces and killed, and hundreds more seriously injured. Again, there was not a single soldier on the train. The "China Press", an American newspaper published in the Far East, said in its editorial that the first incident was "deliberate murder," and when the second atrocity occurred, it said directly that "no word in the dictionary can adequately describe such a heinous act." Furthermore, in Changshu, not far from Shanghai and with no troops, on August 23, Japanese bombers suddenly flew in and first strafed the people with machine guns on one side of its prosperous streets, and then bombed homes and shops, before flying to the other side to do the same, until hundreds were dead and the whole city was a ruin. Such massacres are now taking place throughout our country. In the future, when they build airfields on the islands they have seized or on the Japanese suburban golf courses in Shanghai, the extent of the massacres will become even more severe. I now dare to ask the Western countries, is sitting idly by and saying nothing while watching such massacres and destruction to be regarded as advocating humanity, paying attention to morality, respecting chivalry, and believing in the triumph of Christian civilization? And I also ask whether the great powers are standing by with their hands in their pockets, as if frightened by Japan's violence, so that they dare not say a word of criticism. Is this not to be regarded as the prelude to the decline of international morality, Christian creeds, or so-called Western virtues? If the Western countries are indifferent to the above and abandon the treaties lightly, then we Chinese, who have always been known as cowardly and have been working hard for years, will have to resist to the end as far as our strength allows. We will fight until we achieve final victory, or fight until final defeat. Even if our beautiful land and long history are stained with blood and destroyed, we will not hesitate. Gentlemen, you can hear the sound of artillery fire on the radio, but you can only imagine the groans of the dying, the pain of the wounded, and the sound of collapsing houses. The suffering and hunger of the majority of innocent, homeless, and displaced people, the cries of mothers mourning their beloved sons, and the black smoke and flames of burning houses are often beyond your comprehension. I will stop here. Goodbye, gentlemen. (Central News Agency telegram, 12th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### War Clouds Over Europe

— Fu

Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, everyone's attention has been focused on the development of the war situation, and little attention has been paid to international political situations outside the Far East. This is a natural phenomenon and nothing to be surprised about. However, modern international relations are very close, so we should also pay considerable attention to the recent developments in Europe.

Since the outbreak of the war in the Far East, an important development in Europe is that the fascist countries of Germany and Italy have taken the opportunity to further challenge the God of Peace, expanding their influence and remotely supporting their fascist comrades in the Far East. This challenge is mainly manifested in the following two aspects.

First, Germany and Italy are more openly interfering in the Spanish Civil War. Germany and Italy's help to the Franco rebels and interference in the Spanish Civil War was an open secret, but it has become more obvious recently. When the Italian Blackshirts captured the city of Santander, Franco even telegraphed Mussolini to express his gratitude and congratulations. And the Blackshirt Prime Minister openly admitted and wished the rebels victory in the future. Such open interference was rare in the past.

Second, mysterious submarines have repeatedly appeared in the Mediterranean, attacking merchant ships and warships of various countries. As many as two Soviet merchant ships have been sunk, and countless others have been attacked without being damaged. This piracy is obviously done by a country in the Mediterranean, so the Soviet Union directly protested to Italy twice after the incident, and Britain, France, and other countries also severely condemned this piracy.

The fascist countries' actions of challenge are naturally intolerable to peace-loving countries. Therefore, after the fall of Santander, France advocated convening an international intervention committee to protest to Italy. However, later, seeing that this action failed to produce practical results and the situation in the Mediterranean was very tense, it united with Britain to invite twelve countries, including the Soviet Union, Turkey, Italy, and Germany, to a meeting in Nyon to discuss ways to sanction piracy in the Mediterranean and ensure the safety of merchant ships of various countries. However, Italy, which is fundamentally a highly suspected country, naturally did not want to participate in this meeting that was unfavorable to it, so it refused on the pretext. Germany also took consistent action with Italy and refused to participate. However, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and other countries not only did not cancel the meeting because of Germany and Italy's refusal but also quickly negotiated three specific measures to prevent the recurrence of piracy and protect the safety of merchant ships of various countries. The firm attitude adopted by Britain, France, and other countries at the Nyon Conference is naturally a major blow to countries challenging fascism.

It is not yet known whether fascist countries will respect the decisions of the Nyon Conference and no longer engage in piracy. If Germany and Italy do not currently have the resolve to immediately provoke a European war, they will probably not dare to act as barbarously as in the past. But do Germany and Italy now have no intention of igniting the fuse of war? This question is too important to determine. However, judging from their actions of challenge, they have long been marching towards this volcano. Germany and Italy formed a fascist axis last year. Recently, the Blackshirt Prime Minister plans to visit Germany on the 25th to meet with Hitler. This meeting of the two giants will definitely not produce anything good.

The fascist challenge in Europe is both to expand their own power and to respond to the Far East killer's attack on China. Because the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has already been established, and the Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact will soon be signed. This international fascist alliance will be a great blow to world peace. Therefore, peace-loving countries in the world should unite immediately and form a solid collective security system to sanction this international group that is destroying peace.

### German Leader Reiterates Demand for Return of Former Colonies

Says that if this issue is not resolved, the European situation will be difficult to stabilize.

[Berlin] German leader Hitler held a frank discussion with news reporters today on domestic and international issues, acknowledging that Germany is at risk of a food shortage and stating that unless the issue of the disposition of colonies can be resolved, the European situation will be difficult to stabilize. Hitler did not specify which territories Germany wishes to reclaim but firmly asserted that Germany has a moral right to reclaim its confiscated territories. Hitler also solemnly declared that Germany has no plans for war preparations and urged all countries to treat their domestic minorities well. (National Telegram, 13th)

[Paris] According to a French reporter, German leader Hitler made several important statements yesterday during an informal talk with foreign reporters in Nuremberg. When Havas News raised the issue of colonies, Hitler stated that he firmly believed this issue would be resolved automatically in the future, just as the issue of equal rights had been resolved automatically in the past. However, Hitler claimed, "This is a matter of reason, and I firmly believe that reason will eventually prevail. At the same time, this is a matter of our honor, because the German people do not want to immigrate to other countries, only ask for the return of their original colonies, not to seize them from other countries." Then a British reporter asked, "Will Germany establish naval bases in the colonies?" Hitler replied, "A strong fleet is necessary to have naval bases. Before the war, Germany's expansion of colonies was entirely for economic reasons, and military considerations were not taken into account. Now, if you want to protect distant colonies with an army, it is not only futile but also impossible." (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

⊙ Nuremberg German leader Hitler recently met with German and foreign reporters in the Grand Hall of the ancient castle in this city. The leader wore a brown shirt, shook hands with each reporter in a very sincere manner, and made a speech, the main point of which was that "a way must eventually be found to resolve the issue of colonies, just as the issue of equal rights in armaments was eventually resolved. In short, unless the issue of colonies is resolved, there can be no real peace in Europe." The leader also told the reporters that he had given eleven speeches in eight days, and several times spoke in front of more than 100,000 people, and felt very tired. "Once the National Socialist Party Congress is over, I will go to Munich and Berchtesgaden to rest for a while, and then return to Berlin."

Italian Prime Minister's Visit to Germany's Intentions

Someone asked what the meaning of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Germany was, whether it was only to reaffirm the strength of the Berlin-Rome political axis or whether it had a more important purpose. The leader replied, "The meaning of the Italian Prime Minister's visit is quite obvious, and there is no need to say more. All countries are suspicious of our intentions, but we are now very quiet and doing nothing. We do not want to seize anything that belongs to anyone, nor do we want to dominate any foreign nation. That is all there is to our racism. Understanding this will dispel all doubts."

Restoration of Equality in Armaments

"Since the end of the European War until 1933, Germany was nothing more than a gap in Europe for fourteen years, but this situation no longer exists under the rule of the National Socialist Party. We have already restored the right to equality in armaments and have filled the gap properly. The factor of insecurity in Europe has thus been eliminated, and we can now devote ourselves to various major responsibilities."

Concern about Food Shortage

"These responsibilities are very heavy, and the food problem is especially important. The food produced in Germany is not enough to meet the needs of the people. The amount lacking is 10% to 12%. In other words, 7 million people in Germany lack food. If this problem is to be solved satisfactorily, Germany must obtain colonies. We must know that this is not a question of peace or war, but only a question of reason. I firmly believe that reason will eventually prevail."

Colonies Seek

At this point, a reporter from a British newspaper asked whether Germany would use the colonies as naval bases after acquiring them. Hitler smiled and replied, "If we want to implement this, we must first have a sufficient navy. Before the European War, Germany's development of colonies was only for the purpose of developing commerce, and there was no military intention. It is not a wise plan to raise troops to defend distant colonies." Another reporter asked why Germany did not start from the commercial aspect to solve the colonial problem. The leader replied, "In terms of commerce, if all countries buy as much goods from Germany as possible, Germany will also buy as much goods from those countries as possible in return, but the colonial problem is not only a commercial problem, but also related to Germany's honor. Our people now do not want to leave their country and live with foreigners, and they do not only want to do business, but want to be protected by the flag of their country. Britain, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and Japan all have colonies, why can't we? We are not asking for land from any country. What we are seeking is only to reclaim our country's past colonies."

Minority Issues

When talking about the issue of minorities in other countries, he said that Germany has no imperialistic ambitions. "We only hope that the authorities in other countries will treat the German minorities in their countries fairly, as the Yugoslavian government has done. The 700,000 to 800,000 German minorities in that country are currently satisfied with their situation, which is clear evidence."

Devote to Construction Undertakings

Finally, the leader talked about the public works plans implemented by the German government in the country, such as building automobile roads and holding international expositions in Munich in 1945 and in Berlin in 1950, and said, "If other countries also have such great plans and work hard for ten to twenty years as we do, then the world can be at peace."

### Nyon Agreement Takes Effect Today

British and French Policy Victory, European Situation Turns to Moderation

[Geneva] Following the conclusion of the Nyon Nine-Power Agreement on Saturday, Britain will be responsible for dispatching thirty-five destroyers, and France will dispatch twenty-five, to jointly patrol the Mediterranean Sea to ensure the safety of navigation. In the vicinity of the naval bases of Malta and Gibraltar, in addition to destroyers, aircraft will also assist in patrolling. British and French naval experts believe that the mere signing of the Nyon Agreement is sufficient to deter pirate actions. Therefore, although the agreement will take effect tomorrow, it may not be necessary to use force. At the same time, Italy and Germany are pleased that the Soviet Union has not joined the Mediterranean patrol. Currently, German and Italian newspapers hold the attitude that the Soviet Union is responsible for condoning piracy. According to Rome sources, Italy does not want to abide by any Mediterranean solution unless it places Italy on an equal footing with other countries. Italy may not make a decision on participating in the Nyon Agreement until the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish situation convenes. According to Nuremberg sources, German circles express resentment at the speeches delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in Nyon, and some even suggest that Germany should no longer sit at the same table with Litvinov. However, the Soviet Communist Party's organ, Pravda, greatly praises Litvinov, saying that Italian pirates hide behind a "nationality unknown" smokescreen, but this mask has now been unveiled by Litvinov. The Soviet Union is willing to fully support the Nyon Conference's proposal to safeguard the safety of navigation in the Mediterranean. If Italian pirates damage Soviet ships and kill its people, the Soviet Union will adopt its own plan. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch)

[London] This morning, British newspapers all welcomed the Mediterranean plan, considering it a practical way to deal with the submarine threat. The Times stated that the Nyon Conference concluded an agreement with extremely swift means, and the plan it adopted has a pragmatic nature, so those who criticize the Nyon Conference are silent. British and French naval advisors have established a method that allows neutral ships traveling on the two major sea routes in the Mediterranean to avoid submarine atrocities. The efforts shown by the British representatives in Nyon, and the British government's readiness to assist the weak countries in the Mediterranean, are all commendable. The Daily Telegraph reported that no government can object to the naval measures stipulated in the Nyon Agreement. Italy and Germany have both declared their sympathy for the Nyon Conference's objectives. Today's smiling welcome of the resolution has proven that they have absolutely no bias in the Spanish Civil War. People expect that Italian and German sympathy can eventually become tangible assistance. (Central News Agency, 13th Reuters dispatch)

The number of officers must be increased by 2,000 before it is sufficient. The US Congress declared in 1920 that the standing army should have 18,000 officers and 280,000 soldiers.

### Rumor of Japan and Italy Concluding Anti-Comintern Pact

[Tokyo] Recently, some in Japan have advocated strengthening the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. At the same time, the future of Japan-Italy relations is attracting attention. This morning, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that when Horita, the new ambassador to Italy, took office in June, Hirota instructed him to begin preliminary negotiations on concluding an Anti-Comintern Pact.

### Returning from the Front Lines

— Geng Ya

The scorched earth of Zhabei is like a painted skull, while the meritorious brigade commander is concerned about the international situation.

In peacetime, going to Zhabei from the concessions was easy, like entering an inner room from an outer courtyard, truly "easy as pie." However, during this time of constant artillery fire, it is as difficult as ascending to heaven. But the difficulty is not like the ruggedness of the roads of Shu, but rather that the two areas are closely connected, with only a narrow path to pass through. Without a familiar guide, it would be impossible to find the way. It happened that the night before, at the home of my friend Mr. Luo Yiwen, I met Mr. Wang Boxiong, director of a certain department, who kindly guided me to complete my inspection of Zhabei.

Just as we were about to depart from a certain place, heroic and admirable Boy Scouts suddenly captured a suspected traitor who was holding a large bundle of "ruble" banknotes and looking around in the street. After inspection, it was proven that he was a straggler from a certain division's party student team. He had picked up the rubles in the Jiang area. Fortunately, they were not the enemy's gold yuan notes. He had an older brother who was a martyr in the January 28th Resistance. This time, he joined the army on a distant expedition, hoping to avenge his brother! The final decision was to have him accompany the wounded soldiers on the medical transport vehicle to the front lines. He was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. He said he would ask his superiors to change his duties and let him rush to the enemy lines to recoup his losses! During roll call, someone casually asked, "Where did that traitor go?" Unexpectedly, an electric-like protest came from the car compartment: "Here—here! But that bastard is the real traitor!" This remark provoked a burst of laughter, and our car gently started moving forward.

Most of the battlefields we passed through on the way to the front lines were desolate countryside, occasionally small towns or isolated villages, which made one feel the ease of artillery fire and the undercurrent of flames. Zhabei, on the other hand, used to be a prosperous city with tall Western-style buildings, smooth roads, thriving commerce and industry, and a dense population. According to common sense, even if she had unfortunately been seized by the devil's claws of war, she had not been ravaged for long, and her endowments were so good that her appearance should not have changed much. But in reality, unfortunately, Zhabei had suffered from the enemy's brutal and crazy artillery fire. Not only had her appearance changed, but she had simply become a painted skull sacrificed to the great era!

In this painted skull-like Zhabei at night, the first deep impression is the eerie and terrifying darkness. The lights on the car are not allowed to be turned on, and even flashlights are not allowed to emit light. I wish I hadn't brought one, as it would be easier. Sometimes, a floating flare suddenly bursts out in the sky, illuminating our positions, and you have to get out of the car and hide, holding your breath and listening to the buzzing of enemy planes. After three or four minutes, the eerie darkness returns as usual. As you walk, you encounter tangled electric wires and crumbling walls blocking the way. There are also newly burned houses with lingering embers and acrid smoke, making it impossible to cover your nose and pass through. Naturally, in such a large area, there are also many alleys and buildings that have miraculously survived unscathed. However, there is no sound of chickens or dogs, and no sign of people (sentries are also not easy to find). The silence and stillness are like walking alone in a deep mountain or wilderness at midnight. The sound of gunfire from the melee street battles in the □□□ area reaches us in bursts, like soybeans being fried in a hot pot, exploding louder and louder. Analyzing it, the scattered sound of hand-launched grenades mostly comes from our soldiers charging into enemy fortifications. The "ta-dong, ta-dong" sound of Type 38 rifles is surely from Japanese pirates who are holding fast to their strongholds and firing rapidly from dangerous positions. This tense and eerie atmosphere of street fighting is clearly different from the ease of artillery fire and dim flames of field battles.

In a house at the end of a deep alley, I met a battalion commander of the Zhengke Patriotic Girls' School who led by example. He has been promoted to the deputy director of a certain brigade headquarters. It is said that whether the Patriotic Girls' School is captured or not is extremely important to the outcome of the battle in the Jiangwan area. Although the officers and soldiers of that battalion made great contributions to capturing it, only seven of them were not "wounded" after the fierce battle. More than fifty were lightly or seriously wounded, and more than sixty were killed in action, showing the extent of the sacrifice. Now the enemy's ambition is not dead, and they often counterattack. The night before, our army captured an armored vehicle, which was being towed to the rear by truck tonight. Unfortunately, we didn't get a close look when we met it on the road in the dark.

After consulting by telephone and obtaining the consent of Brigadier General Liao □□ of a certain brigade, Director Wang Boxiong and Wang Zhenjia led the way, wearing steel helmets and holding pistols, and groped forward for another twenty miles to inspect the positions in the □□□ area. The car encountered danger twice, and the driver accidentally touched the lever, causing him to bleed. After abandoning the car and walking, we met soldiers from a certain regiment who had just been relieved from the front lines. When they saw us wearing casual clothes, they kept calling out "Eh? Eh? Eh?" in surprise. As for their fatigue from the bloody battles, they seemed to "not care at all." This spirit of composure and perseverance is truly worthy of twelve thousand points of admiration!

Brigadier General Liao is tall and dignified. Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, we have continuously rejoiced in reading the battle reports of capturing important positions such as Chizhi University, Patriotic Girls' School, and Guangdong East Middle School, all thanks to his planning and command on the battlefield! Mr. Liao is only about thirty years old. He graduated from the Wuchang Normal University and then entered the fourth class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Since taking command, he has been known for his courage and skill in battle. It is said that he is the only graduate of the fourth class who has been promoted to brigadier general.

I had thought that this battlefield meeting would be a chance for him to talk freely about the war and express his feelings so that reporters could report to readers. Who knew that when I asked questions, he said very politely, "This all-out war of resistance is a difficult and great undertaking. As soldiers, we can only obey orders, bury ourselves in hard work, and strive to fulfill our natural duties in order to overcome the difficulties. Talking more is not helpful to the facts. However, I welcome your risking your life to come here because I want to ask you about the recent international sympathy for our country that has been invaded!"

These frank and sincere words show even more that Mr. Liao has a solid foundation in learning and a great mind. With such a general on the front lines, there is truly endless hope for victory in the war. Although he did not make an official statement, I believe that his attitude is more inspiring to us spiritually than making a statement!

### Monks' Ambulance Team Bombed on Front Lines Yesterday

Many wounded by enemy shells, Venerable Hongming slightly injured

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the monks' ambulance team has served on the front lines and achieved excellent results. The team's deputy chief, Hongming, personally led dozens of team members in five ambulances, setting off last night to the battlefields in the Liuhang and Yanghang areas. The third ambulance team rescued more than ten wounded soldiers. When passing the corner of Zhongshan Road and Hutai Road, they were hit by enemy artillery shells, killing the driver Zhou Zhiqing.

Yang Zhixiong, Zhongliang, and his sister, three young children from Fujian Province in this city, are only nine and eleven years old. After talking about how purchasing national salvation bonds is an act of patriotism, they went to the Bank of Communications on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday afternoon with a total of thirty-five yuan, including thirty-four yuan in coins saved over the years and one legal tender yuan. They personally purchased national salvation bonds. Even young children can be so enthusiastic about loving their country. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will enthusiastically contribute.

### National Youth Association Serves Troops in North China

Gongren Society Service Group Provides Long-Term Service on the Front Lines

The Military Service Department of the National Youth Association, in order to serve the troops fighting on the front lines in North China, has already established a wounded soldiers' club, an officers' club, and a soldiers' club in Baoding. All tasks have been planned and are very suitable for the needs of the local troops. In Shijiazhuang, the Youth Association has also established a service branch to provide special services for military personnel. Many soldiers and officers visit the department every day, recognizing the Youth Association as their second home.

Since its establishment, the Gongren Society Youth Service Group has been working very hard, especially in rescue work. They hear daily about going to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers and have achieved great results, which is highly praised by officers and soldiers of our army. Currently, there is a great shortage of rescue personnel on the front lines. The ×× Division of our army specially sent medical officer Li ×× to the group, requesting them to go to ×× and station there for a long time to provide rescue services. The group immediately sent personnel, and the first team set off by car to work on the front lines last night.

### Schools in the Public Concession Resume Classes One After Another

Qinghua Primary and Secondary School

Qinghua Primary and Secondary School and Kindergarten on Baker Road have now resumed classes. Despite the rumbling of artillery fire, the number of applicants increases daily. Other schools, such as Chengzhong Primary and Secondary School, Chongshi Primary and Secondary School, and the affiliated secondary school of Shanghai University, have all negotiated borrowing arrangements. The night school of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is cooperating with the Shuhua Vocational Night School affiliated with Qinghua. Thus, the singing of learning continues without interruption, cultivating talents for the country. There is much to commend. All levels of primary, secondary, and kindergarten schools continue to enroll new male and female students and offer four installments for tuition payment. Typing and traditional Chinese painting courses are available for enrollment at any time, with low fees to encourage education.

### Zhencui Primary School

Zhencui Primary School, located at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Hart Road in this city, reopened on September 10. Almost all of the old and new students attended. The school is scheduled to resume classes tomorrow, the 15th, and will continue to accept transfer students to facilitate students from the war zone.

### Amidst Vegetable Panic, Large Quantities of Salted Fish Arrive in Shanghai

Since the outbreak of the war in this city, transportation has been hindered, and vegetables from various places cannot be transported to Shanghai, directly affecting the lives of residents. The Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Association, recognizing the increasing cost of living for ordinary people, specially instructed its member Yuanchang Fish Company to directly order 300 boxes of small Qingchuan salted fish (approximately 400 catties per box) from the British company Case & Co. in Canada for long term benefit. They have now been shipped to Shanghai and will be distributed to fish vendors in order to lower market prices.

### YWCA Introduces Refugee Women and Children to Work

Since the August 13th Incident, the Shanghai YWCA began to take in refugee women and children. A few days ago, the YWCA again took in a large number of homeless women and children who had fled from Yangshupu. It is reported that the YWCA is finding it difficult to continue taking in more people due to the large number of people it has already taken in. The YWCA has found ways to introduce some of the refugees to suitable jobs. It is now publicly seeking employers for the remaining majority of refugees.

### Chinese Manager of Japanese Bank Resigns

After the outbreak of the war, the whole country united to resist Japan. According to reliable information from the Foreign Banks Association, the Chinese managers and all staff and servants of various Japanese commercial banks have resigned because they are unwilling to cooperate with the Japanese side. They have all resigned since the outbreak of the war. From now on, the Japanese side will lose their assistance, and matters in the banks will become even more disorganized. This is also a good sign of our country's resistance against Japan.

### Enemy Attacks Repeatedly Fail, We Firmly Defend New Defense Line and Respond Calmly

This morning, our side concentrated artillery fire on North Sichuan Road. Our troops on Huangxing Road bravely resisted, and the enemy suffered heavy losses.

In order to escape the threat of enemy naval artillery fire and avoid unnecessary sacrifices, our army withdrew its positions in the city center and Yinxiang Township yesterday morning (13th) and retreated to the first line of defense. The troops of our army that withdrew from the city center area guarded the line from Gaojingmiao to the Wanguo Sports Association, east of Songhu Road. Enemy troops invaded the line from Lujiajiao (west of the city stadium) to Sijingqiu Field (near Yangjiazai on Yingao Road). Since midnight yesterday, they have attacked our positions several times. Our army responded calmly, waiting for the enemy to approach before unleashing dense machine gun fire and attacking with hand grenades. As of noon today, the enemy has not succeeded. As for the troops of our army that withdrew from the Yinxiang Township area, they are guarding the line of Huangxing Road, with the right flank still based on the northern line of the concession, with no changes. The enemy in the eastern part of Yinxiang Township attacked our Huangxing Road line last night. Our army braved the rain to meet them, and the sound of rifles and machine guns never stopped all night until dawn this morning. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated.

### Enemy Troops Advance to Sijingqiu Field

At around 8:00 AM this morning, the enemy in the Sijingqiu Field area launched a fierce attack on our army's positions at Songhu Road and Jiangwan Racecourse. Our army's defenses there are solid, and the enemy suffered significant losses after being severely attacked by us. There was also artillery fire near the Zhabei Water Tower. Our army at Qingyun Road Baziqiao fiercely shelled the North Sichuan Road area at around 6:00 AM this morning. At the same time, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of beads. The enemy suffered heavy losses near the Japanese naval landing force headquarters and the Japanese elementary school.

### We Resolutely Resist on Huangxing Road

Enemy warships shelled the Huangpu River this morning. The enemy's infantry attack ultimately failed.

Although the enemy has invaded Yinxiang Township and the city center, our army in Yinxiang Township is still retreating to the area west of Ningguo Road and Huangxing Road. There was fierce rifle and machine gun fighting there from around 6:00 PM last night to dawn this morning. This morning, enemy warships occasionally opened fire in the Huangpu River, aiming at our army's positions there in order to assist their infantry's attack. However, our army resisted resolutely, vowing not to retreat. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and ultimately failed to succeed.

This kind of busy state had not been seen in a month. It seems that the enemy is reorganizing its military deployment in that area.

### Enemy Troops Attack Our Pudong Positions

Frequently Bombarding Us with Cannons This Morning, a Small Enemy Squad Attempting to Land Was Repelled

After the front lines of our army in Baoshan, Yanghang, and Yuepu were broken through by enemy troops, the situation in Pudong also became tense. Enemy troops have been patrolling the surface of the Huangpu River in armed motorboats for days, spying on our military situation and attempting to land, changing from passive to active. This morning, enemy troops resumed bombarding our army's Chen land in Pudong with cannons. At the same time, a small squad of enemy troops attempted to land and was immediately repelled by our army.

### Enemy Bombs and Destroys Alcohol Factory in Pudong

Disregarding Foreign Property, Enemy Planes Harass Nanshi Again This Morning

From 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy planes gathered in small squadrons three times and flew to Bailianjing in Pudong to bomb the alcohol factory, dropping a total of thirteen bombs, most of which landed in the fields. Although the alcohol factory was slightly damaged, many nearby civilian houses were destroyed. After crossing the river to investigate this morning, there were more than twenty people injured and five dead on the spot, all of whom were villagers in the neighborhood. It was found that the alcohol factory had long been shut down and that a British flag was hanging on its roof. At the same time, there was the American Dale Shipping Company and the British Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory nearby. Most of the factories in that area are the property of foreigners, and the Japanese planes' disregard for international law in bombing them is evidence of their arrogance. In addition, the Dongjiadu area of Nanshi was also bombed yesterday, but the bombs did not explode. At around 9:00 AM this morning, another enemy plane flew low over Nanshi along the Rihui Port area for reconnaissance and occasionally strafed with intermittent machine gun fire before flying to Pudong.

### Enemy Motorboat Sinks in Huangpu River

Five of Seven Enemy Soldiers Drown

Last night (13th), a small enemy motorboat responsible for transmitting information sailed into the Huangpu River and transmitted some kind of important information to the enemy warships in the river. The motorboat then hurriedly sailed out of the Huangpu River, but it is believed that because the boat was traveling too fast and because it was night, the boat mistakenly collided with buoy number thirty-eight, causing the boat to sink. Seven enemy soldiers were on board. Two of the enemy soldiers were rescued, and five enemy soldiers drowned. Today, another enemy warship is using machines to try to salvage the motorboat.

### Enemy Gunboats Bomb Humen This Morning, Two Shot Down by Our Planes

The authorities have sunk two civilian ships and an old ship full of cement in a shallow area of the second beach, about six miles downstream of Huangpu. Only a narrow channel is left open for ships to pass through. This morning after the battle, Chen Ce, the commander of Humen Fortress, telegraphed Guangzhou and said that the Japanese ships participating in the shelling included one cruiser and four destroyers. According to the reports of Chinese planes, the shells fired from Humen Fortress hit twice. As for the damage suffered by Humen, it was very minor and not worth mentioning.

### French Woman Writes to This Newspaper, Bitterly Describing the Enemy Planes' Atrocities

French Woman Personally Experiences Great Suffering, Expresses Gratitude to Chinese People for Escorting Her to Safety

Madam A. Jcurdant, a French national residing at No. 139 Huanlong Road, French Concession, Shanghai, encountered a Japanese aircraft bombing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train while returning to Shanghai from Mogan Mountain. She was escorted to safety by Chinese people along the way and expressed her deep gratitude. She sent a special letter to this newspaper, saying, "I went down the mountain from Mogan Mountain, where I was escaping the summer heat, on the 22nd of last month. I took the train from Hangzhou back to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at around 9 pm, when the train passed a certain village, two Japanese aircraft suddenly appeared in the sky and dropped two bombs, one in front of the train and one behind it. The railway tracks in front and behind were destroyed, and the train could not move forward. The train staff immediately informed us that there was no other way but to walk to Songjiang. At this time, the only foreigners who encountered this difficulty were myself and an American lady. I am physically weak and often ill, and it was already difficult for me to crawl alone, let alone carry the clothing I had with me. Just when I was in a state of great difficulty, two Chinese people happened to be nearby and took pity on my weakness. They generously each carried one of my clothing bags and escorted me on foot late at night, walking all night until 8 am the next morning, when we finally arrived in Songjiang. One of these Chinese people also took the train from Songjiang to Shanghai with me. I am eternally grateful. I think that the Japanese planes arbitrarily bomb civilians, non-combatants, and non-battlefields without any restraint, truly disregarding justice and lacking humanity. Recalling these two Chinese people who helped me through the difficult situation, the difference is like heaven and earth. Therefore, I am writing a few words and asking your newspaper to publish them in the newspaper to express my gratitude for the kindness of these two Chinese people. Furthermore, when I parted with these two gentlemen, I gave them my address in Shanghai in detail, and I hope that these two gentlemen will visit my humble residence so that I can thank them in person."

### Lingyan Mountain Monks Help Save the Nation and Donate

Master Yinguang is a true monk who combines words and deeds and practices diligently. In recent years, he has secluded himself in Baoguo Temple. His disciples and monks from Lingyan Temple, nearly a hundred people in total, all regard the Dharma master's morality as their guide, living a simple and ascetic life without any savings. Many people in Suzhou are well aware of this. Now that the war in Shanghai has broken out, not only is there an urgent need for military supplies, but also for funds to rescue the wounded soldiers and refugees. Master Yinguang voluntarily donated 600 yuan, Lingyan Temple donated 210 yuan, Master Desen donated 30 yuan, and Master Miaozhen Liaoran Hengzhi and others each donated 10 yuan. All the monastics and laypeople in the two temples did their best to contribute, raising a total of 1,013.8 yuan in national currency, which was transferred to the Wu County Anti-Enemy Support Association by layman Cao Songqiao. It was specified that this amount be used for three equally divided purposes: saving the nation, comforting the wounded soldiers, and rescuing the refugees, to fulfill the duties of citizens. Furthermore, Lingyan Temple has set up a shelter at its lower temple at the foot of the mountain at the end of Mudu Street to accommodate homeless refugees, with expenses generally covered by the temple monks. The monks of the two temples are so simple, yet they are so spontaneously patriotic. It is hoped that other temples and nunneries will also be inspired and invigorated.

On the 13th, it issued a general order to all its subordinates to learn from their example.

### Trivial Comments

— Xiang

I said yesterday that this Sino-Japanese war should be calculated entirely, not partially, and calculated finally, not temporarily. Therefore, the final reckoning is difficult to predict, and I don't know what year or month it will be. By extension, taking Shanghai as a small part and counting from the past month, the results are also quite gratifying. Japan was originally a demon king who instigated world wars. How arrogant and boastful it was. However, with an army of 100,000 men, fighting fiercely for more than a month, and increasing its troops three times, its losses are extremely heavy, which can be confirmed. According to general statistics, the monthly expenditure must be 50 million yuan, and the losses in property and business in Shanghai are not counted, nor are the losses of soldiers, nor are the planes and warships destroyed by our army. And the result is still outside my first line of defense. This is too wasteful.

### Painful Memories (3)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di

㊂ The Mystery of the Victory News on the 28th

The whole truth has now been fully revealed and placed before everyone. Without a doubt, all the victory news on July 28th was completely inaccurate. However, the two things that most arouse everyone's "mysterious feeling" are: First, is it possible that all the victory news, not even a trace of it exists? Third, where did these inaccurate news come from? And what for?

Regarding the first point, I think, as long as we briefly describe the real battle situation of that day, it will be completely answered.

On the 27th, the "peace" negotiations between the Hebei-Chahar authorities and the Japanese side declared their final failure. On the same day, Lai Zheyuan issued his final statement, stating: "My efforts for peace have been seen by all, but the efforts have failed. All future major plans should be presided over by the central government. I only ask all residents to remain calm and face the national crisis together," and so on. On the same night, the battles on the Tianjin-Pukou, Pinghan, and between Peiping and Tongzhou broke out simultaneously. All three routes were our side's offensive, and the points of contention were the Wanping and Lugouqiao areas on the Pinghan Line, the Fengtai and Langfang areas on the Tianjin-Pukou Line, and Tongxian, the old nest of the Ji Dong pseudo-organization between Peiping and Tongzhou. Needless to say, such an offensive strategy was carried out in accordance with the central government's instructions to take the opportunity to resolve the enemy's North China Garrison Army nearby. However, the pity is that the time was already more than two weeks late! The enemy's strength two weeks ago was already many times greater than it is now. Therefore, in addition to dealing with our attacks separately, the enemy also gathered troops and launched a fierce attack on the outskirts of Peiping in three routes: one route in the south, facing the Nanyuan area, one route in the west, the western suburbs, and one route in the north, the Shahe area. On that day, within a circular area of less than one hundred miles in diameter, battles broke out simultaneously in almost ten places. This time, the strategies used by both sides were very fierce: if our army wins on all routes, then the enemy's position in the Peiping-Tianjin area may be forced all the way to outside the pass: conversely, if the enemy wins, and Peiping is immediately lost, then our position in North China will have to be divided into three routes, and retreat separately in the directions of Ping Sui, Ping Han, and Tianjin-Pukou. On this day, we were fighting on the Ping Han Line with the 37th Division under Feng Zhi'an, on the Tianjin-Pukou Line with the 53rd Army under Wan Fulin, plus a part of Feng Zhi'an's, attacking Tongzhou with Zhao Dengyu's troops, fighting in Nanyuan with the teaching corps established not long ago, in the western suburbs with He Jifeng's Brigade under Feng Zhi'an, and fighting in Shahe with Shi Yousan's Northern Hebei Security Force. In total, in all the battles, our army took the offensive on three routes, and there were no major victories or defeats on the Ping Han Line. On the Tianjin-Pukou Line, our army did occupy Fengtai Station for two hours, but because the enemy's barracks were too fortified with electric fences, landmines, and other defensive works, after eleven assaults, they were never taken down, so before long even the station could not be held. On the Tongzhou route, we originally had a battalion of people living outside the west gate of Tongzhou. When the battle started, our reinforcements were too slow, and we did not transfer them away early, so they were tragically annihilated by the enemy. Our attacking troops encountered the enemy between Peiping and Tongzhou and engaged in fierce fighting, with no clear victory or defeat. However, the three routes of the enemy's attack on our army were very bad: First of all, in the Nanyuan area, this was where the headquarters of the 29th Army was located, and Deputy Commander Tong Linge was stationed there. However, there were no defensive works at all, nothing but a circle of earthen walls and trenches. And what was especially strange was that beforehand, it seemed that they did not even know that there would be a battle here at all. Therefore, when the enemy lined up heavy artillery to attack Nanyuan, our teaching corps stationed in Nanyuan immediately fell into a state of complete helplessness: the earthen walls were soon flattened under the bombing of artillery and aircraft, the subordinates could not find the officers, and the officers could not find the subordinates. As a result, these more than 3,000 teaching corps, who had never fought before (they were all high school or junior high school graduates), had only to rely on their flesh and blood, each doing his duty, and fighting desperately with the enemy's artillery and aircraft. As a result, more than 2,000 were killed or wounded, and only a small number escaped. And Tong Linge, who was also the head of the teaching corps, as well as Feng Guowei, the son of Feng Yuxiang, and Mr. Duan, the grandson of Duan Qirui, were also buried inside. Regarding this heroic spirit of sacrifice itself, what more can we say than to pay our respects? However, we feel that this kind of sacrifice without regard to effect, this unprepared sacrifice, is too tragic, too trifling with human life! Rather than sacrificing in such a confused way, it would be better to transfer them away early, so as to preserve a part of the nation's promising youth, which is also to leave behind a bit more vitality. Nanyuan fell on the afternoon of the 28th. As a result, Peiping had lost contact with our army on the Ping Han Road, and was surrounded by the enemy on three sides. In the Xiyuan area, our army fought very bravely. Although under the daily onslaught of enemy artillery and aircraft, the loyal He Jifeng Brigade was able to support until night, when Song Zheyuan and other senior personnel retreated, and then they withdrew. In the Shahe area, Shi Yousan's troops were defeated in two consecutive battles under the heavy pressure of the enemy and collapsed to the southwest: and the most strange thing was that the Ruan Xuanwu Brigade under Zhang Zizhong of the 38th Division stationed in Beiyuan actually stayed put and stood idly by. As the battle developed to the night of the 28th, our army was completely in a position of inferior defeat. At that time, Peiping had only two roads to take strategically: one was to abandon it, and the other was to transfer all the forces that had collapsed or not collapsed in the four suburbs into the city, plus more than 10,000 constitutional police, security teams, etc. in the city, to make a final stand and wait for our army to rescue them. However, Song Zheyuan took the first path. - Thus, Peiping fell.

From the battle situation on the mountain that day, it can be said to be a complete defeat. Where was there any victory to speak of! All the victory news was completely unfounded.

So, where did these inaccurate news come from? What was the effect?

The first to be blamed by a group of people were the journalists. They were disappointed and resentful, thinking that the journalists' words were completely unreliable, and even suspected that they had been bought off by others, and scolded them for having no personality. One of my friends angrily declared loudly: "I will never read these lying newspapers again in the future!"

In fact, it is completely unjust to place the responsibility for this same false news on the journalists. In order to answer this question, we must describe the actual situation in Peiping that day.

From the night of the 27th until the night of the 28th, during this period, the surroundings of Peiping were completely filled with the sound of gunfire, and it was not only impossible to distinguish the victory or defeat of the two sides, but even the direction from which each sound came was not clear. Except for one or two that were used to transport輸 troops, the city gates were completely closed. The outside of the city was the front line, and the clues were very complicated, and it was completely impossible to investigate the news on the ground. At this time, there were only a few sources of news: First, the official agencies that were always responsible for external announcements, second, semi-official agencies (such as the Jinde Society, etc.), and individuals related to the battle or the official side, and third, the foreign embassies.

For example, everyone had already heard the news that Fengtai had been recovered, but it was not until it was formally verified by the Jinde Society Pacification Commissioner's Office and confirmed by a certain military officer of the German Embassy that it was first printed and sold by a certain newspaper. Although the sources of other news were different, they were still from these few aspects. Even so, it is by no means possible to say that the initial source of every piece of news is the above three aspects. Sometimes, they often hear it from other aspects and describe it. Therefore, many news items have been repeatedly relayed and changed their original appearance before being printed in newspapers and announced to readers. News of this kind that cannot be traced to its source is also very钓; however, compared, there are still more official sources.

As for the effect of spreading these news items, I think, for the most part, it was because of satisfying everyone's inner hopes and fantasies, and thus, consciously or unconsciously, everyone relayed them, making them gradually exaggerated, and the more they talked, the more they seemed to be true. Naturally, there was also a small part of it that was a certain aspect's way of covering up their retreat. However, whether it is the former or the latter, it is always stupid and clumsy, and when compared with the scene the next day, we always feel that our Chinese nation has made a joke here. This is really a matter of laughing or crying!

### Enemy Ships Attack the Coastal Areas of Chaozhou and Meizhou

Attempt to Enter Shantou Port Under the Cover of Foreign Ships
Coastal Fishing Boats Detained and Fishermen Killed
Enemy Espionage Agency in Yunxiao Destroyed

Shantou Correspondence: Since the enemy announced the blockade of our coastline, four enemy ships, the Hayate, Uzutake, Sanae, and Wakatake, have been anchored near the Biaojiao Red Butterfly Line, De Island, and Chi'ao Lighthouse, eight miles from Ma Yu Kou, to control the key points of the entrance to Shantou Port, Shanghai, and the Nanyang shipping lanes. They removed their gun covers and questioned foreign ships entering and leaving. Shantou and Nan'ao are only separated by a narrow strip of water. At this moment, traffic is cut off. Fishing boats and sailboats cannot travel near the coast. Even the Chaozhou Customs patrol ships cannot go to sea to perform their inspection duties. Moreover, the enemy ships wanted to take advantage of this period to repeatedly try to enter the port under the cover of foreign ships. All were stopped by the signals issued by the Aotou mine team and could not succeed. Enemy ships interrogated foreign ships traveling in the high seas at night with signal lights, and used searchlights to illuminate the coastal villages of Chenghai and Chaoyang, driving away the boats fishing at sea, or even intercepting them. Salt, rice, and fresh fish on the boats were all looted. Fishermen who were captured were injected with medicine in both arms, causing their limbs to ache and making them unable to resist. It can be said to be inhumane. On the 29th of last month, nine fishing boats sailed to Chi'ao to cast their nets, and they never returned. According to fishermen, the fishing boats were sunk by enemy ships, and more than 70 fishermen died tragically. The families of the deceased reported to the Shantou Maritime Police Station on the 4th of this month, asking for ways to retrieve the corpses. Most of the fishermen in Shanwei, Jiao Xiao, and Zhao'an are unemployed, and fish are several times more expensive. Also, on the morning of the 4th, three enemy ships sailed from the Fujian border, passing the fishing boats off the coast of Nan'ao outside the Shantou estuary. All were shot at, and one fishing boat was captured and set on fire. Eleven fishermen died. The enemy ships then went to Shanwei, Magong, and Houmen in Haifeng County to intercept our anti-smuggling ships, firing cannons and sinking many sailboats. There were more than 100 marines on the ships, attempting to land. They were countered by our garrison troops with cannons, and after an hour of battle, enemy ships were hit by artillery shells, wounded and retreated from Magong, and then sent two seaplanes to bomb Ma Shi, Jiazi, and Shanwei. The enemy ships finally retreated at 2 pm, because the coastal defense troops were prepared.

In Yunxiao County, Fujian Province, the enemy had set up an espionage agency in the area, which was recently destroyed by the garrison troops. Plans to sabotage Fujian and Guangdong were found. The enemy spy chief, surnamed Song, ostensibly opened a pharmacy, but secretly colluded with civilian troops and bandits, provided them with food and weapons, and surveyed detailed transportation maps of Zhao'an, Yunxiao, and Pinghe, planning to respond to enemy naval and air force attacks. He also sent people to Gulangyu to participate in the organization of the "pseudo-Southern Fujian Autonomous Government," calling for anti-communism and pro-Japanese. Yunxiao is only a few hours' drive from Shantou, and is the throat of transportation between Fujian and Guangdong. Since the agency was destroyed, the military police followed the maps to arrest the traitorous agencies in Chaozhou and Shantou, and arrested more than 100 lurking traitors in one fell swoop. Eighty-four of them, with solid evidence of crimes, have been executed by shooting. Most of the traitors in the area had been specializing in smuggling to evade taxes a year ago. Now that the Japanese consulate has withdrawn and lost its support, they have become traitors. Since the espionage agency was destroyed, many traitors who slipped through the net have fled to other ports. However, the enemy's plan to break through Fujian and Guangdong has suffered a serious blow.

### Workers of Japanese Cotton Mills Request Relief

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, factories in the war zone have all ceased operations. Tens of thousands of workers have suddenly lost their jobs. The Shanghai Local Association has sent a letter to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau to organize registration and find ways to provide relief to unemployed workers in Japanese-owned cotton mills, both domestic and foreign. A special representative was dispatched to request relief from Party and government organs. It is reported that the Municipal Party Department has sent Li Weixiong, together with Du Liang from the Social Bureau, to conduct an investigation in order to find a way to handle the matter. It is reported that the Party and government authorities have decided to register unemployed workers and find ways to send them back to their hometowns to prevent them from wandering around Shanghai.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Urgently Requests Idlers Not to Stand in the Streets

The Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade hereby issues a public notice, urgently requesting idlers not to gather in the streets. In recent times, fires and stray bullet injuries have occurred frequently within the Settlement. When the Municipal Council Fire Brigade dispatches vehicles to the scene of the incident for firefighting or rescue, there are always large numbers of idlers standing in the streets to watch. This kind of meaningless behavior seriously hinders firefighting or rescue work. The actions of the fire brigade personnel prioritize speed, so that first aid can be administered to the injured in a short time and they can be sent to the hospital for treatment. If there are idlers gathering at the scene of the incident, the work of the fire brigade personnel will inevitably be delayed. Moreover, if the injuries of the injured are caused by stray bullets, there are bound to be shrapnel or stray bullets in the vicinity of the scene of the incident. The danger of being hit by bullets is even greater for pedestrians who gather to watch. In the event of an accident, the fire brigade personnel may feel that their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient. Therefore, all sectors of the public must understand this meaning and must not watch in the streets again, so as to avoid harm to both public and private interests.

### Industrial Circles Send Representatives to Console Soldiers at the Front Lines

At the joint meeting of important industrial groups and organizations held the day before yesterday, it was proposed that the heroic resistance of our military generals and soldiers during the month of the Shanghai War not only terrified the enemy, but also shocked all countries in the world. In order to show the respect of the industrial community, Hu Xiyuan was publicly elected as a representative to pay tribute to the two commanders-in-chief, Zhang Zhizhong and Zhang Fakui, and to go to the front lines to console the generals and soldiers separately.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Notice Regarding Settlement Refugee Statistics

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's statistics on the 10th of this month, there are a total of 116 refugee shelters within the Settlement inspected by the Council's Health Department, accommodating a total of 61,835 refugees. 69 people were vaccinated on the 10th, and 2,294 people were injected with preventive vaccines. According to statistics on the 12th, there were 115 shelters, accommodating 60,815 refugees. No one was vaccinated on the 11th, and 306 people were injected with preventive vaccines.

### All Group and School Relocations Must Be Reported

Since the military uprising in this city, many legitimate groups and schools have relocated. However, a small number have not reported to the Social Bureau, resulting in documents not being delivered. It is reported that the Bureau yesterday issued another notice stating that the above-mentioned groups and schools must report by letter within one week.
