### Central Memorial Week Chu Minyi Reports on the Beijing-Yunnan Tour

Opening a New Era in the History of Chinese Transportation; Offering Two Points of Meaning to the Central Government

[Nanjing] At the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 31st, Chu Minyi reported on the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour. The original words are as follows: "Fellow comrades, I was entrusted by the Central Standing Committee to report on the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour by the Executive Yuan today. Now, let me first talk about the general situation. I served as the head of the delegation and led all the members, departing from the capital on the 9th of last month. There were 108 members, plus staff and machine workers, totaling 180 people, four passenger cars, baggage cars, and one engineering car. Along the way, the provincial governments and various sectors provided us with cars, varying from six or seven to seven or eight cars. After departure, we proceeded directly southwest, passing through Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces, reaching Yunnan, with Kunming as the final destination, arriving in Kunming on the scheduled date of April 29th, totaling 24 days. These 24 days include the days of stay and sightseeing. If we remove these days of stay and sightseeing, we only traveled for 106 hours. If we average 10 hours per day, we can arrive in ten and a half days. This is based on the relatively low speed of our convoy of large passenger cars. If we use small cars for solo travel, we can arrive much faster, probably in seven or eight days, not necessarily ten and a half days. In the past, traveling from the Jiangzhe area to Yunnan and Guizhou was always seen as a daunting task, because it was difficult to get out of Sichuan. Therefore, no one dared to try. Even when it was absolutely necessary, they had to go around foreign countries. This time, we traveled by car directly from the capital to Yunnan, which is really unprecedented, opening a new era in the history of Chinese transportation and completely conquering the difficulties of the past. The closed atmosphere of 'chickens and dogs can hear each other, but people do not interact until they grow old and die' has been completely broken, which is also worth recording. Therefore, the provincial capitals, cities, counties, towns, and villages that we passed through were warmly welcomed by the party, government, military, academic, and various sectors of the population. Their intention was also to value the success of this trunk road and to support the Central Government's spirit of striving for transportation construction in the midst of serious national crisis. Moreover, in their warm welcome, we can see that their training and organization have been quite successful. For example, in Guangxi, they shouted slogans, but other provinces did not shout slogans. Even though they did not shout slogans, they were still very happy. However, when we passed by, everyone's hearts were in harmony, and a sincere unity and a determination to go to the national crisis together could be seen on their faces. Therefore, the enthusiasm and solemnity of the mood when we encountered thousands or tens of thousands of people lined up to welcome us is really indescribable. Our inspection was conducted in groups due to time constraints, spending one or two days, or three to five days, or even seven to eight days in each place. The result of the inspection is that we feel that all provinces are working hard, and we also feel that the opening of the Beijing-Yunnan Highway can promote various new constructions in various places, especially the testing and improvement of agricultural products and the development of mining. Because in the places where the highway passes, the population that had decreased due to natural disasters and man-made disasters has gradually increased, and the places that have not experienced natural disasters and man-made disasters are more developed than before. In various aspects, there has been significant progress due to convenient transportation. It can be seen that the prediction of some people in the past that the highway would not benefit the common people is incorrect. Comparing the highways that we passed through this time, the best are Hunan and Guangxi provinces, followed by Guangzhou and Jiangxi provinces, and then Anhui province. There is a section of highway in Anhui that is the worst, because the Beijing-Ganzhou Railway is being built, and materials are being transported day and night, damaging the road and leaving no time to repair it. This should be forgiven. The highway in Yunnan, from the border to Kunming, is not only good, but also very beautiful, because the soil color is red, and the sidewalks on both sides are marked with white lines for distinction. Looking from a distance, it looks like a red carpet with white lines, which is very beautiful. The road in Jiangxi is because the construction had to be fast, the distance had to be long, and the funding had to be saved. Under these three conditions, it is not as good as Hunan. In short, we now have this very good trunk road, but it is still not enough. We need each province to build more branch roads. Having highways is not enough; we need railways. Therefore, we hope that the Xiang-Gui, Xiang-Qian, and Qian-Dian railways that are now being planned can be built quickly. After these roads are built, and then the Yunnan-Myanmar, Yunnan-Siam, and Gui-Zhen lines are built, the southwest transportation network can be considered complete. At present, we already have this Beijing-Yunnan Highway, which unites the southwestern provinces with the central government and consolidates China's unity. In the future, when the above-mentioned railways are completed one by one, culture, economy, and all aspects will surely be greatly developed. In several provinces that we passed through, the people presented their grievances to us. For small matters, we sent them to the civil affairs departments of each province for investigation. Larger matters have been brought back and will be sent to the Executive and Judicial Yuan for handling separately in the future. This situation is most common in Guizhou province, because in remote areas, administration and justice cannot be clearly separated, and judicial organs are not widespread, with several counties sharing one judicial organ, making it very inconvenient for people to file lawsuits. In the past, during the Qing Dynasty, at the junction of Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi, Miao people's uprisings often occurred due to bad local officials. This time, when we went to those places, there was one very happy thing, that is, the Miao and Yi ethnic groups also came to welcome us, giving us the opportunity to approach them and tell them the meaning of the central government's sincere unity, and that everyone should work together to restore our national status. They also clearly understood the central government's intentions and accepted our words very much. Before we went to the southwest, we had not seen the Miao and Yi people, and we thought that there were distinctions between Han, Miao, and Yi in our country. After this approach, we realized that since the Republic of China, the Miao and Yi people have gradually assimilated and do not need special education and treatment. Now, the children of the Miao and Yi people are studying in the same school as the Han children, and in one or two generations, there will definitely be no difference. This is also a very good phenomenon in ethnic unity. The Miao and Yi people have very good physiques and can endure hardship. From ancient times to the present, they have always been self-sufficient in farming, food, weaving, and clothing. The only thing they lack is salt. In the past, because they had no writing, their knowledge was lower. However, the Han people are weak and their physiques are not as good as theirs. Therefore, the adjustment between Han, Miao, and Yi is also an effective method of improving the nation." (To be continued) (30th Central News Agency dispatch)

As for the preliminary elections of Chinese nationals in various places, they have basically come to an end, and the re-election will be held in early July.

### Liu Jui-heng Discusses the Plague in Fukien Province

[Nanking] Liu Jui-heng said that the plague is rampant in Fukien Province. Invited by Chairman Chen, he is coming south to find a fundamental solution to reduce the plague. He flew from Shanghai to Foochow, stayed for four days, and then went to Foochow, Putian, and other places for inspection. Except for Xianyou, all counties he passed have health institutes. The plague in Fukien has a history of decades and occurs every year. This year, it has reached more than ten counties, and the death toll has reached three to four thousand people. The actual number is probably close to Yu. The plague this year is more severe near the coast because the residents plant taro, and rats can live and reproduce in the fields. He has agreed with Chairman Chen on a five-year eradication plan, and decided to set up epidemic prevention centers in southern Fujian, northern Fujian, and western Fujian as epidemic prevention centers. Each county will set up branches to handle rat extermination and preventive isolation hospitals. If this is done, the plague can be eradicated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

### Promoting Handicrafts and National Economic Construction

Chairman Lin's Speech at the National Government Memorial Week

[Nanking] The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 31st. Teng Chia-yen, Ching Heng-yi, Chen Chi-liang, Chen Hsun-yu, Chen Chi-cai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials of the National Government and various ministries, totaling more than 400 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he delivered a speech on "Promoting Handicrafts and National Economic Construction." First, he said that the National Handicraft Exhibition has opened in the capital. This move has a significant relationship with the National Economic Construction Movement and the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood. He personally visited the exhibition, and the products from various provinces and cities and the four northeastern provinces participated in the exhibition. There were a total of thirty-two applying units, and the total number of products reached more than 30,000 pieces. The skills of all industries are complete and complete, which is unprecedented. Compared with the products of previous national product exhibitions, he felt that there were many improvements. Second, he expressed his feelings, saying that the Premier said, "The most important thing in construction is the people's livelihood," and the initial step of the people's livelihood construction should start from the construction of the national economy, because the current national crisis is caused by many factors, and the most serious one is the decline of the national economy. Our country is based on agriculture, and the consumption of goods in various places is based on agricultural products and rural by-products of handicrafts. Under the simple and thrifty living conditions of the general people, they can be self-sufficient. However, since the Opium War, the economic aggression forces of imperialism have gradually entered the interior. As a result, foreign goods are all over the market, and handicrafts in various places have been devastated and oppressed, and there is almost no place to stand. In the past, farmers relied on handicrafts to sell and subsidize their daily expenses, but now they not only lose their source, but also need to buy their daily needs from abroad. According to international trade statistics in recent years, the import of food, clothing, shelter and other items alone reaches 350 to 60 million yuan each year, plus the import of other consumer goods, so there is a huge trade deficit every year, and the people's conditions have declined as a result, gradually becoming anemia of the nation-state, and foreign troubles have taken advantage of it. Therefore, to implement the people's livelihood construction, we must first start from the national economic construction, and the initial step of the construction should first promote handicrafts, so that they can restore their inherent self-sufficiency status, and then reduce the trade deficit and block the leak. Next, he believed that it was necessary to vigorously promote the domestic consumption of handicrafts in our country, the trend of foreign trade, and the skills of their products. He also said that the new-style industry in our country is now in its early stages, and handicrafts must be supported to help its development. Finally, he said that there are five reasons why handicrafts are not developed: ㊀ Some people like to use foreign loans, ㊁ The technology has not been improved, ㊂ The organization is not sound, ㊃ They do not know how to promote foreign sales, ㊄ Lack of capital and inconvenient transportation. Finally, he said that the above five points should be improved separately to seek improvement. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)

### Implementation of Increased Unified Tax on Cotton Yarn

[Nanking] The current unified tax on cotton yarn is divided into two levels. For undyed cotton yarn within 23 counts, the national currency is collected at 2 yuan and 75 cents per 100 catties. For those exceeding 23 counts, the national currency is collected at 3 yuan and 75 cents per 100 catties. The Ministry of Finance has implemented this unified tax for six years and has not changed it. In recent years, yarn prices have risen sharply. Compared with the selling price, this tax rate is only about 3%, which is the lightest burden compared with other unified tax commodities. Moreover, its grading is too simple, and the burden is even more difficult to average. Therefore, it has been appropriately modified and divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A yarn, no more than 17 counts, is taxed at 5 yuan per 100 kilograms. Grade B yarn, exceeding 17 counts to 23 counts, is taxed at 5 yuan and 70 cents per 100 kilograms. Grade C yarn, exceeding 23 counts to 35 counts, is taxed at 7 yuan and 50 cents per 100 kilograms. Grade D yarn, exceeding 35 counts, is taxed at 10 yuan per 100 kilograms. The Tax Administration has been instructed to implement it on the 1st. As for the transitional measures for the new and old tax rates, the Tax Administration is currently reviewing them. According to the cotton yarn tax revenue in the 25th year, it totaled more than 23.11 million yuan. Now, due to the increase in tax rates, it is expected to exceed 30 million yuan. The increased funds will be used for economic construction. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)

Current Commentary

### Will Roosevelt Dedicate Himself to International Peace?

— Star

Recently, Mussolini told an American reporter that if President Roosevelt convenes an international disarmament conference, Italy will wholeheartedly support it. All countries in the world will participate. His conversation was aimed at the broadcast speech of US Secretary of State Hull on May 22. At that time, Hull advocated convening countries around the world and asking them to disarm spiritually, politically, militarily and economically. Based on friendship, cooperation and fair negotiations, adjust international relations. Mussolini, who is obsessed with military aggression and wanton aggression, said that peace is needed, and the United States, which advocates isolationism, advocates international cooperation. Naturally, this is good news. However, diplomatic rhetoric is always diplomatic rhetoric. We cannot have excessive expectations for these two conversations.

If the United States can truly use all its political, economic, and military power to oppress countries obsessed with military aggression, so that they can know their way back, then universal international disarmament and economic cooperation may not be impossible to achieve. But in fact, even if President Roosevelt is willing to do so, the domestic and international situation does not allow it. First, from a domestic perspective, the arrogance of isolationism is very high now. The passage of the Neutrality Act was a victory for the isolationists in Congress. The current upper and lower houses of Congress are controlled by farmers from the western and southern regions. Any international cooperation proposal will be suspected by them as a trick of capitalists and financial groups. Roosevelt's power comes from the southwest. He cannot violate this prejudice and pressure. The Democratic Party is traditionally isolationist. They believe that the United States can avoid world turmoil and be independent.

From the perspective of the international situation, the United States' efforts for international peace are even less mature. First, economic disarmament has not yet been lifted. Only political relations based on economic cooperation are stable. The expansion of armaments in various countries is also due to the protection of their own markets and emerging industries on the one hand, and the seizure of raw material supply areas and markets abroad by means of armaments on the other hand. Under the spirit of national consumerism, armaments are indispensable conditions. If the system of economic isolation is not lifted, talking about lifting armaments is putting the cart before the horse. However, the United States is the country with the most stringent tariff barriers and the most reactionary economic policy. Although Hull and others advocate free trade, he can only sign some unimportant trade agreements with small South American countries. If he really opens the door to the United States and accommodates products from countries such as Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, then the selfish and self-interested industry spokespersons in Congress will roar.

Second, international organizations are not yet sound, and collective peace is only going bankrupt day by day. It is true that some countries in the world are expanding their armaments in order to invade other countries. However, most of them are expanding their armaments in order to seek their own security and prevent aggression from other countries. When security is not guaranteed by other methods, asking them to disarm will only increase the opportunity for aggressors. Therefore, France advocates that security must be sought first before disarmament. And the guarantee of security is due to collective responsibility and international organization. Countries such as Britain, France, and even the Soviet Union have been actively expanding their armaments in recent years, not because they have the intention of aggression. If international peace treaties are ineffective and security is not guaranteed, especially if several countries with the power to lead the world cannot wholeheartedly support international organizations and sacrifice for collective security, then the world will still be an anarchic world. Each country can act according to its free will. It is difficult to discuss disarmament with a tiger. And the country in the world that is most unwilling to serve international organizations is the United States. Up to now, the United States is unwilling to join even the International Court of Justice. Although the President has this proposition, he cannot withstand the attacks of Congress. To eliminate international thieves, to disarm international private forces, there must be an international police force. With public soldiers, private soldiers can be abolished. However, the traditional belief of the United States is to oppose joining any international organization.

With the above two difficulties, the possibility of convening an international disarmament conference in Mussolini's mouth is very small, and the possibility of the President of the United States being the initiator is even more slim. The germs of international peace are not only armaments, but also the feeling of insecurity and dissatisfaction behind the armaments. Only economic cooperation can eliminate the feeling of dissatisfaction. Only the strengthening of international organizations can eliminate the feeling of insecurity. In today's world of power politics, armaments are not only a sharp weapon in wartime, but also a sharp weapon in diplomacy in peacetime. Having a huge army, navy and air force will give you a loud voice on the international stage and allow you to promote your national policy at will. This is the biggest source of peace. If the United States is willing to treat this world disease, it must first reflect on itself, restrain and restrain itself. Otherwise, diplomatic rhetoric is only diplomatic rhetoric.

### End of Japanese Political Strife: The Hayashi Cabinet Finally Collapses

In office for only 117 days, Hiranuma is a promising candidate to succeed. The order to form a cabinet will be issued tonight.

[Tokyo] The Hayashi Cabinet submitted its collective resignation at 4:42 PM today. (March 31st, Domei News Agency)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi's resignation statement today was announced by Chief Cabinet Secretary Ohashi, highlighting two crucial points: ㊀ The resignation was acknowledged as being forced by the anti-government movement triggered by the dissolution of the Diet on March 31st; ㊁ Regret was expressed for the inability to realize several points within the political renewal policy, but it was announced that the foundation for political renewal had been completed. After submitting his resignation to the Emperor, Prime Minister Hayashi left the palace at 5:18 PM. The Emperor has ordered Hayashi Senjuro to continue administering state affairs pending the formation of a new cabinet. Regarding the formation of a new cabinet, the Emperor has dispatched Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa Kurahei to seek the opinion of Prince Saionji. (March 31st, Central News Agency)

[Tokyo] The Hayashi Cabinet only lasted 117 days, except for the Katsura Taro Cabinet in 1913, this is unprecedented (Note: The Katsura Cabinet resigned on February 20, 1913, with a lifespan of two months). Three days ago, the general impression was still that Hayashi Senjuro might be able to hold on until the special Diet session. However, the joint meeting of various parties on the 28th made it generally believed that a vote of no confidence in the government would surely pass. Since then, internal disagreements among cabinet members have intensified, greatly diminishing Hayashi Senjuro's confidence in facing the special Diet session. This situation has almost decided that the Hayashi Cabinet must resign immediately. However, the general public believes that the collapse of the Hayashi Cabinet today is a manifestation of the participation of senior statesmen, most members of the House of Peers, and naval figures in established political parties' anti-government actions, which led to this outcome. On the 29th of this month, Konoe Fumimaro strongly argued against the possibility of dissolving the Diet again. This statement is quite important. The fundamental reason for the inevitable collapse of the Park Cabinet is, on the one hand, the increasing antagonism between Hayashi Senjuro and political parties, and on the other hand, the growing internal disagreements within the government, which have seriously hindered the realization of the so-called political renewal policy. Regarding the organization of the new cabinet, many rumors are currently circulating. Among the candidates for the future prime minister, Hiranuma Kiichiro, Konoe Fumimaro, Tai Kakuken, Minami Jiro, and others are considered the most promising. At the same time, Suetsugu Nobumasa, Yuki Toyotaro, and Kodama Kenji, and even Honjo Shigeru, are also considered possibilities. However, in general, it is believed that there is no possibility of Honjo Shigeru becoming prime minister at present. Regarding the organization of the new cabinet, there is now one element, that is, how to reconcile the opposition of political parties. This opposition reflects the public's disgust with the government's arbitrary and severe policies. For this reason, it is possible that the composition of the future new cabinet will include military figures, politicians, financial magnates, and representatives of political parties. (March 31st, Central News Agency)

[Tokyo] Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa visited Privy Council President Hiranuma at his private residence in Nishiohkubo at 5:50 PM, exchanging important opinions before departing. After meeting with Privy Council President Hiranuma, Minister Yuasa returned to his private residence at 7:05 PM and told people that he did not intend to go anywhere else today, and would go to Okitsu at 5:30 AM tomorrow, and planned to return to Tokyo early that day. Minister Yuasa was ordered to visit Prince Saionji to discuss the nomination of a successor to the Prime Minister, and is expected to arrive in Okitsu on the morning of the 1st. Negotiations are scheduled to be held that day, and he will return to Tokyo in the afternoon to report back, so the order to form a cabinet may be issued on the evening of the 1st. Prime Minister Hayashi visited Privy Council President Hiranuma at his residence at 2:30 PM on the 31st, briefly stating that in view of the seriousness of the situation, he explained his determination and sought his understanding.

[Tokyo] Today's regular cabinet meeting was held from 10:15 AM to 11:00 AM, but the cabinet members did not disperse and listened to Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru's report on the general political situation in China.

(March 31st, Domei News Agency)

### Japanese Right-Wing Groups Actively Forming a Party

Nearly a thousand right-wing groups, large and small, divided into three major factions, making merger difficult.

[Tokyo] The meeting between Kensawa and Kobayashi with Hayashi Senjuro on the 25th of this month has accelerated the organization of the Japanese Great Fascist Party. On the 28th, Kobayashi Junichiro, leader of the current affairs council, visited Kensawa Misuji. On the same day, Kensawa also visited Hashimoto Kingoro, leader of the Great Japan Youth Party. On the evening of the 29th, about fifty leaders of existing right-wing groups held a joint meeting at the headquarters of the Great Japan Youth Party, and decided on the spot to publicly elect Kensawa as the party leader, and authorize Major General Eto Genkuro, leader of the Political Renewal Association, and Shiio Benkyo, leader of the Dankitsukai, to be responsible for the concrete implementation of the movement to unite all right-wing groups, and to absorb right-leaning elements in the current House of Representatives. Their attitude towards the Hayashi Cabinet is to strongly demand the re-dissolution of the Diet. If Prime Minister Hayashi accepts this request, they will support him, otherwise they will oppose him. A larger meeting will be held tomorrow. In addition to the above-mentioned members, leaders of other right-wing groups will also attend. At present, there are no less than a thousand right-wing groups in Japan, large and small, but the members of most groups are very few, and none of them have any mass base. They still oppose mergers because each faction is supported by capitalists related to the military industry, or aided by landlords and soldiers. If they give up their independence due to mergers, their financial sources will be cut off. Recently, encouraged by Hayashi Senjuro, and actively stimulated by monopolists in the financial and military circles, large right-wing groups have attempted to forcibly eliminate the localism of small factions. However, until now, the three major factions are still fighting each other regarding their attitude towards the Diet. The first faction advocates fundamentally abolishing the Diet system and returning the right to vote to the Emperor. The main groups belonging to this faction are the Current Affairs Council, including the Great Japan Production Party, the Black Dragon Society, etc. The second faction insists on the necessity of fighting in the Diet in order to obtain a majority of seats in the Diet. The main members of this faction are the Political Renewal Association, including the Great Japan Youth Party, the People's Association, the Hometown Army Compatriots Association, etc. The third faction is the neutral faction, such as the National Founding Society, the Imperial Way Society, and the Yangzheng Society. Now the first faction has decided on four main principles to deal with the current movement: ㊀ All groups joining the future new political party should voluntarily dissolve; ㊁ The foundation of the new party should be built on the masses; ㊂ Members of existing political parties who are willing to join the new political party should disassociate themselves from the original political party in advance; ㊃ Absorb neutral elements as much as possible. If the above four principles can be fully realized, a new stage in the Japanese Fascist movement can be developed, and Japan's national military, economic, political, and cultural mobilization can be advanced at a faster pace. (March 31st, Central News Agency)

[Tokyo] Recently, there have been extremely active activities among the leaders of the two mainstreams of Japanese right-wing groups, the Current Affairs Council and the Political Renewal Council, and other factions. Some of the core members of the right-wing factions also advocate that, under the goal of breaking up existing political parties and carrying out the so-called Showa Restoration, they should abandon minor differences, unite, and form a new political party. Therefore, the realization of a new right-wing party is quite promising. On the one hand, the previously chaotic and disorganized claims of each faction will also be reviewed again, using the issue of unity as an opportunity. Because in the past, the methods of seizing power by the right-wing were inconsistent. For example, the Political Renewal Council advocated that, with members of the House of Representatives such as Akamatsu, Eto, Yamazaki, and Koike as the center, they would fight within the Diet organization and carry out political reform. On the contrary, the Current Affairs Council is unwilling to actively compete in elections, but relies on the cooperation of Kobayashi Junichiro, Ida Iwata, Watanabe Ryozo, and powerful figures in the political world, strengthening the national movement, and contacting various right-wing groups to achieve its goals. Therefore, from the overall situation, it is difficult to expect the success of the new party movement among these growing groups with conflicting opinions. Only in fact, the center of gravity of the new right-wing party is the Political Renewal Council. However, many of the leaders of the council have turned from the left wing, so they are often envied by the traditional right wing. Even if a new party is formed with the council as the center, the consciousness of the right-wing groups is so inconsistent and their emotions are so opposed that it is still difficult to expect the heads of the various factions to achieve great unity, or even the establishment of a new party on the entire right-wing front. But at the same time, the factions with a sincere attitude towards organizing a new party still believe that Lieutenant General Tatekawa, the central force of the right-wing faction, and Colonel Hashimoto (Great Japan Youth Party), who has close ties with the lieutenant general, are the center and actively begin activities. Judging from the current situation, this faction may overcome obstacles and quickly make the new party movement centered on Lieutenant General Tatekawa concrete. The future is quite noteworthy in all aspects. (March 30th, Domei News Agency)

### Japanese Army Advocates a Cabinet of Talent

Close Sino-Italian Relations

[Rome] King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy received our special envoy Kong Xiangxi and deputy envoy Chen Shaokuan this morning. Special Envoy Kong and his party arrived here from Geneva yesterday morning, attracting the attention of Rome. Rome's famous daily newspaper, "The Messenger," published the news of Special Envoy Kong's arrival in Italy on the cover in three lines. Special Envoy Kong met with local journalists today and said that he was very happy to revisit Italy this time (Special Envoy Zhazha traveled to Europe and the United States from 1932 to 1935 and came to Italy), and he was especially happy to meet his old friend Count Ciano. Special Envoy Zha also told reporters that the relations between China and Italy have always been very friendly, and he hopes that the relations between the two countries will become closer this time.

Today's newspapers here published a long biography of President Kong on the front page, emphasizing Kong's achievements in the new China, especially when General Chiang Kai-shek was in danger in Xi'an, Kong presided over the central government and stabilized the political situation, so General Chiang's escape from danger was due to Kong's cautious policy. This success strengthened the domestic national character's trust in the National Government. Kong then praised Foreign Minister Ciano, saying that he first met Ciano several years ago in General Chiang Kai-shek's residence in Nanjing, and at that time Kong got a deep impression that Ciano was the best at mediation. Kong finally declared that Ciano's superior and direct understanding of the Far East and China is of inestimable value in maintaining Sino-Italian relations. (March 30th, National Haitong News)

### Japan to Build Transverse Railroad in Central Mountainous Region

[Tokyo] The mountainous and rugged central region of Japan is known as the "Roof of Japan" and transportation is extremely inconvenient. Therefore, during the Hara Cabinet, there was a plan to build a North-South Alps transverse railroad (from Matsumoto City, the gateway to the Japanese Alps on the Central Line, to the Kugukuno Station on the mountain railway Takayama Line, which was opened last year). Moreover, the overlapping mountains along the line belong to the Imperial Household Ministry's imperial forest, which has not been cut down for thousands of years, so the Imperial Household Ministry also hopes to build the Alps transverse railroad to transport the timber from the imperial forest. The National Railways also feel that shortening the route connecting the Takayama Line is extremely necessary in terms of transportation policy. Now the construction is planned, and it has taken three years to complete the actual on-site survey until recently. Therefore, the authorities will start the economic investigation along the line in the future, and plan to prepare a concrete plan before the budget formulation period next year and request a construction cost budget. Then, the realization of the transverse railroad connecting the North and South Alps of Japan is just around the corner. (March 31st, Domei News Agency)

⊙Valencia: The Ministry of Defense has issued a communiqué stating that one German battleship and four destroyers sailed from near Cartagena Port to Almería Port at 5:45 this morning, and fired shells from about 12 kilometers outside the port, without prior warning and without a specific target, firing about two hundred shells in total. Many houses were destroyed, and the number of dead and wounded is unknown. The national coastal defense artillery also returned fire with more than sixty shells, and seemed to have hit one German destroyer. The German warships stopped firing at 6:50 AM and released smoke bombs before sailing east. Coast guard personnel witnessed each warship flying the German flag, forming a war formation and blockading the bay. However, the government army immediately dispatched a destroyer to inspect outside the port. It was reported that the German warships had sailed to Melilla, Spanish Morocco. In addition, several ships belonging to the government army also shelled. (March 30th, Havas News Agency)

⊙Valencia: According to today's communiqué, Almería Port was bombarded by German ships, killing 19 people, including five women and one child, and destroying 39 houses.

[Geneva] One German cruiser and two destroyers fired shells today, fiercely bombarding the port of Almería, held by the Spanish government, in retaliation for the bombing of the German ship "Deutschland" by Spanish government planes on Saturday. The chairman of the League of Nations Spanish government representative, Dai Yu, has confirmed the above news. Geneva attaches great importance to this retaliatory plan, believing that this is the first open act of aggression by German ships against the Spanish government. Berlin has not revealed the nature of the measures agreed upon by Germany to deal with the "Deutschland" attack. However, since this morning, the German government has been very active, holding meetings almost continuously. From this, it can be seen that the government considers the attack on the German ship to be the most serious provocative incident since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. (March 31st, Reuters)

[Berlin] Officials here declared that, in view of the bombing of the German ten-thousand-ton pocket battleship "Deutschland," the German government has now instructed its representative to the Non-Intervention Committee to send a note from the German government to the chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee. The note stated, "Before reliable guarantees can be obtained that such unexpected incidents will not occur frequently, Germany will no longer participate in any meetings of the International Monitoring and Non-Intervention Committee. As for the method of retaliating against the Spanish government for this insidious act, Germany will naturally decide on its own. German warships have received clear orders that, in the current situation, any aircraft and warships of the Valencia government will be met with armed resistance."

### Hitler Rushes Back to Berlin for Emergency Meeting

Decision Made to Adopt Retaliatory Measures; Tensions High in Berlin

[Berlin] Because its pocket battleship "Deutschland" was bombed, resulting in 23 deaths, 19 serious injuries, and 64 minor injuries, Germany today shows signs of abandoning its neutrality in the Spanish Civil War, and has declared that it will take retaliatory measures against the "communist murderers of Valencia." After receiving news of the bombing of the "Deutschland," people have gathered in the streets to discuss the matter, and the intensity of their anger has further heightened international tensions. After conferring with Prussian Prime Minister Göring, Foreign Minister Neurath, Naval Commander Admiral Raeder, and Army Chief General von Blomberg, etc., the Führer Hitler announced that the government would take "independent action." It is apparent that if the Non-Intervention Committee cannot prevent such incidents from recurring through forceful international action, (National Telegram from the 31st)

[Berlin] The German 10,000-ton pocket battleship "Deutschland" was bombed by Spanish government aircraft outside the port of Ibiza on Saturday. According to official sources, 23 crew members died, 19 were seriously injured, and 64 were slightly injured. It is reported that the German government has decided to adopt retaliatory measures. Official circles here are saying the situation is extremely serious. Upon hearing the news of the bombing of the "Deutschland," German cabinet members immediately became highly active. Foreign Minister Neurath took an overnight train to Munich to discuss the matter with the Führer Hitler, who was in the city attending an agricultural exhibition. At the same time, Navy Minister Raeder also flew from Berlin to Munich. After the three men conferred, they took a plane back to Berlin together and convened an emergency meeting of the entire cabinet. Air Minister General Göring rushed back from Weimar overnight to attend the cabinet meeting. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that the government had decided to implement a certain plan and that the measures would be notified to the Non-Intervention Committee. The communiqué also stated that the crew members of the battleship "Deutschland" were in an unprotected area when the aircraft dropped bombs. The ship was hit by two bombs, one of which hit the crew quarters, causing many deaths and injuries, and the other hit the side of the ship, causing slight damage to the side and deck. After being hit, the ship maintained its full combat capability and sailed to Gibraltar, so that the wounded could disembark for medical treatment. The red government of Valencia had been repeatedly warned by the Non-Intervention Committee and the German government to refrain from attacking ships carrying out international monitoring work, yet it still committed this act of bombing a German ship. We have no choice but to deal with this. The planned measures will be immediately notified to the Non-Intervention Committee. It was also stated that since the Italian ships were attacked in the port of Majorca, German ships have been prohibited from sailing to that port. Therefore, the "Deutschland" was anchored in the anchorage of Ibiza. All cabinet members were greatly angered by the bombing of the German ship. As for the nature of the retaliatory plan that Germany intends to take, it may be announced today. The Navy Department has ordered all ships to fly half-mast in mourning, and German newspapers have all published this news on the front page, bordered in black. The reports claim that, according to eyewitnesses, the Spanish government's claim that the German ship fired on the aircraft first is not true. The fact that the crew members were in an unprotected area further shows the falsity of the Spanish government's claim. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

[Berlin] Newspapers here all believe the situation is extremely serious and that Rear Admiral Fischer, commander of the German fleet in Spanish waters, has telegraphed a warning to the authorities in Valencia. This warning should not be taken lightly. The Berliner Tageblatt said, "Attacking foreign warships engaged in monitoring in Spanish waters is a premeditated step. This has been proven by the Palma incident. Such a situation is extremely dangerous. Up to now, all German warships and their commanders stationed in Spanish ports have remained calm in the face of such provocations. In the future, if such incidents occur again, they will naturally be dealt with accordingly." (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 29th)

### Great Shock in Various Countries; Efforts to Prevent Deterioration of the Situation

British and French Authorities Receive Ambassadors; League of Nations to Hold Special Meeting

[London] The bombing of the cruiser "Deutschland" has today caused shock in various European capitals and dealt a major blow to efforts to prevent other countries from interfering in the Spanish Civil War. The ship was bombed near the Balearic Islands, in an area designated for patrolling by the Non-Intervention Committee. Observers do not believe that Germany will abandon its promise to maintain neutrality as a result, but it may demand that countries take strict action against the Spanish government, which could divide the Non-Intervention Committee into left and right factions. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently ordered Italian ships to fire on any Spanish government aircraft flying toward the Mediterranean Sea. This attitude is also a provocative move. It is understood that Germany and Italy are now discussing the policy to be adopted. As for the responsibility for the bombing, the two sides disagree. The Spanish government claims that the German ship fired with anti-aircraft guns before the bombing, while the Germans deny having fired. At the same time, the Spanish government also claims that the cruiser "Deutschland" should not have sailed to the Balearic Islands, as the area should be patrolled by France according to the regulations of the Non-Intervention Committee. (National Telegram from the 31st)

[London] The shelling of the port of Almería by German warships has shocked the general public here. Official circles are very concerned but have made no comment. Political figures are extremely uneasy and generally disapprove of this move. It is said that the German government's reaction to the bombing of the cruiser "Deutschland" is understandable, but to formally declare war as a retaliatory measure would be excessive. It is not yet known what attitude the British government will take, but it can be asserted that it will do everything possible to prevent the current situation from becoming more serious. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to make a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon and will meet with French Ambassador Corbin, German Embassy Counselor Wallmann, and Italian Ambassador Grandi at noon for talks. German Ambassador Ribbentrop is also scheduled to make a statement this afternoon. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

[Paris] Prime Minister Blum received Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Schellschfeil and former Spanish Ambassador Gañán one after the other this morning. At noon, he had lunch with Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, with French Foreign Minister Delbos also in attendance. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

[Paris] The French people were greatly shocked to hear about the shelling of the port of Almería by German warships. The French government immediately contacted the governments of the countries concerned, especially the British government. According to initial reports, the cruiser "Deutschland" appeared in the Bay of Ibiza in the Spanish Balearic Islands without any reason. ① The monitoring work in the waters of the Balearic Islands is carried out by French warships. ② The London Adjustment Committee had designated several ports in French Algeria in North Africa to allow German warships to anchor in order to refuel and replenish supplies. ③ When the "Deutschland" arrived in the Bay of Ibiza, it did not notify the authorities of the Balearic Islands in accordance with maritime law. Observers also said that the "Deutschland" was not carrying out monitoring work on the sea when it was bombed, and therefore was not subject to the control of the Adjustment Committee. However, the committee should still investigate the situation. As for how Germany will retaliate, the decision is naturally in its own hands. In the past, Britain and France have also experienced similar incidents, although their nature was not as serious as this one. However, for the sake of peace, Britain and France have never intended to take retaliatory measures. The action taken by Germany this time is extremely serious. It is hoped that it will avoid causing international disputes, so that the non-intervention policy, especially the monitoring plan, will not have to be reconsidered. In addition, regarding the possibility that the two Republican governments may request the League of Nations Council to hold an extraordinary meeting, French political figures are adopting a reserved attitude, believing that since Germany is not a member of the League of Nations, the Council's meeting, even if held, would not achieve concrete results. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

[Geneva] The initial report received in Geneva came from Gibraltar and was soon confirmed by Spanish representative to Geneva, Valera. The representatives of various countries gathered here were greatly shocked, as this move was the first open action taken by a German warship against the Spanish government, and they all took a serious attitude. It is expected that the Spanish government will petition the League of Nations. According to Spanish sources, Spanish representative Valera intends to request the League of Nations to convene a special meeting of the Council to consider the situation caused by the "Deutschland" incident. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

[Geneva] Regarding the bombing of the German cruiser "Deutschland" and the shelling of the port of Almería by German warships, observers here have stated that the situation is extremely serious and must be handled calmly. It is rumored that the Spanish Republican government has requested the League of Nations Council to convene a meeting immediately. In fact, as of now, the Secretariat of the League of Nations has not received any communication, but it is believed that the Spanish government may invoke Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, namely the treaty regarding respect for the territorial integrity of all member states, and request the Council to take action. The Council may hold an extraordinary meeting on the 2nd or 3rd of next month, and not in Geneva, so that Germany and Italy can send representatives to participate. However, no one knows whether those countries will agree to send representatives. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 21st)

### Basque Capital Destroyed by German Planes

British Investigation Confirms

Bilbao: After the former Basque autonomous capital of Guernica was destroyed by Nationalist aircraft, the British Air Ministry sent investigator Kinnin to investigate. He has now released a report stating that the aircraft were made in Germany and piloted by German aviators who flew to Spain before the monitoring measures were implemented. The German aviators were ordered to show no restraint during combat. This is beyond doubt. I personally questioned German pilot Fantel, who was captured by government forces. He stated that he was ordered to strafe with machine guns as soon as he approached the ground, because the incendiary bombs carried by German aircraft were old-fashioned, and it was impossible to hit the target if dropped from a certain height, so it was better to strafe with machine guns. I also found several such bombs, some of which were made in 1926, all engraved with German writing. The Spanish government forces also shot down several German Heinkel He 51 fighters. The instruments inside, used to calculate the number of propeller rotations, were also annotated in German, indicating that they were intended for German aviators. In short, I personally witnessed many German Heinkel bombs and several Heinkel He 51 fighters on the Basque front. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 20th)

### Disarmament Bureau Reopens

U.S. Advocates Maintaining the Status Quo; Preparing to Advance When the Time is Right

[Geneva] The U.S. government today indirectly rejected Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's proposal that U.S. President Roosevelt convene a new disarmament conference. At today's meeting of the Disarmament Steering Committee, U.S. representative Wilson spoke in favor of maintaining the existing disarmament conference to resume work at an appropriate time, saying that even if it is temporarily unable to do so, it must maintain this organization. Even though no concrete agreement has been reached, we should not allow its effectiveness to be undermined. In all fairness, the existing disarmament conference has done much in terms of budgeting. Once the time comes, it can advance and achieve results easily, without having to start from scratch and delay the process. In short, our past work and economy must not be wasted. (National Telegram from the 31st)

[Geneva] The Disarmament Conference Steering Group met this afternoon. French representative Paul-Boncour proposed inviting countries around the world to hold a meeting to discuss the following issues: ① Publication of military expenditure figures; ② Establishment of a Standing Committee on Disarmament Issues; ③ Judicial regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of armaments. Regarding air force, he also declared that it should be restricted and that civil aviation should be placed under the management of an international organization. Representatives of Sweden and the Soviet Union expressed support for this proposal. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

### U.S. Steel Strike Worsens; Management Supplies Food by Plane

Workers Also Use Planes for Picket Duty; Dozens Injured and Killed in Police-Worker Clashes

[New York] Most of the steel mills in Youngstown, Ohio, have been shut down. Only four plants of the Republic Steel Corporation are still partially producing. These four plants are now surrounded by strikers, leaving the workers inside facing the risk of starvation. The company today used planes to drop food into the plants from the sky. To cope with this, the strikers' picket line also used planes to scout in the sky. The strikers insist that the workers inside must leave the plant or be starved to death. At the same time, suspecting that mail trucks entering the plant are carrying food, they intend to block them. The company, upon hearing this, has asked the post office to protect the mail trucks. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 29th)

⊙Chicago: Serious clashes occurred today between police and striking steelworkers in the South Side of Chicago, resulting in a total of 91 injuries on both sides. 67 strikers were injured, including four who died from their injuries. 23 police officers were injured. Before the clashes, many workers were still working at the Republic Steel Corporation's South Side plant, surrounded by strikers and unable to leave freely. However, during their free time, they played ball inside the plant and attended services in the small chapel. Now that the post office has refused to accept food packages sent to the plant, the strikers' momentum has increased. The post office claims that shipping food in the form of mail is an irregular practice. Since the start of this labor unrest, U.S. steel production has decreased by 17% per week. The losses to both the factory and the workers are estimated at approximately $3 million per week. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 30th)

⊙Chicago:

Forty people were arrested after the incident. Several clashes also occurred in Youngstown and Warren, Ohio, due to the steel strike.

### Japanese in Shantou Act Violently, Assaulting Police Officers

Japanese Warships Sail to Shantou to Intimidate; Make Unreasonable Protests

Shantou Correspondence: In recent years, a large number of *ronin* from a certain country have moved to the Chaozhou, Shantou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen areas, residing along the coast. There are approximately tens of thousands of them, engaging in all kinds of illegal activities. The Chaozhou and Shantou authorities have implemented a Baojia system and conducted household registration checks. All foreigners entering the country must submit their passports for inspection, and when moving in or out, they must fill out forms at the police station's household registration section and obtain moving certificates to maintain local security. However, Japanese nationals regard Chinese laws and regulations as invalid. They not only do not register their households on a regular basis but also move freely. On the morning of May 22, four Japanese nationals, including Aoyama Kiyoshi, privately moved into the third floor of the Shenzhou Foreign Firm on Yongping Road and secretly established a club. *Ronin* frequented the place day and night. When patrol officer Huang Sheng discovered this, he advised Aoyama and the others to follow proper procedures, register their households with the Second District Police Station, and obtain moving certificates. Aoyama ignored him, so the patrol officer reported to the police station. Household registration officer Shang Wenzhi, along with police officer Lai Yunzhong, went to advise them in person. Unexpectedly, Aoyama, speaking fluent Chaozhou dialect, became furious, verbally abused the police officers, and beat Shang and Lai severely, causing them to fall to the ground. Upon hearing the news, the police station immediately sent a vehicle to take them to the British Gospel Hospital for treatment. Shang Wenzhi's left wrist was broken. The police station then dispatched armed police officers to arrest Aoyama. Yamazaki Seiichiro, the Japanese consul stationed in Shantou, then sent Ide Kiyomi, the chief of the Japanese Police Station, and police chief Wang Shuiliu, along with more than ten armed special agents, in two cars from Qilu to the Second Police Station at 1:00 p.m., intending to forcibly retrieve Aoyama Kiyoshi. The Second Police Station, fearing that Aoyama would be snatched away and that a "disappearance like the Kuramoto incident" would occur, urgently sought instructions from Police Chief Xue Hanguang, who ordered that he be transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation. When Ide's car reached the intersection of Shengping Road, it was stopped by the police. Only Ide Kiyomi and three others were allowed to go to the Second Police Station, while the other armed *ronin* waited quietly in the car to avoid accidents. After seeing the chief of the Second Police Station, Ide demanded loudly and aggressively that the assailant Aoyama Kiyoshi, who had assaulted the police, be handed over so that he could take him back to handle the matter himself. The chief of the police station replied that he had been ordered to escort the case to the General Bureau, and he asked him to see Chief Xue. Ide left in disappointment and had to lead the special agents back to the Japanese consulate. At that time, the streets were noisy. 300 members of the Public Security Bureau's Security Team were deployed to patrol along the Outer Road and dispatch detectives to protect Aoyama Kiyoshi from being snatched away by *ronin* en route. After Aoyama was escorted to the General Bureau, the Judicial Section opened court to question him. Aoyama said that he had moved in on the orders of the consul and absolutely did not recognize the household registration regulations promulgated by the Chinese authorities. He was extremely stubborn and unreasonable, and he admitted that it was inappropriate to assault the police officers. After the Public Security Bureau recorded his statement, Ide again went to the General Bureau to ask Chief Xue to release Aoyama. Xue ordered him to negotiate with the municipal government and sign a guarantee in accordance with proper procedures to prevent further complications after he was taken out. Ide then negotiated with the municipal government. Councilor Huang Jing received him and told him that Aoyama Kiyoshi had despised the sovereignty of our government and insulted our police officers who maintain public order. After his release, he must retain the protest and punishment. At 6:00 p.m., Aoyama Kiyoshi was sent to the municipal government, and the Japanese consulate prepared an official document to extradite him for self-handling. Since the incident, the citizens of Chaozhou and Shantou have been extremely indignant. However, the municipal government, in accordance with the principle of promoting good relations, would rather make a big issue into a small one. In addition to reporting to the provincial government, it temporarily prohibited the publication of reports to avoid excessively stimulating the public and hindering relations between the two countries. It also deeply hoped that the Japanese consulate would punish the perpetrator itself so that the incident could be resolved. Unexpectedly, the Japanese consulate claimed that the Shantou police had insulted a member of the consulate and telegraphed the Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou, the Governor-General of Taiwan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo, asking them to protest to the authorities in Nanjing and Guangzhou. A Japanese destroyer was often stationed off the coast of Shantou. On the morning of the 24th, the patrol ship Yubari and the destroyers Asagao and Fuyou suddenly sailed into Shantou from Taiwan, adding to the existing Karukaya, for a total of four ships. Rumors spread in the market as a result. On the afternoon of the 26th, Major General Kumashiro Masayoshi, commander of the 5th Torpedo Squadron, also arrived in Shantou by ship to preside over the negotiations on the case. On that day, Consul Yamazaki Seiichiro again went to the municipal government to make an oral protest, saying that Aoyama had also been injured in his right hand, and the skin on his palm and fist was very red. He demanded that the police officers be severely punished, that medical expenses be compensated, and made various unreasonable demands.

In the town of Liuzhai, the walls are covered with large slogans, such as "Demand the abolition of all humiliating agreements between China and Japan," "Anyone who obstructs the construction of Guangxi is a traitor," "Scorched earth resistance is the only way out for Guangxi," and "Support Commanders Li and Bai in vigorously implementing the Three Selfs Policy," all newly written within the past three days. Also, the walls are full of blue signs with white characters, "The text is the same as above," and the paint is still wet. In public places, there are thirty-inch photos of the three people, Li, Bai, and Huang, of the county, with two crossed party and national flags above them. Opposite them is the open office of the Anti-Smoking Bureau. It is said that smoking will be completely banned in the province in the second half of this year, and anyone who smokes will be shot immediately. As for those passing through the province from Yunnan, their packages will not be opened during inspection, and they will be allowed to pass through the border in the original vehicles. It is unclear whether taxes will be collected. It is also heard that Guangxi province is extremely strict in punishing corruption. Recently, two county magistrates who also served as commanders of local militias were shot for accepting bribes of up to 500 Guangxi currency. Guangxi banknotes from Shanghai and Beijing are not yet in circulation. Guangdong silver coins and Guangxi bank notes are in full circulation throughout the province. The market price on the black market is one yuan of national currency can be exchanged for 1.2 jiao of Guangxi currency. The salaries of civil servants throughout the province are not much different from the numbers set by the central government, but because the national currency and Guangxi currency are different, they actually receive less than half.

Day 40 (May 14), set off from Liuzhai in the morning, passing through the Nanmen County station (also a new Western-style building). Along the way, passed the Chehe station and arrived at the Hechi County station, which is also a three-story building. The road is smooth, the mountains are not high, and the potholes are not deep. In the future, it can be used to lay rails for a railway. The careful construction of highway stations now is probably designed for future railway stations, or it is not certain whether they are used as command posts when calling for mobilization. Twenty kilometers past Hechi County, a vehicle on the Dongjiang River is ferried across by boat. The boatmen are skilled and the process is quick. Another thirty kilometers to Huaiyuan Town, there is also a river named "Huaiyuan River," which is actually the upstream of the Longjiang River, and cars are also carried across by boat in the same way. There are three types of trees at the ferry that are rarely seen inland: ① banyan trees, ② betel nut trees (whose fruit and musk powder can be eaten), and ③ breadfruit trees, with extremely large red fruits, all of which are tropical plants. After crossing the river, the mountain scenery is strange and peculiar, all rising abruptly from the flat ground. There is still a lot of arable land along the way. There are rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, as well as sugarcane and tobacco. Those near the foot of the mountains mostly plant corn. Guangxi farmers are indeed more advanced in utilizing the soil than those in Guizhou. In the afternoon, arrived in Qingyuan (i.e., Yishan County). Bai Minming presented each person with three books: "Recent Remarks Collection," "Three Selfs Policy," and "Guangxi Construction Outline." The newly posted slogans in Qingyuan city are the same as those in Liuzhai, nothing more than demanding immediate resistance to Japan. A welcome meeting and theatrical performance were held in the middle school auditorium that evening. We went to the streets first and saw that the bamboo house built by the Christian missionaries was much more elaborate than the county government. Also, the shops consigned "Air Defense Lottery Tickets" of two types, one with ten characters and one with fifteen characters, with drawings every half month and every ten days. Each ticket has one strip, with the "Thousand Character Classic" above and fifteen characters in the middle, the same as the Guangdong mountain tickets from the past. Although the ticket head says "Air Defense Lottery Ticket," the people still call it "Pigeon Ticket." In the evening, at the Qingyuan Middle School auditorium welcome meeting, the general representative of Guangxi encouraged the members of the group to immediately resist Japan and hoped to immediately ask the central government not to hesitate any longer. Head of the delegation Chu replied, "Since we stepped into Guangxi, we have seen all kinds of new atmospheres and are very happy. As for the issue of resisting Japan, it must be a national consensus, with factual preparations, and cannot simply be shouted out. The central government is not without preparation for this, but it cannot be publicized in advance, because national defense arrangements must not be casually told to others. Therefore, we in the central government have never dared to do lip service. Guangxi is located in the remote southern part of China, and today it can fully express what everyone wants to say. The members of this group are especially excited to hear this. In the past, the central government has repeatedly resisted Japan in actual combat. During the September 18th and January 28th incidents, because the provinces failed to send troops to support them, there was the result of Shanghai. During the Battle of the Great Wall, because the Communist Party launched a large-scale disturbance, a large part of the military force had to be divided into bandit suppression work. Now the bandits have been completely pacified. Last winter, during the battles of Chahar East and Suiyuan East, the defenders also resisted with real strength, so there was the victory of Bailingmiao. In the future, if the whole country is thoroughly unified, united as one, without suspicion, it can gather national strength and go to the same goal. Then the inspection group this year is on the route to East Yunnan, and next year it may not be the inspection of Beijing-Heilongjiang. At that time, we will welcome you to join the ranks." The whole audience applauded. Then there were Guangxi opera, Beijing opera, boxing, stick performance, and other entertainment before dispersing. Day 41 (May 15), in the morning, passed through Yishan (Qingyuan), Jingtanzhen, Limiaozhen, and arrived at Datang. Datang belongs to Xincheng County and is the intersection of the Nanning and Guilin highways. There are very few people in Datang Town, but there are many new commercial buildings under construction. The terrain is relatively high, 400 meters above sea level. At 1:00 PM, arrived in Liuzhou, which is now Liujiang County (the name Maping no longer exists). The highway between Datang and Liuzhou was damaged by rain in one section. A temporary road was opened underneath to pass through. The day before yesterday, Mr. Zhang Shigang's vegetable oil car, passing through this place, got stuck in the mud and rocks. After being pulled out with force, the pressure gear was broken, so it could not start the next day. It was transported to Liuzhou, waiting for a telegram from Shanghai to send this part by plane before it could be assembled and start. Mr. Zhang left the car and took a provincial small car to Guilin first because Mr. Zhang's wife is from Guilin. This time, she took a plane from Wuzhou to Guilin to return to Ning. Brother Shiwei went to the province in a hurry because of this. When we arrived in Liuzhou, more than 6,000 people including militia teams, soldiers, and students welcomed us. Every time a team passed, they shouted "Welcome to overthrow ×× imperialism slogans." The mood was exceptionally warm. Everyone stayed at the Henan Lequn No. 1, which is a large hotel run by the government and merchants. At 3 o'clock, visited the agricultural experiment field, and technician Mr. Song explained the experiment process. The field was established only two years ago, with an annual business expense of 13,700 yuan (Guangxi currency is more than 40% of legal currency). The nursery has dozens of acres, and 30,000 seedlings have been cultivated to supply to various parties. Hundreds of Shatien pomelo trees, various pear, peach, and grape seedlings are also cultivated on several acres. The future plan is to produce 500,000 seedlings every year. Mr. Song spoke about remedies for poor soil and too many pests, advocated collecting tropical plants to try, which has been effective. Also, "insecticide powder" was tested to kill pests, and "pyrethrum" was used to remove pests, with slight success. The south corner of the field is a cow shed, raising 40 cows for the field's work. A stream is repaired in the field, with artificial layering to guide mountain water for irrigation of the entire field. Japanese varieties of fruit trees are tested in the nursery, with slight success. Other fruits from various places, such as those from Hebei and Shandong, have been tried, but the results have not been significant due to different climates. The right side of the field is a cotton experiment station. Last year, American cotton was planted throughout the province, but it was unsuccessful due to excessive rainfall. Only the results of the trial planting in Yulin County were barely satisfactory. Now it can only be determined that cotton can be planted in Yulin County, so Yulin cotton is distributed to nearby counties for trial planting again. The west side of the field is "Xiangsi Ridge", "Acacia trees" and "Eucalyptus trees", standing like a forest. At the exit, there is a small peak rising abruptly from the flat ground, commonly known as "Beauty Peak" or Golden Rooster Independence. There is a light railway of about one mile along the road, which can lead to Jila Town. There is an alcohol factory in Jila. The factory workers commute to and from Liuzhou on this light railway. If you go to Jila by waterway, it takes 40 li. The Liujiang County Highway Station is in Henan, with a road directly to the ferry. Lequn Society is built under "Liyu Peak", using the dripping water of "Tianma Mountain" as the society's free-flowing well, which is very ingenious. There is "Liyu Rock" on the side of Liyu Peak, with three interconnected caves under the rock, where Buddhist seats are offered and there is a temple with thriving incense. Overlooking the entire city of "Liuzhou" in Hebei, the Liujiang River surrounds it on two sides, truly a beautiful place. The top of the mountain used to be a fort, and now there is a blockhouse. Speaking of the alcohol factory again, the factory director, Mr. Wu, immediately reported the results, saying that the factory's capital is 400,000 (Guangxi currency), the machinery is 180,000 (Guangxi currency). Now, alcohol is made from sugar residue, waste is used, and no miscellaneous grains are used. Each dan of sugar residue can produce 25 to 30 jin of alcohol. 6,000 jin of residue are steamed every day, which can produce 1,800 jin of alcohol. The fermentation time is 36 hours, and the "yeast" is self-cultivated. 300,000 jin can be produced every year, a large amount is sold in the province, and a small amount is sold in Guangdong. An annual surplus of 60,000 yuan can be obtained (the cost is one jiao of Guangxi currency per month, and it can be sold for six jiao).

Day 42 (May 16), in the morning, crossed the Liujiang River to Liuzhou City. The river surface is 300 meters wide, but the water is shallow at this time, only more than 200 meters. The ferry boat is a private boat, mostly driven by women. The boat is covered with bamboo mats, smooth and clean. The boat's bed sheets, bowls, and pots are very particular. It is said that someone constantly hires this boat to go to Chang'an upstream and Wuzhou downstream, operating a water hotel. Today, it is only used as a temporary errand for the ferry boat. The three main streets of Liuzhou City have cement roads. The houses are mostly three or two stories high. Six or seven out of ten large shops are opened by Cantonese people. We crossed the river to the city in small groups. The local military and police sent people to greet us and took care of us in every possible way. Even going to the barber shop and shopping, they would accompany us in and out. Their hospitality was very appreciated. Mr. Chen and Mr. Wang and I took a bath in the society, which caused us to leave the reception line and act alone. We hired a boat and went ashore in the Dongmen area downstream for a walk. We saw that the "He Cheng Company's" courtyard was full of prostitutes. Also, opposite it, there were six brothels, such as Yun Ji and Yiqing. Nearby, there were two fan-tan gambling houses, posting notices of five hao for entering the game, similar to the situation in the Xijiang area of Guangdong. However, the streets there are clean, and the hygiene administration is still working hard.

At 3:00 PM, we went to the Liuhou Temple. The tomb is behind the temple. There is a stele with Han Tuizhi's poem and Su Pogong's calligraphy, which is known as the "Three Perfections of Liu Stele, Han Poem, and Su Characters." The stele has been broken into three sections. A young woman was rubbing it. Next to it is the Nine Sages Temple, dedicated to Liu Zhui and the Eight Sages of the Ming Dynasty. Then we went to "Yu She" to sip tea. Yu She is a music club organized by Feng Huan and others from the Guilin Aviation Association. There are many musical instruments, both Chinese and Western. Then we were invited to a public banquet in Liuhou Park. Division Commander Cheng Shufen and Yang Junchang both came to toast and gave patriotic and resistance speeches. Head of the delegation Chu has given a reply at every banquet along the way. Today's reply was particularly brilliant, emphasizing "unity before facing the outside world, then there is assurance." The "Magnolia" tree in the temple is taller than a three-story building. The "Branch Flower" is level with the roof. The dishes included "Night Fragrant Flower" soup, which was very refreshing. The soil in Liuzhou is the most fertile in the province. The prices are cheaper than Guilin and Nanning, because the river connects to the Xijiang River, and the import of Hong Kong goods is very convenient.

### Feng Yuxiang Arrives in Jinan to Visit Han

Stops for Four Hours Before Returning to Beijing by the Same Train

Jinan Correspondence: Feng Yuxiang, Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, previously represented the central government in attending the completion ceremony of the Martyrs' Shrine in Tai'an. He arrived in Tai'an by special train on the 23rd. After the ceremony was held on the 26th, he immediately dismissed everything and returned to Beijing to attend a speech at the Lizhi Society Zhongxin Society at 10:00 AM on the 30th. Before leaving Tai'an, he first went to Jinan for a short stay to catch up with his old comrades and subordinates. So, on the afternoon of the 29th, he came north by special train. The provincial government, upon receiving the news, vacated the East Building of Chairman Han's residence for Feng to stay. At 2:00 PM, the heads of various agencies, the heads of various departments of the headquarters, and the brigade commanders of divisions and brigades, as well as leaders from all walks of life, arrived at the station to welcome him. The police bureau also had a military band and security team on guard to welcome him. At 2:30 PM, Feng's special train entered the station, and the military band played loudly. After Feng got off the train, he rode in a car with Li Shuchun to the provincial government and rested in the West Flower Hall. Feng's wife, daughter, and others went to the East Building to meet Mrs. Han and were accompanied by Mrs. Han to visit famous attractions such as Pearl Spring in the mansion. Feng talked to various dignitaries. Feng said that the year in Shandong was good, which was very rare. Wen Chenglie said that local people intended to invite the teacher to choose a time to express their welcome. Feng said he didn't dare to accept it and only planned to stay in Jinan for an hour before going to Nanjing because he hadn't been here for a long time. He studied with the stationmaster at Tai'an station, and it was still possible to come to Jinan for an hour and then return to Nanjing. He was preparing on the train that if he could not meet with everyone one by one when he arrived in Jinan, he would leave a business card for each person. Liu Xizhong said that he had prepared a place for the teacher to stay. Feng said he could not stay for long because the Lizhi Society in Nanjing had a Xin Society, which had sent several telegrams, agreeing to give a speech at the society at 10:00 AM tomorrow, even if it was only half an hour, so he had to rush back. There are speeches the day after tomorrow and the day after. Feng said that Director Wang (Xiangrong) is now fat. Wen Chenglie said that they play ball every day. Feng said that without exercise, it would not work. Talking about this, Feng said I have nothing to do, everyone can do whatever they want, I will only talk to the Secretary-General and the Mayor. Then everyone resigned.

At about 5:00 PM, Han Fuju rushed back from Foyu and went to the West Flower Hall to meet Feng. Feng and Han talked for about 20 minutes and then had dinner together, which was very simple, only scrambled eggs, tofu, stir-fried green beans, and stir-fried leeks. The rice was corn flour bread. The provincial government's Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, consultants Wen Chenglie, Ge Jinzhang, Yao Yijia, Director of the Motor Vehicle Road Bureau Liu Xizhong, and Feng's teacher Lai Jun accompanied him. The conversation was very pleasant during the banquet. After the meal, a group photo was taken by the Pearl Spring. Then, they set off from the provincial government. Feng and Han rode in the same car. Dignitaries from all walks of life still went to the station to see them off. After arriving at the station, Feng and Han boarded the train again and talked for a while. Mrs. Han also accompanied Feng's wife and daughter to the station and boarded the train. At 6:30 PM, the special train headed south in the sound of military music. Feng stayed in Jinan for a total of four hours (29th).

### Steffanini Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Traveling Through Seven Provinces for a Month, Deeply Impressed by Rapid Progress

Steffanini, the former Italian Minister of Finance and a high-level advisor to the National Government, along with General Jiang Baili and Secretary General Magrini and Dr. Xue Guangqian, traveled north from Nanjing in early May, visiting various places. They passed through the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong, lasting for a month. They arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou, and took the Victoria steamer, arriving in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday. Municipal government officials welcomed them at the wharf. According to Jiang Baili, he and Steffanini traveled through seven provinces, reaching twenty cities large and small. The time spent in each place was short, but the spirit of the local authorities striving for good governance and seeking construction was admirable. He was especially grateful for the warm hospitality received everywhere. Steffanini was deeply impressed by his travels. He said that Italian writers fifteen years ago used to describe Italy only in terms of weather and pasta. Now, the object of writing has transformed entirely. The rapid progress of China in recent years will cause great distress to the world's writers, and they will have to change their outdated style of writing about China. Jiang also said that the entire journey was over 6,000 kilometers, with over 4,000 kilometers traveled by rail, nearly half of the country's railway trunk lines. Each train trip, except for the Yuehan Railway due to heavy rain and water damage to the roadbed causing slight delays, all other routes were very punctual, demonstrating the progress in railway management in recent years. According to Dr. Xue Guangqian, Advisor Steffanini and others are planning to rest in Shanghai for a few days due to the fatigue of the journey, and then proceed to Nanjing to continue their work or perhaps wait to meet with Chairman Chiang.

### Du Yuesheng Thanks for Birthday Congratulations and Endorses Seawall Repair

Farmlands Rely Entirely on the Seawall for Protection, Unable to Avoid Faults, I Dare Not Speak of Longevity

The executive directors of the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Shen Menglian, and Lü Yuequan, had previously jointly written to Mr. Du Yuesheng, the chairman of the association, requesting him to follow the public opinion and transfer the funds for birthday celebrations to repair the coastal stone seawall, as reported in the previous newspaper.

You are enthusiastic about public welfare, and are keen to repair the seawall as an urgent matter, fundamentally solving the problem. Your insightful vision is admirable. I, following you gentlemen, will also do my best to help. As for my ninety-year-old age, time has passed, and I have been unable to avoid faults, how dare I speak of longevity? Your kind intentions are deeply engraved in my heart. I think that you gentlemen love people with virtue, and you will surely understand my sincere intentions and give me your understanding.

### Citywide Rickshaw Theft Insurance

Terms Negotiated, Implemented Starting Today

Cases of rickshaw theft and extortion in Shanghai have gradually decreased since the establishment of the Rickshaw Industry Association and the non-redemption group of North and South Shanghai rickshaw merchants. However, this is limited to the North and South Shanghai areas. In the event of rickshaw theft, only five yuan and five jiao are compensated for each rubber tire, regardless of whether they are new or old. In addition, thefts outside the company's gate are not covered. The rickshaw merchants have said that the five cents per rickshaw are paid by the rickshaw pullers, but there is no corresponding relief, so there are inevitably complaints. The municipal authorities believe that this organization is related to the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers and the credit of the rickshaw industry. The Public Utilities Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Police Bureau have convened responsible members of the association and representatives of the Ning Shao and Taiping Insurance Companies multiple times. It has been decided that all operating rickshaws in the North and South Shanghai Special District and West Shanghai will be insured against theft. The insurance premium is still the same as the non-redemption group, five cents per rickshaw per month, and will be collected along with the association fee and handed over to the insurance company. This has been reported to the municipal government for record for many days. On the 29th of last month, Chang Chunshan, Gu Songmao, Qin Yizhou, Wang Bingyan, and Zhou Jin of the Rickshaw Industry Association, and Shao Ping, manager of the Taiping Insurance Company, and clerk Que Yongkang, etc., reported the changes in the method of compensation for theft, such as rubber tires being compensated for new ones according to the insurance policy and theft outside the company's gate being compensated. The association believed that the number of thefts has been increasing recently, and hoped that the company would underwrite the insurance immediately. The company also agreed to accept it, although the insurance premium will be collected until the 16th, it will be implemented in advance on June 1st (today). Director Xiao of the Fourth Section of the Public Utilities Bureau believes that he is satisfied and approved the plan to be implemented in advance. From then on, rickshaw pullers throughout the city will no longer suffer from the pain of rickshaw theft and extortion.

### China's First Domestically Built Icebreaker

Yantai Customs-Ordered Vessel Named Jiantai, Trial Run on the 4th, Reception and Tour on the 7th

The year before last, the waters of the Beiyang region froze, and many merchant ships were blocked outside the port of Yantai and Tianjin. At that time, because China did not have an icebreaker, there was no way to rescue them, and the losses to the shipping companies were quite large. In view of this, the Yantai Customs specially ordered an icebreaker for both towing and icebreaking from the Hehe Xing Machine Shipbuilding Factory in Shanghai. The ship has a gross tonnage of 350 tons, a length of 117 feet, a width of 27 feet, a depth of 16 feet, and a horsepower of 1,000. The speed is very strong, and it can travel 13 nautical miles per hour. The ship's hull is made of extremely strong steel plates, and the structure is very complete. In addition to icebreaking and towing, it is also equipped with fire-fighting equipment. All the machinery is the latest model. The cost is about 300,000 yuan. The ship is named Jiantai and has been completed yesterday. It is reported that the design and construction were planned by shipbuilding expert Mr. Cao Shouqing. It is now scheduled to officially conduct a trial run on the 4th of this month and invite people from all walks of life to visit the New Customs Wharf on the 7th. On the 8th, Mr. Cao will personally supervise the delivery of the ship to Yantai. This ship is the first icebreaker built by China. In the future, if the ports of Beiyang encounter frozen rivers, it will not be necessary to rely on foreign ships, but there will be icebreakers for rescue.

Also, according to reliable sources, the Qingdao Municipal Government Port Affairs Administration, in order to facilitate icebreaking and rescue in the winter sea, and to rescue ships in distress on weekdays, has also allocated a large sum of money to build an icebreaker for both icebreaking and towing. The equipment, structure, and size of the ship are all based on the Jiantai. The Qingdao Port Affairs Office has sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to negotiate construction with the China Shipyard in Shanghai. The contract has been signed and construction will begin immediately. It is expected to be completed in about four months.

(4) If the interest has a "li" digit, is it completely discarded, or is the "li" digit rounded up to the "fen" digit? (5) If the deposit is less than five yuan, is interest not calculated? (6) For example, if 75 yuan is deposited on January 23 and 75 yuan is deposited on May 30, how much interest should be earned when the interest is settled in the first half of the year? How is it calculated?

A: (1) After the interest on passbook savings is settled at the end of June and the end of December each year, it is rolled into the principal and accrues interest together. (2) (3) Interest on passbook savings is given according to the "half-month calculation method" and is not calculated according to the number of days. Each month is divided into two halves: the 1st to the 15th of the month is the first half of the month, and the 16th to the end of the month is the second half of the month. Each time a deposit is made, if the deposit date is the first two days of each half month, interest can be accrued immediately. If it is not the first two days, it must be extended to the second half of the month to accrue interest. For example, if funds are deposited on May 1 or 2 of the 26th year, interest will accrue from the first half of May. Those deposited between the 3rd and 15th will accrue interest from the second half of May. Those deposited on May 16 or 17 will accrue interest from the second half of May. Those deposited after the 17th and before the 31st will accrue interest from the first half of June. If the first two days are a week day or a postal holiday, it will be postponed accordingly. For withdrawals, interest is not calculated from the half month of the withdrawal. For example, for funds withdrawn in the first half of May, the interest is calculated up to the second half of April. (4) When interest has a "li" digit, it is calculated according to the "rounding" method. (5) If the deposit is less than five yuan but more than one yuan, the interest is calculated, and the zero amount below one yuan is not counted. (6) The standard for calculating interest has been detailed in items 2 and 3 above. If 75 yuan is deposited on January 23, interest should accrue from the first half of February. At the time of the half-year interest, it will be ten and a half months, and the interest will be 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen. The calculation formula is as follows:

The 75 yuan deposited on May 30 must accrue interest from the first half of June. At the time of the interest settlement at the end of June, it will be two and a half months, and the interest should be 2 jiao and 8 fen. The calculation formula is as follows:

### A Sad Story of a Weak Woman

A Woman Named Zhu Binzhen Wandered to Shanghai, a Friend's Family Set a Trap to Profit, a Merchant's Brutality Turns a Good Marriage into a Bad Marriage, Already Rescued by the Ningbo Association

Yesterday afternoon, a woman came to the Ningbo Shanghai Association to ask for help. The matter was extremely bizarre. A reporter from Datong News Agency recorded the situation as follows:

Entrusting a Woman to a Friend Yesterday afternoon, the woman who came to the Ningbo Association for help stated that her name was Zhu Baozhen, 23 years old. Her father's name was Song Shunshui, originally from Ningbo, but her mother was from Hangzhou, so she was born and raised in Hangzhou. She graduated from high school because her father resigned from his job as an automobile repair engineer at the Hangzhou Provincial Industry and Road Bureau last year to seek work in Shaanxi. Since she had no relatives in Hangzhou, she was entrusted to a Wang family, a friend of her father.

Wandering to Shanghai

Since her father went to Shaanxi, there has been no news. However, the Wang family entrusted her to a Yuan family living in Zhabei this spring. The Yuan family was not a good person and gradually pawned off all the clothes and ornaments she brought.

Alliance at a Hotel

Half a month ago, the Yuan family suddenly claimed to choose a match for her and colluded with a waiter from the Jilsheng Hotel on Simalu Road to take her to the hotel to meet with a young merchant. The merchant claimed to be surnamed Feng, doing business in Nanjing, and had no wife, so he was willing to marry her. He had also discussed the marriage procedures with the Yuan family. At that time, she believed it was true because she was suffering from no place to go.

First Intimacy

At that time, the Yuan family excused himself to go out, and the young merchant asked for an intimacy to strengthen the alliance. The woman could not restrain herself at this time, so the merchant opened a room in another hotel opposite Jilsheng Hotel and had sexual relations. Unexpectedly, although the woman was in the prime of her youth, she was still a virgin (as proved by the hospital). The merchant was extremely brutal, and after one night, the woman's reproductive parts were severely injured and she could not even walk. She could not help but feel extremely painful and weep.

Deep Wound

The merchant was also very panicked. At that time, the Yuan family came again, so the merchant paid 60 yuan to be used as medical expenses first and sent the woman to a hospital for treatment. After the woman entered the hospital, the doctor examined her and confirmed that it was her first time. However, her left uterus was scratched. Although she had been treated, it was still swollen and festering, so she has not been able to walk for half a month. At the same time, the Yuan family did not hand over the 60 yuan given by the merchant to the hospital. The hospital asked her for it because she had been in the hospital for a long time and owed a lot of medical expenses. So, the woman told them the address of the Yuan family in Zhabei and ordered them to collect the fees. Unexpectedly, the Yuan family had already moved to another place to avoid the situation.

Request for Relief

The woman, in this dire situation, came to the Ningbo Shanghai Association to tell the story as above and ask for help. The association also felt sorry for the woman's plight and tried to find the whereabouts of the relevant people. On one hand, the association sent the woman to the Siming Hospital for treatment first. The association's letter to the Siming Hospital is recorded below: To whom it may concern, the distressed woman Zhu Baozhen is suffering from illness in her lower body and has come to us for help. After investigation by our association, her biological father, Zhu Shunshui, is from Yin County, and her mother is from Hangzhou. Zhu Baozhen grew up in Hangzhou. Now, she has been fooled in Shanghai and has no one to turn to. In addition to our association trying to find her relatives, this letter is sent to your hospital to ask you to admit Zhu Baozhen to the hospital for treatment.

The Xujiahui Catholic Church in western Shanghai holds a Eucharist ceremony every year on the Sunday at the end of May. On the day of the holy procession, all the city's Catholics participated sincerely. Beforehand, flags and decorations were hung at the entrance of the church and on the parade ground. The atmosphere was solemn, and three large and small altars were set up. Holy images were enshrined on them, and white candles and fresh flowers were lit in front of the images, which were magnificent and solemn. The head of the town police station, Inspector Deng, led police chief Hou Dingyi and ten policemen. The captain of the 10th team of the Shanghai South District Security Corps, Zhou Chengxiang, and the deputy captain, Huang Simei, led all the members to maintain order. At 5:00 PM, teachers and students from more than ten schools, including Zhendan University, Huishi School, Xujiahui Girls' Middle School and Elementary School, the Chinese Catholic Action Youth Association, and the Sacred Heart Girls and Boys School, entered the church in an orderly manner to pay homage to the holy images. Then, led by the bishop, the head of the hospital, priests, fathers, and five to six thousand Catholics sang religious songs together in the sound of military music, recited the Bible, and silently prayed the praises. After that, the whole team marched around the parade ground and ascended each altar to pray for blessings. The ceremony ended at 7:00 PM. On that day, Catholics from all over, together with the nearby people, went to watch, numbering about 10,000 people.

According to him, Laifeng is his biological daughter, and he brought her to Shanghai from his hometown and resided at the house of the defendant Zhang Linsong. He had no knowledge of the sales contract found by the police at the house of the defendant Guo Huaizeng. The court instructed the girl Chen Laifeng to identify whether Chen Bazi (also known as Chen Zixi) was her father. The girl said yes.

A section of Fuyou Road, east of the small world in Shanghai, has a vegetable market with a history of more than ten years. Generally, vegetable vendors set up various vegetable stalls on both sides of the road, with a total of more than 100 stalls.

Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday morning, an inspector from the Yimao Police Bureau suddenly led the police, holding bamboo sticks, to drive away the vegetable stalls. The vegetable vendors refused to obey, causing a dispute. As a result, the vegetables were overturned in the middle of the road, and the order was disrupted for a while.

### The Story of a Dancer Losing Her Virginity in a Stormy Sea

Chen Yaokui Had Sinister Motives for Giving Medicine for Seasickness. Zhang Ronghua Resorts to the Law After Being Ignored

Zhang Ronghua, an 18-year-old dancer at the Great Shanghai Dance Hall, from Kunshan, residing at No. 11 Yuqingli, Xiamen Road, hired a lawyer and, with her mother Zhang Shi (52 years old) as her legal representative, filed a private prosecution with the Shanghai District Court against Chen Yaokui, residing at No. 10 Linxianfang, Qilu Road, Lao County Front, alleging that he used medication on the ship to anesthetize her, causing her to lose consciousness and be raped. The statement of facts in the private prosecution stated that on November 1, 1936 (the 18th day of the ninth lunar month), she was traveling from Shanghai to Tianjin, taking fourth-class cabin on the China Merchants Bureau's Xinfeng ship. That night, the ship was sailing in the ocean, and she was vomiting due to seasickness. The defendant happened to be on the same ship, and he worked on the ship. Seeing that the plaintiff was alone and vulnerable, he pretended to comfort her and seduce her with sweet words. He took two white pills and gave them to her, saying that they could stop seasickness. Unexpectedly, after taking them, she lost consciousness. In the morning, her lower body was in pain, and she looked down to see bloodstains on her pants. Thinking back to the previous night, she suddenly realized that she had been drugged and lost her virginity. She cried incessantly, and the defendant entered the room and comforted her in every possible way, promising to marry her and buy her clothes and jewelry. Thus, she was raped four times during the stormy journey. After arriving in Tianjin, she continued to be raped at the National Hotel and the Changchun Hotel. Unexpectedly, since the ship left Tianjin last December, the defendant has not gone to Tianjin, only sending letters to perfunctorily deceive her. The plaintiff suffered this loss of virginity and had no face to see her mother, so she had to return to Shanghai to look for the defendant, intending to fulfill the promise. However, the Xinfeng ship is a ship that sails without a fixed route (commonly known as a "wild chicken ship"), and it was recently heard that it sails to Jiujiang and Hankou, and sometimes travels to Hong Kong and Guangdong, so the plaintiff searched everywhere, but could not find him. It has now been found that the Xinfeng ship is being repaired at the Nanshi Shipyard. Last month, she sent a letter to inquire about the situation, but it was ignored. Forced to do so, she filed a private prosecution according to Articles 221, 225, and 227 of the Criminal Law. According to Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which stipulates jurisdiction based on the ship's registered port, she respectfully requests that the defendant be arrested and severely punished, and that damages of 3,600 yuan be paid (including 1,200 yuan in losses in Tianjin for two months, plus a monthly living expense of 40 yuan, which is a request for payment of 2,400 yuan for five years). Yesterday, Judge Chen Siyong held a court session. After the plaintiff stated her case, she also said that the defendant's father's name is Chen Wenxin, and Zhang Ronghua is a monkey, born on November 21st. The official then instructed Zhang Ronghua, saying that the defendant was not summoned today because you are not old enough to file a private prosecution yourself. You should report to the prosecutor's office, and it can only be handled through public prosecution. The plaintiff then requested that the court transfer the case. The judge approved the transfer of the case to the prosecutor for investigation.

### People Also Killed Each Other Because of Dog Fights

Chen Daozhang Narrowly Escapes Death, Zhang Shaotang and Others Are Accused

Xi Qinyou, Xi Youxin, and others from Hefei in Xitan, Robert Road, Shanghai West, had a dog that fought with Ren Zhongheng's dog. The dog owners helped their animals, which led to a fight between the people. Both sides were slightly injured. Those who went to the police station at that time included Ren Zhongheng, Ren Zhongyao, Jiang Qiaoshi, Lu Wenqing, etc., in addition to the Xi family. When they were sent to the District Court for examination, both sides were found to have minor injuries. Since it was for livestock, and they had made such a big fuss, both sides were reprimanded and dismissed for their lack of ambition. However, Chen Daozhang (39 years old), from Anhui, was called the leader on the Xi side. All the Xi family's actions followed Chen's lead. Ren's side also had a leader, Zhang Shaotang, who, like Chen, was expanding his power and had long been at odds with him. Therefore, he took this opportunity to ask Chen to persuade the Xi family to compensate for the losses and apologize. Chen, of course, did not want to lose face, and flatly refused, which deepened the ill will between the two sides. At midnight on the 18th of this month, Chen looked back to his home. While walking, he suddenly encountered a pockmarked woman shouting, "Mr. Chen, you're back?" Chen said yes. At that moment, there was a gunshot from behind. A bullet flew over. Chen put his hands together to protect his vitals, and although he was not hit in the vitals, two fingers on his hand were cut off. Shouts for help and police sirens sounded, and he was able to escape. Chen was sent to the hospital by police car and accused Zhang Shaotang, Ren Zhongyao, Xu Qiaoshu, Lu Wenqing, and Ren Zhongheng of planning an assassination. The Caojiadu Sub-bureau arrested Ren Zhongyao, Zhang Shaotang, and the pockmarked woman, while the others were not arrested. Chen Daozhang then hired lawyer Hu yesterday to file a complaint with the District Court requesting an injury examination and legal investigation.

The Zheng clan of Dongshan has been a family of officials for generations and is a prominent family in the town. Since the Qing dynasty abolished the imperial examination system, the children of the Zheng clan have abandoned Confucianism and pursued commerce. Shanghai is a major commercial port, and there are many Zheng clan members doing business here. It is heard that Zheng Zenan, Zheng Ronghui, Zheng Jihan, Zheng Pengnan, and others feel that the Zheng clan members in Shanghai rarely contact each other on weekdays, which not only goes against the ancient teachings of encouraging family harmony, but even makes clan members not recognize each other. Therefore, they plan to initiate the organization of the Dongshan Zheng Clan Shanghai Clan Association to unite the clan, uphold the spirit of mutual assistance, and jointly improve the welfare of the clan as their purpose. They are currently drafting the charter and will announce its establishment soon. It is heard that the contact address is temporarily located at the Continental Bank on Jing'an Temple Road.

Current Itinerary

According to team leader Gu Linli, the team was originally prepared to depart earlier, but the team members were not able to organize their luggage in time, and there were other matters that needed to be arranged, so the departure was delayed until today.

### Gun Killing of Local Guard Case: Criminal Wu Jinbao Arrested

The criminal secretly returned to Shanghai. The Detective Brigade discovered his arrest. Residents of Hongzhen rejoiced upon hearing the news and thanked the police station.

Xu Guansong, the local guard of the 16th Tu, 23rd Bao, Xujiazhai, Hongzhen in this city, was lured out by his enemies late at night on October 12th of last year and shot dead by the criminal Wu Jinbao (also known as Robber Jinbao). The criminal had been on the run and had not been apprehended. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau issued an order to arrest the murderer. The other day, Dan Bin, the captain of the Third Division of the Police Headquarters Detective Brigade, discovered that the criminal in this case, Wu Jinbao, had secretly returned to Shanghai and learned of his hiding place. He then directed detectives to quietly arrest Wu at his address. The detailed circumstances of this case are summarized below:

The Course of the Murder

It was found that Wu Jinbao specialized in manufacturing and selling red pill drugs in the Yinxiang Hongzhen area, and had many followers. In October of last year, the case of manufacturing drugs was exposed, and the Hongzhen Police Station searched his premises. At that time, Wu escaped upon hearing the news, his house was sealed, and the local guard Xu Guansong was assigned to guard it. However, the house was burglarized, and the police station sent officers to move the items in the house to a safe place. Wu found out about this and suspected that the local guard Xu Guansong had played a trick on him. Therefore, he sent his followers to lure Xu out for a talk at night and shot him dead. Although the police station issued an arrest warrant, Wu had been on the run for several months. Now he has secretly returned to Shanghai and was discovered by Dan Bin, captain of the Third Detective Division, and has been arrested. The police station has submitted the case to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.

Popular Rejoicing

The deceased's family, Luo Shi Xu, and dozens of villagers from Xujiazhai, including Song Fogen, Xu Donghai, Xi Songling, Xi Huanxiang, Chen Baoshi, Xing Deqi, Yin Jisheng, Xu Yinhai, etc., believed that Wu Jinbao was usually tyrannical and accustomed to being overbearing in Yinxiang Hongzhen and other places. He had many followers, extorted money, and defrauded farmers. Fortunately, the Police Chief personally ordered the arrest, and Captain Dan Bin of the Third Detective Division and his detectives were effective in their investigation, so they were able to capture and bring the criminal to justice. Yesterday, Luo Shi Xu filed a petition with the Garrison Headquarters, requesting that the criminal be severely punished according to the law. Xu Donghai, Xi Huanxiang, and others jointly submitted a petition to the Police Chief and the Captain of the Third Detective Division, thanking them for their great virtue in eliminating a scourge for the locality.

### Wu Guangzong's Concubine Contests Inheritance After Assassination

Third Concubine Accuses Second Concubine of Embezzling Jointly Owned Property Left Behind

Wu Zhonghuizhen (35 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong), the third concubine of Wu Guangzong, a Fujianese who was the Chief of Staff under Sun Chuanfang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Five Provinces Allied Forces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangxi during the former warlord era, recently acted as a legal representative and, together with her biological son Wu Baojun, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Wu Zhang Yuqing, Wu Guangzong's second concubine (No. 17 Yideli, west end of Radu Road, Shilafeide Road), of embezzling jointly owned property left behind by Wu Guangzong. According to the complaint, Wu Guangzong married one wife and two concubines during his lifetime. His wife, Lin Zhurui, gave birth to sons Wu Baoqiang and Baoyue, and a daughter Zihui. The second concubine gave birth to a daughter Xiuyu, and the third concubine gave birth to a son Baojun, who is currently underage. After Guangzong was assassinated in August of the 21st year of the Republic of China, all of his estate was analyzed on October 20th of the same year by lawyer Shen Yuesheng, who has now fled to the puppet state. The complainant should receive 18.5% of the total estate (of which Baojun receives 11.5%), and Huizhen receives 7%. There was once a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court (in 1934). On April 4th of the 24th year of the Republic of China, a settlement was reached in the Republic of China mediation, and according to the defendant's statement when the record was made, most of the estate was embezzled by lawyer Shen Yuesheng (the custodian). After pursuing Shen, it will be distributed again. However, the complainant recently learned that after the settlement record was made, the defendant received 76 passbooks and other items from Shanghai HSBC Datong Bank from Shen Yuesheng on May 1 of the same year. When the amount of deposits was investigated at each bank, it was impossible to know because it was related to business confidentiality. After repeated inquiries to the defendant, they were ignored. Judging from their intentions, it is clear that they intend to embezzle Guangzong's estate. Although it is not a million, the accumulated assets are also hundreds of thousands of yuan, as evidenced by his handwritten letter. This estate is jointly managed by the defendant, who knows it very well. The reason why the amount of the estate was not included in the division contract was originally made by the defendant in collusion with Shen Yuesheng, so that the complainants did not know the total amount of the estate and were manipulated by them. The complainant is a weak woman and is at their mercy. Thinking about it now, there is still pain left. In February of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Guangzong wrote to the complainant, saying that the Shanghai Bank had a storm last year, so he transferred the complainant's deposit of 10,000 to Datong Bank. Now the money is gone, and the original seal of Wu Baojun was also taken by the defendant from Shen Yuesheng. This deposit is of course also embezzled by the defendant. It is requested to summon the case for interrogation, etc. According to the complaint, the court opened a court yesterday by judge Qiu Huan Ying to summon the defendant, who did not arrive. After the complainant's lawyer stated the intention of the prosecution, the court announced that the defendant had not arrived and ordered a new date for interrogation. It is also known that on the day after Wu Guangzong was assassinated, his biological daughter Wu Zudong opened the No. 4790 safe deposit box at Shanghai Bank and took away all the items stored there. Therefore, the complainant also requested to add Wu Zihui and Ma Boliang to the defendant's position.

Possession of a Handgun Not a Robbery Case

Sentenced to Three Months' Imprisonment for Private Possession of Firearms

Tamura Toji, a Westerner residing at No. 37, Lane 175, Wuchang Road, who is not under consular jurisdiction, was suspected of being involved in the case of a Japanese man, Ko Mu-tei, being shot in the left arm at the Fumin Hospital on Sichuan Road on May 23rd. The Hongkou Police sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest him at his residence. They seized a .22 caliber pump-action handgun and a total of 25 bullets and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie-fen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tian-yin stated that the defendant insisted that the firearm was purchased from a Russian named Mokerla near the Cathay Theater on Meyer Shi Ai Road in the French Concession for twelve yuan. The Russian is untraceable. According to the defendant, after his Japanese father passed away, he came to Shanghai from Harbin with his Russian mother and worked as a shop assistant and tout at a Western dessert shop and Japanese brothel, selling ice cream, etc. It has been found that this handgun is not involved in any other robbery or murder cases in Shanghai.

The health work of the rural branch offices is planned as follows:

Commentary

### Female Worker Dies from Abortion

— Zhong Wei-ling

In these times, life is indeed not easy. It is common for people to work all day and still not be able to feed themselves. Being able to find a job is considered lucky amidst misfortune. Those who wander aimlessly at crossroads are too numerous to count! The hardship of life is indeed an undeniable fact!

The May 28th edition of this newspaper contained the following news: "Wang Fan, a 40-year-old woman from Changshu, residing at No. 13 Yishun Lane, Tokyo Road, works at the No. 9 Cotton Mill of a Japanese company. Her husband, Wang Chun-shan, works as a rickshaw puller. They have one son and one daughter. The couple's labor income is enough to make ends meet. Recently, she became pregnant again, already four months along. However, she believed that childbirth would hinder her work and reduce her income, so she had the idea of ​​having an abortion. On the 18th of this month, she commissioned a woman surnamed Zhou to perform an abortion for her. The woman Zhou inserted a medicinal herb into her vagina. On the 21st, the fetus was aborted, but her abdomen was in constant pain. She has been bedridden since then and unable to get up. The next day, her husband saw that the situation was critical and took her to Guangci Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and she died in the morning before."

After reading the above news, we can't help but feel sorry for the deceased and sympathize with her unfortunate fate! Her death was due to an abortion; the reason for the abortion was that "she believed that childbirth would hinder her work and reduce her income." This situation, among the general working class, I believe is very common. In their current situation, the couple's labor income is only "enough to make ends meet." If she stopped working due to childbirth, her income would naturally decrease, and she would also have to spend a certain amount of childbirth expenses. In this way, she had no choice but to come up with such a desperate plan to save herself from the difficulties of life in the future. However, the result was that she lost her own life and created such a tragedy!

At the same time, this news shows the tragic situation of the working class: First, their knowledge is shallow. They do not know that abortion is an extremely dangerous thing and cannot be approached with caution, so they only use a medicinal herb as an abortion method. Secondly, after the fetus was aborted, her abdomen was in constant pain, and she was bedridden since then and unable to get up. The next day, her husband saw that the situation was critical and took her to Guangci Hospital; this is undoubtedly because of money, because sending her to the hospital would cost at least a few cents. This amount, in the eyes of poor people, is quite large and difficult to bear!

We are all human beings with round heads and square feet, but some spend money like water, and the consumption of the rich in one day can give the poor a lifetime of use. What is more unfair than this in the world? Is the tragic fate of laborers destined?

### A Nighttime Story

— Wenlong

Three years ago, one summer, I drifted from my hometown to Xiamen.

It didn't take me long to find those friends who had previously run into obstacles. They told me that they had recently formed a youth club called "Salon," and I could move in there. "It has a great artistic conception, in that beautiful place." Finally, they added this. Anxious to enjoy this beautiful life, I moved out of the inn.

## Page 24

It can be described as artistic: in front is a small road leading directly to Heshan, surrounded by a grassy field, not far from the urban area, slightly desolate. Except for the passing wheels, few people pass by here.

The "Salon" is located in an old, large flat house that houses about two or thirty households. Facing the road, it is separated by a high fence. There is a small garden about two zhang wide. A table, a bed made of two wooden boards, a few benches, a bookshelf, and a few Chinese and Western musical instruments constitute all the club's property. The landlord has returned to his hometown to collect rent, managed by an old servant who had been there for thirteen years. He is the second landlord of this "Salon" and also its errand boy, often helping us fetch water or buy small things.

During the day, we dispersed from this "Salon" to find our own ways to make a living in Xiamen City. At dusk, we would carry one or two new magazines or the day's newspapers under our arms, dragging our broken leather shoes, humming marching songs, and return.

Once people gathered, this "Salon" would come alive from its slumber. Some would raise their voices and sing "Si Lang Visits His Mother," while others would shake their long hair and elegantly recite the works they considered most satisfactory from the new magazines in a loud voice. The following programs, in addition to telling lewd little stories, singing ditties, also included collective frolicking, and ended with exhausted silence.

The story we want to tell, the nighttime story, happened one night, nearly midnight. At that time, there was a good moon, and there was a slight breeze. The excessive excitement during the frolicking made everyone fall asleep tiredly. I, and two others, as usual, sat under the lamp to read for an hour or two. The surroundings were very quiet. Suddenly, there was a slight rustling sound. From the open door, I saw a shadow flashing quickly under the light and then disappearing.

"Is the fence gate closed?" I was secretly startled, but still pretending to be calm, I asked my companion.

"I don't know, probably not?" My companion answered vaguely, without looking away from his book.

These days, thieves are rampant. It would be terrible if they broke in. Thinking about it, I stood up and was about to close the fence gate. As soon as I stepped out of the door, I couldn't help but be startled again. Looking, it was still that shadow. It stood cowering by the door, its eyes gleaming brightly, staring at me.

"Who's there?" I shouted, boldly pretending to be majestic. In fact, I was trembling so much!

"I..." the shadow answered tremblingly.

By the dim moonlight, I looked at it. It was still a girl, about sixteen or seventeen years old, dressed in short printed clothes, with a long braid trailing behind her head, as if she had run from somewhere in a hurry. Her breathing was short, and her feet were bare.

"Who are you? Why are you here?" Slightly, I softened my tone.

"I?" She looked out the fence in surprise, frowned, and then continued in a trembling voice, sad and low: "Please, do good and save my life. There are people outside looking for me. My dad owes the Taiwanese people opium debts and can't pay them back, so they forced their way into my home to take me as collateral. My mom argued with them, so I took the opportunity to sneak out. Now they're chasing me..." As she spoke, she was still so flustered, her eyes staring blankly at my face. At that time, besides being shocked, what could I say? The power of the Taiwanese people here is feared by everyone! If we hide her, and they find her outside, what if they break in? We can't take that responsibility. So I asked the old servant to take on this responsibility, but as soon as he heard it, he resolutely opposed:

"This is a disaster, young man, we can't get involved..."

This request was rejected by him. As she stepped out the door with trembling, desperate steps, I dared not think about her future fate, and tears quietly dripped down.

### Ancient Building

— Pingzi

Dense, verdant bamboo groves surround an ancient building that is over three hundred years old.

I live alone, quietly, in a corner of the ancient building, with two rectangular glass-tiled windows facing south. Every morning, the sounds of birds wake me from my sweet, deep sleep. This corner of the ancient building gives me endless, distant interest.

When I lie silently and peacefully on my pillow, watching the distant morning sky outside the window, and the cotton-like clouds drifting leisurely by, my thoughts follow the changing, light, floating clouds and become still. All the troubles of the world disappear without a trace. The sky is vast, there is no fighting, no ugliness, and my whole body is dissolved in the light, plain, and peaceful beautification.

After a while, the clouds are dyed with red rosy colors, and the bright brilliance shines over, making my cheeks seem to be dyed red as well. At this time, my heart flutters as if I have drunk wine. Thinking of the beautiful sweet dreams of the night before, I gently bite my lower lip and smile slightly.

The breeze blows in bursts, and the bamboo leaves rustle in time. The songs of the white-headed bulbul, the oriole, the white-eye... innocent and crisp, spread out one after another. At this time, everything feels complete, harmonious, and wonderful.

After the clouds in the sky have scattered, this two-part beautified morning also quietly disappears in the complete, harmonious, and wonderful charm.

In the evening, this ancient building gives me a different kind of charm. At that time, it is mostly when the night is deep and people are quiet: the clamoring sound from across the alley disturbs my sleep. Behind the light gauze curtain, I look out at a corner of the sky, with stars twinkling, flashing charming emerald eyes and whispering, which will make people immersed in deep meditation: that deep, serene sky is the sea; the stars are the fishing lights. When a shooting star casts its remnant light and falls to the boundless end, a lonely, mysterious, ethereal feeling will secretly come and grab my heart, and therefore, I will turn my mind to the emptiness of life and the vagueness of happiness. My charm is faintly woven with the light, silky sadness of velvet.

The bright moon hangs high. When I wake from my dream, a burst of light, the sky is quiet, sparse stars are scattered among them, and there are often light clouds, drifting by. At this time, my heart seems to be transformed into a cloud, floating into the sky, losing control, losing dependence, it is boundless etherealness, boundless illusion.

Therefore, I can't help but jump out of bed, lean against the window sill, and silently gaze at the bamboo forest and the shadow of the building in front of me.

### Uncle Fu

— Yu Lu

That year, Uncle Fu went to Guangning to handle timber. After settling all the business transactions and instructing his twenty-year-old partner to start the timber rafts on their journey, he, as usual, made a trip to Zhaoqing.

In Zhaoqing, in a small room as dark as a rat hole which was the office of a business firm, I first met this uncle who truly lived up to his name, possessing a fat and bloated body like a "Gu Chui Banana" or a "Dongguan Sausage." My father had written seven or eight letters to urge me to find him while he was staying in Zhaoqing.

The moment I saw him, I couldn't help but want to laugh. He had a square, national-character face, large ears, eyelids that covered dull eyes, and a forehead covered in rows of wrinkles, perfectly matching the layers of sagging flesh beneath his chin. Also, his two cheekbones must have been high originally, but now they were submerged by cheek flesh like two weights, with only two small peaks faintly visible.

"Um, ... You are Kunqi's son (note), are you? ..." Later, I noticed that every time he spoke, he said half a sentence and then paused. It was said that this was a sign of his destined wealth, but at the time, this impatient young man of mine felt it was a bit of an insult. Therefore, perhaps it can be said that my first impression of Uncle Fu was not very good.

"Yes, yes!" After I swallowed a bellyful of anger and respectfully answered him, I still received a rude treatment. He used a heavy nasal tone to crudely dismiss my politeness.

"Um, ... You sit! ... Wait a moment, wait..."

He was lying on a large wooden kang bed, specially prepared for people like him, in the business office. It was divided into two sides by a gap. The owner of the business, Uncle Liu, slept on the left side with him. That gap was filled with the following important objects: At the end, there was a short tea table about a foot high, with a Chaozhou teapot and two small cups on it. Slightly further on was a square rosewood tray; the tray held a covered lamp with a flame the size of a pea. Its position was very suitable. Below the lamp were two small earthenware bowls, a few oddly shaped iron needles, and a damp cloth dirtier than a wiping rag. Also, there were two opium pipes, polished to a very smooth, bronze-like sheen. He was sleeping on the right side, his head resting on a slanting green tile pillow, his body curled up in a shrimp-like position, his left hand absentmindedly holding a needle and burning it above the lamp, his eyes intently focused on the bubble at the tip of the needle that had swelled up from the heat. Judging by his appearance, he had probably forgotten that outside the opium bubble, the world had anything else at all.

And I, this young fool, was impatiently waiting here for him, or for him to say that second sentence to me.

In this way, the hands of the small table clock on the desk slipped away without any politeness. Although I had just heard them say that he had something to do at three o'clock in the afternoon, it was now already two forty-five.

"Um... I have... read your father Kunqi's letter." Suddenly, while I was still fantasizing, he opened the floodgates of speech, so I hurriedly focused my attention on his words.

"Things are probably doable, ... um... I know how much timber a ship needs. ... You tell your old man (note),..."

He paused for a moment, reached for a cup of tea as dark as ink on the tea table, and took a sip. Then, he sat up and forcefully spat out a mouthful of thick phlegm, cleared his opium throat, and continued.

"I won't let him suffer a loss, ... Li Dafu isn't that kind of person. This year, Chinese fir has gone up in price. Others are adding four, ... for you, ... um, consider it as if I need it myself, I'll raise the price by two points. ... Eight nines are seventy-two, eight sixes are forty-eight, calculated so neither of us loses. You tell your old man...."

"But..." I was just about to interject, but he repeatedly waved his hand, as if telling me not to speak, and then let out a few chuckles:

"I know, I know. ... Child, if you go to the provincial capital, come sit in my shop! ... Now, you should go back."

As he stretched, I walked out of that small, smoke-filled room. Once outside, I thought to myself: Uncle Fu is indeed such a capable person.

(Note) "Kunqi's son" means "Kunqi's son." "Old man" means father.
