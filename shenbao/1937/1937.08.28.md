### The Enemy Again Attempts to Land at Wusong, Suffers Defeat Under Joint Attack by Our Army and Air Force

The Focus of Battle Shifts to Various Ports Along the Yangtze and Coastlines. Remnants of the Enemy at Luodian Retreat to Areas Around Shengqiao While Being Pursued. Except for Zhanghuabang, No Traces of the Enemy Remain in Other Areas.

The current focus of battle has shifted from Shanghai to various ports along the Yangtze River and the coastline. Enemy reinforcements are massing at Songkou, with approximately 15,000 to 16,000 soldiers constantly attempting to land. At approximately 2:00 AM yesterday morning, enemy troops again attempted to land in the Wusong area. Our troops immediately fought back bravely, and the air force also dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle, bombing enemy ships. Under the joint attack of our air and land forces, the enemy could not withstand the assault and retreated, completely failing in their landing attempt. The enemy on the Luodian front, after forty hours of bloody fighting, could not withstand the pressure from our troops and have retreated to the Shengqiao, Mupiaoqiao, and Chenjiahang areas northwest of Luodian, numbering approximately 2,000. Fierce fighting continued until last night. Remnants of the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area are entrenched east of the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway along the river, putting up stubborn resistance and are still being cleared. In other areas, there are no traces of the enemy. In Chuansha, after our troops repelled the enemy's attempted landing, the enemy did not dare to invade again, and has only used naval artillery to bombard us in recent days. As for the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, they are particularly calm, with no fierce fighting.

The official war report issued yesterday (the 27th) at 8:00 PM stated: ⑴ The enemy troops in Luodian Town were completely cleared out by approximately 1:00 PM on the 26th. The enemy retreated to the Shengqiao Town area six li east of Luodian, and our troops are currently encircling and fiercely attacking them, ready to annihilate them. ⑵ On the morning of the 27th, 500 to 600 enemy soldiers landed at Wusong but were repelled by our troops. ⑶ Because Luodian is extremely difficult to attack, the enemy decided to change their strategy and has lined up thirty-eight enemy warships anchored outside Wusongkou, starting from the Shidongkou and Shizilin ports, spaced approximately one li apart, arranging their artillery positions and transporting a large number of sailboats, planning to secretly cross the river and land at Liuhe and Yanglinkou. ⑷ Seven to eight hundred enemy soldiers in the Shizilin area have been repelled by our troops in part, with the remainder being pursued. ⑸ Seven to eight hundred enemy soldiers in Yuepu have been surrounded by our troops. ⑹ More than fifty enemy soldiers in civilian clothes were discovered in Wufunong, Pudong, and are being surrounded and suppressed by our troops.

The enemy troops are currently massing at Wusongkou, with as many as 15,000 soldiers constantly attempting to land. At approximately 2:00 AM yesterday morning, enemy soldiers landing at Wusongkou and remnants from Yunzaobang launched three fierce attacks on us. Our troops immediately concentrated their firepower and bravely swept the enemy, finally repelling them. Currently, there are still several hundred remnants of the enemy entrenched in the Wusong Town area along the river. Our troops are taking an encircling formation west of the town, waiting for an opportunity to suppress them, and are strictly preventing the enemy from continuing to land.

According to military news, the enemy's aircraft carrier "Notoro" and four destroyers and gunboats left the waters off Songkou yesterday and headed towards the sea off Zhejiang Province, seemingly hoping to invade our □□ and other places.

### The Focus of the War Widens Outwards, Recent Developments Worth Noting

The Central News Agency reporter's dispatch from the front line last night can be summarized as follows: At the beginning of the Shanghai battle, our troops were forced to fight back in self-defense, adopting an offensive strategy and repeatedly capturing important enemy positions. The central route even advanced to the Huishan Wharf, with the momentum to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop. However, the enemy relied on several solid fortresses, stubbornly defending them and urgently telegraphing Tokyo for reinforcements. Three divisions, the 5th, 9th, and 12th, were dispatched from Japan to Shanghai and, starting on the 22nd, repeatedly attempted to land in our coastal areas along the river. For the sake of rear security, our troops had to slightly withdraw the advancing forces in the Hongkou area and temporarily cease the offensive. Therefore, the front line in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas has been quite quiet in recent days, with no fighting. The enemy troops landing along our riverfront are in two areas: one is the Wusong, Yunzaobang, and Zhanghuabang area, and the other is the Luodian and Liuhe area. In total, the enemy troops landing in the two areas number about 5,000 to 6,000. The enemy in the Wusong area has suffered heavy casualties under our troops' continuous fierce attacks. By the day before yesterday, only about 400 to 500 remnants remained in Zhanghuabang, stubbornly defending the station. However, yesterday afternoon, additional reinforcements landed at Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang, launching three fierce counterattacks on our positions, all of which were repelled by our troops. They are currently in a stalemate. Our troops are determined to win and are vowing to annihilate the remaining enemy. The enemy troops in the Luodian area number about 3,000. Although our front-line troops were under the combined attack of enemy artillery and aircraft, they never retreated slightly. When our fresh troops arrived the day before yesterday, they launched a fierce attack. The intensity of the artillery fire on both sides was unprecedented since the start of the fighting. The entire town of Luodian has been reduced to scorched earth. The enemy, after all, was weak and scattered, fleeing to the Shengqiao, Mupiao Town, and Chenjiahang areas in the northwest. Our troops are pursuing them in victory. Looking at the recent situation, the focus of the war has clearly widened outwards. Developments in the recent days are worth noting.

Yunzaobang Remnants Plot Stubborn Resistance

According to the report from the front received yesterday afternoon, apart from the enemy who landed along the coast earlier, there are still a small number of remnants in the Zhanghuabang and Shengqiao, Mupiaoqiao, and Chenjiahang areas northwest of Luodian, who are being cleared. In other areas, there are no traces of the enemy.

In recent days, the fighting on both sides along the coast has been quite fierce, with artillery fire incessant day and night. The air force has also dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle. According to reliable news, there are still over a thousand enemy soldiers north of Yunzaobang, putting up stubborn resistance and attempting to penetrate deeper. However, our side has long placed heavy troops there, and the enemy is already surrounded, making it easy to annihilate them in one fell swoop.

### Fierce Fighting North of Luodian

Enemy Launches Multiple Attacks on Mupiao Town, Shenjiaqiao, and Other Places, All Repelled.

Military news: Yesterday (the 27th), fierce fighting continued north of Luodian, along the line of Mupiao Town, Shenjiaqiao, and Liuhe. Dozens of enemy aircraft flew at low altitude throughout the day, dropping bombs like rain, and using signals to direct gunboats to bombard our positions and the rear of our positions, using extended artillery fire to strike our rear key points and destroy our fortifications. Our troops responded calmly, resisting tenaciously. The enemy launched multiple attacks, all of which were repelled by us. In days of bloody fighting, advancing and retreating repeatedly, both sides have suffered heavy casualties.

Military news: The enemy's reinforcements, totaling three divisions, the 5th, 9th, and 12th, landed mostly in the Luodian and Liuhe area.

According to someone who returned to Shanghai from the front line at 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy troops in the Luodian area, after being besieged by our troops for two days and nights, have retreated to an area about eight or nine *hua li* outside Luodian Town. The night before last and yesterday morning, they were still putting up stubborn resistance. At the same time, dozens of enemy warships, using a dense barrage of fire from Paotaiwan along Baoshan, Shizilin, Xiaochuansha, and the riverside of Liuhe, successively landed secretly in those places.

The Central News Agency reports: According to Wang Yuwu, the Luodian District Chief who arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 27th), there are no traces of the enemy northeast of Luodian. There are still approximately 2,000 enemy soldiers in the Shengqiao, Mupiao Town, and Chenjiahang areas north of Luodian, who are currently being surrounded by our troops. In the Xiaochuansha area, the enemy seems to be constructing fortifications, hoping to put up stubborn resistance, but based on the terrain there, the enemy will definitely not succeed. In the previous few days, the enemy charged into Luodian Town in two routes. The front line had a small number of enemies advancing to Shi Xianggong Temple in Jiading County, but after our troops ambushed them, the enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated. In terms of the current situation, the enemy in that area can be completely annihilated in the shortest period of time.

Enemy Warships Concentrated Outside Wusongkou

Enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River were still frequently moving back and forth yesterday. At 8:00 AM, 8:35 AM, and 8:40 AM, two enemy destroyers, No. 16, and one destroyer, No. 22, which entered the port the day before, successively exited the port. At 10:20 AM and 10:30 AM, one enemy destroyer and one gunboat successively entered the port and docked at the China Merchants Wharf and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha Wharf. Then, the gunboat sailed out again at 11:15 AM. In total, there were eleven enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River yesterday (the 27th) morning. The anchoring situation is as follows: One destroyer at the China Merchants Wharf, one Izumo warship at the No. 2 buoy, one destroyer No. 21 at the No. 4 buoy, one destroyer at the No. 8 buoy, two gunboats at the Pudong Mitsui Wharf, one destroyer at the No. 15 buoy, one gunboat at the No. 16 buoy, one destroyer at the No. 17 buoy, one destroyer No. 21 at the No. 20 buoy, one destroyer at the No. 34 buoy, totaling eleven ships. As for the reason why the number of enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River is decreasing day by day, it is because most of the enemy warships are now concentrated in the waters outside Wusongkou and the waters below Liuhe in order to blockade our coastal ports.

Enemy and Our Forces Facing Each Other on the Eastern Front

The enemy forces along the line from North Sichuan Road, Jiangwan Road, to the west of the Yangshupu Road Gonda Cotton Mill, taking advantage of the arrival of their reinforcements last night, launched attacks on our army positions along the line from all routes. Our army also launched a full-scale counterattack. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy forces immediately retreated, but returned shortly after, and were still repelled by our army. Harassment continued throughout the night and ultimately failed. Our army's front line at Shanghai University is only 500 meters away. Both sides are facing each other.

Military News: The enemy forces in Yangshupu are now entrenched in the buildings in that area, densely laying out electric currents and electric grids.

The Inner Hongqiao Has Been Reduced to Ashes

At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a large number of refugees from Jianghuai, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled from the Hongkou Inner Hongqiao battlefield. After passing through the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road, they rested briefly and sat on the ground at the entrances of the alleys. When asked about the recent situation in that area, they said that the Hongkou Inner Hongqiao and Middle Hongqiao areas are currently in our army's hands. The enemy is entrenched in the area east of the Sika Bridge. Our defending troops have strong strength and strict defenses. Although there has been no fierce fighting on that line in recent days, the remaining enemy still attempts to sneak attacks every night, but due to weak counterattack power, they are always repelled by our army. The enemy always sets fires after each defeat. Therefore, after several days and nights of bombing and burning, that place has become a scorched earth, with no complete houses. As for the residents trapped there, since the outbreak of the war, there has not been a day without some men, women, old, and young being brutally massacred by enemy machine guns and bayonets, with corpses lying all over the roads, which is unbearable to witness. Fortunately, in recent days, due to no major battles, the burial teams have been able to work, and there are now few exposed corpses along the way. Within our army's defense line, there are still police officers on guard. During the fierce fighting last week, the police tried their best to advise residents to stay indoors. They repeatedly tried to escape the war zone, but they could not cross the enemy's defense line, and ambulances could not drive in to rescue them. Now that their homes have been destroyed and there is nowhere to live, and they have heard that the enemy will continue to counterattack, they started at 6:00 AM, escorted by our military police, to leave the defense line in groups, in order to avoid the enemy's harm, detouring and braving all kinds of dangers, and only reached this place after nine hours. There are still many who have not been able to escape, they said. The refugees then learned that all the shelters were located south of Suzhou Creek and then went south in droves. Until 5:30 PM last night, the sound of machine guns and the rumbling of artillery fire did indeed emanate from Eastern Hongkou, which must be the last struggle of the desperate enemy there, but the sound died down in a moment.

Sporadic Artillery Fire in Zhabei

Military News: Our army's front line in the Zhabei area remains the same, and the troops have been strengthened. The enemy forces launched two counterattacks yesterday, both of which failed. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office, there was sporadic artillery fire north of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces headquarters. Japanese bombers were flying at high altitude, heading from Wusong towards the northwest of the concession. From 11:00 AM to noon, although there was sporadic artillery fire in the Tian Tong An Railway Station and Japanese headquarters area, the focus of the military has shifted to Wusong, which has been confirmed. The artillery fire along the riverside north of Wusong is fierce. Four Japanese bombers dropped twelve bombs between the Shanghai-Taicang Road and the (Lianyi) cemetery (about one and a half miles northwest of Shanghai University).

Our Aircraft Again Launched a Night Attack on Enemy Warships Yesterday

At 10:30 PM last night, many of our aircraft continued to take off and flew to Songkou to attack enemy warships. One aircraft appeared over the Huangpu River. At that time, the new moon was rising and the stars were shining, but only the sound of the aircraft could be heard, and the shadow of the aircraft could not be seen. When the enemy warships heard that our aircraft were flying in, anti-aircraft guns and flares were fired together, but our aircraft remained calm and composed. After circling over the Huangpu River twice for reconnaissance, they safely flew to Songkou. At about 2:00 AM this morning, our aircraft took off for the second time, but only reconnoitered along the Huangpu River and returned. However, the enemy warships were already in great commotion.

One Enemy Aircraft Was Shot Down by Us

At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, three or four enemy aircraft flew over Yangshupu to reconnoiter our army positions and encountered our aircraft, resulting in a fierce aerial battle. Both sides fired with machine guns. Our aircraft flew up and down, very agile. A Westerner witnessed one enemy aircraft being shot down by us.

The enemy aircraft's atrocities continued yesterday. Starting in the morning, nine enemy seaplanes, divided into three teams, took off from the Huangpu River and advanced in three routes: northeast, northwest, and due west, reconnoitering in Pudong, Nanshi, Zhenru, Wusong, Zhabei, and other places, circling all day. They returned one after another in the evening. At 4:20 PM in the afternoon, when one aircraft was flying back from Zhenru, its tail suddenly emitted smoke and then fell downwards. When it hit the ground, the bombs exploded, and the fuselage was completely destroyed. The point where it fell was about at the bottom of Yangshupu.

Enemy Warships Shoot at Refugee Ships

The current battle in Shanghai is concentrated in Songkou. A large number of enemy troops, relying on the cover of enemy warships and artillery, are attempting to land at various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and are sending aircraft to drop bombs and bombard them everywhere, causing the people in those places to not dare to live in peace. Enemy warships have sailed to the Chongming Island sea entrance to spy. All the farmers living in the various sands and isles belonging to Chongming County are carrying the old and supporting the young, taking the sand boats to escape to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the enemy warships anchored at Songkou are shooting at the fleeing refugee ships. At about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Xu Fulang, a refugee who had just escaped to Shanghai by boat from Waisha, said, "Our group of thirty-seven people took our own sand boat along the coast from Waisha at midnight the night before last. When we were importing, it was already dawn. An enemy warship anchored at Songkou used machine guns to strafe our boat. We were panicked and helpless. Although we tried our best to steer towards the beach to avoid it, Xie Sanlang (31 years old), who was lying at the stern of the boat, was hit by a bullet in the hip. After we sailed out of the line of fire, we bandaged the wound with cloth, but he bled a lot. We arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM and immediately sent him to the hospital for treatment."

Enemy Aircraft Bombed and Ravaged Everywhere

Yesterday (the 27th) morning, at about 7:00 AM, several enemy aircraft flew to Minhang Town and bombed it fiercely. Nineteen out of ten buildings along the Huangpu River were destroyed, and many innocent residents were injured and killed, dripping with blood, which was unbearable to witness, instantly causing terror to spread throughout the town.

At about 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, six more enemy aircraft came and dropped more than ten bombs. The Pudong Zhangyan Wharf, the Pudong Hai Bank, the Wan Chang Distillery, the Yongxing Lime Company, and a certain lumber company at the West Beach entrance were all damaged. Dozens of city houses in the Tianjie Houshui Alley area were destroyed, and more than a dozen people were killed and injured. Three buildings belonging to the Wang family on North Street were also bombed.

At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, four enemy aircraft flew to the Wangjia Wharf and Rihui Port in Nanshi and dropped several bombs.

At about 7:00 AM yesterday morning, enemy aircraft flew to Minhang Town and bombed it extensively. Nineteen out of ten houses along the river were destroyed, and many residents were injured and killed. The wartime service group of the Shanghai Boy Scouts received the news and immediately sent members to rescue the refugees, rescuing more than twenty men and women and fourteen children. Lawyer Wu Luping and others also escaped to Shanghai at the same time.

According to the information received yesterday, enemy aircraft extensively bombed Nanshi, Wusong, and Yangshupu yesterday. However, as of noon yesterday, there had been no large-scale bombing. Only three enemy aircraft had circled over Nanshi and Pudong for reconnaissance since 8:00 AM yesterday morning and strafed the police maintaining order at the Sixteen Piles Guanqiao with machine guns for about two hours before leaving. The English-language *North China Daily News* reported that at 4:00 AM this morning (the 27th), a six-pound shell hit a corner of the police hospital at Ward Road West, bombing into the second and third-floor bedrooms, injuring eight Indians, three of whom were seriously injured. The deputy warden claimed that the location of the West Prison is still dangerous.

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in Zhenru from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM yesterday.

Enemy Ship Transports Corpses Back to Country

One enemy transport ship, which sailed into Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Wharf on the evening of the 25th, unloaded a large number of military equipment and ammunition and then transported a total of more than a thousand Japanese refugees and wounded soldiers the night before last and sailed out of Songkou back to Japan at dawn yesterday.

The enemy ship Asahi Maru sailed into Songkou yesterday afternoon and docked at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha Huishan Wharf at about 2:00 PM. Hundreds of enemy wounded soldiers were loaded onto the ship. At 3:25 PM, the ship sailed to the China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf, and a batch of enemy wounded soldiers and corpses were loaded onto the ship last night (carrying about a thousand wounded soldiers and corpses in total). It is said that it will sail back to Japan this morning. In addition to flying the Red Cross flag high on the mast, the ship also had Red Cross symbols painted on the smokestack and hull.

There Are a Total of Eleven Foreign Ships in the Huangpu River

At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, one US transport ship, the Gold Star, sailed into the Huangpu River and docked in the Huangpu River outside the Beijing Road Wharf. At 1:30 PM in the afternoon, the British warship Mallard set sail from the Bund outside the French Concession and exited the port. In total, there are eleven friendly warships anchored in the Huangpu River south of the Beijing Road Bund, including five US warships, two British warships, three French warships, and one Dutch warship. (Central News Agency)

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the US transport ship anchored in the Huangpu River outside the Beijing Road Wharf yesterday morning was the "Gold Star." From noon to 2:00 PM, the British warship "Mallard" set sail from the Bund of the French Concession at 1:30 PM, carrying refugees out of the port.

Reports of Fires in Various Places Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Council's intelligence reported that after 5:00 AM yesterday morning, Yulin Road and the Yangshupu area were air-raided, but an all-clear signal was issued about twelve minutes later. A fire broke out at the Mitsui & Co. Wharf nearby the day before yesterday. By 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the fire was almost extinguished. There was also a fire in Pudong, about a mile from the riverfront, but it was not burning fiercely. From 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, a large fire broke out at a certain wharf in Pudong, which had not been extinguished from 9:15 AM to 10:45 AM. The wharf is said to be the Nippon Yusen Kaisha Wharf.

From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, a fire broke out near the Zhabei Electric Company branch, which was very fierce. From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, everything was calm.

### Twelve Japanese Aircraft Launched a Night Attack on the Capital

Two Planes Were Shot Down

[Nanjing] Twelve enemy heavy bombers came to Nanjing one after another from the east, west, south, and north at 12:00 PM on the 26th, attempting a night attack. Our army, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched aircraft to intercept them and fiercely attacked them separately. Until 3:00 AM on the 27th, the enemy was completely driven away, and they were chased to Liuhe County, shooting down two enemy aircraft, one of which caught fire upon landing, and the other is still being searched. The remaining enemy aircraft fled in panic. After investigation, the enemy aircraft dropped several sulfur bombs outside the city, and other than three civilian houses catching fire, which were quickly extinguished by the fire brigade, there were no major losses. (Central News Agency, 27th)

[Nanjing] US Embassy officials are celebrating Ambassador Johnson's 30th anniversary of service in the diplomatic field tonight. During the celebration, an air raid alarm suddenly sounded, as Japanese aircraft came to attack again, but the people in the embassy did not stop their celebration. (Reuters, 27th)

### Criminal Facts of Huang Jun and Others

[Nanjing] The Nanjing Garrison Headquarters recently arrested several important traitors in Nanjing City, including Huang Jun and 18 others. The evidence of their crimes was conclusive, and they confessed without denial. The headquarters sentenced them to death. At 7:00 AM on the 26th, the prisoners were brought out, their identities were verified, and they were taken to the execution ground for execution by firing squad. An investigation into the criminal facts of each prisoner is presented below:

Huang Jun, 46 years old, from Minhou, Fujian, was bribed by the enemy to provide secret documents under his management as intelligence material. After the enemy returned to their country, Huang Jun continued his activities with a designated person from the enemy.

Huang Sheng, 26 years old, Huang Jun's son, was instructed by his father to use his identity to gather confidential information and sell it to the enemy.

Luo Zhiyuan, 36 years old, from Minhou, Fujian, opened the Meimei Advertising Agency in Nanjing as a cover. He used business connections to enter our troops, military education institutions, and fortress construction areas to conduct reconnaissance and mapping, selling the collected materials to the enemy.

Qi Gongheng, 46 years old, from Minhou, Fujian, was bribed by the enemy to open the Overseas Chinese News Agency, using his journalist status to engage in traitorous activities. He also privately wore lost and invalidated badges from the Ministry of Interior to break into a fortress area and observe defense works.

Liu Wenhua, 36 years old, from Nanjing, falsely claimed to be a dental science graduate from Japan, opening a dental hospital to specifically gather information from enemy police stations and newspaper reporters, and introduce traitors.

Hong Nan, 44 years old, from Nan'an, Fujian, was bribed by the enemy to open the Renren Bookstore, using the sale of Japanese books to recruit intellectual traitors. He was also responsible for investigating the ideological trends of Nanjing cultural institutions and intellectual circles.

Guo Junqing (aka Fei Feixian), 55 years old, from Baoying, Jiangsu, was bribed by the enemy, using fortune-telling to gather military and political information.

Xiao Yongquan, 31 years old, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, with the alias Tian Chayi, was bribed by a famous spy to introduce female attendants and singers, using women to recruit traitors.

Qiu Pu, 36 years old, from Raoping, Guangdong, was bribed by the enemy to investigate the conditions of highways and airfields.

Cai Kungang, 31 years old, from Zhangzhou, Fujian, received subsidies from the enemy to open the Capital Hospital, contacting Taiwanese vagrants in Nanjing to investigate the conditions of civilian organizations.

Deng Guangzhi, 30 years old, from Tongcheng, Anhui, was bribed by the enemy to sell confidential documents.

Lu Shouqian, 54 years old, from Baoying, Jiangsu, was a translator at the Foreign Language School of the Training Supervision Department, bribed by the enemy to provide intelligence and gather military secrets.

Dai Tianqing, 33 years old, from Zhangzhou, Fujian, received subsidies from the enemy to open the Bo'ai Hospital, using medical consultations to approach military personnel, gather military information, and provide it to the enemy.

You Lüjufen, 42 years old, from Zhao'an, Fujian, was introduced by Qiu Pu to collect intelligence for the enemy and was directed by a famous spy stationed in Shanghai.

Mo Shuying, 31 years old, from Qingyang, Anhui, lived with a spy active in Nanjing, colluding with military and political personnel to gather information.

Ding Longshi, 48 years old, from Huaining, Anhui, received subsidies from a spy to help Mo Shuying introduce various organizations.

Xu Weiyong, 25 years old, from Siyang, Jiangsu, was bribed by the enemy to leak military secrets.

Huang Yunsen, 26 years old, from Minhou, Fujian, was bribed by the enemy to sell information.

When these traitors were executed, they all trembled with fear, their faces devoid of color. Some with a little conscience claimed repentance, but as accomplices of evil, their crimes were unforgivable. In the end, their lives ended with a loud bang. In this extraordinary period of all-out resistance, severely punishing these deranged individuals is deeply satisfying to the people. It can also awaken the public's shared hatred of traitors and spies and encourage them to unanimously participate in the work of eradicating the enemy's internal lines. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

### Guangdong Authorities Limit White Russians to Leave the Country

[Hong Kong] Guangdong authorities are restricting all White Russians to wind up their business and leave the country within one month. (Special dispatch on the 27th)

### No Signals Found at the Soviet Consulate

Consular corps sent personnel to investigate and found the consulate empty with the electricity cut off.

Central News Agency Moscow, 27th, Reuters dispatch: The Soviet official news agency announced a Shanghai message today, stating that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai declared that if the Soviet Consulate continues to signal Chinese troops with lights, the Japanese army will bombard the consulate.

TASS, August 27, Shanghai message: According to official sources obtained by TASS, the Soviet Consulate-General in Shanghai is located in a Japanese-controlled area. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all personnel have been evacuated. Recently, there have been provocative rumors that signals have been sent from the consulate. Yesterday (26th), Mr. Simansky, Director of General Affairs of the Consulate, requested the Shanghai Consular Corps to send personnel to investigate together to clarify the truth. With the Corps' agreement, Vice-Consul Konstantinof of the Soviet Union was accompanied by personnel to inspect the consulate at 10:00 PM last night. They found the consulate empty, with no signaling equipment and all the lights turned off. The results of the investigation proved that the Japanese claim that the Soviet Consulate was sending signals was purely fabricated and contained a provocative intention.

### British Ambassador Injured by Japanese Aircraft Incident, Britain Prepares to Protest to Japan

Requests punishment for the airmen responsible for the incident. All countries are closely watching the development of the situation. Britain appoints senior officials to China to act as ambassador. The ambassador's condition was still critical yesterday.

Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, was traveling by car from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday. At 2:50 PM, he was bombed by Japanese aircraft and strafed with machine guns, suffering severe injuries. The location where the British Ambassador was bombed was on the highway beyond Taicang, not far from Shanghai. After being injured, the British Ambassador continued to Shanghai in the same car and was immediately admitted to Hong'en Hospital for treatment, under the care of renowned British doctors Panton and Cotrell. He fell asleep after receiving a blood transfusion that evening. His condition was good yesterday, but he was still not out of danger. Since the incident, Britain has prepared to lodge a strong protest with Japan, demanding severe punishment for the airmen involved. The former British Embassy Counselor, Mr. Hoar, has been appointed to China to act as ambassador. All countries are closely watching the development of the situation. Detailed information is recorded below.

Serious Injuries, Condition Still Good

According to the first announcement released by the hospital at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the ambassador's condition was quite good. The second announcement released at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon stated that the British Ambassador's injuries were still serious and he was still in pain. Although he was still conscious, he had not yet escaped from danger. However, in the past 24 hours, his condition had been quite good. Whether the ambassador's injuries were critical could not be determined within 48 hours.

According to the third announcement released by Hong'en Hospital at 6:30 PM last night, the British Ambassador had a good afternoon, with a temperature of 99.4 and a pulse of 84. An examination of the wounds showed that the right waist was the most severely injured. However, as of 3:00 AM this morning, the ambassador's condition had not changed.

Chairman Lin Sent Personnel to Express Condolences Yesterday

Mr. Yu Hongjun, the Mayor of Shanghai, was ordered by the National Government yesterday to visit the hospital at around 3:00 PM on behalf of Chairman Lin to express his condolences and concern. Mr. Yu Ming, the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited the hospital again yesterday to convey the condolences of Foreign Minister Wang and Vice Ministers Xu and Chen. Mr. Kawagoe Shigeru, the Japanese Ambassador to China, visited the hospital at around 10:00 AM yesterday to express his condolences and apologies. Mr. Zhang Zhizhong, the Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai, also sent personnel to the hospital to express his condolences. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Support Association sent personnel with a letter to express their condolences yesterday. The original letter read: "We are deeply concerned to hear that Your Excellency has been injured by the unlawful shooting of Japanese aircraft. We have sent Mr. Gu Bingyuan to represent the Association and express our condolences. To Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Support Association."

Britain to Lodge Strong Protest

Central News Agency London, 26th, Havas dispatch: After Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, was injured by Japanese aircraft, it is generally believed that the British government will not be satisfied with verbal protests and will lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government within days, and demand severe punishment for the airmen involved. However, it is difficult to imagine what effective measures Britain will take to prevent similar incidents from happening again. British political figures believe that the British government now only has to make further representations to the Japanese government so that the proposal to neutralize Shanghai can be put into practice.

National News Agency, 27th, London dispatch: The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Express learned today that Britain will demand that Japan immediately and severely punish the airmen who shot and injured Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, and will demand compensation for all losses and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. If Japan fails to accept this demand, Britain may recall its ambassador to Japan, Clive.

National News Agency, 26th, London dispatch: Today, according to highly reliable sources, the British government intends to protest to the Japanese government regarding the injury of Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to China, but will avoid turning the matter into an international incident. It is understood that if the Japanese government can formally apologize, it may not increase the disputes in the Far East and make the matter a "unintentional accident."

Our Embassy Issues Statement

Central News Agency London, 26th, Havas dispatch: Regarding the injury of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy issued a statement to the newspapers, saying, "It is regrettable that the Japanese army committed such atrocities at this critical time. Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is a person of high standing and greatly respected by us. At this time, the nature of the mission he bears in China is of the utmost importance. He was seriously injured, making it impossible for him to continue his work. In addition to expressing our sincere sympathy to Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, we would like to draw the attention of world opinion to a fact, that is, the Japanese army is using machine guns to strafe non-military personnel outside the war zone every day. This kind of brutal behavior of attacking innocent people is originally a crime against all mankind, but no one has paid attention to it until today, when the victim is the famous Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, this fact is exposed to the world. Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was traveling by car from Nanjing to Shanghai today along a highway, which was originally not dangerous and there was no worry about being shot at by Japanese aircraft with machine guns. If you check the map, the scene of the incident is far from the war zone, and the Japanese army indiscriminately bombed it, which is clearly an illegal act. We sincerely hope that the ambassador's injuries are not as serious as rumored, and wish him a speedy recovery."

Our Ambassador Visits the Foreign Office to Express Condolences

Central News Agency London, 27th, Reuters dispatch: The British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being shot and injured by Japanese aircraft has aroused deep sympathy throughout Europe. Officials in Berlin are unwilling to comment on the impact of this matter on the situation in the Far East, only saying that the matter is extremely complicated. German newspapers all said that the attack on the British Ambassador was not intentional. Italian newspapers all attached great importance to the matter and understood the reasons for British anger, but said that if Japan formally apologized, it would not cause serious consequences. Paris attached even greater importance to this matter. The Paris Daily News said that Japanese leaders should quickly rein in their horses and consider the invitation supported by Britain, the United States, and France, otherwise it would be too late. The Little Daily News expressed the hope that the British Ambassador's personal future would not be interrupted by this shooting. The ambassadors of China and Japan separately visited British Foreign Secretary Eden at the British Foreign Office today, representing their governments to express their concern. Chinese in London said that they did not want to make the matter more serious and did not want Britain to be stimulated by this and take active intervention measures in the Far East conflict. Japanese Ambassador Yoshida said that the Japanese government considered the matter extremely unfortunate and would express the hope that the British Ambassador would recover soon, while Japanese expatriates hoped to receive detailed investigation results as soon as possible.

Britain Appoints Senior Officials to Act as Ambassador

Central News Agency London, 27th, Reuters dispatch: Mr. Hoar, the former Counselor of the British Embassy in China, will soon fly to China to act as British Ambassador. Mr. Hoar is currently on vacation and was about to receive a new appointment. After Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked, he was ordered to go to China as quickly as possible. Mr. Hoar will depart in about one or two days, most likely taking the commercial sea route to Saigon first, and then taking the fastest route to his post.

British Newspapers Consider it Extremely Serious

Central News Agency London, 27th, Reuters dispatch: The Morning Post today published an editorial on the injury of British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft, entitled "A Very Serious Misfortune." The article said that the national public opinion was greatly shocked to hear the news that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was seriously injured in a deliberate attack by Japanese aircraft. There is no room for whitewashing such a brutal act, because the ambassador's car was flying the British flag, and just a car cannot be considered to have a military connection. The government communique announcing this unfortunate incident contained natural indignation after appropriate diplomatic silence. Therefore, what is gratifying now is that after further receiving the necessary information, the British government will take full action to negotiate with the Japanese government. Know that the people will not be content with this, for an ambassador enjoying diplomatic privileges was attacked while performing his official duties, which is unforgivable. It is thought that the Japanese government will immediately offer a sincere apology for this, and it is hoped that the Japanese government will quickly investigate with those in command of the war in China why they allowed their troops to commit this unpardonable atrocity.

Central News Agency London, 27th, Reuters dispatch: This morning, almost all major newspapers commented on the injury of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. The Daily Telegraph said that the matter contained serious international relations. The British side may not make any hasty decisions until after a thorough investigation. Japan is now using the killing of two Japanese people at Hongqiao Airport as the reason for the Shanghai operation. It is thought that the Japanese government will not dare to ignore the seriousness of this matter regarding the injury of the British Ambassador. At present, we must assume that the attack on the British Ambassador was an unintentional mistake. The initial telegram issued by the Japanese official news agency did not acknowledge the seriousness of the matter, but the Japanese government may not take the same attitude. This incident shows that the opposition to ignoring the rights of neutral countries is urgent.

Central News Agency London, 27th, Havas dispatch: Regarding the injury of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, the Daily Telegraph recently commented, "Britain should not make any hasty judgments until the matter has been thoroughly investigated. However, regarding the disregard for the rights of neutral countries, there is an even greater need to protest because of the attack on the British Ambassador. The Morning Post published a commentary with the headline "Extremely Serious Incident," stating, "The British Ambassador enjoys diplomatic privileges and was attacked during his legal actions. The Japanese government should be responsible for the actions of its troops and should only offer a sincere apology to the British government. The Times reported that "This kind of accident cannot be resolved by an apology. The position of the British Ambassador is sacred and inviolable. This is an unforgivable act. Japan has not declared war on China, but has launched a large-scale invasion, and has even blatantly disregarded the rights of all countries in China, hindering the trade of all countries in China, and all kinds of illegal actions abound. Now, the British Ambassador has also been attacked. The urgency of the Far East situation is becoming more and more clear. The British government will decide how to obtain satisfaction after receiving a detailed report of the incident. In terms of public opinion, it can be asserted that no matter what "appropriate action" the government takes, the people of the whole country will resolutely support it. The Daily Herald reported that "If the Japanese army intentionally attacked the British Ambassador or the British car at this time, I know that it is not so foolish. For this reason, Britain does not need to overreact and demand compensation... Now we only hope that the ambassador will recover soon."

The Times Denounces Atrocities

Central News Agency London, 27th, Reuters dispatch: The Times newspaper today published an editorial denouncing the attack on British Ambassador to China Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen as an unprecedented atrocity, saying that we assume that even the most reckless Japanese aviator would not attack the ambassador's car if he knew who the passengers in the car were. However, the Japanese government's responsibility is not relieved by this. Even what the Japanese non-officialdom said, that the Japanese side believed that senior Chinese military officers might be traveling by car to Shanghai, so it ordered its aviators to attack any car, only proves that the Japanese government has not paid any attention to the sacred dignity of the lives of civilians in the country that it has not officially declared war on, especially since the ambassador was injured many miles outside the war zone. Tokyo will make a more formal apology, but can an apology alone be sufficient compensation for this kind of event? It is known that the ambassador's position is inviolable. If it is violated, even a hundred mouths cannot shirk the blame. Seeing this atrocity, we can know that the situation is an intolerable tangle. The British government naturally knows how to obtain satisfaction. What we can reliably tell the government is that any appropriate action the government decides to take will certainly receive the strong support of the people.

American Newspapers Criticize Severely

Central News Agency New York, 27th, Reuters dispatch: The New York Tribune today published a severe criticism, denouncing the disrespect for the lives of neutral countries in the Sino-Japanese War, saying that society has sought to legislate to sanction violence in international events, but Japan has deliberately turned it into an undeclared war in order to evade legal sanctions. The New York Times said that the misfortune encountered by British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen will of course make Britain more anxious about the safety of British lives and property. Tokyo's recent hopes of restoring the old Anglo-Japanese alliance will inevitably be erased in the future.

French Newspapers Believe it Hurts the Whole of Europe

Central News Agency Paris, 27th, Havas dispatch: French newspapers have recently commented on the injury of British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. The Echo de Paris reported that "It is difficult to predict what consequences this will have and what actions the British government will take after investigating the matter. What we should pay attention to is to what extent the Mediterranean issue and the China issue can be resolved directly, or jointly resolved by the countries concerned, which is still unknown. The Daily News reported that "The British and French proposal for the neutralization of Shanghai, as well as the call for peace by US Secretary of State Hull, should now be seriously considered by the Japanese authorities."

Central News Agency Paris, 27th, Reuters dispatch: French strong newspaper's famous international observer Ronner commented on the incident of the British Ambassador being attacked today, saying, "Yesterday, it was not only the British Ambassador who was injured on the Nanjing-Shanghai highway, but the whole of Europe." Ronner then said in the tone of the Japanese military authorities, "You did not notify us in advance that you wanted to drive on this Chinese highway." Ronner's reply was, "If you give notice in advance, it is tantamount to admitting that Japanese military aircraft have the right to bomb or strafe Chinese highways with machine guns. Moreover, China and Japan have not yet formally declared war." Ronner continued, "If this were fifty years ago, Europe would never agree to being disposed of outside the law and its power. If we want to rebuild Europe's prestige in the Far East, can Britain just wait for the fate of the British Ambassador alone? Moreover, it is not only the lives and property of the British that are lost, but the people of France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and other countries are also sacrificing. We have discussed the coordination of Europe, and it is now urgent to make Europe's voice reach the Far East and make it feel that its prestige is still there."

Our Ambassador Hughe Sends a Telegram of Condolences

Central News Agency Tokyo, 27th dispatch: Regarding the incident of British Ambassador to China Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being attacked, the Foreign Minister issued a statement late on the 26th, saying that he is currently thoroughly investigating the facts on the ground, and that it is impossible to dream of Japanese aircraft deliberately shooting at the British ambassador's car. The reports in the newspapers mostly focused on the fact that the Japanese side had not been notified in advance and that it was not intentional. Our Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying learned of this on the night of the 26th and immediately sent a telegram of condolences. On the morning of the 27th, he sent a secretary to the British Embassy in Tokyo to express his condolences.

Military Attaché Details the Dangerous Encounter

The China Press reported that last night (26th), Mr. Fraser, the military attaché of the British Embassy, told the representative of the China Press about the details of the attack on Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador, by Japanese aircraft, saying that after the ambassador and others left Wuxi, when the car was less than fifty miles from Shanghai, a Japanese aircraft came in the sky and suddenly opened machine gun fire on two cars. The first car was driven by him and carried the ambassador and the financial advisor, Herbert. The second car only carried luggage and was driven by a Chinese driver, following closely behind. Both cars were flying the British flag. Herbert testified on the spot that the two aircraft were flying very low, but he did not hear the sound of their engines, apparently because they had stopped their engines. In any case, the machine gun strafing was unexpected. The ambassador's side seemed to have been hit by bullets and there was a lot of bleeding. The two cars stopped immediately. Fraser and Herbert got out of the army to discuss what to do. From time to time, another Japanese aircraft came and dropped a bomb on the two cars. The bomb fell into the rice field, but its explosive force was very strong. The two men could not stand and fell into the field. Fraser also said that if the bomb had fallen on the road, everyone would have been turned into powder. So the two decided to drive quickly to Shanghai. Fortunately, the ambassador was brave and calm. Although he felt very painful, he was clear-headed and got back in the car and moved forward. He only stopped the car once or twice to drink water for the ambassador. At 4:00 PM, he arrived at Hong'en Hospital in Shanghai. Before the ambassador was served by nurses and doctors, he still instructed some urgent and important matters to be handled, which shows his perseverance. The ambassador came to Shanghai this time to meet with the leaders of the British community. It is believed that it is related to the war in Shanghai, and he wanted to bring good news to his people in this difficult and dangerous situation. The ambassador has been working hard for peace in Nanjing in recent months. He is still doing this when he comes to Shanghai.

Current Commentary

### Expedite the Launch of National Diplomacy

— Ji

Since the outbreak of large-scale, full-scale war of resistance, the loyal and brave spirit of sacrifice and the magnificent battle behavior of our front-line soldiers have not only shocked the enemy but also shifted international attention. People in Europe and the United States, who have always underestimated China's combat capabilities, have had to admire this. Major newspapers that have always maintained a neutral attitude have now begun to relentlessly criticize Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. This is an important development in the international situation since the war of resistance.

Because of several victories of our army on the front lines, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, and because the international situation is favorable to our development, the aggressors have had to greatly increase their troops and launch a full-scale invasion, attempting to land at Wusongkou and other coastal areas to contain the military in North China. Thus, our war of resistance against the enemy is becoming more intense, and the battle line is expanding day by day.

This war is arduous and protracted, and it is also the final war for the survival of our Chinese nation. We must not be arrogant in victory, nor should we be discouraged in defeat, because local gains and losses are irrelevant to the overall situation. How to shake the enemy's internal structure, how to cut off all sources of enemy material supplies, and how to obtain continuous assistance from international friendly nations so that our anti-enemy work can develop smoothly and balanced in military, economic, and diplomatic aspects are extremely important issues today.

We know that modern warfare is not simply a war of force against force, but a war of national strength against national strength. The people's political organizational power and the use of diplomatic relations are particularly important keys to determining the final victory. Therefore, our goal today should be to launch our war of resistance against the enemy from all aspects.

Therefore, in addition to launching a full-scale military war of resistance against the enemy, we ask the government to use the talents of the whole country and expedite the launch of national diplomacy, promoting it from contact and advancement between the people so as to promote our entire diplomatic work, making the brutal Japan a brutal Japan abandoned by the world, and enabling us to obtain automatic and large-scale assistance from the people of various countries in terms of finance, military technology, and the supply of military supplies.

How to launch national diplomacy? We believe that at this time, the government should select internationally renowned scholars, missionaries and industrialists who have extremely close relations with the people of various countries, and representatives with definite diplomatic activity and organizational abilities, and send them to various countries. On the one hand, they should expose the brutal Japan's conspiracies and its destruction of world peace. On the other hand, they should declare our determination to resist Japan and the true meaning of fighting for the public justice and righteousness of mankind. On the one hand, they should raise public bonds for friendly governments and people who sympathize with us. On the one hand, they should organize overseas Chinese and students scattered in various countries to work separately for the glory of the entire nation to resist the enemy. Make every one of our citizens a member of the battle, and make our anti-enemy organization spread all over the world to arouse the sympathy and assistance of the whole world to us.

We know that if the government can have the determination to do it, the launch of this diplomatic work will not be difficult at all, and the willingness of talents throughout the country to do their best for the country goes without saying. The effectiveness generated in diplomacy will far outweigh the achievements of diplomatic envoys or other special envoys. The main reason why Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War was that the Japanese people provided government military funds to the United States and Britain through the debt. Shouldn't we catch up quickly?

As for the economic source of national diplomacy work, we believe that at this time, we should temporarily stop sending students abroad to study and let them work for the country. Allocate this funding to national diplomacy work expenses. At the same time, bring forward the time limit for government-funded students to return to China. On the other hand, save the investigation fees of investigators sent to various countries and use them for more practical activities. We hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will pool their wisdom and efforts to jointly launch this arduous national diplomacy work.

### UK and US Do Not Recognize Enemy's Blockade of Our Seaports

Any Obstruction of Merchant Ships Will Cause Disputes; Roosevelt and Hull Discuss the Situation Again

[Washington] Regarding the Japanese Third Fleet's decision to blockade the southeastern coast of China, the US State Department has declined to comment, believing that Japan has not formally raised this matter with the US government, so it is not appropriate to express its opinion hastily. However, well-informed sources believe that if the US maritime traffic is interfered with by Japan, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull will not tolerate it. Therefore, if Japan does not formally declare war on China and directly blockades its coast, it will put itself in an extremely difficult position. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that the State Department is now planning to quickly collect various facts about Japan's blockade of Chinese ports. Japan has not formally notified the US government. It is said that if the blockade is implemented, the result will be that President Roosevelt will immediately invoke the Neutrality Act. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt recently met with Secretary of State Hull to discuss the Far East situation and discuss the policies that the United States should adopt. According to informed sources, the government has decided to continue to adopt a monitoring attitude. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

[London] After the news of the Japanese Third Fleet blockading the southeastern coast of China was published in the newspapers, the general impression here was extremely bad, believing that the state of war will be established immediately. The blockade of the coast is an illegal act. As the Observer said, the second step in the blockade is to interrogate ships of various countries, but in any case, this right cannot be exercised by the Japanese Navy. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

[London] The British Foreign Office has not yet received any formal notification from Japan regarding its intention to blockade the coast of South China. It is heard that since a legal state of war does not exist, Britain cannot recognize the blockade. If it does not require the right to stop and search British ships, then Britain will not be affected in any way. So far, Japan has not indicated any intention to search British ships. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

[Tokyo] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry met with foreign reporters today. Regarding the incident in which the British ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, was attacked, he read the statement issued on the night of the 26th and said that the Foreign Ministry had not yet received a bulletin. Everything is under investigation and it is difficult to discuss. Later, someone asked that if third-country ships carrying munitions to China were also included in the blockade, the spokesman said that it was not mentioned in the statement and further study was needed before he could reply. Then, reporters from various countries raised five points, and the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry promised to reply on the 30th. Someone also asked whether Japan had replied to the British proposal for the neutralization of Shanghai. He replied that it had been formally replied on the 19th, but the content could not be revealed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)

### Our Army's Combat Power Is Now What It Used To Be

A Glimpse of German Media Commentary

[Berlin] It is reported that newspapers stated that the combat power and morale of the Chinese army have made considerable progress. The Battle of Nankou proves that Chinese soldiers are good at fighting. From a military point of view, the Chinese army has progressed very rapidly in recent years. Japan has felt that the current situation is more serious than in 1932. The Chinese army's resistance is stronger than it has been in the past five years. The Chinese have better weapons, the commanding ability of officers has also been strengthened, and the main force of the Chinese army, whether in North China or Shanghai, has not yet joined the battle.

### American People's Anti-Japanese Sentiment Is High

Protesting Against Aggression to Japanese Ambassador Saito; Academia Opposes the Implementation of the Neutrality Act

[Washington] The American League Against War and Fascism issued a declaration to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, stating that millions of Americans oppose Japan's aggression against China. If Saito does not convey this protest to Tokyo, tens of thousands of Americans will besiege the Japanese embassy and consulates and will call on the people of the country to boycott Japanese goods to safeguard China's democratic government and world peace. After the declaration was issued, Secretary of State Hull, under the order of President Roosevelt, strongly urged the League not to insist too much to avoid causing disputes. Today, the police stopped the League from implementing the action of besieging the Japanese embassy. (National Telegram, 26th)

[Washington] The American League Against War and Fascism, disregarding President Roosevelt's advice, placed 30 pickets at the gate of the Japanese embassy today, each holding a flag. One of the flags read, 'Japanese aggression endangers American peace.' The secretary of the New York branch of the League recently stated that all Japanese consulates in the United States will be picketed by the League. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

[Washington] The American League Against War and Fascism recently planned to hold a demonstration in front of the Japanese Embassy in the United States to protest against Japan's aggression against China. Secretary of State Hull recently, under the order of President Roosevelt, dissuaded them and told the League authorities that the situation in the Far East was quite serious and delicate, and it was not appropriate to hold demonstrations to avoid causing any problems. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

[Washington] The Diplomatic Policy Discussion Conference warned President Roosevelt today that if the United States, regardless of other countries, unilaterally implements the Neutrality Act, it will promote the Japanese Navy's blockade of Chinese seaports, and US-Japan relations will inevitably fall into serious danger. The meeting also stated that Japan can already supply its own military supplies, but China's resistance to Japanese aggression still relies on foreign supplies. The implementation of the Neutrality Act by the United States will inevitably greatly hit China, but Japan will still find ways to prevent American military supplies from entering China. If so, China will only be able to import military supplies from Siberia and Vietnam. As far as morality is concerned, if the United States implements the Neutrality Act, it is tantamount to the US government cutting off China's access to the US market when China is invaded by foreign enemies. The only solution for now is for the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to act in concert with the Soviet Union to ban the supply of military supplies to Japan. This move can, on the one hand, avoid the United States from taking responsible actions for the situation in the Far East, and on the other hand, make the war that endangers the world end quickly.

### Shanghai Circles' Campaign to Solicit National Salvation Bonds

The General Assembly Has Been Officially Established; Copper and Tin Industries Successfully Raised Their Allotment

Various Solicitation Teams Formed

The National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee General Assembly has been officially established at No. 70 Avenue Doumer, this city. Solicitation efforts from all circles in Shanghai and various provinces, cities, and counties are proceeding enthusiastically. To expedite and facilitate solicitation work, various circles in Shanghai will organize different solicitation teams. It is understood that various sectors of the Shanghai business community, under the leadership of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will organize the Shanghai Municipal Business Community Solicitation Headquarters, with Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, serving as the commander. Individual trade associations will organize solicitation sub-teams. Citizens will form another organization, the Shanghai Municipal Citizens Solicitation Headquarters, led by Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association. The academic community will organize the Shanghai Academic Community Solicitation Headquarters, led by Li Zhaoshu, President of Jiaotong University. Other sectors are also actively organizing. Each municipality (special municipality) will organize solicitation branches, and each county (ordinary county) will organize solicitation sub-branches. Chen Lifu, Vice Chairman of the General Assembly, yesterday sent a telegram to Shanghai expressing great concern for the solicitation efforts and offering suggestions. It is also understood that the organization of the General Assembly is now complete, and all parties are enthusiastically supporting it. Payments have already been made in recent days, so the association's donation procedures and methods have been formulated, and collection will begin immediately.

Chamber of Commerce Discusses Methods

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce considers the solicitation of national salvation bonds to be a matter of utmost urgency. A standing committee meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss implementation methods. It was resolved that the Chamber should establish the Shanghai Municipal Business Community Solicitation Headquarters for National Salvation Bonds, with the chairman of the committee as the commander, standing committee members as deputy commanders, and all executive and supervisory committee members as team members. In addition, each trade association will organize its own industry solicitation sub-team, with the chairman of each trade association as the sub-team leader, standing committee members as deputy sub-team leaders, and all executive and supervisory committee members as sub-team members. The solicitation amount will be based on the principle of capital and bond commission. Detailed methods will be decided at a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees.

Achievements of the Copper and Tin Industries

Since receiving a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce instructing it to actively raise funds for national salvation donations, the Shanghai Copper and Tin Trade Association has conducted separate solicitations. A total of 31 members have raised 2,260 yuan, which has been submitted to the Bank of China. The association believes that sustained resistance requires a steady supply of funds, so it will continue to solicit donations monthly.

Solicitation by the Municipal Federation

The First Special District Citizens Federation of this city states that since the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee General Assembly has begun operations in Shanghai and the bond is scheduled to be officially issued on September 1st, all citizens should actively purchase it to strengthen the forces of resistance and fulfill their national duty. The association's wartime service committee has decided to lead district branches in carrying out a 'Solicitation of National Salvation Bonds' campaign, starting with publicity before implementing solicitation to achieve significant results.

Annual Interest Rate Changed to Four Percent

According to a message from the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee General Assembly yesterday, the national salvation bond originally had no interest. It was later revised to an annual interest rate of two percent. In view of the enthusiastic subscription by the general public, it has been further revised to an annual interest rate of four percent.

### New Games Association Suggests School Opening Methods for This City

Letter to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to Coordinate Implementation; Schools Housing Refugees Limited to Five Days to Conclude

The New Games Association, in view of the fact that a comprehensive united front has begun and that educational work is extremely important, notes that this city has a dense population and is the national cultural center. Even at the front, educational endeavors cannot be halted. Now is the time to open schools, and the enrollment situation of students should be coordinated. Yesterday (the 27th), the association made suggestions to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to coordinate the opening methods of public and private schools in the city so that the studies of tens of thousands of students would not be wasted. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Public and private schools in the city and special districts should contact each other and find safer locations to merge and open schools. (2) Class time should be appropriately reduced, with a maximum of six hours per day per class, but the usage time of classrooms should be increased. From 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM, classes should be rotated, so that one school building can be used by students from three schools. (3) Salaries for teachers, staff, and school workers should be suspended uniformly, with only food provided, to demonstrate the spirit of shared national hardship. (4) Fees for tuition and miscellaneous items should be canceled uniformly, with only a minimum maintenance fee and room and board fee charged to reduce the burden on students and allow more students from families facing economic difficulties due to the war to continue their studies. (5) In addition to regular curriculum, wartime knowledge of all kinds should be added. (6) Students, in addition to study time, should be organized to serve in various wartime works.

The Municipal Relief Committee, due to the insufficient number of shelters for refugees, previously sent a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs ordering all schools to suspend classes during the war to house refugees. Seventy to eighty schools in Shanghai's urban areas have been converted into shelters. Now, as the long-term resistance has become a trend, the committee believes that all schools should reopen one after another to continue educational endeavors. Yesterday, it ordered all schools to conclude operations of established shelters within five days and transfer them to school authorities to handle school opening matters. The refugees in the shelters, except for those who have been sent away in batches, will be transferred to other shelters. The work of sending refugees away must be completed in the shortest possible time, at least half of them must be sent out of the city, so as not to deplete food supplies and to free up resources to handle long-term relief.

### Security Tightened in Both Settlements

French Concession Southern Area Defenses Increased; 200 American Troops Arrive by Ship

After two battalions of French marines came to Shanghai to be stationed a few days ago, the French barracks in Gujiazhai were insufficient to house them. Now, the Zhongfa School on Ningbo Road and the Lagenna Small School on Lagenna Road have been found as residences for the soldiers. Yesterday, they were ordered to transfer to the east and west districts and the Bund on Avenue Edward VII for rotation guards. This morning, the French Concession's defenses were particularly strengthened. The iron gates connecting the Chinese areas were opened for about two hours in the morning and then tightly closed, cutting off traffic from the Chinese areas to the concession. Defenses were also reinforced at the intersection of Minthani Yin Road and Baxianqiao, in front of the Slaughtering Company, and at various cross streets on Avenue Edward VII. Defense soldiers, detectives, and armored vehicles patrolled to maintain local security.

All key points in the Zhaojiaodu area of western Shanghai are guarded by British troops. The iron gates of the foreign bridge on Zhongshan Road have been closed, cutting off north-south traffic. At the intersections of Wujiaochang, Kangnaot Road, Xinkang Lane, and Defeng Road, British troops have stacked sandbags high and guarded day and night. The Jing'an Temple Police Station has also dispatched Western and Indian detectives to patrol the areas beyond the boundary road. Most of the shops have opened, and the area is still peaceful.

Yesterday, about 200 more American Marines arrived in Shanghai from Little Luzon on the USS Gold Star. The ship also carried a large number of munitions and provisions.

Actions of a Few Individuals Cannot Represent the Whole

Recently, Russian and Western newspapers in this city have reported on the activities of White Russian émigrés. A letter has been received from the Shanghai White Russian Émigré Joint Organization stating that 'White Russians residing in various countries are law-abiding and never interfere in the affairs of other countries. However, due to the pressure of life, a few Russian émigrés in this city inevitably participate in Chinese-Japanese work, but this is the action of a few Russian émigrés and does not represent the intention of the whole. The whole Russian émigré community cannot be held responsible for it.'

### The Enemy Uses All Their Strength to Relentlessly Assault Luodian Again

Attacked at Dawn, Blood Battle for Five Hours Repulsed; Enemy Troops in Zhanghuabang Repeatedly Counterattack, Failed; Artillery Battle at Wusong Estuary Fierce, Ceaseless Throughout the Night

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy's landing troops have designated the area around Wusong, Yunzaobang, and Zhanghuabang as one sector, and the area around Shizilin, Xiaochuansha, Luodian, and Liuhe as another sector. In the Wusong sector, after our army's bloody battle, the enemy suffered countless casualties and retreated in disarray along the coast. Only a thousand or so enemy remnants stubbornly resisted, surrounded by our forces, with no possibility of breaking through. Without special changes, this route should not be a problem. As for the enemy landing in the Shizilin sector, they have greater strength and are the main force of the enemy troops. They have been concentrating artillery fire to relentlessly assault Luodian Town. Our army initially supported with thin defense forces and did their utmost to resist. Once the large supporting troops arrived, a full-scale counterattack was launched, and a bloody battle raged for 48 hours. As of 12:00 AM last night, Luodian Town remained in the hands of our army. This morning at dawn, the enemy launched another full-scale counterattack with all their strength, aided by dozens of planes, tanks, heavy artillery, etc. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. Our army bravely resisted, fighting fiercely. After a bloody battle of five hours, the enemy was finally repulsed. As of this afternoon, Luodian Town is still defended by our army.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The reporter on the Luodian battlefield reports that the battle situation in Luodian has been fierce in recent days, setting a new record for the Shanghai battle. Over two-thirds of Luodian Town has been subjected to artillery fire, a scorched earth, a terrible sight. The enemy uses planes and heavy artillery to cover their operations, so they always launch a general attack at dawn, while our army attacks at night, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, launching a full-scale assault, so the enemy has suffered countless casualties from our night attacks. Fierce battles have erupted north of Luodian, in places such as Mumuqiao Town, and Shenjiaqiao. Our army's morale is high, and everyone is fighting tenaciously. The enemy's soldiers lack the will to fight and rely only on the precision of their weapons. They will definitely not succeed.

The intensity of the bloody battle near Zhanghuabang and Luodian has been unprecedented since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. According to those returning from the front, our soldiers have been fighting bravely for more than two days and nights without sleep or food. The sacrifice is also unprecedented. Due to inconvenient transportation and intense artillery fire, the wounded are lying on the ground without rescue. We sincerely hope that all circles pay attention to this and urgently seek rescue, so that the brave men can recover as soon as possible and return to the front line to kill the enemy.

Central News Agency: The enemy on the Zhanghuabang side continues to land reinforcements and has launched counterattacks several times since last night (the 28th). Our army bravely fought head-on, and the enemy did not succeed.

Central News Agency: From last night to this morning, the enemy ships docked at the Wusong estuary have been shelling us, and our side has also returned fire with heavy artillery. The sound of artillery fire has been continuous throughout the night.

### Northwest of Luodian Face-to-Face Across the River

Enemy Troops in Xiaochuansha Have Deployed Heavy Artillery on Land

Central News Agency: The enemy near Shengqiao, Mumuqiao Town, Chenjiahang, and Liuhe, under the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft, has repeatedly counterattacked our army's positions. After our army bravely attacked, they advanced and retreated repeatedly. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and our side also suffered huge casualties. As of this morning, the two sides are facing each other across a small river about four miles northwest of Luodian. It is reported that the enemy in Xiaochuansha has deployed heavy artillery on land, attempting to cover the enemy's advance.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) This newspaper's reporter met many refugees fleeing Shanghai from Luodian this morning. They said that after the enemy's surprise landing there, and with the help of traitors who opened the gates to the enemy, the townspeople had no way to escape, and many were brutally killed. After several days and nights of fierce fighting, about three-quarters of the town's houses have been destroyed. The 2,000 or so people who escaped had to walk over a hundred miles day and night to safely reach Shanghai. It is now reported that the enemy has been driven back to the vicinity of the coast by our army, but there are still many refugees hiding in various places. Efforts have begun to concentrate them in areas with convenient transportation, and then use cars to transport them to Shanghai for shelter. Everyone sighed with emotion when speaking.

### Our Army Adheres to the Principle of Bloody Battle

Luring the Enemy Deep to Encircle and Annihilate; Abundant Military Strength, Enough to Fight

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Enemy ships are gathering at various ports along our rivers and coasts, firing artillery harassment at any time, making a show of force, dispersing our garrison forces, and concentrating on attacking a certain location to attempt a landing. After our army's head-on attack in recent days, the enemy's landing reinforcements are continuously increasing. According to reliable sources, in addition to the landing troops, there is still a division's worth of enemy troops providing support at sea. Our army adheres to the principle of luring the enemy deep, encircling and annihilating them. Troops in various locations are responding calmly, with abundant military strength, enough to fight.

### This Newspaper's Reporter Inspects the War Zone

The Enemy Uses Shidongkou as a Conduit for Landing; Uses Fishermen Familiar with Ports and Rivers as Guides

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) This newspaper's reporter drove to the front line at 3:00 AM this morning, passing through Zhenru, Yangjiaqiao, Dachang, and ending ten miles from Luodian Town. They returned along the original route at dawn. The journey was very fast, and everything seen along the way was very desolate. They deeply grieved the inhumanity of the Japanese air force to this extent. Now, the reporter will roughly record what was seen. (1) According to a military officer, the enemy's landing this time used Shidongkou (i.e., Xiaochuanshakou) as a conduit. In the past four or five days, when the tide has surged, during the small flood tide, the water in Shidongkou was about three or four miles from the shore, making it more difficult for the enemy to land. Recently, with the flood tide, the water and shore are connected, making it extremely convenient for sand boats to dock. Shidong has 140 fishing boats docked in ordinary times. These fishermen are very familiar with the land and water transportation along the river, but their level of knowledge is very shallow. After the outbreak of the war, they were incited by local traitors, and the enemy maintained their livelihood, so all the fishing boats were used to support the enemy. The enemy in Shidongkou, firstly, took advantage of the flood tide opportunity, and secondly, used fishermen familiar with the geography of the port and river as guides, so the landing was more convenient than in other ports. Moreover, Shidong has many small ports. The front of the port is defended by our heavy troops, while the enemy operates to the left and right of the small port. (2) The enemy once occupied Luodian Town, but after our army's overnight attack, they retreated in disarray along the river. As of now, Luodian is still defended by our army. (3) In the Shengjiaqiao area north of Luodian, the villagers, seeing that our defending soldiers were loyal, brave, and sacrificing for the country, automatically sent food and drink to the front line to comfort them. The local traitors expressed great dissatisfaction and set fire to it. Within one day, the entire village was gone. (4) On the way, the reporter encountered more than ten refugees from Jiading, carrying books and coming to Shanghai. They said that Jiading had been bombed by enemy planes many times, and although the losses were great, they were not as serious as the rumors. They saw that the bombing of Nanxiang was the most tragic. They saw no complete buildings, only debris and no livestock. (5) Refugees from Huangdu said that the town mayor, Dai Di, was shot by the garrison troops two days ago. Evidence of communication with the enemy and wireless telegraph equipment were found in the town mayor's home. Afterwards, the whole family fled overnight, and their house was destroyed by neighbors.

### Enemy Attempts to Land in Nanhui

Central News Agency: After the enemy troops once landed on the coast of Nanhui County a few days ago, they were surrounded and annihilated by our army and have not dared to commit the crime again. Now it is learned that several enemy ships and several small boats have been found at Dengjia Pier in Nanhui County, with a look of attempting to land. Our army has been strictly vigilant.

### Quiet War News in Hongkou Districts

Artillery Fire Very Intense Near the Beijing-Shanghai Road; Hongkou Police Stations Report Peace

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the center of the war in this city shifted to the Wusong area, the war news in various parts of Hongkou has gradually subsided. There has been no major action from either our side or the enemy. According to a report from the Public Works Department, the news about Hongkou is recorded as follows: From 5:00 AM to 6:00 AM on the 28th, the Hongkou Police Station, the Qushan Police Station, the Qianglin Road Police Station, the Yangshupu Police Station, the Qiwuyong Road Police Station, the Eastern District Rear Guard, and the Huade Road Prison all reported that everything was peaceful. The water company branch also had the same report. At 8:00 AM on the 28th, as of 9:00 AM, the artillery fire near Beijing-Shanghai Road in western Zhabei was very intense, with one to three shots per minute.

### Enemy Planes Strafing Nanshi Civilians

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) This morning, as soon as dawn broke, enemy planes appeared in the sky over Nanshi, circling and reconnoitering, without any interruption. The number of planes gradually increased to eleven, with constant rumbling noises. Around 8:00 AM, at the Minsheng Company's North Pier near the Seventh Pier in the Bund, there were about 40 porters carrying goods. Enemy planes used machine guns to strafe them. Fortunately, the workers managed to dodge in time, and no one was injured. As of the time of publication, the enemy planes have not yet left.

### Two Steamships, Shenfu and Longshan, Head to Ningbo

The Ningbo Compatriots Association is sending Shanghai refugees back to Ningbo. In recent days, over 40,000 people have been sent. Four ships have now been chartered for continuous transportation. Today, the steamships Shenfu and Longshan are scheduled. These two steamships arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo this morning, so they were able to enter the port as usual.

Inside the ships, Chinese and Western medical rooms have been added so that sick refugees can receive treatment at any time.

### British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's Condition is Improving

His Wife and Son Arrive in Shanghai by Plane This Morning; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Sends a Letter of Condolence

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, was traveling by car from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday when he was strafed by Japanese aircraft and injured. He is receiving treatment at the Hongen Hospital. The condition of the British Ambassador is of great concern to Chinese and foreigners alike. This morning, a reporter from this newspaper visited the Hongen Hospital. According to the British doctor at the hospital, the British Ambassador's condition last night was very good, and he had several hours of restful sleep. His condition this morning remains good. There should be no special changes in the short term. The hospital issued the following public announcement about the British Ambassador's condition at 8:00 AM this morning: "The British Ambassador had a satisfactory night and had several hours of restful sleep. His condition this morning remains good."

His Wife and Son Arrive in Shanghai This Morning

According to the Shenshi News Agency, the injuries of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen are of great concern to all parties. The Ambassador's wife and son accompanied him to Beidaihe for summer vacation a month ago and originally planned to return south with the Ambassador after the autumn coolness. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Ambassador has been traveling south to strive for peace. His wife and son did not accompany him. After the unfortunate incident, the British Consulate in Shanghai telegraphed them to return south that night. After receiving the telegram, the Ambassador's wife immediately took a specially prepared plane to a certain location and then transferred to Shanghai this morning. At around 8:00 AM, they went to the Hongen Hospital to visit her husband. There have been no changes in Sir Hughe's condition this morning. According to doctors, it has now been over 36 hours, and there should be no further danger. However, due to his weakness, surgery has not yet been performed, and the bullet has not been removed. The hospital released the following announcement this morning: "The Ambassador had a good night, slept very comfortably, and his condition is even better this morning."

Madame Chiang Kai-shek Sends a Letter of Condolence

Director Yu then took Madame Chiang's letter to the Hongen Hospital this morning and delivered it to the British Ambassador.

Organizations and Individuals Send Condolences

According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai sent a letter to the British Consul General this morning, representing the million citizens of the First Special District, to express condolences to the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. The original letter stated: "To His Excellency the Consul General, the Japanese military's brutality in indiscriminately bombing and strafing with machine guns, causing injury to Your Excellency's Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, has aroused indignation around the world. This Federation is especially deeply concerned. We hereby represent the million citizens of the entire district in sincerely expressing our condolences to the Ambassador. We respectfully request that you forward this message and wish the Ambassador a speedy recovery. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai."

Zhang Ming, the former Special Envoy of Nepal, came to Shanghai to express condolences to British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. When interviewed by reporters, he said that he was extremely concerned and expressed regret and sincere sympathy for the unfortunate shooting of Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft. He made a special trip to the hospital to offer condolences, as Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is an old friend of Mr. Zhang's in England. He also hoped that Japan would pay attention to humanitarianism and not strafe non-military personnel and refugees outside the war zone with machine guns, exposing barbaric behavior to the world, which he deeply hates, he said. Mr. Zhang will go to Guangzhou in a day or two, he said.

### Britain Decides on Measures to Take Regarding the Japanese Aircraft Bombing of the British Ambassador

British Ambassador to Japan Suspends Taking Office

[London] After consulting with Prime Minister Chamberlain in Scotland by telephone, British Foreign Secretary Eden decided today on the measures to take regarding the injury of British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. Although the specific steps are not yet determined, it is understood that the proposed measures are not limited to protests. The British rejected the Japanese claim that the British Ambassador should have notified the Japanese military authorities before departure, arguing that there was no indication that the road would be bombed at the time. The British government does not pay much attention to the Japanese fleet's blockade of the Chinese coast, as the Japanese announcement on this matter has stated that it will not interfere with foreign navigation. Today, many representatives of various countries stationed in England went to the British Foreign Office to express condolences for the injury of Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi personally delivered the Chinese government's letter of condolence and hoped that the British Ambassador would recover soon. Eden has now instructed the British Embassy in Nanjing to thank the Chinese government. Japanese Ambassador Shigeru Yoshida also went to the Foreign Office and left after half an hour. Many photographers took pictures of him as he got into the car. Representatives from countries such as the Soviet Union, France, and Germany also came to express their condolences. After receiving a telegram from the US Secretary of State, Eden replied to express his thanks. Although British newspapers criticized the bombing of the British Ambassador cautiously, they ultimately revealed an unusually angry mood. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters)

[London] British newly appointed ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, who is going to Japan to take office, is still en route. It has been heard that the Foreign Office has already instructed Craigie to suspend his advance, but this news has not yet been confirmed. Regarding the case of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, being injured by Japanese aircraft, the Japanese side said that the Japanese military authorities mistook the car carrying the Ambassador for the car of a senior Chinese administrative official and attacked it. However, British political and diplomatic circles do not consider this explanation satisfactory and are still extremely angry. They said that since Japan maintains diplomatic relations with China, it is unacceptable to attack senior Chinese administrative officials. Therefore, the arguments put forward by the Japanese side cannot be regarded as valid. These people also said that Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen went to Shanghai to meet with Japanese Ambassador to China Shigeru Kawagoe to discuss adjusting the conflict between China and Japan and protecting ordinary people. Unexpectedly, he was injured by Japanese aircraft en route. (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas)

### The Enemy Further Blocks Industry

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to reliable sources, after blockading our sea ports, the enemy has now taken a further step and notified the Shanghai Consular Corps, roughly stating that after the implementation of the blockade policy, there is concern that ships will change flags of various countries and still try to sail to various places. If there is a change of flag, the countries must prove that there is a relationship of transfer of property rights before they are allowed to change the flag. Real estate, buildings, docks, and warehouses must also have the above-mentioned situation before they are allowed to change the flag. Otherwise, effective measures must still be taken.

### The United States Sends Notes to China and Japan to Respect American Interests

Responsibility Must Be Taken for Losses Caused by War

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull announced today that the US government has sent notes to China and Japan, requesting that all American rights and interests in the Far East be respected and that responsibility must be taken for any losses suffered by American assets or people due to the war. Hull also said that according to information he received from the Far East, Japan does not intend to interfere with foreign shipping when blockading the Chinese coast. The US government believes that it has now received official information from Japan about the blockade of the Chinese coast, but on the one hand, it is still collecting facts about the impact of the blockade. Some say that Hull's note to China and Japan shows that the United States has no intention of withdrawing from the Far East and that the public believes that the United States' international peace policy will not be changed by the current situation. The United States' maintenance of its position in the Far East is precisely to maintain its good standing and to continue its advocacy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters)

### Over a Hundred American Women and Children Continue to Leave Shanghai

According to the Central News Agency, at 10:00 AM today (the 28th), another group of over a hundred American women and children living in Shanghai boarded a small boat at the New Customs Wharf to sail to Songkou, where they transferred to the President Lincoln, a steamship of the Dollar Steamship Company, to go to Hong Kong and then to Manila.

He first described in detail the situation of his trip to Nanjing and discussed the efforts that Yunnan Province should make in the future. They did not disperse until 12:00 AM. Long Yun told reporters that this time he was summoned to Nanjing to discuss major plans, and the leaders of all parties gathered together in sincerity and unity to overcome the national crisis, which has been manifested in fact. He witnessed the actual situation of the air battle in Nanjing and felt that the enemy's machinery, equipment, and technology were not as good as ours. At a time when the whole country is mobilizing to fight for the survival of the nation, all citizens have a good opportunity to dedicate themselves to serving the country. Now, we should examine the manpower and material resources of our province and contribute as much as possible to the country. The warm-blooded men and loyal and brave soldiers of Yunnan will be able to fight the national crisis in an organized and powerful manner. Final victory will surely belong to us. He repeatedly visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing and was repeatedly visited by him. He was deeply moved by the greatness of the leader's personality and the sincerity of his love. Chairman Chiang's health has fully recovered and his will is firm. With such a great leader leading our country and people, we will surely achieve final victory, he said.

### Japanese Merchants in Hong Kong End Business and Return to Their Country

[Hong Kong] Many Japanese merchants in Hong Kong have voluntarily ended their businesses and left Hong Kong to return to their country (Central News Agency, 27th dispatch).

### Two Traitors Beaten to Death on Route Tenant de Bail

According to Shenzhou News Agency, at around 12:00 PM yesterday, two traitors carrying two hand grenades were acting suspiciously on Route Tenant de Bail. They were bravely captured by passers-by and beaten to death on the spot. Later, British soldiers called for an ambulance to take the bodies away. According to nearby residents, the two traitors were employees of the Gongda Yarn Factory. They secretly carried out their work while our police were maintaining law and order, so they were not detected by the residents. However, yesterday, since there were no longer any police officers stationed in the area, they revealed their ferocious faces. One person was holding a grenade, threatening our people, while the other was surveying and mapping. Judging from the actions of these two people, the Japanese may have a conspiracy in sealing off the western part of Shanghai.

### Chamber of Commerce Announces Prevention of Military Materials from Aiding the Enemy

Our chamber has resolved to notify the relevant trade associations and banking associations that in the future, when withdrawing goods from various banks and warehouses, the respective trade associations should request our chamber to issue a certificate before withdrawal is permitted. This is for the record. In addition to sending letters to the hardware, electrical appliance, rubber and hardware materials, banking, and money industries, a record letter is sent for reference. We hope that your association will investigate and notify your members to comply accordingly."

Now, we have received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that henceforth, all flocks (i.e., cotton wadding removed from worn-out cotton quilts and cotton clothes) should also be prohibited from re-export to various parts of the country. We shall immediately comply accordingly. This is to inform all merchants. Superintendent Zhu Changnian, Customs Commissioner Luo Fude."

### Brief Comments

— Xiang

In recent days, the war situation in Shanghai has changed dramatically. The Japanese, seeing that relying on the concessions to carry out combat plans is very damaging and cannot be developed, and that stopping the army in a corner will gradually reduce their strength, have used aircraft and artillery as cover after reinforcements arrived, and are planning to land along the river and coast in order to find a way out. Therefore, the focus of the war has expanded outward. Our army should gradually reduce it with a special strategy.

Regarding the injury of the British Ambassador, there were originally two views. One view is that this is an extremely serious incident that cannot be resolved with ordinary apologies for a tragic accident. The other view is that this is not a serious incident and can be resolved as an "unintentional accidental event." It is not known how the British authorities view it. There will inevitably be an expression of it soon.

### Urgent Issues in Transportation This Month (3)

— Rui Ling

⑦ It is essential to make full use of the transportation convenience provided by the Yangtze River and its tributaries. In addition to large steamships, we should pay more attention to small steamships, tugboats, and various types of sailboats. Regarding small steamships and tugboats, we hope to be able to manufacture them ourselves during wartime. Therefore, the Jiangnan Shipyard and the Mawei Shipyard should be moved to suitable locations upstream of the Yangtze River as soon as possible. If they remain in Shanghai and Fuzhou, they are likely to become the best targets for the Japanese navy and air force! Sailboats still occupy a very important position in inland river transportation in China. We especially need to make use of them during wartime. However, first, they are too scattered and lack organization; second, they rely entirely on the weather. They can travel easily with the wind and current, but they can hardly move against the wind and current, and there is too little time accuracy. The remedy is to make full use of small steamships and tugboats to carry out towing. Each small steamship or tugboat can tow five or six sailboats. This way, the calculation of the voyage can be more accurate. At the same time, all sailboats in the country should be registered, their routes and freight rates should be specified, and the standard style of newly built sailboats in the future should be determined. This will reduce many difficulties for the government to requisition them. Therefore, what we now hope from the navigation authorities is: first, to move the shipyards to safe areas immediately; second, to expand the manufacturing of small steamships and tugboats for inland rivers, and if motors and other parts required for these small steamships, etc., need to be ordered from foreign countries, they should be done as soon as possible; third, to count the distribution and transportation capacity of all large and small steamboats in the country; fourth, to register, organize, and control sailboats immediately to assist wartime transportation.

⑧ From the point of view of national defense, there are several necessary principles for the construction of railways: first, all lines should be interconnected to form a network, so that they can communicate with each other. For example, the Ping-Sui Railway is a dead end. After Beiping is cut off, the Ping-Sui Railway has no way out and cannot communicate with other lines. From the point of view of transportation and national defense, this is a very unfavorable fact. Therefore, the lines should be interconnected as much as possible, so that if this intersection is bombed, that intersection can still communicate, and if this end is cut off, that end can still communicate. In this way, vehicles can be operated freely, and transportation will not be cut off horizontally. Second, the construction of lines should gradually extend outward from the center point, not from the outside to the inside, so that their own interconnections are

⑩ In terms of land routes, we should open up international transportation routes, because after the outbreak of war, the coast will be surrounded by enemy ships, and we will be in danger of being blockaded! After the opening of the Yue-Han Railway, we can reach Hong Kong directly via Kowloon, which may not be a vital route for communication with overseas countries in the early stages of the war, but this is not very reliable, because if a certain country is determined to act recklessly, its navy can blockade south of Hong Kong and east of Singapore, and the United Kingdom may not turn against this reckless actor! As a result, although Hong Kong may still have foreign merchant ships coming and going, many of the things we need to import may not be able to be imported through Hong Kong because they are subject to inspection by enemy ships. Therefore, in terms of land routes, we must open up international transportation routes. We can open up four routes to the outside world: ⑴ from Guangxi to Annam, ⑵ from Yunnan to Myanmar, ⑶ from Yunnan to Annam, and ⑷ from the Northwest to the Soviet Union. However, since our rear center of gravity is in the Southwest, there are many geographical difficulties in the transportation routes to the Soviet Union, and in fact, they are too far apart, so it is still more realistic to focus on communication with British Burma and French Annam. The shortest route is to use the completed Xiang-Gui Highway, which passes through Zhennanguan on the border between Guangxi and Annam, and reorganize it. Secondly, there is already the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Annam to Kunming, and there is also the Yunnan-Nanjing Highway from Yunnan to Nanjing, which can also be connected to Annam, but the Yunnan-Nanjing Highway needs a lot of reorganization or straightening. Thirdly, the most difficult and relatively important route is to build a highway from Kunming, Yunnan to the border of Myanmar, connect it to the railway in Myanmar, and then use the Yunnan-Nanjing Highway to connect to various parts of the country. Any of these railroad construction are not in line with our feelings of poverty, nor does the passing time allow. We should give immediate and practical plans for the construction and improvement of highways and start construction immediately, which will surely have great benefits for national defense.

⑩ ⑴ Regarding air defense and security, we do not know what the content is. Standing in the position of the people, we should not ask what it is, because this belongs to military secrets. However, railways and rivers are the best guides for enemy planes to fly and will not be strong on the outside and weak on the inside. The so-called center point is the military and economic base. When we open the map of each country, we can often see that its military and political center is its transportation center. The lines radiate in all directions. In the Qing Dynasty, China was centered on Beiping. The Bei-Ning, Ping-Sui, and Ping-Han railways all started from Beiping. The Jin-Pu Railway can also be said to have started indirectly from Beiping. From the establishment of the Republic of China to the present, especially after the September 18th Incident, due to the changes in the political and external situation in North China, the weakness of the coastal defense forces, the superiority of the terrain in the Southwest, the abundance of mineral resources, the large population, and the considerable development of economic power, everyone believes that the Southwest is the final base for national defense. In particular, Hunan should be the center of the southwestern railway system. However, in terms of completed railways, there were more outside the pass than inside the pass in the past, more in North China than in South China, and more along the coast than inland, forming a situation that was strong on the outside and weak on the inside. Each step we retreat militarily increases many difficulties for us. When the enemy occupies a place, they can get many transportation conveniences. This is a very unsound phenomenon. Third, we are very poor, and at the same time, we urgently need railways. Therefore, we should use the most economical methods to build more new lines. If we use the same amount of money to build a perfect railway, we can only build 100 kilometers, but if we build a less perfect railway, we can build 130 kilometers. Therefore, as long as we can cope with the traffic, we still take the approach of building more rather than building perfectly, because the impact on national defense is far greater for a longer railway line, even if it is not perfect, than for a shorter, perfect railway line. Based on these principles, in a very urgent situation, we should still immediately complete the Jing-Gui Railway so that it can connect with the Zhe-Gan Railway, and immediately complete the Nanping section of the Zhe-Gan Railway so that it can connect with the Yue-Han Railway. This can increase many conveniences in the military field. Secondly, if we really still have money and time to build the Chao-Mei, Pu-Xin, and Qiong-Nan Island railways, we should choose more important railways to build. If we really have money to improve the completed railways (the Ministry of Railways and various railways have published such plans), except for the most necessary projects to maintain the status quo, we can move this money to the construction of new roads. The Bei-Ning and Ping-Sui railways previously planned some projects, such as the rerouting of the Ping-Sui Railway and the reconstruction of the Yeh River Bridge on the Bei-Ning Railway, and the Jiao-Ji Railway also planned many projects to improve the railway. I think this is probably what our "friendly country" would most welcome, but we dare not approve of it.

### 鄭州漢奸失却保障

Famous traitor Luo Fasen and others arrested; more than a hundred traitors also caught in Yancheng

Zhengzhou Correspondence: After Sasaki Takayoshi, the Japanese consul stationed in Zhengzhou, led four members of the consulate away from Zhengzhou, Luo Fasen and other important traitors in Zhengzhou who helped the Japanese carry out espionage activities, endanger the local area, and betray the country, are all related to the previously uncovered Japanese spy agency and other various conspiracies of traitors. Luo was arrested before the Japanese consulate personnel left Zhengzhou, and it is rumored that he has been executed. Other traitors such as Ruan Jinxiang, Bai Deyuan, Li Yongxiang, and Tong Changyun were also arrested. At the same time, many suspected traitors were also arrested and are being interrogated separately. In addition, traitor Zhang Jinsheng has also recently been arrested. Generally, traitors in Zhengzhou currently have no protection and have lost contact, and it is expected that there will be no other actions, and there should be no problems with public security. In addition, in Yancheng County, traitors were found spreading poison at the beginning of this month, and several residents were victimized. On the 10th, many traitors colluded with rioters to destroy military vehicles at the train station. The garrison imposed martial law and searched, and as a result, more than a hundred traitors were captured. On the 11th, they were all sent to Bian for punishment. A rope-bound bomb was found on the Heqiao bridge in Minquan County, and one traitor has been arrested and is being searched for.

### Jiading Captures Japanese Spies

Enemy ships forcibly seize civilian boats in Liuhe Yanglin; a traitor posing in military uniform arrested in Nanxiang

Jiading Correspondence: Enemy planes come and go incessantly at Liuhe, Yanglin, and other ports. Many enemy ships are docked outside the port, seizing many civilian boats, hoping to take the opportunity to sneak ashore. We have paid close attention.

Recently, enemy planes came to harass Nanxiang. Over the past three days, they have dropped bombs five or six times, a total of more than fifty. Sulfur bombs burned down 17 storefronts, including Daqingguan and Xinwujiaguan, at the Hengjie intersection of Nandajie, and dozens of houses. The Zhugonghe sauce garden south of the Bazhi Bridge was bombed, collapsing the house into the river, blocking the waterway. The Hentang Lane and the bamboo shops along the river in the North Market were also bombed, collapsing houses. More than 30 people were killed or injured in the town. At 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, sulfur bombs were dropped again, burning until 5:00 p.m. A bomb was dropped west of Houhuang Bridge outside the West Gate, but there was little damage. Enemy planes flew low over the city and strafed with machine guns once, killing a maid named Ge at Sixiantang.

A native of Nantou Township in Taicang saw a person with a short stature walking strangely. When asked, the person remained silent, so they were arrested and sent to the Waigang Police Station of the county, and then escorted to the county government on the 20th. At first, they remained silent and refused to confess. After strict interrogation, they admitted in Japanese that they were Japanese, came to the mainland as a spy, and dozens of people came on the same boat, scattered in the mainland. Magistrate Guo immediately prepared a document and sent them to the front-line headquarters for punishment.

Five traitors wearing military uniforms were captured in Nanxiang. At first, they looked like military officers, coming and going without any suspicion. Later, they were seen by our military officers, who found that they had no symbols, so they were arrested and sent to the headquarters for execution. In addition, a villager from Jianbin Bridge captured a man from Jiangbei in his forties, who claimed to be Feng Weizhang from Jiangyin, with five large copper coins worth twenty each in his possession. In addition, an old woman was captured in Luodian, with a thousand-year-old safflower in her possession and silk threads hanging from her girdle. When asked about her origin and destination, she gave evasive answers. All were sent to the county on the 21st for investigation.

### Efforts by All Sectors to Carry Out Relief for Refugees and Send Them Back to Their Hometowns

Municipal Relief Committee adds shelters; hometown associations find ways to send refugees back

After the outbreak of the Songhu War, there were more than 100,000 refugees from Zhabei, Jiangwan, Pudong, Hongkou, and Yangshupu. They are currently being taken in by the Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee, the joint disaster relief association of various charitable organizations, and various hometown associations, which have set up shelters separately, and are being sent back to their hometowns in order. The recent situation of refugee relief is recorded as follows:

Adding Shelters

The refugees sheltered by the Municipal Relief Committee, apart from some who have been sent back to their hometowns, still number more than 19,000, housed in 37 shelters separately. However, refugees continue to flee from Hongkou and Yangshupu, and are being rescued from danger, in a tragic situation, urgently awaiting relief. However, the existing shelters can no longer accommodate them. The association has set up three additional shelters at the intersection of Avenue Road and Gordon Road, Hengfeng on Marunouchi Road, and Qingliang Pavilion on Sima Road to accommodate them and continue to take them in.

Sending Back to Hometowns

(1) The hometown associations of five counties, including Jiang, Danyang, Jintan, Liyang, and Yangzhou, have registered more than 6,000 people since they began registering fellow villagers to be sent back to their hometowns. Yesterday, the first batch of 1,500 people began to be sent back, and a letter was sent to the disaster relief association of charitable organizations and the refugee relief committee, asking them to forward instructions to the shelters to prepare a list for verification and repatriation. Fellow villagers from the above five counties who wish to return to their hometowns can contact the Xinxing Pharmacy on Baker Road. (2) The Shanghai Hometown Association of Seven Counties in Shaoxing is very active in sending fellow villagers back to their hometowns. Because there are very few Shanghai-Ningbo ships and no fixed schedule, the issuance of ship tickets was temporarily suspended yesterday. The holders of the more than 7,000 ship tickets that have been issued can go to the Jinliyuan Wharf every day to wait for the ship to depart. (3) The Haiyan Shanghai Hometown Association sent more than 200 fellow villagers back to their hometowns the day before yesterday, and another 100 people were sent back yesterday. (4) The Jiangyin Wuxi Hometown Association Joint Relief Association hired the Yongchang Wheel yesterday, towing 13 civilian boats, carrying the eighth batch of 2,200 refugees, led by Wang Jiannan and Xue Xiren back to Wuxi. The association has successively sent a total of 10,000 people back to their hometowns. (5) The Red Swastika Society sent more than 500 refugees from various places to the Suzhou area yesterday. They first gathered at Pintang Lane, and each person was given ten steamed buns. A number of relief team members escorted them to Suzhou by boat. It is heard that after arriving in Suzhou, if the refugees have hometowns that are far away, the Suzhou association will give them money to help them return to their homes safely. (6) The Jiangsu Shanghai Hometown Association has now discussed and decided on measures to send fellow villagers back to their hometowns. Homeless fellow villagers are requested to go to the association at Xinzha Road to register from now on. On the one hand, the committee members will solicit donations from all walks of life and try to send poor fellow villagers back to their homes. (7) The Changshu Shanghai Hometown Association has sent more than 100 fellow villagers back to their hometowns in the past two days. It is heard that the association has set up an office at No. 9 Chengdu Fang, South Chengdu Road, for the convenience of fellow villagers to register and inquire. Changshu fellow villagers who wish to return to their hometowns, please go directly to the association to contact them. (8) Xu Shenru, Shi Shaochu, Xu Yongzuo, and others from the Haining Shanghai Hometown Association launched a campaign to send fellow villagers back to their hometowns. A temporary registration office has been set up in North Xiangfen Lane, and the registration is very enthusiastic. The repatriation expenses are all borne by the initiators. It is heard that they plan to contact the two railway administrations for transportation. (9) The Quanzhang Shanghai Hometown Association has formulated the following repatriation measures: (A) The ships sent by the association will go directly to Quanzhou and Xiamen. Those who wish to go must register with the association. (B) The fare for each person in the first-class cabin is 30 yuan, 15 yuan for the second class, and half price for children. The third class is free of charge. (C) The association will provide meals during the voyage. (D) After this repatriation, the supply of food to the shelters will be stopped. (10) The Changzhou Shanghai Hometown Association has been actively sending fellow villagers back to their hometowns for several days, and has successively sent out more than 5,000 people. Yesterday, the sixth batch hired six civilian boats to transport more than 700 refugees back to their hometowns. They all escaped from Yangshupu and Hongkou, and were in a very miserable situation. The association has no funds and is in great financial difficulty. It is hoped that enthusiastic fellow villagers will donate as much as possible. (11) The Wujiang Shanghai Hometown Association sent more than 100 fellow villagers on the fourth batch the day before yesterday, and continued to send the fifth batch yesterday, with the number also being over one hundred. All were towed to Suzhou by the Municipal Relief Committee, etc., and then transferred to boats back to their hometowns in Suzhou.

Continued Rescue

The Municipal Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees, considering that there are still a small number of refugees trapped in the war zone, unable to enter or exit, specially sent a large number of vehicles to Hongkou and Yangshupu yesterday to rescue them. As of 6:00 p.m., more than 1,000 refugees had been rescued. At the same time, as refugees continue to move into the concessions, all shelters are full. If the war is prolonged, food will become a problem. In addition to the original purpose of establishing refugee hospitals to provide temporary accommodation for refugees in the war zone, the shelters will also start registering those to be sent back to their hometowns from yesterday. As of last night, according to reports from the shelters, there were a total of 11,000,2 people. They are currently negotiating with transportation agencies to send them away separately on a specific date. If there are refugees in Shanghai who have hometown associations, the hometown associations will transport them. It is hoped that all sectors will provide more assistance so that refugees in the war zone can be rescued continuously.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Eighth Broadcast Report

The situation in the concession is easing; food supply increases

The Shanghai Municipal Council's eighth broadcast report said: From now on, the bureau hopes that the public will understand that, as far as the International Settlement is concerned, no news is good news. In the first few days of the outbreak of the war, this broadcast was indeed a necessary measure, so that the public could be quickly informed of the measures that the bureau had taken to protect their interests. However, the current situation has greatly eased. In the past two days, the bureau has been able to issue a more optimistic tone, and today there is more concrete progress. However, what the bureau is concerned about and reports is only the casualties south of the Suzhou Creek within the concession, and it has never described in detail the major military actions, except for occasional mentions. In the future, everything will depend on when and how China and Japan resolve their disputes. However, as far as the International Settlement itself is concerned, the current situation is more relaxed and peaceful than it has been since the beginning of the war, and most importantly, it seems that there is no reason for this situation to worsen. Therefore, the need for this broadcast has decreased, and the time to stop the broadcast is not far away.

The situation on the Huangpu River this morning is said to be much better. If ships can pass more easily to unload goods, without major difficulties or special dangers, then the city will benefit greatly in all respects. In the past ten days, a large amount of food and essential goods have been stored in warehouses in dangerous areas. If these items can be transported to supply daily use, the difficult work undertaken by the committees can be greatly reduced.

We do not want to think that the dangerous period has passed, because the dangerous period has not yet passed, and there are still many far-reaching problems to be dealt with. The committees of the Municipal Council during the emergency period still exist, and are still performing the same work as in the previous two weeks, without any slackness, so the public can rest assured about this. But we are now confident that we can make the most satisfactory report to the public, that is, even if all dangers have not passed, the situation regarding the rapid restoration of the original state is more hopeful than at any time in the previous two weeks or than in the previous three or four days. There are currently 109 refugee shelters open, accommodating 61,022 refugees. These shelters are being built rapidly. The more shelters there are, the better the supervision will be. The number of refugees is not increasing, but decreasing.

Regarding daily affairs, the vegetable markets in the North District have now resumed business, although the current business is not very complete. There are many vegetables, salted vegetables, salted fish, fresh meat, and ham, but the prices are about 25% to 50% higher than usual. The food supply in the markets in the Central District has generally increased, but most of them maintain a "wartime" price. Because of the improvement in the situation in the East District, efforts are now being made to reopen the cold storage plants immediately, and to transport out the stocks that could not be removed in the previous two weeks. The bureau's cold storage plant at the corner of Disuiwei Road and Shajing Road reopened this morning, and the various foods stored in the plant, about 200 tons, are still intact. (August 27)

### A Tour Along the Huangpu River for Ten Li

From the mouth of Suzhou Creek east to Yangshupu along the Huangpu River, there is no doubt that it became the navy's base for the enemy after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. Relying on the cover of the Puxi concessions, they can leisurely transport troops to land. On the Pudong side, there are also many foreign warehouses that help them act as a barrier, blocking the sight of our army. Therefore, Japanese warships dare to recklessly control the traffic on that section of the river. In order to understand the situation on both sides of the Huangpu River under the vigilance of enemy warships, the reporter, through the introduction of a friend, specially took a small steamship of a certain foreign shipping company at 8:00 a.m. today to take a tour there. In the short ten-mile journey, I gained infinite feelings.

The weather was very clear and the climate on the river was very cool. A small steamship, less than ten feet long, left the Bund of the French Concession and headed towards Xiagang, rushing past the fleet of various countries. The ship turned its helm eastward at the mouth of Suzhou Creek. What first came into our view was the Japanese Consulate, which was in an extremely desolate situation. Only a small steamship, whose smokestack had been bombed by our army, was docked at the pier. A large hole, blown open by our air force in front of the consulate, still remains. The facade of the consulate has also suffered considerable damage. Looking inside, it is dark and gloomy, and not even a ghost can be caught. There is no rising-sun flag hanging on top. Everything is like a dead person.

The Hongkou China Merchants Central Warehouse has been occupied by the enemy and used as a major base for stockpiling munitions and food. A small gunboat is docked at the pier. There, we saw many Japanese people going up and down, busily carrying boxes of things. Could they be bullets? The Izumo flagship is also anchored in the center of the river, with the French Yongxing Lime Warehouse in Pudong covering it. It can safely fire at Pudong. Countless sandbags are piled on the deck, and several soldiers are holding binoculars, looking at the sky. This shows that they are fearing the arrival of our air force.

Our boat continued to move forward. In the distance, we saw the roof of the Nanyang Tobacco Factory in Hongkou. Although it still maintains its heroic posture, every window has been burned black. At this time, a passenger pointed and cursed, "××××, they can't beat us, they will only secretly set a fire in the rear!" Even the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong, the Shin Mitsui Warehouse, and the offices on the Pujiang River have been destroyed by artillery fire, leaving only the shells. The British-owned Gonghexiang Warehouse also had many artillery holes blown into it by enemy ships. The Shin Mitsubishi Outer Warehouse has been completely burned down. The very tall warehouses inside are still burning today. This area has clearly undergone a fierce battle. The Pudong China Merchants Huacang has more than ten warehouses lined up along the Pujiang River, all of which have been destroyed by Japanese warships. There are ruins and broken walls here, a desolate scene. From this, we can see that the enemy's fierceness is not in the strength of their combat power, but in their special ability to destroy buildings. As long as it is our factory or our warehouse, they must bomb it until it is completely destroyed.

There were particularly many floating corpses in that section of the Huangpu River. Next to a customs boat at the Weituoma Road Pier, there were more than twenty in a row. We stared intently and looked closely. Some had their hands tied behind their backs and were covered in wounds. These were undoubtedly innocent civilians who had sacrificed at the hands of enemy soldiers. There were such situations in other places as well, either drifting with the waves or half-sunken on the beach, extremely tragic. In this ten-mile short trip, we saw a total of ten enemy ships, one was the Izumo flagship, one was a cruiser, four were destroyers, and four were shallow-water gunboats, with an average distance of one mile apart. This sparse arrangement clearly shows that they are afraid of the bombing of our air force. We also saw an ironclad small steamship, probably used when attempting to land in the Wusong area.
