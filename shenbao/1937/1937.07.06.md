He Issues Written Statement

[Chongqing] Minister He arrived in Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. Reporters went to visit him at the airfield and were given a written statement, as follows: "Director Gu and I have been ordered to come to Sichuan to work with Director Liu and the generals of Sichuan and Xikang to handle the military reorganization of Sichuan and Xikang. Today, we arrived in Chongqing by plane and were warmly welcomed by the generals and various sectors of Chongqing. We are very honored and very grateful. I visited Chongqing twenty years ago. This time, I have returned and have seen great progress in the construction of Chongqing, and the situation is extremely vigorous. Although I have only seen one place, it is enough to prove the efforts of all the compatriots in Sichuan under the leadership of Chairman Liu in recent years. Not only is there much expression in material construction, but there is also very rapid progress in the spiritual aspect. In recent years, when I was in Nanjing, I often received letters from many Sichuan friends and often came into contact with many Sichuan youths. I felt that their thinking was very progressive and that everything was premised on the interests of the nation and the people, and not, as in the past, putting Sichuan first and the nation and the people second. In particular, the soldiers of Sichuan have made many contributions to the Party and the country in recent years and have made their best efforts for the work of saving the country and building the country. This is what I feel very admired and very happy about. Regarding the issue of military reorganization, the military reorganization plan has already been decided by the central government and telegraphed to Director Liu and the generals of Sichuan and Xikang. Director Liu and the generals have all telegraphed back to the central government, unanimously expressing their acceptance. My visit to Chongqing this time is only to discuss the methods and steps for implementing the military reorganization plan. Now, the whole country has a clear understanding of the matter of military reorganization, because in order to lay the foundation for national revival, the national army must be thoroughly reorganized. However, there are still a few people who think that military reorganization is military reduction, is reducing expenses, and is placing personnel from the central government. This, of course, is because they do not yet understand the meaning of military reorganization. In short, military reorganization is to enrich the quality of the army. Second, it is to unify the organization of the army in accordance with the organization stipulated by the central government to meet the needs of national defense and modern weapons and tactics. For example, the central government stipulates that the number of people in a division is 10,000, but the number of people in a general division is only a few thousand. It can be said that it takes two divisions to form one division as stipulated by the central government. Therefore, although the large unit is reduced a bit, the actual number of people has not decreased, and the combat power has greatly increased, and command and use are especially agile and flexible. Second, the expenses are reorganized based on the original expenses and are not reduced by a single point. However, after reorganization according to the central government's plan, the treatment of officers and soldiers can be improved, and they can be paid according to the National Crisis Allowance Regulations. Third, personnel are handled entirely in accordance with personnel regulations, so that officers and soldiers are guaranteed. After the reorganization, if there are a small number of surplus officers, they will be arranged in accordance with the methods of reorganizing the divisions in the 25th year, or they will be assigned as aides to various troops, or they will be sent to military schools for advanced studies. The central government does not arrange people down separately. The only difference between the army after reorganization and before is that after the reorganization, all organization, personnel, expenses, education, etc. are directly under the central government, and everything is handled in accordance with regulations, and all become a real national army. Therefore, military reorganization is definitely not the so-called reduction and reorganization of the past. As for the military reorganization principles stipulated by the central government, they are all determined according to the needs of the country. All armies that should be reorganized are handled in accordance with this principle, and it is not determined for the reorganization of the Sichuan-Xikang army. Moreover, this time the reorganization of the Sichuan-Xikang army is entirely to resolve the difficulties in Sichuan. Because the current situation of the Sichuan army and finance is such that if it is not reorganized, it will only tend to be in a state of crisis. Therefore, the central government presides over the reorganization of the Sichuan-Xikang army, which is really to help Chairman Liu complete the aspirations of building Sichuan, to help all the officers and men of Sichuan and Xikang reduce their current difficulties, and there is absolutely no personal prejudice mixed in it. This can be proven by facts. It is hoped that all the comrades in Sichuan and Xikang and all the people in Sichuan will have a clearer understanding of this military reorganization and will unanimously cooperate and support it, so that the military reorganization can be completed quickly, which is not only the blessing of Sichuan but also the blessing of the entire nation and people. Finally, when reporters asked about the situation of Chairman Chiang's health and the reorganization of the former Northeast Army, etc., Minister He replied that Chairman Chiang's health has recently fully recovered. When I visited Chairman Chiang in Lushan this time, I saw that Chairman Chiang's spirit was as strong as ever. Today, Lushan held a memorial week, and Chairman Chiang also went to participate and gave a long speech. The reorganization of the former Northeast Army is progressing extremely smoothly. Now the reorganization has been completed one after another. Yang Hucheng's departure from the country is in accordance with the order of the central government to inspect military affairs. The army under his command has now been approved by the central government to be reorganized into two divisions and is still stationed in Shaanxi, actively training. Since Director Yu Hanmou took office in Guangdong, he has been determined to reorganize the army. This spring, he also voluntarily reduced more than 20 regiments to make military expenditures suitable. Therefore, the garrison in Guangdong Province is now completely on track. Director Li Zongren and Commissioner Bai Chongxi in Guangxi are all burying their heads in hard work for the reorganization of the army and the management of construction. Their enthusiasm for supporting the central government has even more practical expressions. Commissioner Bai will soon go north to visit Chairman Chiang. Although the situation in the north is often in a difficult situation, with the efforts of Director Song Zheyuan and the generals and local authorities, they can still support it with hardship and maintain stability. Their will is completely consistent with the central government. Under the leadership of Chairman Long in Yunnan, all construction and politics have made greater progress than before. I also wanted to go to Yunnan this time to see, but because I am busy in Nanjing, I don't know if I can spare the time. Guizhou Province has been hit hard by drought this year, and now it is actively providing relief by raising funds separately inside and outside the province. If time permits, I also plan to go to Guiyang after the meeting in Chongqing, because I have been away from Guiyang for more than ten years. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar Narrowly Escapes Assassination

Bomb Explodes in Front of Church Door. Flying Street Stones, He Is Fortunately Unharmed

⊙Lisbon Someone attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Salazar this morning, but failed. The Prime Minister goes to the church in the private residence of his friend Dr. Tocos every Sunday morning to attend Mass. This morning, the Prime Minister went as usual. When his car arrived in front of Dr. Tocos's private residence, the Prime Minister got out of the car and was about to enter when a huge bomb suddenly exploded in front of the door. A large piece of street stone flew up with a roar and fell several steps away. The glass windows of nearby houses were also shattered, but Prime Minister Salazar was safe and sound. He immediately walked into Tocos's home. Regarding this case, the police authorities have launched an investigation and discovered that the bomb was placed in the ditch in front of Tocos's door, one meter from the ground, and its explosion was powered by electricity. The explosive force was extremely fierce, and it was fortunate that the Prime Minister was unharmed. At present, the situation in the city is as peaceful as usual, and the streets are bustling with pedestrians, no different from a normal Sunday. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th)

Details of the Incident

The police investigation revealed the following details of the incident:

The night before, a car with its front and rear lights off stopped near Dr. Tocos's residence. There were several unidentified people in the car. They probably took advantage of the night to secretly place the bomb in the ditch and used a long wire to wind along the ditch underground to the corner of "October 5th" Street, 50 meters away. Until yesterday morning, two assassins, one waited at the corner of "October 5th" Street, and the other spied near Dr. Tocos's residence. As soon as Prime Minister Salazar's car arrived in front of Dr. Tocos's residence, they sent a signal, and their accomplices immediately pulled the rope, and the bomb exploded. At that time, the Prime Minister was about to get out of the car and was unharmed. His confidential secretary was also in the car, but was only covered in mud and was not injured. It can be said to be fortunate. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 5th)

Salazar's Brief Biography

Salazar is 46 years old. He first served as Minister of Finance for four years, and in 1932 he also took over the position of Prime Minister. Salazar is one of the most incredible figures in European politics. He is a devout Catholic and believes that God has ordered him to save the country from its difficulties. His rule is authoritarian, so he is actually the dictator of Portugal. Portugal's finances were chaotic, but after Salazar took over the Ministry of Finance, he was able to create a balanced budget and implement the administrative plan laid down by the Marquis of Pombal 200 years ago after the great earthquake in Lisbon. Portuguese politics then gradually got on the right track, so Salazar has the reputation of "Savior of Portugal". (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th)

### Situation in Palestine Perilous

British Navy and Air Force Sent to Suppress

[London] Fearing that incidents may occur in Palestine after the publication of the Palestine Committee's report, the authorities today specially ordered the battlecruiser "Repulse" to sail from Malta to Haifa. According to information from well-informed Jewish sources in London, the committee's report advocates dividing Palestine into three parts: a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a British trusteeship area. The "Repulse" has a displacement of 32,000 tons and is equipped with six 15-inch guns. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 5th)

⊙Jerusalem The report of the British Committee on Palestine is about to be released, and the local situation is very dangerous, with the possibility of bloodshed.

His residence has also been shot at, and his wife, daughters, and servants have been injured. At the same time, it is learned that Hussein, the leader of the Arab Nationalist Party, has gone to Syria to mobilize Arabs for support. There are about 7,000 British troops stationed here, preparing to prevent conflicts between Arabs and Jews. The British Committee was established in November last year, originally to establish a Jewish state in Palestine based on the promise of former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour in 1918. Its report will be submitted to the League of Nations Mandate Commission. The Arab National United Front has shown signs of division tonight, and the release of the British Committee's report may cause serious disputes. (National Telegram, 4th)

### Hopes for the Female Aviator Persist

Signals Received in San Francisco, Now There Are Clues to Follow

⊙San Francisco At 1:00 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time), the radio station of the Pan American Airways in Honolulu sent out a broadcast telegram to the famous American aviator Amelia Earhart, who went missing in the Pacific. At 1:15, the station received a radio signal from the southeast of Howland Island, which seemed to be sent by Ms. Earhart's plane, but it was weak and difficult to identify. The coast guard ship "Itasca" immediately rushed to the area. The general opinion is that this signal may have been sent by other radio stations trying to communicate with Ms. Earhart, but the Pan American Airways still believes that it was sent by Ms. Earhart's plane. The radio generator installed in Ms. Earhart's plane is powered by an engine and cannot be used after landing, so some people think that the plane may have landed on a coral island in the Pacific. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 5th)

⊙Los Angeles The coastal patrol ship "Itasca" patrolled the waters around Howland Island today, but did not find any trace of the plane piloted by Ms. Earhart and her companion Noonan. The US Navy Department is now making every effort to find the plane. The battleship "Colorado" sailed out of Honolulu yesterday afternoon, heading towards Howland Island at full speed, and is expected to arrive on Tuesday night. The ship has three planes on board, one of which flew in front of the ship to search, but returned to Honolulu due to wind and rain. The aircraft carrier "Lexington" is carrying 54 aircraft, and sailed from California to Howland Island last night, accompanied by four destroyers. Although the weather between Honolulu and Howland Island is currently bad, it is heard that the skies near Howland Island are mostly cloudy and there is a light breeze. If the lady's plane is floating on the sea or staying on a distant reef, then this kind of weather is particularly favorable. Ms. Earhart's husband, Putnam, told people that his wife intended to make this flight across the Pacific her last transoceanic flight, and then the couple would settle down at home. If this flight is safely returned, then all the oceans of the world will have been flown over. His wife has always had the ambition to fly around the world, and will not be able to settle down until she has fulfilled this wish. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th)

Current Affairs

### Commentary on the Revised Implementation Rules of the Publication Law

— Star

Our country's current Publication Law was promulgated in November of last year. Because the old implementation rules of the law had become ineffective, the new Publication Law has not yet come into effect in reality. According to a special dispatch in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month, the Ministry of the Interior has formulated twenty-eight new implementation rules for the Publication Law, which have been passed by the Executive Yuan and, after some textual refinement, will be promulgated and implemented. The two most important points in the detailed rules are the regulation of the minimum capital amount for the establishment of newspapers and news agencies, and the minimum educational level of newspaper publishers. Within six months, all registered newspapers must supplement their capital registration. Those newspapers with insufficient capital will inevitably be eliminated. If this leads to the result of removing the inferior and preserving the superior, emphasizing quality over quantity, it is certainly what we very much hope for.

The purpose of the new Publication Law and its implementation rules is nothing more than to guide the newspaper industry onto a rational path under the leadership of the central government. The legislative intention is not objectionable. Its method is: first, publication registration, so that publications deemed unnecessary by the government have no possibility of being born; second, restrictions on what is printed, so that publications that have already been born can follow the rules and regulations in their reporting and speech to meet the needs of the country and not stray from the correct path of public opinion. The second task is accomplished by the news censorship system, which the government can exercise at any time. The first task was not clearly stipulated in the old Publication Law. The new Publication Law has stricter regulations. When applying for registration, the organizational structure, capital amount, and economic situation of each newspaper must be stated. There are also various restrictions on the qualifications of the publisher. However, when reviewing the registration form, how much capital is considered qualified, and what level of education the publisher must have, are not stipulated in the Publication Law. The implementation rules provide detailed answers to these two questions.

According to our newspaper's report on the 3rd, the minimum capital for newspapers published in cities with a population of one million or more is 10,000 yuan, and for issuing news dispatches, the minimum capital is 3,000 yuan. In cities below one million in population where the provincial or municipal government is located, the capital for publishing newspapers is at least 6,000 yuan, and for news agencies, 1,000 yuan. In county government seats, the capital for newspapers is 1,000 yuan, and for news agencies, 200 yuan. Publishers of newspapers and issuers of news dispatches must have one of the following qualifications: graduation from a university or junior college, graduation from a high school with more than three years of experience in running a newspaper, having served in a news affairs regulatory agency for more than three years, or having five years of experience in running a newspaper. These regulations are intended to solidify the economic foundation of newspapers and raise the knowledge standards of those in charge, so that mediocre newspapers and reporters have no place in the sacred realm of public opinion.

Of course, these restrictions are not strict compared to those in Europe and Japan. In Japan, newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka must pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan before publishing. If there is a violation of the law, the government will deduct the fine from this amount. The German Newspaper Law stipulates that those who have not received specialized training and do not have the ability to express public opinion cannot obtain the qualification of a journalist. At the same time, there are too many unsound newspapers and news agencies in the Chinese press. Due to the unsound economic foundation, they often resort to subsidies and other methods that damage their reputation for survival, thereby degrading the quality of the newspaper. Due to the unlimited qualifications of journalists, there are often those with no social science knowledge, no vocational training, and therefore no sound professional ethics or sense of responsibility who infiltrate the newspaper industry. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in the interior. The provisions of the Publication Law implementation rules are necessary to rectify the newspaper industry and raise standards.

However, our government and the press should pay attention to the following: First, the Chinese newspaper industry is still in its early stages compared to Europe and the United States. In this period, we cannot be too strict in our requirements for capital and talent. In the past, there have often been extraordinary people who, without sufficient financial resources or specialized training, relied solely on their creative genius and personal perseverance to work hard in the newspaper industry and achieve success. For example, Benjamin Franklin in the United States rose from a printer to a master of public opinion, and Bernard founded New York's most successful newspaper with a capital of 500 yuan. The achievements of the predecessors can serve as a model. Now that newspapers have developed printing technology and specialized content, they cannot do without large capital and specialized talents. However, compared to other commercial and cultural undertakings, the possibility of risk is greater. If the legal restrictions are too strict, young people with aspirations to start a business will only sigh in vain, and the wealthy class and commercial forces will inevitably infiltrate the realm of public opinion, causing the newspaper industry to lose its spirit of autonomy and independence.

Second, the provisions of the Publication Law and its implementation rules are all negative restrictions. While removing the inferior and eliminating the weak can provide opportunities for the good and the strong to develop, the future remains uncertain if the government does not provide active support to China's nascent newspaper industry. It is beyond the means of graduates of high schools and universities with ten thousand gold pieces to start a newspaper in large cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. The high cost of daily raw materials such as paper and ink, and the fierce competition, often make it difficult for newspapers to survive on their own. Therefore, the government and the press should actively work to overcome economic difficulties, strengthen solidarity within the industry, raise standards, enforce discipline, and train talent. Otherwise, relying solely on the negative work of the law will not enable the Chinese newspaper industry to reach a path of prosperity.

### Hirota Seeks to Unify the National Diplomatic Front

Not Using Policies as Tools for Political Strife; The Policy Towards China and Russia Remains Unchanged

[Tokyo] Since taking office, Foreign Minister Hirota has been attempting to establish a unified national diplomacy. As a result of consultations with Prime Minister Konoe, he has requested the assistance of the military, the House of Peers, both political parties, and the people of the entire country. Hirota himself has exchanged views with various parties and has seen its effectiveness. According to Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomatic policy, he places his emphasis on the following two points: ㊀ Foreign policy should not be changed due to changes in domestic political conditions; ㊁ Unify external diplomatic functions and seek to strengthen them; ㊂ Do not use foreign policy as a tool for domestic political strife. The Foreign Minister intends to strengthen the foundation of national diplomacy based on these three principles. If this plan is realized, Japan's foreign policy, centered on diplomacy towards China and Russia, will not undergo any changes for the time being. The Foreign Minister recently met with Ogawa Gotaro of the Minseito Party, Matsuno Tsuruhei of the Seiyukai Party, and Nakano Seigo, among others, and has received expressions of sympathy. He is also scheduled to meet with Kiyose Ichiro of the Kokumin Domei in the coming days to exchange views. (Allied Press, 5th)

### Japanese Concern Over Trade Situation

How to Reverse the Adverse Trend is a Serious Problem Currently

[Nanjing] The general public here has expressed unusual concern about Japan's international trade situation in the second half of this year. Traditionally, the second half of each year is a period of export surplus. However, observers have differing opinions on the extent of the export surplus in the second half of this year. In order to maintain balance of international payments, Japan has already shipped gold abroad five times in the first half of this year, totaling 270 million yen. It is now preparing to ship gold abroad for the sixth time, with an amount of approximately 40-50 million yen. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is now planning to set the gold reserve of the Bank of Japan at 425 million yen. All gold exceeding this limit may be transported to foreign countries by the Bank of Japan. This year, the gold reserve has consistently been around 524.7 million yen. According to a published announcement today, the bank's reserve on July 3rd decreased by 5.3003 million yuan due to the shipment of gold to New York. Furthermore, financial circles estimate that within the next three years, Japan will experience a continuous import surplus as a result of expanding production capacity and strengthening military preparedness. Even if the amount of gold exported abroad each year is limited to 350 million yuan, the total amount of gold exported in three years will inevitably reach 1.05 billion yuan. Moreover, this estimate is only the minimum. If the trade situation continues to reverse, it will be necessary to export even more gold. Therefore, how to increase gold production and how to reverse the adverse trend of international trade are both serious problems currently facing Japan.

The wife of the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Składkowski, and many Polish dignitaries were present to watch. According to the traditional rules of the Gypsy nation, the voters should be thirty "elders," but thirteen abstained, so only seventeen participated in the vote. These people were all wearing patched silk and ink ceremonial robes, or top hats, or fedoras. After the election results were announced, the Greek Orthodox Bishop Dwolowicz of Warsaw crowned King Janusz. The crown was made of copper, gilded with gold. The Bishop then presented King Janusz with a scepter and placed a large blue cape on him. The cape was trimmed with silver rats and embroidered with lilies. It was borrowed from the Warsaw Municipal Theater, used in the performance of Shakespeare's tragedy "King Lear." Other items, such as tables, chair pads, and carpets, were also borrowed from the theater. The table was made of cardboard, and the chairs were also gilded, serving as real seats. After the coronation ceremony, twenty-one firecrackers were set off to serve as a salute. The seventeen "elders" all knelt before the King and kissed his hand to show their loyalty. A group of "princes" in ragged clothes, followed by many attendants in theatrical costumes, expressed their loyalty to the new King. The new King then issued a declaration, stating, "I am always concerned about the interests of Poland, just as I am concerned about the interests of my people. Long live Poland, Long live President Mościcki, Long live the Polish Army and its leader General Rydz-Śmigły!" The new King also told the press that he would find land for the Gypsy nation to build a country and would ask the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request the League of Nations to help. He would also visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, asking him to allow land to be carved out in Abyssinia for the Gypsy nation to live on. The new King has three adult sons, two of whom are currently engaged in the profession of making pots with the new King, so the succession to the throne should not be a problem.

⊙Warsaw Today, the European Gypsy nation held a congress of representatives here and held the coronation ceremony of the Gypsy King. Unexpectedly, after the new King Janusz Kwiek was crowned, a brawl broke out in the crowd, killing ten people and injuring twenty. It was found that Janusz Kwiek was a wandering tinker. The cause of the brawl was due to the new King's opponents making disrespectful slanders against him. When the coronation ceremony was held today, there were 5,000 representatives in attendance. The new King will soon go to Rome to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is said that Mussolini has agreed to open up an area in Abyssinia for the Gypsy nation as the territory of the Gypsies. It is also heard that the new King intends to raise this issue to the League of Nations. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 4th)

### A Certain Party Determined to Protect the Pseudo-Organizations of Chahar and Hebei with Force

The Air Force Threatens Sui and Jin; The Navy Oppresses Ping and Tianjin; Fifty Aircraft from Changchun Arrive in Chengde for Standby

Zhangbei Correspondence: During the period when the People's Self-Defense Army rose up actively, the puppet army in northern Chahar has been indirectly obstructing the issue of advancing westward. The reason is due to the restraining force of the People's Self-Defense Army, but also because the behind-the-scenes manipulators have concerns and other intentions. Although they had previously expressed to the two traitors, De Wang and Li Shouxin, that they should quickly determine methods to suppress or appease the People's Army, or quickly determine a plan to advance westward or southward, this was merely an expression of anger, suddenly revealed in their words. The truth is that their domestic political situation is unstable, and their foreign policy has not been determined, so they have no choice but to wait patiently. Recently, their policy towards China has been decided to continue to be implemented based on the three principles, and the main plan for the puppet army in northern Chahar has been determined accordingly.

Determined to Maintain the Established Facts by Force

According to sources from a certain related party, the certain party has now decided to maintain all the special facts that have been established in North China by means of armed threats. If necessary, the air force will be the main force to threaten the authorities of Suiyuan and Shanxi, and protect the existence of the rebellious group in northern Chahar. As for eastern Hebei, a large number of naval warships will sail along the coastal areas of Qinhuangdao and Dagu, in order to threaten the authorities of Ping, Tianjin, and Hebei Province, and protect the existence of the pseudo-organization in eastern Hebei. According to a message from a certain special agency on the 2nd of this month, more than 50 fighter planes, bombers, and reconnaissance planes have now been transferred from Changchun to Chengde for standby. As for the puppet army in Rehe, they are currently moving westward to prepare for any eventuality.

Armed Secret Agents of Bandits and Puppets are Densely Deployed in Chahar and Suiyuan

Recently, the bandit and puppet army in northern Chahar secretly dispatched about 200 armed secret agents from Zhangbei, Shangdu, and other places, densely deploying them on the eastern border of Suiyuan and in various places north of Chahar Province. Their purpose is to gather information on the military and political situation of our country and the activities of the People's Self-Defense Army, and report to the special agencies at any time. If necessary, they may take the opportunity to disrupt the local public order. In addition, a certain party is also adopting the old tactics of the Soviet Union, using beautiful Korean women or young Chinese women as honey trap spies. It is said that the organization of these honey trap spy agencies selects 30 beautiful and vicious young women to form a group, with a group leader, deputy group leader, and secretary each. They are now active in Ping, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, and other places, mostly mixing in brothels or disguising themselves as waitresses in hotels and restaurants, using their beauty to seduce and detect secrets. As for male spies, 14 people form a group, and the organization is the same as that of the women, but the treatment is slightly different.

Activities of the People's Self-Defense Army

According to a person from Kangbao County, on June 28th, Zhang Ying, who had previously served as the director of the Public Security Bureau of a certain county, secretly joined forces with more than 200 comrades to occupy Kangbao in response to the atrocities of a certain party and the bandits and puppets, due to his anger at their actions. However, because there were so few people and there was no support, they once fiercely attacked the county seat, but were immediately defeated. Seven people were killed by the puppet army, and three were captured alive. More than ten horses of the bandits and puppets were obtained. Zhang Ying then led the remaining people to flee and is now joining forces with Zhang Zhongying, waiting for an opportunity to rise again. It is also heard that Zhang Zhongying's troops also launched two consecutive attacks on the puppet army on the 28th of last month in the vicinity of the Continental Company, 40 li northwest of Shangdu. The first time, they obtained 70-80 war horses, and the second time, they obtained 46 horses. Zhang Zhongying is still in the vicinity of Xinghe. As for Li Ying and Liang Pin, etc., they are all preparing or engaging in guerrilla warfare.

### A Certain Party Secretly Recruiting Chinese Laborers in Southern Fujian to Go Beyond the Pass

Falsely Claiming to Go to Singapore to Cultivate Rubber Plantations; Recruitment Halted After Being Discovered

Xiamen Correspondence: Everyone knows about the deceptive and cruel tactics used by a certain party in recruiting Chinese laborers in North China to go beyond the Pass. The floating corpses in Tianjin and Dagu are clear evidence of this. Therefore, few have applied in recent days, and they have felt the difficulty. Therefore, they have turned to South China, especially paying attention to southern Fujian, which has a large number of Chinese laborers going abroad to Southeast Asia every year. According to reports here, "Recently, hundreds of strong men have been recruited from Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Shima, and other places to go beyond the Pass. According to investigations, two batches were assigned to a certain country's ship to Hong Kong in June. The first batch was 300 people, mostly from Zhangzhou and Shima. The second batch was more than 100 people, from Xiamen and Shima, mostly laborers and coolies. The persons responsible for recruiting in Xiamen were Chen and Yang, and in Shima, one or two baojia chiefs were bought as their accomplices to carry out the recruitment, which was extremely secretive. They falsely claimed that they were recruiting people to go to Singapore to cultivate rubber plantations. Most of the applicants were ignorant and shallow. After the negotiations were successful, they were threatened in various ways and were not allowed to reveal anything, otherwise they would be dealt with severely. Therefore, few people outside knew about it. Each person was given a family allowance of 10 yuan before departure. In fact, both batches went to Dalian beyond the Pass after transferring ships in Hong Kong. The certain country people used the psychology of the people in southern Fujian, falsely claiming to hire them to work in Southeast Asia. Few were not deceived by them. It was originally planned to recruit a large number of people to continue, but later, the person who was recruiting in Shima on their behalf was discovered by the authorities and arrested and sent to the province. Seeing that they had suffered a setback, the certain country has stopped recruiting in recent days." It should be noted that the psychology of the people in southern Fujian seeking employment overseas has a historical background. Few with lofty ambitions do not hope to go abroad. The British Malaya has a monthly limit of 6,000 Chinese laborers entering the ports of Singapore and Penang. Xiamen can be allocated 1,800 exits per month. Because there are few quotas and many people, a registration and lottery method is used. Those who win the lottery can purchase ship tickets to go abroad. As of the end of June, as many as 6,000 people have registered but did not win the lottery, so they could not make the trip. A certain party took advantage of their psychology and was able to succeed. (July 4th)

### The Actual Situation of Disaster in Various Counties of Gansu (Continued)

And the Tragic Situation Desperately Awaiting Relief

㊁ Previously issued relief funds for bandit disasters in various counties: During the summer and autumn of the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], the disaster victims in various counties in eastern, western, and southern Gansu were in dire need of assistance. 3,000 yuan was allocated from the disaster relief reserve fund, along with the remaining 61,000 yuan from the central government's previous allocation of public bonds for disaster relief in the twelve counties of Hexi, and 40,000 yuan allocated from the provincial treasury, totaling 105,000 yuan. Of this, 3,000 yuan was allocated to Zhengning and Heshui counties to establish refugee shelters, 4,500 yuan to Linxia and Zhenyuan counties and the former provincial capital's Public Security Bureau for accommodating and repatriating refugees fleeing banditry from neighboring counties, and 6,500 yuan to Huating, Xihe, Kangle, and Tianshui counties for relief from hailstorm and earthquake disasters. The remaining relief funds, totaling 91,000 yuan, were distributed to Qingyang, Guyuan, Haiyuan, Huanxian, Minxian, Lintan, Weiyuan, Zhangxian, Lintao, Longxi, Huixian, Chengxian, Kangxian, Liangdang, Tongwei, Huining, Kangle, Jingyuan, Wushan, Dingxi, Lixian, Xihe, Longde, Jingning, Gangu, Jingtai, Zhuanglang, and Gulang counties, as well as disaster victims in the ten villages of Nalang under the jurisdiction of Yang Jiqing, the security commander of the Tao-Min Road. According to Article 15 of the Central Relief Commission's investigation and distribution regulations, each person was given one yuan, so only 91,000 people could be assisted.

㊂ Currently issued relief funds for bandit disasters in various counties: In the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], a total of 58 counties in the province were affected by bandit disasters. Among these, 30 counties were severely affected, with a total of 2,400,222 disaster victims. Fifteen counties were moderately affected, with 366,392 disaster victims. Thirteen counties were relatively affected, with 263,709 disaster victims. In total, there were 3,032,323 disaster victims. The central government specially allocated 300,000 yuan in public bonds, equivalent to 200,816.3 yuan in legal tender. Subsequently, two additional allocations of 100,000 yuan each were made in cash, totaling 400,816.3 yuan. In addition, the Executive Yuan sent Commissioner Du Yannian to Gansu to oversee the distribution. The Gansu Provincial Relief Association, in consultation with Commissioner Du, temporarily diverted 41,838.7 yuan from donations to orphanages, bringing the total to 450,000 yuan. In May of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the provincial government approved the allocation of 433,500 yuan to the 58 counties, after deducting 16,500 yuan for relief to the five major monasteries of Song Kanbu and other relief efforts. Among these, 30 severely affected counties were allocated 331,500 yuan, 15 moderately affected counties were allocated 62,500 yuan, and 13 relatively affected counties were allocated 39,500 yuan. According to Article 15 of the Central Relief Commission's investigation and distribution regulations, each person was given one yuan, so only 433,500 people could be assisted.

In summary, the actual situation of the disaster is extremely serious. The total amount allocated before and after was 667,558.15 yuan. After deducting 38,558.15 yuan for operating disaster children's shelters, refugee shelters, and providing relief for hailstorm and earthquake disasters, the actual amount distributed to disaster victims was 629,000 yuan. According to Article 15 of the Central Relief Commission's investigation and distribution regulations, after distributing one yuan per person, only 629,000 people could be assisted, which is less than 22 percent of the total number of disaster victims. There are still over 2,403,300 disaster victims crying from hunger and cold, desperately awaiting food. The severity of the disaster exceeds that of other provinces. Currently, counties such as Minqin, Jiuquan, Jingtai, Zhangye, Anxi, and Jingchuan are sending telegrams requesting increased assistance due to the severity of the disaster and the scarcity of funds. Moreover, ten counties, including Tianshui, Gangu, Weiyuan, Longxi, Zhangxian, Huixian, Lintao, Jingchuan, Linze, and Jingyuan, have recently suffered again from natural disasters such as hailstorms, black frost, and sandstorms, and are also urgently requesting relief. Although the Farmers Bank is allocating 500,000 yuan to actively implement rural loans, this can only help a few counties whose residents are capable of engaging in production. As for the poor and helpless disaster victims who are displaced, they rely on grass roots and tree bark to prolong their lives, and deaths due to lack of grass roots and tree bark are heard of every day. Seeing the pitiful remnants of humanity is heartbreaking. The situation is compelling, and continuing emergency relief is a truly urgent matter. Some believe that with the recent rains in various counties, a harvest can be expected, and emergency relief is unnecessary. However, after a severe disaster, many farming tools are lost, and spring plowing is impossible. Replanting is already delayed, and it is difficult to expect a livelihood without providing rapid relief. Therefore, the Department of Civil Affairs convened a meeting to plan the second phase of emergency relief. Regarding the methods of raising relief funds, the meeting resolved that: ㊀ The provincial treasury should allocate an appropriate amount. ㊁ A detailed report on the disaster situation should be submitted to the central government requesting further large allocations. ㊂ An earnest appeal should be made to the provincial and municipal governments and various charitable organizations. ㊃ Overseas Chinese should be telegraphed to raise funds for assistance. ㊄ Leading figures from all sectors of the provincial capital should be asked to solicit donations from wealthy merchants. ㊅ Charitable performances or entertainment events should be held to raise funds. ㊆ A ratio for one-time donations from staff in all provincial agencies should be proposed and submitted to the Provincial Council for approval. From this, it can be seen that the disaster situation in Gansu Province must rely on collective wisdom and efforts, and multifaceted assistance, to be successfully resolved. Therefore, the actual situation of the disaster in various counties and the tragic situation awaiting relief are widely publicized to plead for the disaster victims. It is earnestly hoped that all charitable gentlemen and ladies will embrace compassion and generously donate, or engage in continuous fundraising, to save this great calamity. The urgency and eagerness to serve are beyond expression. (June 23rd)

### Songjiang Education Association Holds a Meeting to Reject Xiong

Resolved to Issue a Declaration Rejecting Xiong and Petitioning Party and Government Agencies

Songjiang Correspondence: Since the news of the change of director of the local Education Bureau, colleagues in the education community have been deeply indignant at the appointment of Xiong Zhugao as the new director, due to his base character and notorious reputation. Yesterday, a general membership meeting was specially convened, attended by more than 300 people. The atmosphere at the meeting was unusually tense. The meeting unanimously passed a declaration rejecting Xiong, and elected more than 60 representatives to petition the county party headquarters and the county government. At the county party headquarters, Executive Committee member Sun Shiheng received them and promised to telegraph the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, and the education department to request a remedy. The county government, due to County Magistrate Cao's absence, was received by Secretary Wang, but no satisfactory response was obtained. The representatives expressed deep dissatisfaction. Rumors suggest that the situation may escalate, which is truly unfortunate for the education community in Songjiang.

Declaration of the Education Association

Declaration of all members of the Songjiang County Education Association rejecting Xiong: The document states: The education in Songjiang has a long history of more than 30 years, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present. Especially in recent years, the progress of the education cause has been due to the appointment of capable directors. Moreover, Songjiang people have governed Songjiang, and never has talent been borrowed from other places. Now, Xiong Zhugao has come to lead the education in Songjiang, which has already been announced. An investigation reveals that Xiong is from Qingpu, and during his tenure as director of the Education Bureau in Jiangyin and Qingpu, he was driven out by the people due to his base character and notorious reputation. He has long been abandoned by his fellow villagers. The education in Songjiang has a long history and has achieved considerable results. It has been built up through painstaking efforts and only has what it has today. Even if Xiong shamelessly comes, the colleagues ask themselves: their character still exists, and they cannot bear to sit idly by and watch Songjiang education be ravaged by him. They vow to fight to the death and refuse to cooperate with him. This declaration is hereby made.

Xiong Eager to Take Over

An investigation reveals that Chen Guisang, the director of the Songjiang Education Bureau, was transferred to Taicang by order of the department. After Xiong Zhugao was appointed to fill the vacancy, all sectors telegraphed the provincial department to retract the order. It is now heard that the new director has sent a letter to Director Chen, stating that he will arrive in Songjiang soon to take over the duties, and has expressed his intention to dismiss capable personnel in the existing bureau (see the original letter). According to the Regulations on the Protection of Education Personnel, this is clearly a violation. His future actions can be foreseen from this. The original letter, which has been obtained, is recorded below: (Omitted above) Time flies quickly. It has been three weeks since we parted in Jingjiang. Recently, I have been ending the past and preparing for the future, which must have been a lot of hard work. I have been transferred to your place, and the order has been received. I don't know if it has been delivered to your place yet. Please let me know when you are preparing to hand over the duties so that I can prepare. I heard that the chief of general affairs in Taicang has already resigned, the chief of school education has already taken a higher position, and one or two ordinary staff members have also left the bureau. I believe you will need some experienced personnel to assist you when you go there. Therefore, I dare not force the capable personnel in the Songjiang Bureau to stay and have already looked for suitable personnel to replace them. (Omitted below)

### Xiaoshan

Rice Prices Gradually Rising

Since the recent flood disaster in the four townships of Xiaoshan, all early rice is hopeless, and late rice is still being planted. Therefore, new rice from the townships cannot be marketed in time, and the source is lacking, causing supply to fall short of demand. The price of old rice has risen sharply. Since the 1st, the price of various grades of white rice has increased by 4 jiao, more than 1 yuan higher than in previous months. The price of white rice is more than 11 yuan per dan, and there are many buyers of wheat, rising from 5.1 yuan to 7.6 yuan. Demand exceeds supply, and the people's food is quite panicked.

### Introduction

— Yu Hongjun

Mankind has two great enemies: disease and death. European and American medical experts and scientists, concerned with the welfare of the population, have devoted their lives to eradicating these two great enemies. Although death has not yet been conquered, since the rise of microbiology, the origins of diseases have been clearly recognized and extensively studied. With sophisticated methods of treatment and prevention, human lifespans have gradually increased, and the mortality rate has decreased year by year. Although there are occasional chapters in our country's classical texts on health preservation, they mostly consist of Daoist alchemists' discourses on personal cultivation, which are difficult to reconcile with today's hygiene, and even more difficult to reconcile with today's public health. After the Opium War, when the seas were opened and new knowledge was imported, the Chinese people gradually began to pay attention to cleanliness in their daily lives, but this was limited to individuals and seen in cities. There was no overall health administration plan. After the establishment of the Republic of China, internal wars continued. The officials of the Beijing government and the provinces had no time to pay attention to this. Since the Nationalist government established its capital in Nanjing, it recognized that the health of the people could not be ignored and that health administration could not be delayed. Therefore, central departments were established, bureaus were established in cities, and offices were established in counties to emphasize this matter. Thus, our country's health affairs had a unified responsible agency. In recent years, health undertakings have advanced rapidly, and the health of the people has become increasingly excellent, which is not without reason.

Shanghai is a thoroughfare for Chinese and foreign transportation, with a dense population and complex situation. It is the focus of attention. Health issues are the most important task of municipal administration. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the municipal government, a health bureau was established to formulate health administration policies and implement them step by step. Over the years, although limited by funds, it has not been possible to fully realize every ideal, the establishment of epidemic prevention, the eradication of opium, and various other efforts to promote the health of citizens have been commended by society. The establishment and construction of municipal hospitals are all modern in scale. Now, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government, a health exhibition is being held and a special health publication is being printed. Everything that can be done to awaken citizens' awareness of health and instill health knowledge has been prepared. However, the purpose of the exhibition and the special publication is to contribute to citizens' relevant health knowledge, on the one hand, hoping that they will enjoy it as a right, and on the other hand, hoping that they will fulfill it as an obligation. "What is taken from the citizens is used for the citizens" is the basic principle of the municipal government and its affiliated agencies in serving the citizens. Therefore, from the perspective of pure municipal administration, the municipal government and all its facilities are for the enjoyment of the citizens as a right, and the various items related to health are especially important. However, from the perspective of national responsibility, if citizens have diseases that are not treated, have epidemics that are not prevented, or their behavior is harmful to public health, it will not only weaken personal physical strength but also hinder public health, and directly reduce national strength, which is contrary to the natural duty of citizens. Therefore, whether it is for rights, for obligations, for individuals, or for the country, our citizens should pay close attention to various health facilities, and strictly abide by various health rules, to help promote health administration. This is not for the municipal government, it is for the citizens themselves. It is not for the citizens themselves, it is for the entire nation. However, at present, the education of the people is not yet widespread, and the common sense of citizens has not yet reached a high level. It is feared that the significance of hygiene and its importance will be difficult to universally recognize. The duty of the municipal government's health bureau lies in intensifying efforts to promote health undertakings and instill health knowledge in urban and rural areas in the future, so that every citizen has a sound physique and a sound spirit. However, the subtle transformation and the establishment of customs still depend on the advocacy and promotion of insightful people. Therefore, the creation of this publication holds deep hopes for our enlightened citizens.

### The Significance of the Summer Hygiene Campaign

— Jin Baoshan

The value of the summer hygiene campaign in terms of social education is immeasurable. Everyone acknowledges its contributions to the happiness and benefit of people's daily lives. Before and after the promotion of the summer hygiene campaign in our country, the general public's lack of and progress in health knowledge is obviously different. Previously, the public considered eliminating mosquitoes and flies to be an insignificant task. Since the advent of the hygiene campaign, many places have voluntarily organized campaigns to eliminate mosquitoes and flies. This can be seen from the records in the newspapers every summer. In addition, regarding vaccinations, such as typhoid and cholera vaccines, people have always adopted a wait-and-see or suspicious attitude. Since the advent of the summer hygiene campaign, the number of people voluntarily vaccinated in various places has gradually increased. Judging by the surge in the amount of typhoid and cholera vaccine used in recent years, it can be inferred that all of this shows the general public's increased knowledge of health education. At the same time, the only way for the government to promote public health programs is to rely on the summer hygiene campaign as a tool to convey its intentions so that the public can develop sympathy and acceptance. In this context, the summer hygiene campaign is like a major bridge, mediating between the public and the government. The first obstacle to establishing the foundation of public health is to enable the public to complete psychological construction, so that the public has a deep impression of public health in advance. However, this task cannot be solely borne by the public health program itself. Everything contained in the summer hygiene campaign, as well as its development in social education, conveniently and naturally shoulders this task and has already achieved considerable results.

Past summer hygiene campaigns (referring to the major cities in the country in general), in addition to standing on the above-mentioned position to fulfill their mission, have also grasped the actual needs, and then diseases will naturally decrease, and individuals will naturally be healthy. However, this purpose cannot be achieved in one place. The daily lives of the people have gradually tended towards a scientific level. The assistance it provides to the promotion of social culture should not be ignored. It seems that the summer hygiene campaign in the future needs to be even more advanced. Its activity should extend from the surface of society to the bottom of society, so that every family unit can be affected by the summer hygiene campaign, so that every housewife can acquire rich summer hygiene knowledge and manifest it in the handling of household affairs. The next summer hygiene campaign can be fully achieved only with the long-term efforts of the staff responsible for this campaign.

### Hygiene is Still For Yourself

— Wang Qizhang

The two words "hygiene," in the eyes of the general public, seem to be a very profound, very complex, and very difficult-to-implement new field of knowledge. There is a concept of being too high to see and too lofty to climb. Moreover, some people misunderstand it, thinking that hygiene is the administration of the state, the facilities of society, and the cause of the masses, and that it has nothing to do with us individuals. In fact, these are all errors of thought and illusions of the mind.

Living beings all love life and hate death. Especially we humans, feeling the meaning of being human, the responsibility of being human, and the status of being human, naturally have the hope of cherishing our own lives and protecting our own bodies, and study various techniques of seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune. Simply put, if you want to maintain the safety of your own life, you have to plan strategies for self-defense and resistance to insults. This strategy is naturally very complex, very broad, and very subtle. And hygiene is one of them.

I often say that the origin of hygienic thought is by no means man-made. It is inherent in living beings since they were born. However, without guidance, everyone does not understand avoidance. Without encountering harm, everyone does not pay attention. For example, in ancient times, in the era of Tang and Yu, if there were no traces of beasts and birds in China, there would be no attention to chasing away birds and beasts, and there would never have been the idea of using fire to benefit the palm and burning the mountains and swamps. Also, if there had been no floods that overflowed and flooded the world at that time, there would be no attention to preventing and controlling floods, and Yu would not have come up with the method of following the mountains and cutting the bases and establishing high mountains and great rivers. Therefore, harm is a dose of stimulant for everyone. People suffer pain before they can attract attention and realize that they have to study methods of coping and relief to achieve the purpose of self-defense and resistance to insults. Did Mencius not say, "A country constantly periled by external foes will survive?" This is the meaning.

From ancient times for thousands of years, we humans have suffered everything, and I don't know how much. Every time we suffer harm, we have one more lesson, which is also learning one more trick. In other words, taking a dose of stimulant brings a reaction, exciting us once, and further recognizing the effect of the stimulant. Therefore, we can say that today's hygienic methods are half the reaction of feeling the lessons of disease and half the manifestation of human reason. On the surface, it is for the sake of the happiness of the masses. In fact, the individual himself is a member of everyone, is he not for ourselves?

The significance of the hygiene campaign, according to what has been said above, is very clear, that is to say, to tell everyone the tricks learned from the lessons of harm suffered, and to guide everyone with the gains of human reason, a method of seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune. If everyone can understand these many methods and put them into practice, not only can everyone get a safety, but the safety of the masses is our own safety. In turn, paying attention to hygiene and practicing hygiene still ends up being for ourselves.

Here, I can give a few practical examples for everyone to use as a reference for household hygiene. For example, red and white dysentery and cholera, which are common in summer and autumn, are now understood to be caused by dysentery bacteria, amoeba, and cholera bacteria. However, the most common method of transmission of dysentery and cholera bacteria, in addition to unclean water, is through the transmission of flies. Because flies often like to gather in dirty places and like to stop on food. Therefore, the dirt on their feet can be transmitted to our food, and the dirt on the food can enter our abdomen. Will we not get sick? But this fly does not recognize people. The food it stops on does not know who will eat it. If you let the flies go and do not dispose of them, you will always be carrying a lot of danger. Your family will also always be carrying a lot of danger. Superficially speaking, swatting a fly or two, what's the big deal? There's no need to make a fuss. However, the people who promote hygiene are all saying that eliminating flies is to promote public hygiene. It seems to be for everyone's sake. In fact, flies that do not recognize people may even like to get close to you. Then, eliminating flies can also be said to be for ourselves.

For example, there is also the transmission of tuberculosis. Now everyone understands that the most common way to get sick is by inhaling tuberculosis bacteria contained in dust. Originally, the tuberculosis bacteria in the dust were mostly caused by the sputum of tuberculosis patients being spat on the ground, drying up, and mixing into the dust, which then flew up. Then, the sputum of tuberculosis patients spitting on the ground is the main cause of tuberculosis transmission. You need to know that dust has no eyes, and it drifts with the wind, and it does not know your nostrils, your mouth, and the ventilating holes, and the breathing doors. It always flows arbitrarily. Therefore, if we are alive and constantly breathing, we are everywhere carrying three parts of danger. Then, when you want to persuade people not to spit on the ground, it is said that it is for the sake of the public's public health. In fact, we have two nostrils and one mouth, and when we do not stop breathing, are we not all getting his benefits and his protection? Speaking of which, it is still for ourselves.

Judging from the simple examples given above, no matter what treatment, what time, and what situation, if you do not pay attention to hygiene, in the end, others will indeed suffer from your harm. In turn, you are still harming yourself.

### General Assembly Declaration

The survival competition of nations has now become the most urgent era. There are six elements of this competition:

㊀ Physical strength,

㊁ Intelligence,

㊂ Courage,

㊃ Agility,

㊄ Endurance,

㊅ Unity,

Although these six elements include both physical and mental aspects, a sound spirit resides in a sound body. Without strength, there is no sound spirit. Therefore, the fundamental element of national rejuvenation is still to seek physical health, and to make the body healthy, the most basic thing is to earnestly promote hygiene!

In the past, the reason why our Chinese nation failed time and again on the competitive stage and was in an oppressed position by imperialism was because our bodies were not strong, our knowledge was not sufficient, we lacked courage, we had no will to improve, we could not endure, and we could not unite. Therefore, we could only be slaughtered and insulted!

Now, if we are awakened, we should actively build up the cause of hygiene and move out hygiene knowledge so that all the people have a strong body, a sound spirit, a firm will, and the perseverance of endurance and unity. In this way, not only can we make the enemy slightly restrain their ambitions, but also we can obtain a solid guarantee for the future of national rejuvenation.

This city is holding a hygiene campaign, and this is the sixteenth session. It is difficult to accurately estimate the effectiveness of the hygiene campaigns held in the past. However, we do not take into account temporary successes or failures, but only hope to promote and carry forward the above-mentioned meaning and spirit!

### Wu Tiecheng Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon

Yu Hongjun and others welcome him warmly with a special ferry across the Huangpu River. The Municipal Government also sent a large team of honor guards to pay their respects. He issued a written statement outlining his policy for governing Guangdong.

Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has been in Guangdong for nearly three months since he left his position as Mayor of this city in April to develop new projects. This time, he came to Shanghai to attend the tenth anniversary of the Municipal Government and to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan. He arrived in Shanghai on the President McKinley of the Dollar Steamship Company at 11:00 yesterday morning, accompanied by Zhang Yuanruo, Director of the Design Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Li Dachao, Chief of the Fourth Section, Huang Zuyao, Secretary, and attendants. All parties in this city welcomed him with a special ferry across the Huangpu River, which was extremely warm. The Municipal Government also sent honor guards to line up at the Great Eastern Wharf to pay their respects. Wu issued a written statement outlining his policy for governing Guangdong in detail. The details are recorded below:

Welcoming Personnel

The welcoming personnel boarded the specially prepared Municipal Ferry No. 5 at the Customs Wharf at 9:30 and sailed to the President McKinley to welcome him. They included Acting Mayor of this city, Yu Hongjun and his wife, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Bureau, Cai Jingjun, Director of the Police Bureau, Li Tingan, Director of the Health Bureau, Wen Huayin, Commander of the Security Corps, as well as senior officials such as Guo Le, Geng Jiaji, Tang Shixuan, Huang Shaoer, Section Chiefs of the Municipal Government, Ms. Ma Fengqi, wife of Chairman Wu, Jie Zixiang, disciple, Wang Zhinan, Secretary of the Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Wu Kaixian, Tong Xingbai, Jiang Huaishu, members of the Municipal Party Committee, Zhou Jue, Director of the former Diplomatic Office in Shanghai, representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai and Lu Bohong, Yang Dezhao, Li Xiangen, and friends from all walks of life, and reporters from various newspapers, totaling about 200 people.

Arrival Situation

The President McKinley was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9:30, but was delayed until around 10:00 before entering the port. At 11:00, it docked at buoys No. 12 and No. 13 on the Yangshupu River. Wu immediately changed to the Municipal Ferry to greet and shake hands with the welcomers, looking very energetic. At this time, the full military band of the Municipal Police Bureau also played music on the ferry to welcome him.

Issuing a Statement

Wu met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship and issued a written statement as follows: I, Tiecheng, left Shanghai for Guangdong nearly three months ago. This time, I am going to Nanjing to report on my duties and will pass through Shanghai to attend the tenth anniversary celebration of the Shanghai Municipal Government and to treat my dental disease. I am deeply grateful to my friends for welcoming me upon my arrival. Since Guangdong Province was unified last year, the political and social situation has been improving day by day. Recently, the currency system has been reformed, and the ratio between Guangdong currency and national currency has been determined. Not only has the economic market become increasingly stable, but also the unification of finance and currency has increased the connection between Guangdong Province and the entire nation. Today's Guangdong, whether politically or economically, has laid a solid foundation. This is of great benefit to national construction and national rejuvenation. I, Tiecheng, am particularly pleased to have witnessed these two major achievements on my return to Guangdong.

Policy for Governing Guangdong

Regarding the policy for governing Guangdong, I, Tiecheng, made a declaration at the beginning of my term, which is divided into four major guidelines: ㊀ Political construction, ㊁ Economic construction, ㊂ Cultural construction, ㊃ Rural construction. Among the four, rural construction is the most central. Rural construction is not only an important plan for Guangdong to solve the food problem, but also the basic work for national construction from the perspective of the entire country. From a political point of view, such as organizing Baojia, handling autonomy, training young men, and national defense construction, from an economic point of view, such as alleviating the suffering of the people and cultivating the foundation of industry, from a cultural point of view, such as eliminating illiteracy and improving the level of knowledge and skills of the general people, all of these should start from rural areas, so as not to become empty talk and be of no practical benefit. Especially from the perspective of the province's position, all political, economic, cultural, and educational plans and facilities should take this as the basis. People of insight in the country have long advocated and spared no effort in the rural construction movement. However, Guangdong Province intends to concentrate the manpower and material resources of the entire provincial government to carry out comprehensive planning and seek thorough construction. At present, most of the specific implementation plans have been drafted, and the construction funds have also been raised. Before leaving Guangdong, I, Tiecheng, also summoned the directors of each department and the heads of each competent authority to discuss the specific methods of mobilizing to go to the countryside. The methods for the use, organization, and training of rural service personnel have also been drafted. In the near future, the rural construction of Guangdong Province can be moved from planning research to implementation and mobilization.

Opening Huangpu Port

Secondly, the opening of Huangpu Port has also moved from the planning stage to the implementation stage. Huangpu is the end point of the Yuehan Railway and a major port for importing and exporting goods from various provinces in the north and south. At present, the Huangpu branch line of the Yuehan Railway has been under construction for five months, and the roadbed has been completed in stages. It will be open to traffic in August or September. Other projects, such as harbor engineering, steel pile wharves, and transportation arteries, have also been contracted for and will be completed next year. The completion of this major southern port will not only greatly contribute to the economic development of Guangdong Province, but also play a powerful role in the development of the entire national economy. In addition, the development of Qiongyai, whether from a national defense or economic point of view, is important. The initial steps of its development are the construction of railways and wharves, and the development of the transportation network. It is hoped that those who are concerned about the development of South China and economic construction will actively invest and promote its success.

Provincial Industry

Furthermore, Guangdong's provincial industry has also laid a considerable foundation. For example, the provincial paper mill is currently the largest paper mill in China. Paper will be produced around February, using pine wood as raw material, with a daily output of about 50 tons. Guangdong Province is the birthplace of the revolution and should be a powerful link in the process of national construction in the future. Since the unification last year and the recent currency unification, the political economy has been very stable. From now on, we rely on concentrating talents, studying good plans, in order to promote the progress of the new government construction. I, Tiecheng, am serving my hometown, although I am determined to serve the country, my talent is limited. I hope that friends from all sides and sages from home and abroad will give more assistance, so that the construction of the new Guangdong can see results as soon as possible.

Inspecting the Police Force

Wu disembarked from the ship around 11:00 and took the municipal ferry across the river. He landed at the Dada Wharf in the South City at 11:30. The Municipal Government, because Wu came to attend the tenth anniversary celebration of the Municipal Government, specially sent a team of honor guards, security forces, and police to stand at the Dada Wharf in preparation for inspection. After Wu landed, he was accompanied by Acting Mayor Yu and Police Chief Cai Jingjun, Inspection Director Wang Dashui, and Deputy Commander of the Security Corps Wen Huayin to inspect. He then took a car directly back to his private residence on Haige Road.

Staying in Shanghai for a Week

Wu came here to participate in the tenth anniversary celebration of the Municipal Government and to treat his dental disease. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for about a week and will then go to Lushan to meet with President Chiang Kai-shek to report on provincial affairs. Acting Mayor Yu is scheduled to host a banquet for Wu tonight at 7:00 to welcome him and invite the directors of the various bureaus under the Municipal Government to accompany him.

### Ye Wenjin and Others Report: Suffering of Students Studying in Japan from Oppression

Students in Tokyo are Unable to Focus on Studies, Will Petition the Central Government and Ambassador Xu

The Chinese Students' Associations, Provincial Fellow Associations, and other cultural organizations of Chinese students in various universities in Tokyo, considering that Chinese students in Japan are often arrested and oppressed by the Japanese authorities for no reason, causing anxiety and making it impossible to study, specially sent representative Ye Wenjin back to China to request relief from the central authorities and Ambassador Xu, so that more than 5,000 students studying in Japan can concentrate on their studies. Mr. Ye also held a press conference at the Guanshengyuan on Route de la Mission at 3:00 PM yesterday, inviting members of the press and cultural circles to report the details. Lu Yaowu and Yang Xianwu, responsible persons of the World Compilation Society who were recently expelled from Japan, also gave an on-the-spot report on the closure of the society. They will also pay a visit to Ambassador Xu to petition in the coming days. The details are recorded as follows:

The Anxious Situation of Students Studying in Japan

Ye Wenjin reported on the uneasy situation of students studying in Tokyo, saying that Chinese students have a long history in Tokyo, but in recent years, there have been arbitrary arrests and expulsions. In the past six months alone, the Maodong News was shut down in February, and Zhang Jiandong and others were arrested and expelled. In the middle of the month, Wei Mengke and others from the Translation Society were arrested and expelled. Most recently, on June 12, eight people from the World Compilation Society were arrested and have also been expelled separately. In addition to those expelled in batches, there are still uncounted individuals who have been expelled and returned to China. Therefore, students in Tokyo have felt a great threat, and I was specially sent back to China to report the actual situation to compatriots in China and request relief. The closure and expulsion of a research academic organization shows the cultural oppression of students studying in Japan. The only purpose of students studying in Japan is to seek knowledge and research. The above-mentioned closed institutions are all purely academic research organizations with several years of history. The authorities suppressed them for no reason, making it difficult for students studying in Tokyo to satisfy their desire for knowledge. Japan also separates our Chinese students, calling students from the four northeastern provinces "Manchukuo" students and those from within the customs "Republic of China" students. Not only do they separate us in name, but also force the separation of our student associations in various universities. They strictly monitor our interactions and use various means to intimidate and coerce students from the Northeast, making them avoid approaching students from within the customs. They not only use various illegal means to spy on our friends' interactions, private letters, and group activities such as academic research, student associations, and fellow associations, but even privately open our letters, enter our private residences, and secretly flip through manuscripts and diaries. It is a pity that a country known for the rule of law should act so illegally towards students from neighboring countries. They privately use the Boxer Indemnity, hoping to create traitors. Students from the Northeast are often used as bait. They regard our patriotic students as "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese" elements, often insult them privately, and once arrested, they are imprisoned and interrogated as a matter of course. As a result, they are expelled with the charges of "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese" or even "communization."

The Recent Arrest of Eight People

Lu Yaowu and Yang Xianwu, who were expelled on June 37, then reported on the sudden closure of the World Compilation Society and the arrest and expulsion of colleagues. The World Compilation Society was established in Tokyo for almost two years. It usually studies knowledge from various countries, has pure thoughts, and its work is to compile and exchange knowledge, which is highly praised by general students. On June 12, it was suddenly searched by the Tokyo Police Department. As a result of the search, nothing was found. However, those in charge, myself (Lu Yaowu) and Yang Xianwu, Wang Kongzhao, Shi Baohu, Zhao Guibi, Yang Shike, Liu Qingzhen, Deng Keqiang, etc., were arrested separately and detained until the 28th of the same month, when they were expelled separately. The first batch was Yang Xianwu et al., the second batch was Wang Kongzhao et al., the third batch was myself et al., and the fourth batch was Zhao Guibi et al. When they were imprisoned, they were interrogated in secret rooms, and no charges have been disclosed so far. Therefore, this expulsion was a planned action by the authorities. However, we can only return in silence.

Petition Ambassador Xu for Relief

The returning representative Ye Wenjin et al., in order to maintain the safety of students studying in Japan and to focus on their studies, will petition the central authorities and Ambassador Xu Shiying in Japan in the coming days, requesting negotiation so that students studying in Japan should have considerable protection and freedom within the scope of the law, and demand the freedom to study, because writing and translating for students is their duty, and interference makes it impossible to progress. At the same time, they also demand that the Japanese side not arbitrarily arrest students for no reason, so that more than 5,000 students studying in Japan can be settled. In addition, students studying in Japan feel that students from within the customs are considered Chinese students, while those from the four northeastern provinces are considered "puppet Manchukuo" students, and there is no opportunity to talk and communicate. They feel extremely stimulated and painful in spirit. It is hoped that compatriots will pay close attention to these situations.

The official opening will be at 10:00 AM tomorrow, welcoming visitors from all walks of life. Discounted tickets will be sold for 1 jiao. The association has collected more than 10,000 exhibits and is ready for display. Due to space limitations, exhibits must be displayed in batches.

Masterpieces from the ten counties since the Song and Yuan dynasties have all been collected completely.

Air Defense Explanation

The materials displayed in the exhibition are divided into ㊀ Air defense departments, such as anti-aircraft guns, searchlights, sound locators, bombs, camouflage nets, and aircraft carriers, ㊂ Monitoring and intelligence departments, such as monitoring reports, ㊃ Passive air defense departments, such as air defense buildings, underground room models, night urban air defense, and chemical weapons, are completely collected, large and small.

All sectors of the city have erected various arches and flower gardens on the main thoroughfares of the city to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government. There are more than 30 in the first district of South Shanghai, and more than 10 in Zhabei. Other places such as Pudong, Jiangwan, the city center, and Wusong also have exquisitely decorated arches. There are street-spanning electric lights and various colored torches on each electric pole and tree trunk on Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, and Heping Road in South Shanghai. The preparatory committee for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Municipal Government in the northern district of the city held its fourth preparatory meeting yesterday, deciding that ㊀ the six colored lacquer arches donated by the association have been completed and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company should be requested to connect the fire and light them on the evening of the 6th, ㊁ the celebration fireworks were originally scheduled to be set off on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, but are now changed to the 7th and 8th, because the 9th is the time donated by Xingzhuanglou to be set off every night from 9:00 PM in the square behind Baoshan Road Hongxing Road, ㊂ the donations received from all sectors and the expense accounts are entrusted to accountant Wang Haifan to review and announce.

### Fierce Competition Among Foreign Ships on the Xiamen-Philippines Route, Overseas Chinese Prefer to Travel on National Ships

British Ships Cut Prices by 80%, But Overseas Chinese are Not Tempted, Haiheng's Voyage Successful

The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xiamen-Philippines liner Haiheng had a collision with a boat in the Huangpu River during its first maiden voyage to Xiamen, drowning a boatman. Afterwards, the family of the deceased sued Chen Bingzhi, the chief mate of the Haiheng, in court, demanding that he be held responsible. Because Chen was serving on the ship and the ship did not go to Shanghai, the court sent a letter to Xiamen, summoning Chen to Shanghai to appear in court for questioning. Recently, Chief Mate Chen has returned to Shanghai from Xiamen, preparing to argue the case under maritime law to prove that the collision was not his responsibility. According to Chen, the patriotism of the overseas Chinese in Jianfei is a commendable fact. There are only 30,000 overseas Chinese traveling between Xiamen and Outer Luzon every year, but since the Haiheng started sailing, driven by patriotism, overseas Chinese, even those traveling between Xibo (Cebu) and Xiamen, are willing to give up foreign ships on the direct Xibo route and take the Haiheng to Manila before transferring to Xibo, not hesitating to spend more money and time to show their support for national ships. Therefore, the foreign merchants in the same shipping line admire this. This is one. He also said that the price competition of foreign ships cannot move the hearts of overseas Chinese. In the Xiamen-Philippines route, the British ship Anqing has always had a monopoly advantage and the most passengers. It has made huge profits for many years. Since the Haiheng started sailing, Anqing's business has plummeted. The Haiheng always has 360 to 370 passengers on each voyage, while the British ship only has 20 to 30 passengers each time, at most 50 to 60. As a result, the British merchants drastically reduced the price of tickets (third class between Xiamen and the Philippines) from 27 pesos (about 36 to 37 yuan) to 5 pesos. The Haiheng still sells for 27 pesos. The British ship cut prices by 80% in order to compete, but the overseas Chinese also agreed on a solution: those who take the national ship Haiheng to Xiamen will have their fares subsidized by the fishermen, not allowing them to take the cheap foreign ships. If they go from Xiamen to the Philippines, they will not be hired by employers unless they take the national ship. As a result, the price cuts of foreign ships have fundamentally failed, and the patriotism of overseas Chinese between Xiamen and the Philippines has been fully demonstrated. Now, the Haiheng on this route has a revenue of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per month from passenger business alone. The Feian, newly purchased from Wunei, still needs to be renovated and decorated, and after completion, it must first be dispatched to Qingdao route.

### Shanghai Exchange Brokers Association General Meeting

The Shanghai Yarn Exchange Brokers Association, following an order from the Social Affairs Bureau, has prohibited entrusted buying and selling on behalf of small companies. A general meeting of all members was convened yesterday at 2:00 PM in the conference room on the second floor of the Exchange. After a report by Vice President Cao Wenmei, it was resolved to comply and a circular was sent to all members for their information. All brokers were also asked to supervise and report on each other. After the meeting, a responsible person told reporters that this move by the government was to protect the business of colleagues and safeguard their position. Therefore, everyone was happy to comply. It is reported that these small companies are illegal organizations and should be banned. There are currently about one hundred of them.

### Mediation of Labor Dispute in Zhabei Silk Factories Yesterday

Difficulties in Reaching Agreement Between the Parties; Suggestion to Negotiate Out of Court

After the workers of fourteen silk factories, including Fu Chang in Zhabei District, initiated a general strike to protest the factories' sudden implementation of a production quota system, party and government officials, together with the silk weaving unions of the six districts, went to earnestly persuade the workers to resume work over the past two days. However, the workers of each factory insisted on the cancellation of the production quota system and the implementation of eight demands before resuming work, so the labor dispute remains in a stalemate. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to prevent the labor dispute from expanding and to seek an early solution, convened both parties for mediation yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Representatives from the Silk Manufacturers Association, Shen Huachen and Zhang Peishen, representatives from the Six Districts Silk Reeling Union, Yuan Yunlong and Yang Gengti, representatives from the Four Districts Silk Reeling Union, Chen Xiupu and Yang Hongmei, and Wang Jiashu from the Municipal Party Headquarters were present. Director Wang Xianqing of the Mediation Office presided over the meeting. First, the chairman inquired about the details of the labor strike from the labor representatives and consulted the management on their response to the labor's demands. Subsequently, due to the difficulty in reaching an agreement, both parties were ordered to attempt to negotiate automatically and report the results for review within three days or to reconvene for mediation. The labor representatives were also responsible for persuading the workers to resume work first.

### Fishing Boat Lost at Sea in Storm

At 6:15 PM on the third day of this month, two Hongfeng fishing boats, No. 2 and No. 3 of the Hongfeng Company, were returning to Shanghai from fishing off Huanao Mountain. Both boats were diesel-powered. At midnight, they arrived at the sea north of Daji Mountain, when a sudden strong wind rose and huge waves surged, washing over the deck. The No. 2 boat was suddenly sunk to the bottom of the sea by the waves. All thirteen people on board fell into the sea. Seeing this, the No. 2 boat, regardless of the danger, threw life buoys and rescued ten people. However, the old engineer Chen Aru from Ningbo (37 years old), the head of the sailors Hu Kuanyong (40 years old), and the sailor Hu Jinquan (32 years old) disappeared at that time.

### Truth About the Murder of Zhao Jinshan, Stabbed Eighteen Times

Claiming to Be a Gang Leader, Extorting Two Yuan; Fellow Gang Members Suspected Impersonation and Killed Him; The Murderer Zhang Quanfa and Others Have Also Been Arrested

At the entrance of No. 12, Lane 51, Xinzha Bridge Road, a man was suddenly assassinated and killed in the afternoon the day before yesterday. The Xinzha Police Station, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Detective Ma Zhongrong to investigate. It was learned that the deceased was named Zhao Jinshan and had been stabbed eighteen times. In addition to sending the body to the coroner, the police arrested Zhang Quanfa and Zhang Xingsheng, both from Changshu, at 12:40 AM yesterday. At 9:30 AM, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang charged Zhang Quanfa with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. As for Zhang Xingsheng, he requested detention for investigation. According to lawyer Wang, at 5:00 PM yesterday, Police Officer No. 558 of Lane 51, Xinzha Bridge Road, reported to Chinese Police Officer No. 2057 that a man had been stabbed to death at the entrance of No. 12 in the lane. The Chinese police officer reported to the police station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. It was found that the deceased, Zhao Jinsheng (also known as Zhao Xiaolong), from Jiangbei, was an unemployed gangster who specialized in extortion. Since the first year of the Republic, he had committed numerous crimes and had been arrested and imprisoned many times. Most recently, he was sentenced to fifty days of detention for a crime and was released on June 21. However, he did not repent and continued to make a living by extortion. At about 9:00 AM on the fourth day of this month, Zhao went to the Central Clock and Watch Shop at No. 56, Xinzha Bridge Road, to extort money, claiming that he was the leader of the gangsters in the area and extorting two yuan. The shop owner paid the money at that time. Not long after, another gangster, Shen A'san, also went to the shop to extort protection money. The shop owner told him that Zhao Jinshan, the leader of your gang, had already taken it. Upon hearing this, Shen, who considered himself the leader of the area, felt extremely humiliated that Zhao dared to overstep his authority. Therefore, he invited his gang members, Gao Linsheng and the defendant Zhang Quanfa, and others to hide sharp weapons and seek out Zhao to provoke him. When they arrived at the entrance of No. 12, Lane 51, they met Zhao. They stepped forward and stabbed him repeatedly. Zhao fell to the ground and died instantly. Shen and the others all fled. However, the defendant Zhang Quanfa suddenly felt disoriented after seeing Zhao's death and could not control himself. He wandered around aimlessly and invited his fellow villager Zhang Gusheng to accompany him. It was not until after 12:00 AM this morning that he was arrested by Chinese Detective Ma Zhongrong on North Xizang Road, and so on. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confession and briefly questioned Zhang and others, ordering them to be detained for another hearing on the 14th. Meanwhile, Zhang, a prosecutor from the Special Court Prosecutor's Office, was appointed to examine the body at the coroner's office. It was confirmed that the deceased, Zhao Jinshan, had been stabbed to death before his death. The body was handed over to his niece, Chen Zhao, who signed a guarantee to claim it.

A Robber Breaks In

At 2:50 PM yesterday, a young robber suddenly broke into Yifeng Cloth Shop at No. 21, Lane 212, Ningbo Road (opposite the Money Exchange Guild). The robber was wearing a blue long gown and carried a box gun. After entering the shop, he went straight to the counter, forbade the shop assistants from making noise, opened the drawer, and seized more than fifty yuan in national currency.

Continuous Robbery

At that time, there was a customer chatting with a shop clerk in the reception room of the shop. The robber noticed them, stepped into the room, and robbed the customer of a gold watch and dozens of yuan in national currency he had on him. However, the shop's coachman had already sneaked out of the back door and reported to Chinese Police Officer No. 1668 nearby to make an arrest.

Firing and Fleeing

After the robbery, the robber was about to flee out the door when the Chinese police officer summoned by the coachman stepped into the lane entrance in the north section. Seeing the situation, the robber became anxious and fired a shot at the police officer. The Chinese police officer quickly dodged, and fortunately was not hit. However, the robber took the opportunity to flee south, making it impossible to catch him. Not long after, a large number of detectives arrived from the Central Police Station, but the robber had already escaped.

Wang appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which overturned the sentence and released him on bail. Because the Police Affairs Department refused to accept the decision, it appealed to the Supreme Court, which revoked the acquittal and sent the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. Because Wang's whereabouts are unknown, the Third Branch of the High Court ordered Wang's guarantors, Huang Shijie and Jin Changqing, and others to appear in court for questioning. Because the guarantors also did not know Wang's whereabouts, they were ordered to pay the two thousand yuan security deposit to the court for review. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Daqi of the Third Branch of the High Court continued the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. Wang's guarantors, Jin Changqing and Huang Shijie, stated that they still did not know Wang's whereabouts and paid the cash security deposit as ordered. Judge Chen ordered them to pay directly to the accounting office of the court and ordered the guarantors to find and hand over Wang Xinggao to the court within one week. If they fail to do so, they will be dealt with accordingly. Wang Yisheng, the representative of Li Meidong, the owner of the Meidong Shop, who was detained as a guarantor, was ordered to be released in court and ordered to find and hand over Li Meidong to the court without delay. After the order was issued, the court adjourned. Zhang, a prosecutor from the Special Court Prosecutor's Office, was then appointed to examine the body at the coroner's office.

### Demanding Payment Was Falsely Accused Of Extortion

Wang Shanhai's Ill Intentions; Hong Wanqing Ultimately Found Not Guilty

Hong Wanqing founded the Pacific Overshoe Factory several years ago. However, due to poor business, it soon went bankrupt. Wang Shanhai, who was a salesman for the Pacific Overshoe Factory, owed Hong more than three hundred yuan at the time. Recently, Hong worked as a salesman for the Baoxingsheng Overshoe Factory opened by Ge Baohua, but his income was limited and insufficient to cover his expenses. Therefore, he asked Wang Shanhai to pay the old debt. On the evening of the second day of this month, knowing that Wang was hosting guests at the Zhenmingyue Bookstore in Xifuzhi Lane, Guangxi Road, Hong went there. However, Wang was playing mahjong at the time, so he arranged to pay the money at the Leyuan Teahouse on Erma Road at 9:00 AM the next morning. When Hong Wanqing went there at the appointed time, Wang, harboring ill intentions, reported to the Old Zha Police Station in advance, accusing Hong of extortion. The police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to wait at Leyuan. Seeing Hong receiving the money, they arrested him and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao’yi stood up and explained the case, stating that the case also involved private affairs between men and women, while the defendant denied extortion. Ge Fuhua, the owner of Baoxingsheng Overshoe Factory, testified everything. Judge Feng ruled in court that Hong Wanqing was declared not guilty.

### Zhou Qigang Going to Fujian and Guangdong to Inspect

Xie Zhongfu and Others Hosted a Farewell Banquet

Zhou Qigang, member of the Central Committee and Deputy Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday to go to Fujian and Guangdong provinces to inspect overseas Chinese affairs. Overseas Chinese businessman Xie Zhongfu and others, hosted a farewell banquet at Jue Lin at noon yesterday, inviting leaders of the city's business community and people related to overseas Chinese affairs. More than twenty people, including Lin Kanghou, Qu Wenliu, Shen Zhongyi, and Xie Xiaochu, attended. Xie Zhongfu stood up to speak first, saying that Mr. Zhou Qigang had lived overseas and was very familiar with the situation of overseas Chinese and had considerable contact with overseas Chinese in various places, so he was particularly concerned about the situation of overseas Chinese. This inspection of Fujian and Guangdong provinces, passing through six places: Youtou, Xiamen, Haikou, Jiangmen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, are all places where overseas Chinese gather. We can predict that the results of the inspection will greatly improve overseas Chinese affairs in the future. Lin Kanghou then stood up to speak, recounting the enthusiastic welcome of the local overseas Chinese when he and others went to Siam to inspect last year, and hoped that China Merchants Bureau would carefully plan the China-Siam air route transportation to facilitate its early realization to alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese in various provinces. Finally, Zhou Qigang replied to thank the host and expressed his gratitude. After the Zhou party dispersed, he took the Haizhen ship to Hong Kong at 4:00 PM to inspect for about a month.

### Petition Representatives for Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment Return to Shanghai

The Shanghai Bar Association recently appointed three committee members, including Le Junwei, Zhang Juan Sheng, and Xu Zuoliang, as representatives to petition the Executive Yuan in Beijing to expedite the promulgation and implementation of regulations regarding compensation for wrongful imprisonment. After arriving in Beijing, the representatives, together with representatives from the National Bar Association, jointly filed a petition with the following requests: (1) The draft of the Law on Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment should be announced; (2) Lawyers should be allowed to participate in discussions when meetings are held. The Executive Yuan commended and adopted these requests. The representatives, considering the petition satisfactory, took the Beijing-Shanghai express train back to Shanghai yesterday and immediately went to the association's premises at 30 Gao Naiyi Road to give a preliminary verbal report. They will then present a detailed report of the proceedings at a future association meeting, where each representative will be present.

### Chamber of Commerce Notice to All Industries: Strictly Enforce Measures Against Non-Membership

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all trade associations, stating: "Regarding the proposal by the Old Timber Trade Association, discussed at the 8th Members' Congress of the Chamber on June 19 of this year, to strictly enforce the measures against non-membership in trade associations formulated by the Ministry of Civil Training of the Central Party Headquarters. The justification stated that trade associations are collectives of businesses in the same industry, and thus, businesses are essential components of the association. In modern commerce, progress requires collective effort; internal organization must be sound, and external progress is difficult without long-term planning. Therefore, anyone with a basic understanding of these principles should join and support the association to achieve unity and mutual assistance. However, there are corrupt elements who are ignorant of these principles and disregard the overall situation, either taking a wait-and-see attitude, standing idly by, or reluctantly joining but failing to pay dues. They are unaware that membership dues are stipulated in the association's constitution, and economic resources are the lifeblood of any endeavor. It is difficult for even the most skilled housewife to cook without rice. Therefore, if businesses that do not join trade associations or join but fail to pay dues according to the rules are not sanctioned, the existing trade associations will inevitably fail to sustain themselves, and it will be impossible to stimulate public interest and ensure that the public has sound organizations.

Currently, it is reported that the Ministry of Civil Training of the Central Party Headquarters has formulated measures to sanction non-membership in trade associations, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, the enforcement procedures stipulated in these measures require each trade association to petition the Chamber of Commerce, which then forwards the request to the local administrative authorities. The Chamber of Commerce remains the central hub. Therefore, it is essential for the Congress to resolutely and promptly implement these measures when petitioned in the future and request the administrative authorities to strictly enforce them to achieve a deterrent effect and reverse the wait-and-see attitude. We respectfully await your decision." This was resolved by the Congress and referred to the Executive Committee for handling. At the 12th Executive Committee meeting on the 3rd of this month, the matter was raised for discussion, and it was resolved to notify all trade associations and inform all members. We hereby record and notify you. Please investigate and inform all members as required.

### National Physicians Prepare Pulse Study Association

Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners rely on pulse diagnosis as the standard for treating illnesses, exploring pathologies, and determining symptoms. Therefore, ancient physicians were known for their expertise in pulse diagnosis, and there was a saying that the pulse does not deceive. However, since the Tang and Song dynasties, relying solely on the radial artery in the hand to infer the condition of the internal organs, without examining the pulses throughout the body, is contrary to modern anatomical theories. Therefore, national physician Yao Xinyuan advocated restoring Zhang Zhongjing's three-part pulse method from the Han Dynasty, comparing and diagnosing the cun kou (radial artery), ren ying (carotid artery), and fu yang (dorsalis pedis artery). He lectured in Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places and published a book called "Pulse Study Restoration." The medical community across the country has enthusiastically supported this, and the Central National Medicine Institute and the Ministry of Health have commended it, marking a new record in the history of traditional Chinese medicine. As a result, individuals enthusiastic about improving medicine are preparing to establish the Chinese Pulse Study Association. According to Zhang Ziying, the head of the preparatory committee, membership applications have been enthusiastic, reaching over 300 people. A founding meeting will be convened soon, and members in Pinghu and other places are also initiating the preparation of branch organizations. Those who aspire to improve pulse studies and wish to study medicine in depth can send a letter to Zhang Ziying's medical office at Fudeli, west end of Mahou Road, Edward Road, to request the constitution.

### The Retort of the Monk Driven Out by the Incense Keeper

— Zhen Shilin

When the incense keeper has lived in the temple for a long time, he will inevitably covet the temple's property. Thus, the guest becomes the master, and the incense keeper drives out the monk.

This situation is very similar to the concessions in Shanghai.

The so-called concessions originally referred to areas designated in treaty ports for foreign businesses to lease land for commerce. Merchants from the lessee countries could lease land and build houses within the boundaries. Although the affairs within the boundaries could be managed by agencies established by each country, the most important thing that could not be ignored was that the local sovereignty still belonged to China.

However, what is the actual situation of the Shanghai concessions? What kind of treatment do Chinese people receive in the concessions? "Great power is lost, and we are at the mercy of others." This has been a long-standing problem for decades, and now it has become increasingly severe. The concessions have become their colonies! Taking the screening of films and dramas as an example, works approved by the Central Film Censorship Board cannot be freely screened in the concessions, but they pretend to be deaf and blind when facing films that insult China. This kind of overstepping and unfair actions, reaching their peak recently, have awakened the self-awareness of the Chinese nation. Therefore, the cultural community has launched a movement to revoke the censorship rights of films and dramas in the concessions. Sixteen organizations have joined, and five preparatory committee members have been elected, with the founding meeting scheduled for the 11th.

This is the beginning of the monk's preparation to retaliate after being driven out by the incense keeper, after deep pain and suffering. Saying "beginning" obviously does not mean the "ultimate" goal; but although it is not the ultimate goal, the responsibility for this retaliation is extremely important. If the retaliation is weak, it will not only discourage and affect the subsequent fighting power, but also, if the first shot fails, the incense keeper will know the monk's weakness and will oppress even more severely. At that time, I am afraid that the monks will not only be in a terrible mess.

The most unfortunate thing is that some of us are now monks who have been driven out of the temple gate, but some are still unaware, thinking that being driven out is natural. Therefore, I think the preliminary work is to awaken everyone and unanimously join the "retaliation" group. Revoking the censorship rights of films in the concessions is not only a matter for a few people, but even more not only a matter for the cultural community. Every resident of the concessions needs to stand up and participate in the effort. Only by concentrating the power of the majority is there real power.

What we want to tell the incense keeper and ourselves is that this retaliation is not based on a "anti-foreign" mentality. This is only to reclaim our sovereignty that has been lost for many years. This kind of sovereignty is necessary to reclaim after anyone loses it.

The difficulty of the work is undoubted, and the increased oppression is also expected. We must unite and cultivate a strong sense of self-confidence. We firmly believe that "justice" and "light" do not insist on separating from us. If we pursue them with great determination.

I would like to contribute this short essay to the "Shanghai Cultural Community's Movement to Revoke the Film and Drama Censorship Rights in the Concessions," and sincerely wish the meeting success and the full support of the 3 million citizens of Shanghai!

### The Old Hunter

— Rui Yao

Recently, I received a letter from home, which ended with this paragraph: "Uncle Fuxiang was shot and killed last month. It is said that he was a victim of banditry because he was passing information. But whether he did such a thing, no one is very clear. However, seeing the difficult life he has led in recent years, people have indeed changed a lot compared to before! ..."

Since I have had any memories, this old man has long been a famous hunter in our small town. Although he also had a so-called "home," the only things there were a dilapidated house inherited from his ancestors, a wife he had finally managed to marry at the age of thirty with his own efforts, and a few hunting dogs used as tools for making a living. There was nothing else worth recording. In his mind, there were no extravagant hopes, no long-term plans; no dreams, and no thoughts of gratitude or grudges. But he also had his own beliefs and his own code of conduct: he was superstitious about work, believing that diligence and hard work are a person's duty. Therefore, despite the hardship of his life, he was like a heavily loaded old ferry, without groaning, without lamenting, silently shouldering the heavy burden of life, and passing the dull days one by one.

No matter what day it was, as soon as the east turned white, he would prepare some dry food, gather his old hunting companions, carry nets, and take dogs, and walk together into the vast mountains and forests. It was not until the sun had set, or even the clear moon hung high in the blue sky, that he would stagger back, carrying all over his body the fatigue. No matter how much he had hunted, the prices of all kinds of wild game were fixed, and they were always a little cheaper than others. Therefore, whenever the setting sun slanted over the distant peaks, many customers would be waiting at his home. As soon as he returned home, the game would be bought up. If the hunt was particularly good that day, he would leave a fox, a wild boar, or a wild rabbit for himself to enjoy. He would instruct his wife to slaughter it, and he would take the gourd that had been passed down from who knows how many years ago, and drag his tired eyes to Huangzhen, more than five li away, to buy wine. By the time the wine was bought back, the dishes his wife was cooking would be almost ready. At this time, he would also invite his hunting companions from neighboring villages, as well as two or three old men of similar age from his own village, to his home to drink together. As soon as people sat down at the table, the conversation would start up. They talked about hunting, about the harvest, about the distant stories that had faded in everyone's memory, ... talking like this, they would always talk until after midnight before parting ways. If you were to ask whether he ever felt happy in all those days he lived, then an evening spent like that would be the happiest, most enjoyable evening for him.

He had no children or grandchildren of his own, but he loved children very much. When a child came to his house, he would treat them like his own, using his withered hands to touch their heads and cheeks kindly. Sometimes he would even take out some wild game to give to the child, and tell them stories or strange sights he had seen and heard in the mountains and forests. At that time, in my childish heart, I was very envious of his leisurely life, and I always hoped that I would grow up quickly so that I could go with him to the desolate mountains and deep valleys to live. In fact, how could it only be children who had such thoughts? The farmers in our town, who would not often say with an admiring tone: "Uncle Fuxiang is really lucky, he doesn't have to worry about natural disasters, he doesn't have to worry about grain prices, if he has no money in his pocket, he can go to the mountains to get it, if there is no rice in his pot, he can go to the mountains to get it, really..."

The year before last, when I was in Beiping, a friend came from my hometown and talked about Uncle Fuxiang's recent situation, sighing sadly, "Now the place is poor, and everyone is struggling to find a way to get two meals of white rice a day. Where do they have the spare money to eat wild game! The life he leads is really not as good as it used to be! ..." At the time, I just felt that everyone's life was difficult, and that some more weight of life had only been added to his hunched back. This, for an old man accustomed to carrying heavy burdens, might not be considered such a big hardship. Who would have thought that only a little more than a year later, he would have such an ending!

### Reader's Voice: The Cry of Small Merchants

— A Citizen of Zhabei

The difficulties of small smoke and grocery shop merchants cannot be truly understood unless one has personally experienced them. They buy goods in bulk for a fixed price and sell them off in small quantities, a level of trouble and triviality that is unmatched by any other endeavor. Yet, the fruits of their hard work are diminished because, in addition to the tobacco and alcohol tax, salt tax, and property tax, there are also local gangsters who demand festival dues every year during the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and at the end of the year. In autumn, there are miscellaneous taxes, and those who are slightly unscrupulous or greedy even borrow money at ordinary times, with all sorts of unspeakable pretexts, which must be satisfied. Otherwise, you will suffer overt or covert losses, and it will even be difficult to continue operating, etc. They barely manage to cover expenses, let alone enjoy comfortable food and clothing, dancing halls, theaters, or grand hotels!

Mr. Reporter, you are able to advocate for the people. Now, I am reporting to you the oppression and suffering that I have indirectly experienced and may directly experience in the future, which can also represent the cries of many small merchants in Shanghai. I dare to ask that you publish it, hoping that the authorities can understand the suffering of small merchants, sympathize with them, and grant them leniency! The matter is as follows:

A vermicelli shop in Zhabei's ☓ Road, owned by ☓, has been operating a Beijing goods store in Zhabei for decades. He has always been cautious and especially attentive to national taxes. Last year, due to the poor business of his grocery store on ☓ Road, he changed his strategy and took over a vermicelli shop on the current ☓ Road. It has been a year now. Cigarettes are one of the goods he sells as a side business, and sales are actually small. However, when he moved from ☓ Road last year, he still had some cigars (which were determined to be unlicensed, and the company has now closed down). He has not sold them yet because ☓ Road is a slum with no cigar smokers, so he put them in the cupboard. After a year, he almost forgot about them. If the shop owner had known that these cigars were prohibited from being sold, he would have secretly hidden them at the time.

Unexpectedly, several people suddenly arrived with the police and went straight into the shop, with a tense atmosphere as if they were capturing a major criminal or facing a formidable enemy. They claimed to be inspecting counterfeit cigarettes. The shop owner, a very honest old man, naturally allowed them to search as they pleased. However, the result was that they did not find any counterfeit cigarettes.

Suddenly, the inspectors found the cigars that the shop owner or employees had long forgotten in an old cupboard.

As a result, the old shop owner was taken to the police substation, then to the Zhabei Inspection Sub-Bureau, being tossed around and tired for a whole day. No matter how you explained it, they initially said that a bail of thirty yuan was required. Later, because the shop owner could not produce that much money, it was reduced to ten yuan, and he was given something like a receipt.

The receipt was the evidence for the shop owner to be interrogated again at the General Inspection Bureau. What it said was truly insulting!

It said, "☓☓☓ et al. seized ☓☓☓ selling unlicensed cigars privately on ☓ Road..."! Doesn't the word "seized" already treat the shop owner as a seller of smuggled goods? Has he not already become a criminal? In fact, the shop owner said that last year, these cigars were clearly sold to him by street vendors. They even sent a cigarette tray to be placed on the counter for advertising, clearly allowing them to be sold publicly. If these cigars were to be prohibited, why were they not prohibited at the time? Why prohibit them now? The cigars were manufactured by a cigarette company. Why don't the inspectors prohibit the cigarette company and instead prohibit the seller? If the cigarette company has already closed down, then the inspection bureau should announce to all shops that the sale of this type of cigarette is prohibited. Why use such a swift and unexpected method and then give people the infamous name of "seized"?

Yes, this action, on the part of the inspection bureau, is in accordance with regulations, and it is a public matter handled officially. However, they do not know that most small merchants are ignorant of current affairs and therefore do not know what is going on, causing them to suffer great injustice! If the General Inspection Bureau interrogates him and orders him to pay a fine of several tens of yuan because the shop owner has no money, wouldn't that kill him?

At the same time, the small merchants in the Zhabei area who have suffered the same pain from inspection are not limited to one. Among them, there are certainly those who knowingly violate the law and deserve to be punished, but there must also be more than one who has suffered injustice like the one mentioned above. They cannot speak, and there is nowhere to speak. The writer loves the government and has deep feelings for his fellow merchants, so he has hastily presented this hidden situation here. I hope that the authorities, after receiving this hidden situation, will consider the hardship of small merchants, show them compassion, improve matters of this kind, and relieve the people's plight!
