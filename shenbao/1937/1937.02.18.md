President Roosevelt Achieves First-Stage Victory

[Washington] President Roosevelt's plan to reform the judiciary so that the Supreme Court can no longer obstruct his New Deal legislation has achieved the first stage of victory with the passage of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee of the Senner Bill.

Now that it has been endorsed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is expected to pass in the Senate next week. (Sixteenth Reuters Telegram from the Central News Agency)

The President had previously appointed a special committee to study agricultural issues. The committee's research report has been completed and was also sent to Congress by the President along with the above message for reference. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram)

Current Commentary

### On Unification

— Beginning

As long as you are Chinese, you sincerely pray for the unification of our country. The reason is too obvious and too simple, even young children can understand it. Especially recently, as the Shanghai All Circles United National Salvation Alliance Declaration said, "The national crisis is deepening, and the crisis is imminent. There is no way to save the country without completing true unification." In short, the necessity of unification is as clear as the sun in the sky, and there is no need for us to elaborate. What we want to mention here are a few points related to unification.

For more than twenty years, advocating for the meaning of unification has not started today. In the recent past, some people advocated for unification by force, and this advocacy has even been partially and temporarily put into practice. What was the result? The so-called unified situation was only a flash in the pan, and good times did not last long. The reason is easy to understand. It is that such unification was not built on a truly solid foundation. We must understand that the connection between people is based on common life goals and common demands as its pivot. The power of teaching and rewarding is very small here. If they get their common life goals and needs, even hundreds of millions of people cannot be dispersed. If they lose their common life goals and needs, even two or three people are difficult to unite. The true foundation of unified unity is here. In the past, because there was a facade of unification but no foundation of unification, such a unified situation was like flowers on a stone. Although it was obtained, it was lost. The lessons of the predecessors are a mirror for future generations. Based on the lessons of past facts, we must not only strengthen the unified situation, but also strengthen the foundation of unification. This is the first point.

When we talk about unification now, we must not narrow our horizons and ignore the main goal that must be achieved in our unification movement. On the map of our country, up to now, large areas of territory are no longer under the unified sovereign jurisdiction of our country. For example, the pseudo-autonomous organization in eastern Hebei and the puppet Manchukuo are. As long as these anti-unification abnormal states are not eliminated for a day, we can be considered as not achieving the goal of true unification for a day. Moreover, looking deeper, if this step cannot be achieved, even a unification movement within a smaller scope may be difficult to achieve. Our territory is whole, and our sovereignty is whole. When one part is damaged, it will naturally affect the whole. Therefore, what we seek is a broad unification movement, not a unification movement within a smaller scope. This is the second point.

Today, all Chinese people should accept a supreme principle of saving the country, that is, the interests of the nation outweigh all other interests. Because if the nation perishes and the country perishes, all interests are out of the question. Since all Chinese people are fighting together under the premise of prioritizing national interests, everyone must be mutually tolerant, mutually forgiving, abandon unnecessary disputes, and eliminate the prejudices of fighting each other. Each individual must have such an attitude, and true unification will be realized. Under common life goals and needs, everyone will certainly unite and unite, but in this process, we must also work hard, work hard to overcome our own habits and attitudes that may give a bad impression of unification. We must eliminate prejudice, be completely impartial, and treat others with sincerity. Everyone must sincerely join hands. This is an important condition for creating true unification. This is the third point.

We extremely support the unification movement. The above are just small supplementary opinions.

### Veteran of Japanese Parliament, Ozaki Yukio, Displayed Eloquence

Criticizes Government for Lack of Sincerity Towards China, Greatly Puzzled by Treaty with Germany, Crisis of Military Interference in Politics Lurks

[Tokyo] Ozaki Yukio, a member of the House of Representatives who has been continuously elected since the establishment of the parliamentary system in Japan, maintained silence for a long time. At 5:10 PM today, he participated in the question-and-answer session in the plenary session of the House of Representatives, questioning the government's beliefs regarding the essence and operation of constitutional politics, and also elaborating his own beliefs. The atmosphere in the venue was somewhat tense for a while. Ozaki's eloquence is as follows:

⑴ The increasing national defense expenditure and the excessive burden on the people are said to be unavoidable. Please explain the basis for this.

⑵ The reason for its inevitability comes from within or from outside.

⑶ If this inevitable situation comes from outside, is it from land or sea? Please explain.

⑷ Whether it comes from land or sea, if it is considered necessary to defend against it, then Japan alone is not convenient to undertake it. Please explain this matter.

⑸ Since it is called national defense, there should be a hypothetical opponent. Does it have the same or more strength than the opponent?

⑹ I believe that the sense of security of national defense is different from strengthening armaments. What is the government's view?

⑺ What is the result of the Japan-Germany agreement? If the purpose is to defend against communism, then what is the effectiveness of defending against communism? The Japan-Germany agreement is beneficial to Germany, and Japan cannot consider it beneficial. In which direction does Japan want to develop its diplomatic policy? What diplomatic policy does it adhere to?

As for relations with the Soviet Union, if it is said that it is not only fearing the spread of communism but also wanting to conclude a non-aggression treaty, if the treaty is concluded and they break it, is it not possible to take decisive measures at that time?

And the most important issue of China, and what China is prepared for, is that it does not know what Japanese diplomacy is for, so it should express a clear and concrete policy. If it treats China in this way, China will also open its mind. As for Manchuria, it was obtained by Japan betting the national fortune on the two major wars, the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, so even if China says it wants to recover lost territory, there is no need to argue with it. But problems other than the Manchuria problem should not be impossible to coordinate. If Sino-Japanese friendship can truly be implemented, it is not just lip service but sincerity, China will also be happy to shake hands with us.

And the so-called "extraordinary period" is now popular. What does it mean? I really don't understand. Europe is truly facing a crisis, but where is the real crisis in the East? It is impossible to consider. After the Manchurian Incident, the League of Nations loudly called for economic sanctions against Japan, but what can those fifty countries do to Japan? Their own countries are in crisis and are unable to take care of themselves, let alone deal with us. The so-called watching the fire from the other side of the river, and today's fire is still on the other side of the Indian Ocean, so there is no need to expand armaments externally. As for the internal situation, the internal affairs of the Japanese Empire have indeed encountered their crisis. Prime Minister Hayashi and others can certainly break the crisis of internal affairs, and there seem to be not a few great people in the military, not only ministers, but even we who guide public opinion. After sixty years of political life, I have not yet known of such a great person who can guide an era alone. I have never heard of it. If those who guide politics with great enthusiasm, then they should take off their military uniforms and come forward. We will certainly listen to their guidance with a clean body. If they allow their mouths to interfere in politics with the power of a group or with the background of force, then such a good opportunity to do whatever they want without any scruples is rare in the world.

The old general Ozaki's speech lasted for one hour and forty minutes. He stepped down amidst applause. After Prime Minister Hayashi made a simple reply, Minister of the Army Matsuyama replied:

I am deeply frightened by the February 26 Incident. We are now moving towards purifying the army. The reason and motivation for this matter, to put it bluntly, is that young officers disobeyed the imperial order and made a rash decision. In other words, it is the corruption and degradation of the political situation. I will never consider their actions to be right. The motivation for their actions should be regarded as a lesson from others. It is quite significant. The meeting adjourned at 7:07 PM. (Seventeenth Allied News Telegram)

### Yesterday Afternoon's Interrogation

[Tokyo] At the House of Representatives' general meeting on the 17th, due to the rumor that Yukio Ozaki would run, there was not enough space to stand in the visitor's gallery, and the members were also extremely nervous. The meeting started at 1:15 PM and immediately began questioning the state ministers. Kozō Matsumura of the Seiyūkai took the podium.

Industrial Control Issues

He stated that general industries should always be based on private management as a principle, and state socialism, such as nationalizing industries, is absolutely unacceptable. The previous cabinet's electricity management plan should be withdrawn. What is the Lin cabinet's spirit of industrial guidance? Japan's overall policy also originates from acquiring raw materials and resources and establishing industrial self-sufficiency. Is there any preparation to participate in the World Economic Conference on the redistribution of world assets? There is still no industrial control mechanism to integrate Japan and Manchukuo. Does the government intend to establish an Imperial Economic Conference? The exchange control law of former Finance Minister Mayang has caused suspicion abroad and shaken the domestic economy. Does Finance Minister Yūki intend to revoke the law on July 31st, when it expires? What is the government's view on future prices? Finance Minister Yūki replied: ① To establish economic control between Japan and Manchukuo, the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Committee is planned to be utilized. ① The reason for reducing national fuel policy expenses is to re-examine the Imperial Fuel Company proposal. ① The trade administration organization reform plan is planned to be submitted to this session of the Diet and is currently under study. ① The cause of rising prices is the currency problem, but Japan's currency, due to the Bank of Japan's measures, will not expand so much, so there is no fear of malignant inflation. ① As a result of the implementation of the exchange control order, although there are many inconveniences for two or three speculative importers, there is no disadvantage for general importers, so there is no intention to revoke this order at present. ① As for measures against rising prices, we do not want to adopt overly artificial means, but should examine various causes and take appropriate countermeasures to maintain price stability.

Prime Minister Lin replied:

Although I feel the need to properly control industries, I have no intention of nationalizing various industries. When there are opportunities for a world conference on resource redistribution, I will gladly participate and explain the government's beliefs.

Regarding the Manchurian Policy from Now On

After Mr. Eio Morio of the Shōwakai asked questions about the Manchurian policy, Minister of the Army Matsuyama responded as follows:

The current state of "Manchukuo" cannot maintain security without military force. Minister of Colonial Affairs Yūki responded:

To enable "Manchukuo" to develop soundly, not only agricultural immigrants but also many excellent citizens must immigrate. I also agree with this.

Prime Minister Lin replied:

The Manchurian policy must be parallel to the security policy. In order to gain people's hearts and stabilize the people's minds, it is necessary to build a policy of appeasement.

Kawakami Asks Four Questions

Next, Buntarō Kawakami of the Social Masses Party asked questions, generally saying that recently Japan has been obscured by various dark clouds, all latent in the course of the February 26th Incident. I believe that the course of this incident should be reported to the Diet and await the judgment of the people, which should be a shortcut to military reform. What are the views of the military authorities? It is also said that General Ugaki's cabinet formation is considered an obstacle to military reform. To what extent has military reform progressed? The military authorities often call for military reform and forcibly demand the withdrawal of members of the Japan Labor Federation, which is contrary to constitutional freedom.

The military has published a pamphlet promoting the rescue of rural villages in order to establish broad national defense, but the budget for the Shōwa 12th year is completely contrary to this claim. Do the military authorities intend to give up a portion of the budget for the urgent needs of rural villages? As for the budget for investigation and revision, the direct tax is light and the indirect tax is heavy. Is this the fundamental policy of increasing taxes? If so, Finance Minister Yūki is sacrificing rural villages to support Japanese capitalism, and is a proxy for financial capitalists. The so-called Yūki Finance is Yūki plus Ikeda Finance. The major dollar buyers directly induced by the May 15th Incident are still present and are a major key to the future of Japanese capitalism. Finance Minister Yūki, who is called a financial fascist in the world, if he does not believe in this, please express his views frankly and boldly.

The first policy to overcome the difficulties of the country at this time is national unity. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has the belief in deliberating politics and administering affairs with the public, but the fundamental meaning of reforming politics, I believe, is to expand and strengthen the authority of the Imperial Diet. What does Prime Minister Lin believe?

Minister of the Army Matsuyama replied:

The February 26th Incident has not yet been fully deliberated, so it is not convenient to report its course. There will be opportunities to report all information in the future. There is no fact to hinder General Ugaki's cabinet formation. The Army has recommended suitable personnel, but the person himself refused to accept it. The dissolution of the Labor Federation is based on the Army's own request to facilitate military reform. There is no intention to cut military spending at all.

Finance Minister Yūki replied:

The Japanese Empire is now faced with the urgent task of national defense, and the foundation of national defense is the people. In this sense, stabilizing the people's lives is essential. Under the same circumstances, expanding production is also necessary, and promoting overseas trade is also necessary. It is necessary to establish a financial strategy based on these circumstances. I believe that this is the only way to do it. I am not a supporter of capitalism. The reduction of consumption tax in the budget revision案 is larger than the reduction of direct tax, which can also be clearly stated.

Prime Minister Lin replied:

Respecting public opinion and following public sentiment in order to carry out fair politics is stated in the party platform, and we will carry out a reform of politics with the people. (Dōmei Electric)

### Japan Brews a New Political Tide

The attitude of political parties against the military remains unchanged. The Seiyūkai has internal strife over the president's issue.

[Tokyo] A new political tide is brewing in Japan. When the House of Representatives met yesterday, after submitting many lengthy questions opposing the Army, Army Minister Gen Sugiyama and Army Vice-Minister Imai and other leaders gathered in the meeting lounge after the meeting. It is heard that they decided to take a tough stance on the House of Representatives' sentiments against the Army, and disregarded the precedent of the collapse of the Hirota Cabinet on January 23. The various political parties are still working hard to oppose the Army, showing a determination to separate the Army from the Navy and the entire country. Observers predict that unless the political parties change their strategies, the Army will soon make a request to dissolve the Diet again. (Central News Agency 17th Reuters)

[Tokyo] The reformists within the Seiyūkai, taking the opportunity of President Suzuki's expression of resignation, demanded the immediate establishment of an organ to replace the president and began a vigorous movement to expel the cadre faction. The faction close to President Suzuki, including Ichirō Hatoyama, believes that the establishment of a acting organ is a prerequisite for President Suzuki to remain in office. According to the Seiyūkai party rules, a president must be established in the party, and the president may establish a acting organ at any time if necessary. Therefore, the acting organ established now inevitably has a temporary nature. After the president resigns, the current general affairs should be the center, and the cadres should handle all party affairs. The cadre faction's opinion completely conflicts with the reformists. The reformists plan to amend the party rules to temporarily disregard the party rules, advocate the establishment of a acting organ, and are willing to split the party from the cadre faction if necessary. From this point of view, the Seiyūkai will continue to be in turmoil for the time being with the establishment of a acting organ as the center. (17th Dōmei Electric)

### Japanese Finance Minister Attends Budget General Meeting

Explanation of Budget Amendment

[Tokyo] At the first day of the House of Representatives' Budget General Meeting on the 17th, Finance Minister Yūki explained the issues of the Shōwa 12th year's actual budget. The main points are as follows: The current cabinet has no room to change the compilation of the Shōwa 12th year's revenue and expenditure budget, so it is inevitable to submit the previously withdrawn budget as it is. However, the government believes that abandoning the budget of the previous cabinet is inappropriate given the recent reality of Japan's economic circles. Therefore, changes will be made during implementation. Among these changes, those that require budget amendment will be handled as soon as preparations are completed. The total budget for the 12th year currently submitted to the Diet is 3,038.5 million yen for both revenue and expenditure, of which 269.2 million yen is planned to be used for expenditure. For revenue, the tax system reform and tariff system reform planned by the previous cabinet will also be carefully considered again. For the time being, according to the provisional plan, the revenue will inevitably decrease considerably. However, the actual budget amount for the 12th year is 2,769.35 million yen for both revenue and expenditure, which is an increase of 463.7 million yen in revenue and 457.8 million yen in expenditure compared to the actual budget for the previous year. First, I will generally explain the actual budget amount of revenue. The ordinary revenue is 2,043.1 million yen. The amount of this submitted budget has decreased by 193 million yen, but it has increased by 441.34 million yen compared to the actual budget of the previous year. The increased amount is roughly based on the plan to increase the temporary tax, create new taxes, and other revenue increase plans. The content of this revenue increase plan is 269.54 million yen due to the increase in the temporary tax and the creation of new taxes, 25.4 million yen due to the revision of the tobacco selling price, and 67.8 million yen due to the incorporation of the special account into the general revenue source, for a total of 362.94 million yen. In addition, there is an increase of 22.5 million yen due to the revision of tariffs. Next, regarding expenditure, in view of the recent trend of rising prices, based on the principle of suppressing the increase in government material needs and easing private material needs, the amount of expenditure budget is suspended for 269.2 million yen. This has already been explained. The so-called suspension of use means not using the budget within the year. The method is to suspend the project, reduce the amount, or extend it to the next year. Those that can be amended will be amended. Also, when deciding on the amount of expenditure budget to be suspended, the policy of respecting the purpose of enriching national defense, promoting industry, and stabilizing national life must be adopted. In addition, a considerable amount will be suspended for the special account expenditure. At the same time, the foreign special account is related to the general account, and changes will also be made to tax and tariff revenue. Although the amount of suspension of the special account expenditure is nominally a considerable amount, it is actually only about 18 million yen in total. Finally, the amount of public bonds issued to cover the revenue source of the 12th year's expenditure, the actual budget amount, is 726.2 million yen for the general account and 143 million yen for the special account, for a total of 869.2 million yen. The amount of this submitted budget has decreased by 76.1 million yen for the general account and 12 million yen for the special account. (10th Dōmei Electric)

### British Government Announces National Defense Plan White Paper

Stepping up the expansion of naval, land, and air forces. 1.5 billion pounds needed within five years.

[London] The government recently published a white paper explaining the national defense procedures and stipulating the main points of the large-scale military innovation method as follows: ① In the next fiscal year, the navy will build three battleships, seven cruisers, and two aircraft carriers. ② The army will add a tank battalion. ③ Increase the number of air force personnel. ④ Open many airports in the headquarters and various autonomous territories. (16th Havas Electric)

[London] The white paper published by the British government today estimates that the cost of national defense and military preparations within five years will reach 1.5 billion pounds. (16th National Electric)

[London] The white paper on the British government's proposal to the parliament to expand military preparations and strengthen national defense was published tonight, containing details of the entire national defense plan. The white paper stated that although the government requested authorization to borrow 400 million pounds, this number does not need to be fully exhausted. However, the total national defense expenses within the next five years, based on the most prudent estimate, will require at least 1.5 billion pounds. The so-called total expenses are the number of ordinary estimates in five years, plus 400 million pounds of national defense bonds. The white paper further put forward the reasons why this new plan must be implemented. In recent years, the mechanical equipment in the military preparations of various countries in the world has seen an unlimited increase in precision, and the needs of the latest equipment and air defense equipment are the same for all countries. Moreover, the British territory is scattered and distributed very far. The supplies that the country needs from overseas must be transported by sea. All of these emphasize the strength of the British military. The Navy must maintain the safety of transportation, and its responsibility is especially important. The modernization of the defense of militarily important locations in various territories of the British Empire is also one of the most important aspects of the national defense plan. The white paper then described the needs of the army, navy, and air force individually, and discussed the capacity of reserve manufacturing plants and the defense issues of the country and overseas. It also stated that what Britain needs now is that various issues should be dealt with in a flexible way, so that after the international situation changes or scientific research and inventions are intensified, they can be changed immediately to adapt to the environment.

Regarding the navy, the book stated that in the next few years, the country will have to implement a major construction plan. In addition to the two battleships worth 8 million pounds currently under construction, three more ships must be added in the 1937-1938 program. The plan this year will also add seven cruisers and two aircraft carriers. From 1931 to 1934, the average annual number of naval construction programs was about 12 million pounds, but it increased to 50 million pounds in 1936, and the needs this year will have a sharp increase.

For the army, it is planned to reorganize two tank regiments and corresponding auxiliary military forces to complete modern military forces so that they can effectively respond on the battlefield. The maintenance expenses occupy a large number according to the new plan to improve the army's situation, and the mechanization of various parts is also being accelerated. There is also a considerable plan for the large-scale storage of military supplies, so that the military needs resources will not be cut off for several months after the war, before production can be increased.

Regarding the air force, the white paper advocates the construction of a large number of airports, and plans to build 75 mobile training and other air stations in various locations at home and abroad. The number of British air force personnel has increased from 31,000 in 1934 to 50,000 in 1936, and this number must have a huge increase.

The white paper also has a plan for the construction of military supplies and the latent storage of military supplies in preparation for unexpected needs. In addition, there is a so-called shadowy aircraft manufacturing plant that can supply a large number of aircraft in an emergency. Furthermore, state-owned industries related to national defense should also be prevented from being abandoned due to the interruption of major raw materials. Therefore, the storage of major items such as fuel is also very costly.

Regarding the national defense plan, the white paper stated that the original two divisions of the British territorial army have now been reorganized and expanded, and several new territorial army corps headquarters will be built in the new recruitment locations of the territorial army. In addition, the balloon covering team is also increasing the number of balloons. The protection of the people, such as the supply of gas masks and the increase of fire-fighting equipment, are important tools for defending against the danger of incendiary bombs, so they are all being planned. As for the defense of overseas bases, the air defense equipment should be increased, and the increase of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights in various overseas ports are necessary for protection. The modernization of the coastal defense force at home and abroad requires huge investment.

The white paper stated, "Since the government began the plan to expand military preparations, the external environment related to the scope and speed of this plan has not shown any signs of improvement. Therefore, the government believes that in this phenomenon, the plan for military building cannot be reduced or slowed down for the time being."

The white paper continued, "The government firmly believes that this kind of military expansion plan is of great benefit to the future of peace, and all citizens should do their best to support it. Therefore, although 'the Emperor's government regrets the expenses required for this military preparation and other defense plans, it is indeed aware that it must be implemented. The government is half due to the pressure of the current environment and half due to the fact that the government has needed less financial resources for national defense in previous years, so today it has to catch up urgently. However, it feels difficult to implement and feels unfair to impose the full burden of compensating for this shortcoming in a short period of five years on taxpayers in this period. What comforts the Emperor's government is that in proposing to spread a part of this expense over a longer period, it deeply feels that its path is fully pure." The white paper again solemnly stated that this plan must be implemented before the national defense strength can restore its safe level. (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)

### Parisian Sympathy

[Paris] Today, people in Paris feel that the great efforts of British national defense will surely have a beneficial effect. The action of Britain not wanting to make the freedom of the ocean a mere empty word is now welcomed by the French. The British military preparation program, although it shows that it can only place a minimum number of troops into the battlefield, its program of making huge preparations for armaments is called by Paris a far-sighted precaution. (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)

### Roman Surprise

[Rome] The Italian people are deeply impressed by the great determination of the British government to make up for its shortcomings in military preparations, and they are surprised by the huge amount of funds required. They all feel that the United Kingdom and France are now raising the arms race to the highest level, making it impossible for the poorer powers to catch up. Italians are now all afraid of the extent to which the arms race continues. (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)

### Berlin's Fear

[Berlin] A German government spokesman commented on the British military program today, saying that Germany does not deny the right of the United Kingdom to expand its military preparations to the extent it deems necessary, and only asks that Germany should also enjoy the same right. However, Germany deeply believes that the position of the United Kingdom is far less dangerous than that of Germany, and it is incomprehensible why it is expanding its military preparations so greatly now. Therefore, political circles are now asking each other, "Where will all these actions lead? Will countries such as Italy, France, and Soviet Russia not follow in the footsteps of the United Kingdom?" (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)

### Japanese Concern

[Tokyo] Japanese naval circles have admitted that they are extremely concerned since the British announced their plan to expand military preparations, and will pay close attention to the subsequent developments. They believe that the British decision to build three battleships and seven cruisers is a reaction to the expansion of the German navy, and predict that the United States will also implement an expansion plan to compete with the British plan. However, the Japanese navy has no intention of seeking equality with the United Kingdom and the United States. On the one hand, it is stated that Japan's purpose is only to enrich its military preparations on the independent foundation of not being threatened and not invading, and that the military strength of Japan must be able to cope with the maintenance of peace in the Far East and the authority in the western Pacific. However, the so-called military preparations only have a relative value. Now that the United Kingdom has held a huge construction plan, and the United States will inevitably track down and advance, Japan will be forced by the environment in the future and will have to catch up urgently.

### British National Defense Bond Proposal Submitted to the Lower House

Debate Began Yesterday

[London] Since the publication of the British government's white paper, the huge expenditure on British national defense has become an important topic of conversation in the parliament's lounges. The government is confident that this great strategy will surely win the ordinary support of those who support the government, but the opposition feels that a large increase in taxes will be inevitable, and therefore expresses pessimism. The debate on this proposal will begin today for two days. At that time, Finance Minister Chamberlain will put forward a resolution on national defense bonds, and it is heard that the most important criticism of the Labor Party will be that the white paper has not put forward any adjustment plan for national defense. (Central News Agency 17th Reuters)

### US Neutrality Act

Will be passed by Congress early. The Navy maintains equality with the UK.

[Washington] The impact of Britain's move to raise huge funds for national defense will cause the US Congress to pass the Neutrality Act early. Many congressmen said that if there were no alarming British preparations, the situation in Europe would definitely be explosive. Non-official circles all expect that the US Navy will continue to maintain its equal status with Britain. However, this decision will probably not be announced until the report of the current case between the US government and steel manufacturers is released. Since steel manufacturers stopped supplying steel to US naval shipyards, the US shipbuilding program has been temporarily suspended. (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)

### Baldwin expected to retire after the coronation of the British Emperor

Chamberlain succeeds as Prime Minister

[London] The public initially believed that Prime Minister Baldwin would remain in office until the end of the parliament's summer recess, but political circles are now unanimously believed that Baldwin will resign immediately after the coronation of the Emperor, which can be predicted. Also, Privy Council Minister MacDonald and Lord Chancellor Hailsham also intend to resign. Hailsham's physical condition has been unsuitable for the past year, and MacDonald feels quite inconvenient due to eye disease. If Baldwin resigns, then Finance Minister Chamberlain will succeed him, which is needless to say. However, there are many opinions on who will be the finance minister, and there is no consensus. Naval Minister Hoare and Home Secretary Simon seem to be the most promising. The public all believe that Simon will be ennobled and succeed Hailsham as Lord Chancellor. If so, then the Commerce Secretary has the possibility of entering the Ministry of Finance. He is very steady and is loved by the public. If Simon is in charge of finance, it will involve special problems, so it is feared that it will not be realized. It is expected that the cabinet members who will be changed are Army Minister Cooper and Labor Minister Brown. The public also expects that if MacDonald resigns, Chamberlain will recruit a member of the National Labor Party into the cabinet to maintain the cabinet's academic unity. The only thing that can be decided now is that Chamberlain has a plan in mind, and he will have very clear motions for whatever he wants to do. (Central News Agency 7th Reuters)

### Progress on the Non-Intervention Committee's Work Regarding the Spanish Civil War

Subcommittee Passes Two Resolutions: Ban on Volunteers Effective This Saturday; Portugal Raises Reservations on Maritime and Land Monitoring Plan

[London] The Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session this afternoon and adopted two resolutions passed by the subcommittee yesterday: ① The ban on sending volunteers to Spain will take effect on Saturday, the 20th of this month; ② The monitoring plan for the non-intervention measures will take effect on March 6th. Today's meeting was brief. The German representative, Ambassador to the UK Herr von Ribbentrop, spoke first, announcing Germany's acceptance of the above measures. Subsequently, the Italian representative, Ambassador to the UK Count Grandi, issued a similar statement, sarcastically mentioning the news reported in the British newspapers (namely, that the agreement on the ban on volunteers was reached because the French representative in the subcommittee expressed a strong attitude). The Portuguese representative, Monteiro, speaking after Grandi, expressed acceptance of the ban on volunteers, but raised reservations regarding the implementation of the monitoring plan. Optimists believe that Portugal will only temporarily stay out of it and will eventually participate when the monitoring plan is implemented. Pessimists, however, believe that Portugal will maintain its opposition to the monitoring plan from beginning to end. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### Fierce Battle Southeast of Madrid

Rebel Forces Launch Three Fierce Attacks, All Repelled by Defending Troops

Valencia: According to news from the Spanish government, the major battle, spanning twenty miles southeast of Madrid, has now entered its second week. Madrid seems to be becoming the second Verdun. The government claims that the rebels have suffered 6,000 casualties in the past few days of heavy fighting. The battle is currently taking place on the plateau overlooking the Arganda Bridge. Government troops are still firmly defending the bridge. According to photographs obtained by the government forces, among the rebel casualties are 2,000 Germans. Meanwhile, it is reported that at several points along the Biscay front, soldiers from both sides gather around campfires every night, singing and making merry, which is a stark contrast to the hardship and suffering of the troops on the Madrid front. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Madrid: Nationalist forces launched three successive attacks yesterday in the vicinity of Jarama, southeast of Madrid. The attacks were extremely fierce, but all were repelled by government troops. It is anticipated that government troops will launch a counter-offensive today. The Nationalist forces' three attacks yesterday unfolded as follows: In the first attack, the Nationalist forces first bombarded with artillery for a long time, and then launched a tank assault, followed by an infantry charge. The infantry units used very effective automatic weapons. The fighting lasted for two hours and was extremely fierce, but the government troops remained unmoved, and there was no change in the original positions. Before long, the Nationalist forces launched a second attack, but this time without a tank assault, and were eventually repulsed by the government troops' sweeping fire and failed to succeed. The Nationalist forces then reorganized their troops and launched a third attack, but the result was again defeat. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Unprecedented Disaster in Malaga; Residents Flee in Destitution

Valencia: Spanish Minister of Justice Oriol, under government orders, issued a report describing the suffering of 100,000 residents of Malaga who were fleeing to Almeria to escape the rebel forces. Oriol stated that this evacuation was an unprecedented human disaster in European history. During their flight to Almeria, the refugees were subjected to naval bombardment, aerial bombing, and machine-gun fire from tanks. Corpses littered the roads. Many refugees, unable to walk due to exhaustion, first strangled their children to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Fascists, and then killed themselves by hitting their heads against stones or lying in the road to be crushed by trucks. Many children were separated from their parents and trampled to death by the crowds. Some refugees, unable to lift their feet, crawled on their knees, leaving traces of blood behind them. Severe shortages of food and drink further increased their suffering. Upon reaching Almeria, the refugees, unable to find accommodation, mostly slept on the roadside. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Avila: According to the latest news, government troops executed more than 10,000 prisoners before withdrawing from the port of Malaga. Since the port fell into the hands of the Nationalist forces, residents have been experiencing shortages of food and clothing. Several ships, fully loaded with clothing and food, have arrived at the port to provide relief. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### International Eucharistic Congress Held in the Philippines

— Philippine Correspondence

Representatives from Over Fifty Countries Participate in Large Numbers; Philippine Immigration Department Obstructs the Landing of Our Representatives; Consul-General to the Philippines Protests to the Immigration Department

The Philippines is the only Catholic country in the East, having been governed by Spain for three hundred years and influenced by its culture and education. Except for a small number of Muslim ethnic groups in the south, the rest are Catholics. The current president, vice president, and key figures in the political arena all believe in Catholicism. Private universities, such as Santo Tomas, Ateneo, San Beda, La Salle, etc., have histories of hundreds or hundreds of years and were all established by clergy from various religious orders. The clergy class in the East is most respected in the Philippines, with one Apostolic Delegate, two Archbishops, ten Bishops, one Vicar Apostolic, and two Prefects Apostolic. This year's International Eucharistic Congress is being held in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, because the Philippines is a newly emerging country with convenient transportation, developed commerce, a mild climate, and beautiful scenery, possessing favorable conditions in terms of time, location, and people.

The congress was originally scheduled to open on February 3rd. A grand venue, capable of seating 100,000 people, was constructed in New Manila, with equipment costing nearly 100,000 pesos. Hundreds of large incandescent electric lamps were installed in the venue, and dozens of loudspeakers were hung. From the afternoon of the 3rd, when the congress opened, until the afternoon of the 7th, when it closed, believers attended Mass in their respective parishes after 1:00 AM every night. From 6:00 AM in the morning to 6:00 PM in the afternoon, they attended High Mass at the main venue. The 4th was designated as Women's Day, the 5th as Men's Day, the 6th as Children's Day, and the 7th as the Day of Blessing for the Masses. More than 100,000 believers participated in the processions. Because of religious obligations, each meeting was solemn and reverent. Many believers knelt for one or two hours to receive the Gospel. Before the congress opened, the colorful chapels in each city district and town were freshly painted. The government also strongly promoted the event. During the congress, all government agencies and schools suspended operations for half a day. The American and Philippine national flags and the congress emblem were hung from the windows of residences and on lampposts along major streets, fluttering in the wind. Cars displayed small American and Philippine national flags and the congress emblem, traveling on the main thoroughfares. The believers were highly excited, considering the rare opportunity to attend such a grand event, and were willing to spend whatever it took. Therefore, seats near the stage in the main venue, which accommodated six people, were booked for as much as 500 Philippine pesos.

Manila, a city with over 200,000 residents, suddenly saw an influx of nearly 50,000 to 60,000 tourists (many believers from the outer provinces also came to the capital for the pilgrimage). Various foods were in greater demand than supply. In restaurants and tea houses, both large and small, latecomers had no place to stand. The hotel industry, in particular, was unable to expand to meet the appropriate needs. Therefore, Italian ships from Europe, Russian Empress ships from America, Anqing ships from Xiamen, and Twelve Ports ships from Java were specially docked in the harbor for four or five days, serving as temporary hotels for the delegations. It is said that the fares for their berths were specially discounted as a gesture of preferential treatment. After the congress closed, the delegations returned to their home countries on the original ships.

Our country's representatives, such as Lu Bohong from Shanghai and Yu Bin from Nanjing, held very high ranks in the Catholic Church and had been granted titles. Before their arrival, President Quezon had sent a letter cordially inviting them to stay at the Presidential Palace as honored guests. Unexpectedly, when they arrived in Manila at 7:30 AM on January 20th, the first day along with representatives from other countries, our Consul-General to the Philippines and the Chinese community welcoming committee saw the representatives of other countries stride proudly ashore. Only our country's representatives, Lu and Yu, were detained by the immigration department at the new passenger detention center to verify their passports and interrogate them before being released. Otherwise, each person had to pay a guarantee of 1,000 pesos. After repeated negotiations by the Consul-General and the head of the Eucharistic Congress Preparatory Committee, the immigration department still did not relent. They were only allowed to disembark at 9:30 AM after the Consulate General provided a temporary guarantee in its name. God advocates equality and universal love. Our country's representatives were subjected to such unfair treatment, which deeply saddened the overseas Chinese due to the low international standing of our country.

This matter concerns international prestige and cannot be easily let go. Therefore, the Consul-General sent another letter to the immigration department after the event, raising two main points: ① The members of the Chinese pilgrimage group held sixth-class entry certificates, which had been rigorously verified by the American Consul. Why should each person still be forced to pay a guarantee of 1,000 pesos? This is excessive and unreasonable. ② Lu and Yu are senior leaders of the Catholic Church, holding certificates issued by the American Consul in Shanghai and wearing cassocks and insignia, indicating their high position in the Church. They were also identified by representatives of the Eucharistic Congress Preparatory Office. Yet, they were still obstructed for two hours. The American spirit of refusing Chinese entry is only to refuse Chinese laborers. Since the Chinese hold valid certificates and are not laborers, they should not be prevented from landing. Furthermore, Lu and Yu hold very high positions and should be accorded due respect.

In summary, since the transfer of the Immigration Bureau to the management of the Ministry of Labor, the entry of Chinese children has been nitpicked. Unexpectedly, this has insulted our country's delegation, which is related to international prestige. This shows that the Filipinos' repeated claims of goodwill and improving the treatment of immigrants to us (in reality, the current immigration laws are even more stringent) are merely superficial.

### People in Counties Along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province Oppose Hunan Province Blocking Dongting Lake

The Lives and Deaths of Hubei People Are at Stake and They Cannot Help But Protest; Jointly Telegraphing the Central Government to Immediately Stop It

Hankou Correspondence: Regarding Hunan Province's construction of the Tianhu Embankment, encroaching on 13% of the area of Dongting Lake and blocking the four river outlets, it has caused criticism from the people of Hunan and Hubei provinces. The counties along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province are particularly concerned with their lives and deaths and cannot sit idly by. Today, the entire government agencies and legal organizations in the counties, jointly sent a telegram, resolutely opposing it and requesting the Central Government to immediately stop it. The original telegram is as follows: Hubei's terrain is low-lying, and the Yangtze River runs through the entire province. The counties along the coast rely on embankments for their survival. Since the old courses of the Nine Openings and Thirteen Outlets cannot be fully restored, we can only rely on the existing four openings of Ouchi, Songzi, Taiping, and Tiaoxian to divert water into Dongting Lake, thereby alleviating the momentum of the surging waves. In recent years, residents along the shores of Dongting Lake have built embankments and reclaimed land, reducing the area for water storage, while the disasters of embankment breaches in Hubei have increased. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek proposed returning farmland to the lake, which can be said to be a crucial suggestion and a merit for all generations. The total flow of the above four outlets during floods is 37,100 cubic meters per second, which is stored in Dongting Lake and converges with the nine rivers, entering the Yangtze River within the borders of Hubei Province through Chenglingji. This is exactly in accordance with the old course of the Yu Gong waterway, and the floods in the counties of Hubei and the areas of Anxiang, Li, and Nanhua in Hunan can be slightly alleviated. However, recently it has been heard that the people of Hunan Province are arbitrarily building embankments within the Ouchi estuary, hoping to reclaim the lake as farmland. This is not only completely contrary to the policy of returning farmland to the lake, but also extremely contrary to historical trends and national laws. According to the Yu Gong, the Minshan Mountains guided the Yangtze River to the east and branched into the Tuo River, and then east to the Li River, passing through Jiujiang to Dongling. According to the records, the water from the river flows out as the Tuo and Li Rivers, which is now Lixian, and Jiujiang is Dongting Lake, named after the confluence of the nine rivers. Dongling is now Baling. Although the Tuo River is now silted up, the four openings of Ouchi, etc., still have the effect of dividing the river flow eastward to Baling. When the water level is extremely high, there may be slight damage to the newly silted fields in Dongting Lake. However, when the water recedes slightly, it is no longer possible to divert the population. If embankments are built to block the flow, the only beneficiaries will be the very few silted lands of Dongting, while Hubei will suffer, affecting as many as twenty or more counties. According to the historical course of the river flow and the current situation, it is not appropriate to build embankments. One is that rivers are owned by the state and should not be occupied by the people. The criminal law has specific provisions for the crime of blocking waterways. Even from the perspective of civil law, the owner of land through which water flows does not have the right to unilaterally change the water flow or width. The four openings are natural rivers. How can the people of Hunan Province secretly make them their private property? Now, they are illegally blocking the flow, causing Hubei to lose the benefit of Dongting Lake's water storage and suffer solely from the flood flow from the entire Hunan Province. If the people of Hubei follow suit and build a giant dam on the silted sandbars of Jinghe Township, preventing the water of the Chenglingji River from flowing smoothly to the northeast, would the government sanction it? Can the people of Hunan allow it? According to the law, it is not appropriate to build embankments. Two is that, in general, the land and people of Hunan and Hubei provinces are equally under the jurisdiction of the national government and should be treated equally. The people of Hunan should not harm their neighbors for their own private interests, causing the national taxes and the lives of the people in more than twenty counties in Hubei to be completely subject to the waves. As for how to dredge the four openings, how to implement the return of farmland to the lake, and how to dredge the riverbeds below Jingnao, the government should have a plan. We will not go into detail. The matter concerns the lives and deaths of the people of Hubei. The situation is urgent. We earnestly request your examination and approval and a swift plan to stop it. We cannot express enough our expectation of your orders. (February 15th)

### Kunshan

Preventing a Theatrical Performance Leads to Beating

Farmers in Lujiapu Village, Sixth District, planned to put on a religious opera during the Lunar New Year, having collected funds for it. The village chief, Wu Yanzhen, found out and went to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, they disagreed and swarmed him, beating village chief Wu and causing injuries. The Chenmu Police Station, under whose jurisdiction the incident occurred, arrested six people, including the instigator Zhu Yongnian, and brought them to the county for interrogation and punishment.

Summoning Township Chiefs for Discussions

In order to improve the Baojia system and promote local autonomy, the county government decided to summon township chiefs from across the county in batches, starting on the 23rd, to come to the county for discussions. The main points of this discussion will focus on the implementation of local reforms. If there are any insights or difficulties, they can be fully stated for reference and improvement.

### Suzhou

Execution of Notorious Lake Tai Bandit

The Joint Defense Office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Water Police in Wujiang dispatched detectives to Suzhou in November last year and captured Ren Caifeng, a notorious bandit from Lake Tai, outside Panmen. He was taken to Wujiang for interrogation. He confessed to multiple robberies of the Chen family in Jiangyin, the Zhang family in Wuxi, and the Chen family in Dongshan. He was deemed to have committed heinous crimes and sentenced to death. After being approved by the Military Affairs Commission, he was tied up and executed by firing squad outside the East Gate of Wujiang County on the 16th.

### Changshu

Widening of Main Roads Commences

The county has stipulated that the widening of the city's first main road, from the South Gate to the North Gate via the downtown area south of the county and the West Alley, will be uniformly widened to ten meters. The entire North Gate Street commenced construction on February 1st and is mostly completed. It is expected to see a spacious avenue soon. Other sections were suspended for several days due to the Lunar New Year. Now that the fifth day of the Lunar New Year has passed, workers have returned and will continue with the second phase of work. The removal of the West Alley to the North Downtown is expected to start next month. Large government agencies and commercial enterprises such as the post office and telegraph office have found relocation sites. The construction project of the north and south gates will be changed to six meters in the style of Suzhou's Fengmen Gate. The entire line of the project is expected to be completed by the end of April. From then on, cars from outside the city can directly reach the northern suburbs through the city.

### Wuxi

Major Fire at Lihua Textile Factory

The Lihua Textile Factory, located in Yingshanhe, in the city, was founded by local residents Cheng Jingtang and Tang Xiangting. It was a large-scale operation, and its business had been profitable over the years. At the end of last Lunar New Year, the total profit was more than 100,000 yuan. Recently, the factory had newly acquired a large batch of cotton yarn, preparing for half a year's use. Unexpectedly, around midnight of the 16th, a fire suddenly broke out in the raw material warehouse of the spinning workshop on the first floor. At the time, all the employees in the factory were unaware. It was only after hearing the alarm bell that they woke up from their dreams and escaped through the windows. However, the fire had already broken through the roof, and in an instant, the flames soared to the sky, spreading throughout the factory and making it impossible to approach. Fire brigades from all sections rushed to the scene to put out the fire. Unfortunately, the flames were raging and could not be extinguished easily. It was not until about 2:00 AM that the fire was extinguished. However, in addition to the complete destruction of all the buildings in the factory, the internal machinery, including 30 iron weaving machines, 40 power looms, more than 20 drawing frames, and warping machines, were all reduced to ashes. The total loss is estimated to be over 200,000 yuan. Afterwards, the factory's board of directors and managers met in the store to discuss the aftermath. It was reported that the factory had fire insurance of 70,000 yuan, so there should be no major problems.

### Liyang

A Tragic Accident Caused by a Circus Performance

A circus troupe came to Liyang to perform during the Lunar New Year, borrowing a site on the open space across the river from the East Park. They had also filed a report with the authorities. However, the river could not be crossed without a bridge, so they hired carpenter Liu Changgao to contract the wooden materials and labor for a total of forty yuan. After the construction department inspected it, it began operating. For several days, visitors came in droves. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 AM on the 16th, the bridge collapsed with a loud crash due to the bridge planks being too thin and too many pedestrians. The bridge body also collapsed. More than 100 people fell into the water at once. Fortunately, the rescue came early, and many people were rescued. A small boat was hired to carry out the rescue. A total of six or seven people were injured and were taken to the county hospital for treatment. The search continued. A villager brought two children. They also fell into the water while crossing the bridge. Although one child was rescued ashore, the other two children were still missing. Some villagers, seeing this, believed that the circus was the cause of the disaster and tore down the cloth tents. The authorities rushed to the scene after hearing the news and, seeing that the disaster had occurred, immediately took the villagers who had torn down the cloth tents to the county for detention. It is reported that the circus came to Liyang to perform and reached a compromise with a certain agency, but the bridge was so flimsy and no one cared about it, causing this tragedy. All those involved should bear considerable responsibility.

### Zhenjiang

Planning to Establish a Large-Scale Silk Factory

In view of the decline of the silk industry in Jiangsu Province, in order to revive this industry, the province has implemented unified control of silkworm cocoon trading since the autumn of the 23rd year. For three years, the quality and output have been improving day by day. Silk factories and silkworm farmers are no longer as pessimistic as before, and they are regaining their interest in silkworm farming. Although silk cocoon prices have not recovered to their old levels due to the world market, it is not difficult to restore the silk industry in the province to its former glory if we continue to move forward. However, in terms of silk reeling, although we are striving to cooperate with each factory, the reform of silk-making machinery is more costly. It is not easy to carry out without a farsighted vision and strong financial resources. Moreover, commercial management rarely involves large-scale experiments and research on the relationship between varieties and silk quality. In terms of the purpose of promotion and encouragement, there also seems to be a lack of basis. Therefore, the provincial construction department should include a budget of 100,000 yuan each year in the silk improvement project funds for the 25th and 26th years to establish a provincial silk reeling factory. In order to develop the silkworm industry in Jiangbei, the factory site is planned to be located near Jinshan Temple in Yongdong Township, First District, Zhenjiang. The equipment cost is set at 200,000 yuan, purchasing 180 new-style multi-spindle rotary silk reeling machines. In addition to the capital allocated by the province, the operating policy should be independent and not receive subsidies. Therefore, the annual work is planned to be 80% commercial operation, 10% experimental research, and 10% reeling on behalf of cooperative societies in the province. The entire plan has been approved by the provincial government meeting, and the construction department has now sent personnel to actively prepare and will be realized in the first half of this year.

### Nantong

Collection of 900,000 Yuan in Land Tax

The land tax arrears in Tongyi County have been high for many years. The county government organized a committee to urge the payment of arrears and collected them household by household. As of February 10th, a total of 900,000 yuan in new and old land taxes has been collected. The Land Administration Bureau has completed the land registration, and the land price tax for this year can be collected according to the register. In the future, tax collection can avoid all kinds of difficulties.

### Hangzhou

The Ferocious Bandits on the Zhejiang Border Are All Captured

The Commander-in-Chief Headquarters for Suppressing Bandits in the border area of Weichang, Kai, Sui, and Chunshou counties has achieved victory since the start of the encirclement and suppression in October, annihilating many bandits. On the 13th, more than 100 bandits from the roaming bandit group in Fuman Mountain, armed with eighty rifles, fled south from the northwest of Suian. Commander Lu reported this and secretly ordered the Li and Tang regiments to send a part of their troops to set up an ambush, surround, and attack. They captured a fake company commander alive, killed five or sixty bandits, seized more than thirty rifles, and rescued many hostages and captured bandits. Lao Zhu (Zhu Xuexin), a well-known ferocious bandit who was the Central Committee member of the bandit forces, has now been captured on the border of Shouchang and sent to the county for interrogation and punishment. Yu Dabing, a notorious bandit in Shouchang, has also been captured and will be severely punished as a warning.

### Huzhou

Kidnapping Case Occurs in Shuanglin Town

At about 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, several bandits armed with wooden-cased guns and speaking with mixed accents suddenly broke into the Zhang Gonghe Rice Shop in Hongqiao, East Zha, Shuanglin Town. They kidnapped the shop owner, Zhang Hecheng, and pushed him into a boat that had been ambushed nearby and sped away towards Lianshi. Afterwards, the shop's partners reported to the town's aquatic and land doctors. The Security Corps immediately dispatched a team on the Bihuzhou steamboat to chase after them, but there was no trace of the bandits. After the Wuhing County Government received the news, Huang, the concurrent county magistrate, took the Huanhuzhou patrol ship to the scene yesterday afternoon to inspect it personally and found that Zhang Hecheng's brother, Zhang Zhongnan, was suspected. He was taken to the county for interrogation.

### Shaoxing

Requesting Relief for Damage to Water Conservancy

The Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is currently under construction, passing through a section within Shaoxing County. For the sake of reducing the construction cost, it has blocked the Grand Canal, bypassed small rivers, and filled in the original river courses and crooked harbors at bridges along the road. As a result, the county's water flow cannot be properly discharged, and future flooding is likely to cause blockage and inundation, easily becoming a major disaster. Various legal organizations such as the County Chamber of Commerce and the Farmers' Association held a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss relief measures. It was decided that each legal organization would present a detailed account of the railway bridge construction plan's damage to agricultural water conservancy and request the county to forward a telegram to the provincial authorities for relief. They also first notified the engineering department to temporarily suspend construction and telegraphed the provincial government and the Ministry of Railways directly, requesting that the straight river channels not be curved and blocked, obstructing the water flow, and that the width of the bridges must be widened in accordance with the standards of the highway bridges along the line.

### Xiaoshan

The Entire Wenchang Pavilion is Burned Down

The Wenchang Pavilion in Xiaoshan Wenyan Xiabu was built by Huang Sixin, a local worthy of the Qing Dynasty, and has now been 56 years old. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the 12th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the side house on the west side of the hall. It was not extinguished until 12:00 noon. The entire Wenchang Pavilion was almost completely burned down. The old woman managing the temple, who was seventy years old, was also buried in the fire.

### Fuzhou

Liu Hanzhang Returns to Fujian for Inspection

Liu Hanzhang, courtesy name Zhongzuan, a native of Minhou, was dispatched by the Ministry to Fujian to inspect judicial affairs. He is a senior figure in the judicial world and has long served as the Presiding Judge of the Supreme Court. This time, he was dispatched to return to Fujian and has been inspecting various judicial organs in Fujian Province under the guidance of Tong Hangshi, the President of the Higher Court, for the past few days. According to him, this is the second time he has returned to Fujian to inspect judicial affairs. He also returned once when Zheng Xiaoyun was the President of the Higher Court. At that time, due to the shortage of judicial funds, the agencies and prisons were simple and crude. This time, when he came again, they had been completely renovated. The handling of cases in the civil and criminal courts and the procuratorate was also very vigorous. All the arrangements within the court were also very orderly, which shows President Tong's clear rule of law and construction efforts.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed Editor:

Regarding the news "Opium Addict Investigation Bribery Case" in your newspaper's Kunshan correspondence on February 14th, which stated that after opium addict Gao Zhongliang was reported by someone, he was sent to the county hospital for investigation, and in a state of fear and panic, he entrusted Yuan Kegong to secretly negotiate bribery with Xue A'gen, the hospital's rickshaw driver, this is inconsistent with the facts. The truth is, my father, Gao Zhongliang, entered Kunshan Hospital for investigation on February 21st. On February 6th, the hospital director, Chen Quanheng, instructed Yuan Kegong, an opium addict undergoing investigation in the hospital, to contact Guo Shi, saying that if he was willing to pay money, he would be given a certificate stating "no poison, no addiction" and be released early. Otherwise, he would be deemed to have poison and addiction. Guo Shi immediately gave him one hundred yuan. However, two days after paying the money, my father was still not released from the hospital. When Guo Shi questioned Yuan, he said that he had contacted Xue A'gen, the hospital director's rickshaw driver, and that another one hundred and fifty yuan was needed to release him. Guo Shi had no way to raise the money and was extremely anxious. When the matter was reported to my uncle, Gao Bangying, and uncle-in-law, Zhou Tiandu, they were shocked and said that Guo Shi was young and ignorant and was being defrauded. They planned to expose the inside story so that they could report it. Therefore, they decided to turn the tables on the fraudsters. When Yuan Kegong came to the house for the second time to negotiate, they feigned hospitality and readily agreed, but pretended to say that they did not have the money on hand and needed to go to the city to raise it. The next day (10th), they lured Yuan Kegong and others to the city and had tea at Ban Yuan Garden. Then, they summoned Chen Renheng's rickshaw driver, Xue A'gen, to pass on a message. At the same time, they secretly reported to the county police station, which sent medical officers to the scene and arrested Yuan. Xue escaped, but was later arrested as well. The police station recorded their confessions and sent them to the judiciary for handling. They were immediately detained in court for investigation. This is the general situation of the case. I am writing to inform you of the facts and hope that your newspaper will disclose this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to verify the truth. I am deeply grateful.

Sincerely,

Gao Guoshi, Zheng Yi Town, Central Market, Seventh District, Kunshan County

### Shanghai Chinese Football Team Lost to Hong Kong All-Stars Yesterday

The result was six to zero. The Shanghai team is going to Guangzhou today.

Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th: The Shanghai Chinese Interport Football Team played an exhibition match against the Hong Kong All-Stars team at Caroline Hill Stadium at 4 pm on the 17th. Because Li Ning and others were injured and did not play, the team's lineup was scattered. In the first half, they were repeatedly scored on by Siao Kwok-shan's and Noel. The situation was one-sided. In the second half, after Hu Li scored a goal for the Hong Kong team, goalkeeper Luo Lan Shi even took a penalty kick and scored another goal. As a result, the Shanghai team suffered a crushing defeat of zero to six. The team is scheduled to go to the province on the 18th for exhibition matches.

(Special dispatch from Hong Kong) The first Shanghai-Hong Kong Chinese Interport Football Match was held at Caroline Hill Stadium at 3:30 pm on the 14th. The fans watching the game were extremely crowded, with an estimated number of more than 8,000 people. The situation was extremely lively. The weather was severely cold that day, with biting cold winds. The fans watching the game showed no signs of shrinking back. The battle was dull and lacked exciting performances. Because Chen Zhenhe, Sun Jinshun, and Li Yishen and others were unable to spare the time to come, the strength of the Shanghai team was extremely weak and could not withstand a single blow, resulting in a disastrous defeat to the Hong Kong team with a score of one to five. The Shanghai team's performance was abnormal that day. Judging from its strength, it was not as good as the Hong Kong ordinary Second Division's ever-victorious Navy team. The record of the battle is as follows:

Battle process

When Ye Jiugao entered the field to officiate, the Hong Kong team launched an attack, but because it was too polite, it did not open the scoring for a long time. Huang Meishun, seeing that it was not good, repeatedly fired cold arrows to threaten the Shanghai team. Before long, Li Huitang took advantage of Zhang Manrong's pass, settled the ball twenty yards away, and scored the first goal with a shot. Unexpectedly, after the Hong Kong team won, it did not advance further. Zhuo Shijin was also injured and left the field and was replaced by Yang Shuiyi. Coming and going, it was taken advantage of by the Shanghai team. Xu Jingcheng saw an opportunity and used high-angle artillery to transport the ball forward. Tan Jiangbai originally intended to jump high to save the ball, but Bao Jiaping was overly flustered and came out to snatch the ball, and could not turn around in time. He was penetrated by Nan Douwen with a goal, making it one to one. Afterwards, Zhang Manrong and Yang Shuiyi each made a contribution, and the Hong Kong team took the lead with three to one.

After the break, the second half continued. Zhang Rongcai showed his skills, blocking Li Zhaorong's cross-shot. Then, with a pigeon somersault, he blocked the ball shot by Yang Shuiyi, which was well received. Unexpectedly, Li Huitang broke through the barrier and went straight in, passing through layers of defense. Zhang Rongcai came out to rescue. Li then performed his life's best technique, lifting the ball over Zhang Rongcai. Dai Lin couldn't help but lie down and launch a massive counterattack, but it was blocked by Tan Jiangbai and ultimately failed to be effective. Then, Liu Shizhan fouled in the penalty area. Huang Meishun took a penalty kick, and the ball hit Zhang Rongcai and bounced out. Meishun then moved forward to shoot again and scored. At that time, Li Ning and Xu Jingcheng were injured and left the field one after another, and Jiang Shaoxiang and Wang Kehou replaced them, but they gained nothing. The Hong Kong team then won this championship with five to one.

Banquet situation

At 8 pm that night, the Hong Kong Chinese Sports Association held a conference at Guangzhou Restaurant. In addition to the chairman of the host association, Cai Huihong, the vice-chairman, Xie Yuchuan, the former chairman, Quan Chengkun, and the members of the association, as well as the main guest, Jiang Xiangqing, the representative of the National Association, and all the team members, there were more than 100 people, including Mr. Wenna, the chairman of the Hong Kong Football Association, the chairman of Tung Wah Hospital, the chief director of Po Leung Kuk, and people from all walks of life. After the wine was served, Cai Huihong gave a welcome speech, and Jiang responded with a thank you speech. The banquet ended happily at around 10 pm.

### Shanghai Basketball Association Group A Group Jia Team Xin Wins the Championship

Defeated Mai Ling Jia 39 to 34 yesterday. Mai Ling Yi won the Group A Group Yi championship.

Team Xin defeated Mai Ling Jia 39 to 34 yesterday, completing the Shanghai Basketball Association's Group Jia schedule with a record of five wins and zero losses, and winning the championship. Yesterday's game was light and interesting. Team Xin's victory was mainly due to Nanbu Yao Ya serving as center. Mai Ling was too careful, and Locke and Brizi were closely monitored, causing the entire team to lose its center of gravity and have fewer scoring opportunities. Technically, Team Xin was indeed above Mai Ling yesterday. The results are as follows:

After the Shanghai Basketball Association restored the participation of the two strong teams, Fudan and Jinan, Team Xin recruited important members from the two teams, and had long been determined to win the championship. In addition, Xintong gave up the concept of the championship and acted perfunctorily, so Mai Ling and Team Xin became confrontational. In the end, Team Xin was able to consolidate its position and win the throne with its lively performance.

Currently, there is still one game left in the Group A schedule, Mai Ling vs. Wu Long, to determine the runner-up. The situation is as follows:

The Mai Ling vs. Xin game started at 8 pm. There were about 300 Chinese spectators. After Ziwendayun opened the scoring, Mai Ling showed considerable activity, and Apaidajia scored repeatedly. Within five minutes, they took the lead with 7 to 4. Feng Nianhua threw two shots and took the lead with 8 to 7. Kang Deng also returned two balls, making it 11 to 8, causing Team Xin to temporarily regress. Goda Yun regained the advantage (12 to 11). In an instant, they lost three points again. In the midst of desperate struggles, it became 14 to 14. After Feng Nianhua scored a free throw on the 16th, Team Xin took the lead from then on. The first half ended with a score of 23 to 18.

In the renewed battle, Mai Ling showed considerable revitalization, but the dead-like appearance of the guards after getting the ball and the slow pace forward reduced the enthusiasm of the game. Furthermore, the defense under the basket was strict. It was difficult for Team Xin to attack. Team Xin's advance and retreat was rapid, and the charge under the basket was also very moving. A discerning person could already speculate on the final outcome. Therefore, although Mai Ling showed temporary ability, it had few scoring opportunities. Except for once when the score became close at 29 to 27, Team Xin often led by five or six points. When Zhou Weiyun, who scored the most points for Team Xin on the 28th and 33rd, was ejected due to four fouls, Mai Ling was ultimately unable to stir up waves and reverse the situation, and ultimately lost by five points with a score of 34 to 29.

Team Mai Ling Yi defeated Team Ying 48 to 24 yesterday. The first half ended with a score of 31 to 8. The team completed the Group A Group Yi championship with a record of six wins and zero losses.

### World Education Conference Held in Japan

Countries not recognized by the League of Nations are participating.

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th) It is rumored that the World Education Conference, which will be held in Japan in August of this year, will have countries not recognized by the League of Nations participating. In case this becomes a reality, the Chinese Education Society has pre-prepared questions to solicit opinions from its members on how to deal with it.

### Publisher's Talk on Textbook Pricing

Books are ineffective and equal to waste paper, and paper prices are soaring. The cost cannot be calculated with pure labor and materials.

(Central News Agency) A reporter visited an important employee of a bookstore about the issue of textbook pricing. According to him, since the Qing Dynasty promoted new-style education, textbooks have been compiled and printed by bookstores. Last year, the Ministry of Education summoned four companies, Commercial Press, Chung Hwa, World, and Zheng Zhong, to the Ministry to discuss printing textbooks compiled by the Ministry. Since the government has decided to compile its own books, from an educational standpoint, each company should do its best to assist. Therefore, they resolutely signed a contract with the Ministry of Education to print the books and were willing to assume 100,000 yuan per year to assist in editing costs in order to complete the Ministry's compilation of textbooks as soon as possible. After signing the contract, they did their best to rush the printing of the books compiled by the Ministry and fully prepared enough stock for schools in various places to adopt. Because the textbooks for each subject have not yet been compiled into a complete set, it is difficult to sell all the stocks at once. Each company has put aside a lot of capital. If it is said that they are profiting from this, it is simply not true. As for the outside world saying that textbook prices are too high, it is important to know that the cost of any business cannot be calculated with pure labor and materials. Moreover, other industries can turn their inventory into treasures when it is unavoidable, but books are ineffective or out of date, which is equal to waste paper. Although textbooks have very large sales when they are first compiled, they must be revised at most every three years. Whenever they are revised, old textbooks must be cut and destroyed due to their obsolescence. When the new curriculum standards for the Republic of China were promulgated in 1933, each Shanghai publisher destroyed more than 80 million elementary school textbooks. If the initial pricing does not include this loss, then the publishing companies will inevitably go bankrupt when the Ministry compiles and revises the textbooks after three years. Furthermore, paper prices have recently soared, and newspaper prices have almost doubled, but the book industry has not increased book prices slightly for fear of increasing the burden on the reading community and affecting education. The criticism from the outside world is due to a great lack of knowledge of the situation in the book industry.

Peiming Girls' Middle School, located on Hede Road, Xinzha Road in this port, has been established for more than ten years. Its strict management, excellent results, have long been praised by society. Since moving from McBain Road to the current school address, South Garden Building, last year, the development has been even more rapid. The number of students was originally more than 400, but has now increased to more than 700. Principal Jin Yuezhang deeply believes, based on his personal experience, that those who sacrifice and fight for the cause of education will surely gain the final success and comfort. This semester, with the greatest effort, the school will take further steps to seek the complete equipment and reform of training and administrative administration with resolution and plans. In terms of equipment, the following have been put into practice one after another: a complete set of physical and chemical instruments, 1,500 books, complete sets of animal and plant specimens have been purchased. In addition to the original basketball court, volleyball court, and tennis court, four new softball courts and health ball courts have been built. As for the proposition of training, to achieve strict teaching through active guidance and autonomy, with special emphasis on practice and oral answers, and abolishing monthly exams, striving for unified administrative structure, liaison, etc., all have been carefully considered.

There are two Shanghai Experimental Primary Schools: one established by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Department of Education, named Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School; the other established by the Shanghai Municipal Government Social Bureau, named Shanghai Municipal Experimental Primary School. This article describes the general situation of the various facilities of the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School. The general situation of the Municipal Experimental Primary School will be introduced in another article. The author is grateful to Mr. Sheng Langxi, the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School, for providing various materials and for giving me a summary of the school's overview. I would like to express my thanks here.

1. School History

The Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School was founded in the 癸卯 year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (i.e., eight years before the founding of the Republic of China), and has a history of thirty-four years. At that time, Shanghai County gentry Ji Huike, Yao Wengou and others raised funds to open a primary school in the Minzong and Liugong ancestral halls in the Twenty-Two Shop area of Shanghai County, named Twenty-Two Shop Primary School. Mr. Mai Jiying and Mr. Yang Yueru served as directors. On the first day of school, only twenty-seven students attended.

Two years later, the Jiangsu Songtai Dao opened the Longmen Normal School, and the Twenty-Two Shop Primary School was changed to an attached primary school, named Longmen Normal School Affiliated Primary School. In March of the first year of the Republic of China, the Longmen Normal School was renamed Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School, and the school was also renamed Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School Affiliated Primary School. At this time, Mr. Mai Jiying served as the principal, and Mr. Yang Pingyu served as the director.

In May of the third year of the Republic of China, the school built a new school building at the old site of the Prefectural Office in Shangwen Gate, and the entire school was divided into two parts: the new school building in Shangwen Gate was the first part; the old school building of Minzhong and Liugong ancestral halls in Ximen was the first part. In August of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Provincial Second Normal School merged with the Shanghai Commercial College and other schools to reorganize into the National Fourth Sun Yat-sen University Shanghai Middle School, and the school was renamed the National Fourth Sun Yat-sen University Shanghai Middle School Experimental Primary School, with Mr. Sheng Langxi as the principal. Later, the school changed its name several times, and in July of the twenty-third year, it was renamed Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School. At the same time, the school built a new school building in Wujia Lane and added a third part.

### British Representative Mr. Beatley Emphasizes That Sino-British Cooperation Is Absolutely Necessary

With the vast populations and lands of both countries, they can influence the happiness of the world's humanity.

Mr. Beatley, the special representative of the British Export Credit Guarantee Bureau in China, gave a speech at the banquet of the Sino-British Alumni Association the day before yesterday, strongly advocating that China and Britain must cooperate effectively. The following is a translation of the main points of his speech.

"I am honored to be invited by the chairman of your association to participate. I believe that you do not want me to give any formal speech, but I hope that you will allow me to talk casually. Yesterday, I received a notice from your association and recalled that a century ago, Sir Parkes, the first British Minister to China, said at a gathering of the same nature, 'I believe that the true friendship between the two countries is based on the love of the people of the two countries and is obtained through communication and cooperation. The realization of this will not be far away.' The main purpose of your association is to maintain the interest of you in the education you received in the UK. By the UK, I mean Scotland and Wales, not the entire British Empire. You have studied or practiced in schools in England and Scotland. I believe that you can understand the lives and thoughts of the people of our country, and what is especially noteworthy is that you can sympathize with our country's intentions towards friendly countries. I believe that our expatriates must also be able to contribute a lot to the motherland, that is, they can guide and help us understand the lives, thoughts, and political situation of the people of their country. If they do not have a good impression of the people of the country where they are located, then we will not be able to gain anything from it. Now, I sincerely hope that the people of our country who live in China, if they return home, will be able to give the people of our country a correct understanding of the Chinese people. Similarly, I also hope that the Chinese who have studied in the UK will work hard to promote the understanding between China and Britain, so that the people of your country will know what you have learned in the UK, promote the friendship between the two countries, and increase the interests of the two countries. I also hope that those of you who have studied in the UK, as well as the people of enemy countries who live in China, will criticize and study the living conditions of the people of both countries at any time. It is necessary to know that well-intentioned criticism is very necessary, so I now suggest that your association organize various debate meetings so that you can freely discuss various issues, such as a certain action, special thoughts, and temporary unusual trends. When it is necessary to expose, test, and explain, I believe that this kind of friendly debate can eliminate various misunderstandings and obtain a correct understanding. Otherwise, true harmony and sincere understanding will not be possible. I have traveled to many countries and have this confidence. I dare to embrace this goal and make friends with people from all walks of life in your country. Now I am exploring the differences and similarities between the thoughts, customs, habits, forms, hobbies, family life, moral concepts, and social order of the people of the two countries, but it is easier to explore the similarities than to observe the differences. It is expected that the similarities must be more than the differences. These are all things that we must tolerate, understand, and sympathize with. If we see them in our thoughts and actions, then the love of the two countries and their people can be expressed. China has almost one-quarter of the world's population, and Britain has almost one-quarter of the world's land. These two major countries almost represent 45 percent of the world's 200,000 population. If a world conference is convened and elections are held, and this kind of election can control the world, then China and Britain must be able to gain an advantage due to their large populations and land. Although there is no such fact now, the cooperation on these two major political units must be of great importance to world peace and human happiness. We can be proud of the history and culture of the two countries, but in the past, we have all sought individual development. However, today, we must work together to seek happiness for all mankind. To achieve this goal, the only way is to establish and promote true friendship. My mission in coming to China this time is to enable our country's goods to be exported to your country by credit methods. I hope that all the imported goods will be of good quality. I also hope that every invoice and every bill of lading will be accurate and error-free. I also hope that the friendship between the two countries will increase with trade. I can only reiterate what Sir Parkes said to the Shanghai business community on September 6, 1883. What I am most pleased about is to support China's development and to enable close contacts between the people of the two countries. I now sincerely agree with this statement and hope that the British living in China will understand this and engage in close cooperation to seek mutual understanding. I think it is also the urgent hope of both China and Britain."

### Telegrams from Various Groups in Kaifeng in Response

Declaration of the National Salvation Movement for Unification, and hope that the whole country will uphold the same

Twenty-five groups including the Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce in Henan sent a telegram to the China Cultural Construction Association in response to the declaration of the National Salvation Movement for Unification, and hoped that the whole country would uphold the same. The original telegram said, "To the Shanghai China Cultural Construction Association, your association launched the National Salvation Movement for Unification, and your great words and opinions are admired by all. If you sincerely want to resist the enemy and save the country, you must first seek domestic unification. Eliminating the bandits and suppressing the rebels is the most urgent task at present. People here are rising up in response, suppressing heresy, and maintaining human discipline. They are willing to follow the wise men and save the situation together. We hereby send a telegram in response and hope that the whole country will uphold the same. Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce and twenty-five other groups send their regards."

The problem of improving the treatment conditions for workers of the Shanghai Tram Company, a British company in the Public Concession, Zhu Guilin, a staff member of the Social Bureau, Yu Yaoqiu, a cadre of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the General Trade Union, and Gong Yuting, a standing committee member, advised worker representatives Yang Zhaoyu and others once at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, and went to the tram company on Suzhou Road at 3:00 p.m. to continue mediation with the manager Evans and the compradore Hu Zixing. All the terms have been agreed upon. The retirement pay is determined according to the length of service as a standard. Those who have served for one year will be given one month's pay, and the rest will be calculated by analogy. However, the company insisted on raising the lowest level of wages from 20 yuan to 22 yuan and the highest level from 32 yuan to 35 yuan. For example, those whose wages are 20 yuan will receive an increase of 2 yuan, but those above 21 yuan will only need to add 1 yuan, which has not been resolved.

### Good Situation of Chinese Sugar Industry Last Year

Annual Sales Reached More Than 340,000 Bags, Although Smuggling in North China Was Rampant, Fortunately It Did Not Affect

According to the Central News Agency, smuggling was rampant in North China last year, and smuggled sugar was rampant, but the Chinese sugar operators who were operating properly in the city all reported profits at the end of the year. According to statistics, the sales volume of domestically produced machine-made sugar in one year has reached 3,428,360 bags. The reporter specially investigated the situation of the sugar industry in the city as follows:

Joint Stock Company Sets Prices for Package Sales

For a long time, our country has been a huge importer of foreign sugar, accounting for the second position in the trade deficit. The ups and downs of the sugar market have always been controlled by foreign merchants in Hong Kong. After Shanghai Chinese merchants directly purchased from various producing areas, the sugar market moved from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Yuegui Sugar Factory was established the year before last. Xinghua Bank, a major sugar merchant in the city, gathered sugar merchants from all over the city and organized a joint stock company to set prices for package sales. If there were any unsold products, Xinghua Bank would sweep them all for package sales. Shanghai has become the center for promoting the sales of domestic sugar. If there is a shortage, foreign sugar will be purchased.

Well-Organized Sugar Market Stable

Sugar is a daily necessity, and it is very important to the people's livelihood. The sugar merchants in the city are unwilling to kill each other and unite in a common spirit. The joint stock company last spring and summer, the price of sugar fell daily, and the domestic sugar stored in Shanghai reached 200,000 bags, worth several million yuan. Although the consumption was lost day by day, it was decided not to reduce the price for promotion in order to stabilize the sugar market. This is entirely due to the well-organized organization, which can avoid foreign manipulation.

Sales are Brisk in Tianjin, Hankou and Other Places

Sugar is sold a lot in Tianjin, Hankou, Suzhou and Hangzhou. Chaozhou, Shantou, Minyue are the areas where sugar is produced. The reason why the national sugar market regards Shanghai as a transfer is that it knows the world market situation and knows the situation of sugar merchants in various ports. It delivers goods first and sets a date for payment. This is something that Taikoo and Dutch sugar merchants dare not do. Chinese merchants are more determined to purchase foreign sugar only when domestic sugar sales are not good. Therefore, domestic sugar sales are bound to be brisk.

Excellent Production, Promising Future

At present, the products of the Yuegui Dongguan Shunde Market Head Three Factories in our country are comparable to imported products. However, the machines of the Huiyang, Jieyang, Xinzhao and Guixian factories are slightly inferior due to machine relations. If they are improved, the future of domestic sugar is unlimited. Smuggling in North China last year did not affect domestic sugar, which was purely due to the fact that the joint stock company and sugar merchants were able to promote domestic products and did not compete for private interests.

### Jiangxi Yumin Bank to be Reorganized into Provincial Bank

Increase in Government Shares by One Million - Expected to be Realized Soon

According to the Xinxin News Agency, Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, in order to alleviate the financial drought and revitalize industry, intends to reorganize the Jiangxi Yumin Bank into the Jiangxi Provincial Bank, increasing government shares by one million yuan to make it the only local bank in Jiangxi province. Agreement has been obtained from the majority of shareholders, and it is expected to be realized soon. The details are as follows:

History of Yumin Bank

In 1926, when the Revolutionary Army recaptured Nanchang, the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, which had been organized during the warlord era, was declared bankrupt. In 1927, Huang Shi, the Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance, prepared to restore it, with the provincial government and the original creditors each contributing 500,000 yuan, totaling one million yuan. This joint government-business Jiangxi Yumin Bank was officially established in January 1928. By 1932, in order to fulfill the mission of a local bank, it was decided to expand the business area, invest in construction projects, and facilitate the transportation and sale of products as the business policy. Significant progress has been made to date. The head office is located in Nanchang, with branches in Jiujiang, Ji'an, Fuzhou, Hekou, and Raozhou. There are 24 offices in Shanghai, Wucheng, Wuning, etc. The business is still quite developed.

Reasons for Reorganization

Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi Province, in view of the past, due to the impact of banditry and natural disasters in Jiangxi, society was devastated, and all industries were depressed, with the prices of various production items plummeting. In order to revive the industry and prosper society, it is planned to strengthen the organization of the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, so as to invigorate finance and assist all industries. Therefore, a plan was specifically drafted to reorganize the Yumin Bank into the Jiangxi Provincial Bank, expanding government shares to 1.5 million yuan. In addition to the original 500,000 yuan, an additional one million yuan will be added, combined with 500,000 yuan in commercial shares, totaling two million yuan, in order to increase its strength. The draft articles of association have been circulated to solicit the opinions of the various shareholders. According to the Xinxin News Agency reporter, the directors and shareholders of the bank have all expressed their approval of the provincial government's move. Therefore, a shareholders' meeting will be convened soon to formally realize it.

Can Return South to Resume Duties in Two More Weeks

According to the Central News Agency, Song Ziliang, Director of the Finance Department of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has been in Shanghai for more than a month for medical treatment. According to Song's aides, Song suffers from rheumatism, which recurs every spring and summer in Guangdong due to the humid climate. Coupled with his busy official duties, his old illness relapsed. He came to Shanghai and was admitted to the Ansi Hospital for treatment. He is now gradually recovering and will be able to return south to resume his duties in two more weeks of rest.

### Legislative Yuan Agrees to Refer to Amendments to the Income Tax Regulations

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously convened representatives from chambers of commerce along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou and Ningbo lines, as well as representatives from various trade associations in Shanghai, to hold a research meeting on income tax and resolved several proposals. After the meeting, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sorted them out separately. Regarding the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, they were submitted to the Legislative and Executive Yuan, requesting that they be adopted and amended. A reply was received from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan stating, "To the esteemed, we have received a document from the President regarding the meeting convened by the chambers of commerce along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line and various trade associations in the city, regarding the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, requesting additions, deletions, and amendments to various points. The petition was approved and referred to the Finance Committee for reference." The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has notified the various chambers of commerce accordingly.

### Various Industries Improve Bookkeeping After Implementation of Income Tax

Chamber of Commerce Opens Classes in the South City to Teach

After the implementation of the income tax, the bookkeeping and accounting records of various industries in this city have become very important. They have been actively discussing improvements. Currently, the Soybean and Rice Industry, the Sauce and Pickles Industry, and the Silk and Satin Industry have all established special committees to collect the books and records used by the various member stores, compare and study them one by one, standardize the names, prescribe the formats, and distribute them to the various members for application, starting from this year, so as to avoid any troubles when inspecting the books in the future. The various trade associations in the South City requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to open classes to teach improved Chinese-style bookkeeping. In the past, the classes were held in the North City and in the evening, making it inconvenient to travel to and from, and many were unable to participate. Therefore, they specifically requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to open a special class in the South City to meet the demand. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce has decided to open a class in improved Chinese-style bookkeeping and a class in income tax research at the Shangji Vocational School on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen. The bookkeeping class will be held every Tuesday and Thursday, and the income tax class will be held every Saturday and Sunday. Classes will be held from 7 PM to 9 PM. The tuition fee for the bookkeeping class is six yuan, and the tuition fee for the income tax class is four yuan, including handouts. The Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm is still invited to lecture. The starting date is set for March 1st. Registration and payment will be accepted at the Shangji Vocational School from today.

### He Shangping Discusses the Sericulture Industry in Guangdong Province

Early Spring and Late Autumn are Best for Raising Silkworms; Outlines Improvement Steps

According to the Xinxin News Agency, He Shangping, Director of the Sericulture Improvement Committee of the National Economic Council, was invited by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction and the Guangzhou Municipal Government to inspect the sericulture situation in Guangdong. He has completed his task and returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency paid him a special visit to inquire about the inspection process and future improvement plans. According to him, regarding how to improve the sericulture industry in Guangdong Province, since returning from the inspection, he has begun to draft a plan for improvement, detailing the improvement steps. The plan is still being sorted out and will be released to the public after being reviewed by Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Yangfu and Guangdong Construction Director Liu Weichi. As for his impressions of the trip to Guangdong, they are good, but the improvement of sericulture is a scientific matter and cannot be encompassed by a single "good" word. Analytically speaking, the silkworm rearing areas in Guangdong Province are concentrated in Shunde and Lianglong. Although there is production in Hainan, it is very small, so we only went to the two places to inspect. In the past, when the silk production in Guangdong was at its peak, it reached 30,000 piculs, almost half of the silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Considering the proportion of the area of the production area, the production volume was shocking. However, because they did not pay attention to the improvement of technology, it gradually decreased. Last year's production was less than 10,000 piculs. The rapid decline is deeply regrettable. Guangdong Province has a warm climate, which is very suitable for silkworm rearing. The best seasons of the year are the big season (Cantonese), which is now in early spring, and the sixth and seventh seasons, which are in late autumn in October and November. At other times, the temperature is either too high or it is rainy and stuffy. Therefore, early spring and late autumn are the most suitable seasons for silkworm rearing in Guangdong Province. However, the development of mulberry leaves is very good due to the climate. One mu of mulberry land can produce as much as 27 or 28 piculs of mulberry leaves per year, and it does not require cultivation. Compared to the well-cultivated mulberry land in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which produces a maximum of 6 or 7 piculs per mu per year, the proportion is vastly different.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Sends Kong Xuexiong to Investigate the Shanghai Fish Market

According to the Shenzhou News Agency, Zhu Jiasheng, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, specially sent Kong Xuexiong, a member of the Fisheries Management Committee, to Shanghai to investigate the production and sales situation of the fish market in order to provide a reference for the development of the fishery industry in Zhejiang Province. The fish market, because 80% of the fish come from Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taizhou and other counties in Zhejiang Province, the Shanghai fish market is most related to the Zhejiang fish dishes and the lives of the fishermen. After arriving in Shanghai, Kong went to the fish market yesterday afternoon, where he was received and visited by Secretary Ren Jinpin, and then studied and investigated. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for three days before returning to Hangzhou.

The Lives of Fishermen are Extremely Difficult

According to Kong, Zhejiang Province is rich in fishery products, most of which are concentrated in Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taizhou and other areas, with about 20 counties on the sea. There are about 2 million fishermen in the province. As for the production of fish, there are no statistics, but it is roughly estimated that there are 5 million yuan of freshwater fish and about 20 million yuan of marine fish. The lives of fishermen are extremely difficult, even worse than that of farmers. The biggest reasons are that 1) the price of fish is low, 2) the sea is unsafe, and 3) there is no guarantee of catching fish. As a result, fishermen have developed special personalities, such as not being able to catch fish for several days, and then spending money casually as soon as they make a lot of money, without knowing how to save. Therefore, it is very important to improve the organization of the fishery industry and improve the education of fishermen.

Zhejiang Province's Measures to Reorganize the Fishery Industry

The Zhejiang Province's measures to reorganize the fishery industry are as follows: 1) A fishery loan of 2 million yuan has been established, which is jointly loaned by the Zhejiang Local Bank and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, of which one million yuan is used for business loans, such as various construction costs in the fishery industry, and another million yuan is used for fisherman loans to help them maintain their livelihoods. 2) Actively protecting fishing, as pirates appear on the sea, which affects the activities of fishermen. Protecting their safety is essential. 3) Technical and sales aspects are being planned. 4) Fishery salt is an important product for the fishery industry, and there may be control measures in the future. 5) Strengthening and reorganizing fishermen's organizations. In the past, there were only fishery guilds, etc., and there were very few cooperatives and fishery associations. 6) Improving the education level of fishermen to improve technology and increase production. 7) Reorganizing the water patrol system. 8) Conducting fishery vessel registration and fishery statistics so that the entire province's fishery industry can be checked.

### Workers at Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory Resumed Work Yesterday

Social Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Mediate on the 20th

More than 300 workers at the Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory on Haizhou Road went on strike to demand improved treatment. After persuasion from the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers resumed work yesterday. It is reported that the Bureau has scheduled to convene both labor and management at 9 AM on the 20th to mediate.

### Factory at New Yu No. 2 Factory Went on Strike Again Yesterday After Resuming Work

Party and Government Agencies to Investigate Today

According to the Dagong News Agency, all the workers at the New Yu Textile Company No. 2 Factory on Route Robison in Western Shanghai went on strike some time ago to demand improved treatment and made six demands to the factory. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, they resumed work yesterday. The workers in the fine spinning department of the company's No. 1 Factory at 37 Suzhou Road also demanded that the factory pay them double wages for the New Year and provide rest time. When their demands were not met, they went on strike at 1 PM. The workers in other departments continued to work as usual and were not affected. The factory immediately released all the workers in that department. At about 6 PM, when the night shift came on, some of the workers also joined the strike and refused to enter the factory. It is reported that party and government agencies will send people to investigate the truth today in order to mediate and prevent the labor unrest from expanding.

### No Solution Yet to the Layoff Dispute at the Public Welfare Yarn Factory

Factory to Issue Severance Pay Tomorrow

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Public Welfare Yarn Factory at 150 Route Robison in Western Shanghai announced the dismissal of more than 300 workers in the bobbin room, etc., the labor side insisted on paying six months' severance pay, but the capital side only agreed to one month. Due to the wide difference in opinion, a labor unrest occurred and has not been resolved. It is now reported that the factory has announced that it will distribute severance pay to the laid-off workers at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 19th. The workers will decide what to do next based on the amount of severance pay they receive.

### Rice Merchants Eagerly Hope Government Will Not Allow Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice

Last year, there were bumper harvests in agricultural areas across the country, and the rural economy was active. As domestic rice supply exceeded demand, rice prices steadily declined. Since the Lunar New Year, market prices have remained flat and sluggish. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency interviewed rice merchant Zhu Zixiang to understand the situation of grain merchants and rice prices. Mr. Zhu told the reporter that the business of grain merchants across the country improved last year, farmers' incomes were quite substantial, and all industries and transportation reported surpluses. This is sufficient to prove that the rural economy has recovered slightly. The main point is that our country is based on agriculture. The prosperity or decline of the countryside is related to the lifeline of the national economy. Therefore, government officials spare no effort in the work of revitalizing the countryside. Countries around the world also attach great importance to the countryside. However, the rice prices in this port are because Guangdong Province is requesting tax exemption for foreign rice again. If the government approves it, the rice price will plummet, which is expected. As a result, rice sales areas are all waiting and watching. Those who have suffered from the dumping of foreign rice in previous years still feel the pain when they think about it. Upon hearing the news of foreign rice tax exemption, they all carefully consider and delay importing, resulting in very sluggish sales and a drop in rice prices. However, it is difficult for the public to understand why Guangdong Province insists on requesting tax exemption for foreign rice. If the province is really short of rice, why not purchase it from the surplus rice provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui in our country? As for the rice price in Guangdong Province, it is not very high. The reported price of 17 or 18 yuan per picul is the silver dollar price. Because 1,500 Guangdong dollars are exchanged for 1,000 Hong Kong dollars, 10 yuan is already equivalent to 15 yuan. A rice price of 18 yuan per picul is only 12 yuan in national currency, which is not much different from the rice price in Shanghai. However, the claim that one yuan can buy six sheng of rice is unknown what kind of weight scale is used in that province. According to the highest-priced rice in Shanghai, plus all the expenses, and water transport to the province, one yuan can buy one jin. Moreover, the rice transported by Guangdong merchants in Shanghai still needs to make a profit. It is difficult to guess what the truth is. What is most worrying is that the countryside is recovering. If it is dumped by foreign rice again, not only will the financial outflow, but also the rural areas that were celebrating will be feared to go bankrupt. The collapse of the economy is a hidden worry. I think the government authorities will plan and will not easily approve it.

### Demand for Socks in the Three Northeastern Provinces Exceeds Supply

Shanghai Goods Gradually Selling Well

According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the sock sales in the markets of the three northeastern provinces were originally a major sales market for the Shanghai knitting industry. After the September 18th Incident, because the environment of the factories was no longer the same as before, and the puppet state levied exorbitant taxes, making it difficult to transport there at cost, they had no choice but to give up the market with heartache. Recently, due to the immaturity of the knitting industry in that area, although some small factories from Shanghai have moved there to produce, the output does not meet the demand. Moreover, due to technical and other expenses, the cost is higher. Therefore, customers in that area have come south to purchase. Although the puppet state's taxes have not been reduced, it is heard that the tax on ordinary thread socks is about 4 jiao per dozen in national currency. However, transportation and sales are unobstructed. Recently, there have been small transactions with customers in Shenyang and other places. In order to promote sales, the customer factories are selling at the lowest original cost, hoping to gradually develop.

### Qianzhuang Abolishes Check Notification Procedures

The Shanghai Qianye Guild has informed various qianzhuang and their customers that the usual practice of requiring customers to notify the qianzhuang after issuing a check for 500 or 1,000 yuan before the payment can be made (i.e., the stub) is in conflict with Article 31, Section 5 of the current Negotiable Instruments Law. The industry colleagues have convened a meeting and resolved to abolish the notification procedure for all customers who use checks from the various qianzhuang in the industry after the end of the 25th year and the start of operations. To support the check, once the issuer issues the check, he is legally responsible for the full payment. A notice has been published in the newspaper yesterday to inform all check users to pay close attention when issuing checks.

### National Goods Industry Federation Prepares to Go to Hebei for Exhibition

Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting to be Held on the 20th to Discuss the Progress of Association Affairs

The National Goods Industry Federation of this city received a letter from the Jiaxing County National Goods Promotion Association requesting to hold a national goods exhibition to promote national goods. The original letter stated, "To the esteemed, we have received a public letter No. 29 from the Jiaxing County New Life Movement Promotion Association, which states that foreign goods are flooding our country, the leakage of wealth is increasing day by day, the economic panic is increasing, and unemployment is increasing sharply. The reason for this is that, on the one hand, the national goods in the past have not been improved, and cannot compete with foreign goods side by side. On the other hand, the people are ignorant of the national conditions because of the beauty of foreign goods, and they compete to purchase them. Although there are those who use national goods for their business, they are deceived by unscrupulous merchants because they cannot identify them and are deceived by unscrupulous merchants who use foreign goods to impersonate national goods. Therefore, many people are mistakenly purchased. What is a national good and what is a foreign good must be made clear to the people so that the promotion of national loans can be effective. Therefore, at the seventh board of directors meeting, it was resolved that 1) the United Federation of Shanghai and Hangzhou National Goods Factories will be contacted to hold a national goods exhibition in Jiaxing in the shortest possible time. 2) Institutions and groups that employ public goods personnel should conduct regular lectures so that they can uniformly recognize and speak about national goods. The records of the two cases are recorded in the file. Correspondingly, the file is recorded and sent to you for approval." In view of this, promoting national goods is an urgent task for saving the country. A national goods exhibition will give the people a deep understanding, so as to arouse the people to compete for purchase by understanding. It is an urgent plan. We have always admired your association's enthusiasm for promotion and sparing no effort. This is probably a consensus. In response to the previous letter, we will send personnel to Jiaxing in the shortest possible time to hold a national goods exhibition to promote and benefit national goods. We hope to see a reply. After receiving the letter, the association decided to hold a joint executive and supervisory committee meeting at the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road at 12 noon on the 20th of this month to discuss everything and the progress of the association's affairs.

### Police Bureau Orders All Smoking Cessation Centers to Promote Chinese Medicine for Quitting Smoking

Previously, the Central Medical Hall Designated Experts to Research; General Order Issued for Trial Use, with Instructions to Report Progress Regularly

The Municipal Police Bureau, in accordance with the instructions from the Military Commission's Anti-Smoking Supervisor, specifically ordered all smoking cessation hospitals and Chinese medicine organizations to promote the use of Chinese medicine formulas for quitting smoking. The order and smoking cessation formulas are delivered and recorded as follows:

Order to All Hospitals:

As per the Municipal Government Order No. 2340: A case involves the Anti-Smoking Supervisor's Order No. 4556, dated the 14th day of a certain month in the 16th year. It is noted that while sending smokers to hospitals for treatment is the primary principle for quitting, some smokers believe in Chinese medicine and are unwilling to take Western medicine. As long as it is non-toxic and effective, it should be promoted equally. Regarding this method of quitting smoking with Chinese medicine, the Central Chinese Medicine Hall was previously instructed to designate experts for detailed research. Now, the Hall has sent five simple Chinese medicine quitting formulas. In addition to collecting effective formulas for further distribution, the attached simple formulas from the Hall are to be used for trial purposes as deemed appropriate. The progress of the trials should be reported to the Municipal Government for record and future reference. This order includes a paper with simple Chinese medicine quitting formulas. Having received this order, besides notifying the Health Bureau, all smoking cessation hospitals and Chinese medical organizations in the city are instructed to promote trial use, and to report the progress for review. The original document is attached for the Bureau's information. This order...

Chinese Medicine Quitting Formulas:

(1) Zhao Gong's Pine Resin Ointment: Take 100 catties of fresh pine needles (preferably the ends of pine branches). First, remove impurities and insects, wash with clean water, chop on a clean mat, and then crush in a mortar. Filter the crushed pine needles three times with clean cloth and boil the juice in a steel pot. Add two catties of brown sugar to every 100 catties of pine needle juice to make a paste. For severe addiction, take one qian per dose; for mild addiction, take half a qian per dose. After sixty days, or two weeks for some, the addiction will naturally be broken. (Explanation) This formula was repeatedly tested and proven effective by the former Qing Dynasty Sichuan Governor Zhao. Wang Shixiong's "Dietary Manual" also includes this method under the "Opium" section. According to Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica," pine needles are bitter, warm, non-toxic, and good for treating wind-dampness, promoting hair growth, pacifying the five internal organs, and preventing hunger. (2) Quitting Smoking Green Bean Wine: Three catties of aged distilled liquor, two liang of mung beans. Put them together in a jar, seal tightly, and open after one hundred days. The idea is to use liquor to combat the craving, and mung beans to detoxify. (Explanation) Drink this wine whenever the craving arises, to the point of intoxication. After drinking, expect several episodes of diarrhea within three to five days (or four to five days for some), to purge the accumulated toxins from the intestines and stomach. No other medicine is needed. Continue drinking the wine as before, until the toxins are eliminated, the diarrhea stops, and the addiction is gone. (3) Qi Lin Gong's Longevity Elixir: Take the entire pumpkin plant, including the roots, vines, flowers (when the flower is just blooming), leaves, and the pumpkin itself (unripe pumpkins are even better). Wash, mash, and squeeze the juice. Regular consumption several times will completely eliminate the addiction. (Explanation) According to the "Materia Medica," pumpkins are sweet, warm, and non-toxic, and can strengthen the middle and boost qi. (4) Raw Chicken Eggs: After smoking each cigarette, immediately eat three raw chicken eggs. Do this every time, without interruption. Stop smoking after a few days, and the craving will not return, with no pain. (Explanation) Old chicken eggs nourish the body and moisturize the skin, and this aligns with the modern theory of lecithin. (5) Quisqualis indica dates: Remove the pits from red dates, stuff them with Quisqualis indica seeds, roast until cooked, and eat ten dates a day to eliminate the addiction. (Explanation) According to the "Materia Medica," dates replenish spleen qi, and Quisqualis indica can eliminate accumulations and kill parasites. There are many types of Chinese medicine formulas for quitting smoking, too numerous to list. However, even with many effective formulas, if one does not persevere, the quitting attempt will start but ultimately relapse. As the saying goes, "Quitting smoking is easy, dispelling doubt is difficult." Therefore, in addition to perseverance, one must have absolute faith in the chosen formula. With faith, doubt is eliminated; with doubt eliminated, the addiction is broken. Otherwise, even a magical elixir will be ineffective. For those who became addicted due to illness, treatment should be tailored to the illness and not treated generically.

### Law Clerk Shen Xinglu Extorted Money by Impersonating a Detective

Colluded with a Westerner to Break into Homes to Search for Opium and Extort Money; The Victim's Relative Followed Him and Discovered the Impersonation

Shen Xinglu, a native of Ningbo and the law clerk of lawyer Shi Jiutang, is 29 years old and resides at No. 2, Lane 76, Broadway Road. He was previously fined 400 yuan in the French Concession for fraud, but he did not learn from his mistakes. The other day, he was arrested by the Jing'an Temple police for impersonating a detective and colluding with others to intimidate people. Li Jiren from Suzhou and a woman named Shen Lao-si were also arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted Shen Xinglu in the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for violating Article 346 of the criminal law, which is

Extortion by Intimidation.

The lawyer stated that at 3:30 PM yesterday, a Westerner and five Chinese men suddenly broke into the home of Shi Huanzhang at No. 8, Fan Zhi Lane, No. 303, Moore Road. They claimed to be Chinese and Western detectives dispatched by the police to search for heroin. They even produced a white paper with red letters resembling a court search warrant. They then went upstairs and began searching. Shi's aunt happened to be smoking opium, and the group

Took Advantage of the Situation

and demanded 1,000 yuan. Otherwise, they would take her to the police station. The aunt was terrified and negotiated with them. As a result, she immediately paid them 400 yuan, and the group left. However, Shi's relative, Wang Shoushan, secretly followed them. He saw the group walk a few steps and then hire rickshaws going towards the French Concession. Wang was very surprised because public concession detectives would not enter the French Concession. So, he continued to follow them secretly. He saw them get out of the rickshaws at Yongle Lane, Kaizier Road, and enter house number 3. Wang

Immediately Telephoned

Shi and reported it to the Jing'an Temple police station. The police sent Chinese and Western detectives, along with detectives from the French Concession, to No. 3 Yongle Lane, and arrested the three defendants. Wang Chunshan identified the defendant Shen Xinglu as one of the people who impersonated detectives at the scene. The criminal involvement of the other two, Li Jiren and Shen Lao-si, has not yet been clarified, so the prosecution has requested their detention to apprehend the accomplices. According to the testimony of witness Wang Chunshan, at 3:30 PM yesterday, he suddenly heard a knock on the door. He opened the small door

To Inquire About the Matter.

He saw a person wearing an overcoat asking if Mr. Shi was at home. He said he came to wish him a Happy New Year. Wang replied that Shi was not at home. The person then asked if Mrs. Chen was at home. Wang thought that since it was a New Year's visit and the person was alone, he opened the door and invited him in. Unexpectedly, a Westerner and three Chinese men followed him inside. They said they were dispatched by the police to search for heroin. When they saw Shi's aunt smoking opium, they became even more demanding, attempting to extort 1,000 yuan. Later, it was agreed that they would give them 400 yuan, and the rest would be paid later. The group then left with the money.

Wang Followed Behind.

If they went to the police station, he would also go back. Unexpectedly, they hired rickshaws and entered the French Concession. Wang wondered why public concession detectives would enter the French Concession. He became suspicious and followed them closely to Yongle Lane, and then telephoned Shi Huanzhang. Wang testified that the defendant Shen Xinglu was indeed among those who came and stood in the middle of the staircase, etc. Shen Xinglu confessed that yesterday he went to Shao Laoyi's house at No. 1 Yongle Lane, Kaizier Road, French Concession, to wish him a Happy New Year. He met four people named Bu, and Chinese men Lu Caigen and Chen Sibao. Shao

Introduced Them.

Shao invited him to Moore Road to collect debts. He initially did not know that Shao and others were impersonating detectives and searching for opium as a pretext for extortion. Shen Lao-si confessed that she was acquainted with Shao Laoyi and went to her little sister's house yesterday to play mahjong. She was arrested on her way home and did not know anything about this case. Li Jiren confessed that he was a relative of Shen Lao-si and had just arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou by bus at 8 PM yesterday. He was immediately arrested and did not know Shao Laoyi, nor did he know anything about the extortion. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the confessions and ordered that the three defendants be remanded in custody separately for further investigation in seven days.

### National Child Welfare Association Concerned About Child Criminals

The National Child Welfare Association previously sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting the establishment of a reform school for child criminals, completely separate from the Huade Road Prison. The Public Works Department's Security Committee discussed this case and planned to send a reply to the association, stating that the establishment of a reform school was considered difficult to implement. However, if the association is concerned about the reform of child criminals, it can contact the Public Works Department's prison authorities to discuss a cooperation plan, so that children who have been reformed can receive protection after being released from prison. According to the department's opinion, the establishment of such a school would require financial consideration and did not seem essential. Although the current juvenile reformatory is located inside the prison, its location is separated from the prison by walls, making it a completely independent unit. The teachers are all experienced personnel who are qualified for the job. The prison authorities believe that establishing an organization to protect children after they leave the reformatory is more important than establishing another reform school. The Security Committee also believed that since the department's finances were already strained, it was not permissible to spend a large amount of money to run this type of school. At the Public Works Department's board meeting on the 17th of this month, it was resolved to approve the Security Committee's proposal and send a reply to the National Child Welfare Association.

### Gas Price Increased by Five Li

The Shanghai Gas Company previously sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting permission for the company to change its billing system from April 1st of this year. According to the new system, gas sales would be billed by "units," with prices increasing by about 5% compared to the previous system. A "unit" is equivalent to 10 cubic feet under the old system. The new and old price lists set by the company are listed below:

The company stated that the price increase was a last resort because the franchise tax and other taxes paid to the Public Works Department had increased sharply. According to the opinion of the Public Works Department's finance director, the company's request was reasonable. The company's shareholders were able to share dividends of 8% in previous years, but this had dropped to 4% by 1935. This was because the franchise tax and taxes paid to the Public Works Department had increased significantly after the completion of the new plant in the Eastern District and the headquarters on Yu Qiaqing Road. There was no waste in other expenses in recent years. The Public Works Committee then recommended to the board that the company's request to change the billing rate be approved. This recommendation was approved at the board meeting on the 17th of this month.

### Massage Girl Fainted After Drinking a Cup of Coffee

When She Regained Consciousness, Two Gold Rings Were Stolen; Lu Genlin, a Repeat Offender, Was Sentenced Yesterday

Lu Genlin, a native of this city, has no regular occupation. Recently, he impersonated the famous martial arts actor Zhang Yipeng, using various fraudulent techniques to deceive massage parlors and guides, stealing the clothes and jewelry of massage girls and guides. On the 19th of last month, Lu again defrauded the massage girls Zhou Xiaomei, Li Axiang, and Wang Gendi of the Sanmin Massage Parlor at No. 5, Lane 442, Haining Road, of one gold ring each, which he pawned for cash. The Hongkou police detective Zhang Desheng and Zhang Yaoji arrested Lu. It was discovered that Lu had not only defrauded the above three women but also cheated other female guides, including Zhang Mary Liang Ping, Zhang Caiying, Yang Zuifang, Jiang Mulan, Li Xiuying, Zhang Huizhen, Wang Aiying, and Chen Aidi, of their clothing and jewelry. The First Special District Court interrogated and detained him. This case was continued yesterday by Judge Pan Zhenyang in the Fifth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that in addition to the seven cases that the police had already prosecuted against Lu Genlin, they had now found four more similar cases. The method of defrauding was generally the same: he would rent a room and invite the guides over, using various methods to steal their jewelry. However, there was one case that differed slightly from the others. A massage girl named Zhang Ying was summoned by the defendant to room 316 of the New New Hotel on January 6th to give him a massage. After the massage was completed, the defendant asked Zhang to drink a cup of coffee. Zhang became unconscious as a result. When she regained consciousness, the two gold rings she was wearing on her hand had been taken away by the defendant. Therefore, the defendant has committed the crime of fraud as a habitual offender and should be severely punished as a warning to others. Zhang Ying and others then testified about the circumstances of being deceived. The defendant Lu also confessed to the crimes. Judge Pan reviewed the confessions and pronounced the judgment: Lu Genlin is sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for fraud as a habitual offender and a repeat offender. The Second Special District Court stated that Lu had also committed similar crimes in the French Concession, so it specially dispatched bailiff Li Shiquan to deliver the case and requested permission to transfer him. The court granted the request to transfer him. After the interrogation, he was sent back to serve his sentence.

### Zhu Xinyuan Guilty of Abortion

Fined Thirty Yuan, Yang Zhong-shi Sentenced to Six Months

Zhu Xinyuan, a local woman residing at No. 15, Shanhaiguan Road, is 21 years old and unmarried. She had an affair with a certain man, which led to pregnancy. Fearing criticism from her mother, she discussed abortion with her friend Tan Caidi. Tan introduced Zhu to Yang Zhong-shi, a woman from Zhenjiang at No. 215, Changping Road, to perform the abortion. The agreed

Surgical Fee

was 21 yuan. On November 14th of last year, Yang managed to induce the abortion, but due to poor surgery, Zhu suffered continuous bleeding from her lower body. She groaned in bed until January 3rd, when her condition worsened. Her mother discovered the situation and rushed her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported the case to the Gordon Road police station. After investigation, Yang Zhong-shi was arrested and prosecuted along with Zhu Xinyuan for the crime of abortion in the First Special District Court. Because Zhu's condition was serious and she could not leave the hospital for interrogation, the presiding judge

Went to the Hospital

to take her statement. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that Zhu Xinyuan had been released from the hospital and brought to the court with the consent of the hospital, but her illness had not yet been cured, so she still needed to be sent back for treatment. Zhu Xinyuan testified that Yang Zhong-shi did perform the abortion for her. Yang Zhong-shi claimed that her daughter, Mao Tou, used to work with Xinyuan in the same yarn factory and had a quarrel and fight with her. She admitted to having beaten up Xinyuan, leading to

False Accusations.

She denied performing the abortion and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Huang Risheng immediately pronounced the judgment in court. Zhu Xinyuan is fined 30 yuan for inducing an abortion by other means. Yang Zhong-shi is sentenced to six months of imprisonment for accepting a pregnant woman's request to perform an abortion for profit. After the sentencing, lawyer Fan Gang immediately requested that Yang Zhong-shi be allowed to post bail pending appeal. Judge Huang approved the request and ruled that she could be released on bail with an 800 yuan bond during the appeal period, pending appeal.

### Rickshaw Thefts Increasing Daily

Since the Municipal Public Works Department issued an order to eliminate the non-redemption group registration stickers for rickshaws, thieves have been increasingly active, believing that the non-redemption groups organized by rickshaw merchants in the northern and southern parts of the city have been virtually abolished. On the 17th of last month, rickshaw No. 9494, which was stolen at the Beijing Wharf, and rickshaw No. 4975, which was stolen on the 20th on Chuanxin Street, Lao Beimen, disappeared without a trace. New rickshaws have been put into operation. Recently, even during the end-of-year holidays, rickshaw thefts have remained rampant. On the night of the 9th of this month, Cai Jinshan's house at No. 52, Huining Road, had two rickshaws stolen, No. 6493 and No. 8863. Xia Huaixiang's house at No. 10, Tonghuai Lane, Guohuo Road, had rickshaw No. 5565 stolen. There have also been cases of rickshaws being stolen by tricking rickshaw pullers while they are working. For example, at 11:00 AM on the 11th, rickshaw puller Lin Junyuan was tricked into delivering two bundles of incense into a lane, and the rickshaw he was pulling, No. 5391, was stolen in an instant. At noon on the 12th, rickshaw puller Xu Xinlai left his rickshaw to hire a rickshaw for a passenger, and the rickshaw he was pulling, No. 9867, was also lost. At 9:00 AM on the 13th, Cui Shigui's rickshaw, No. 9585, was also stolen after he left it to hire a rickshaw. The rickshaw owner Cai Fangsheng learned that these thieves were led by Wu Er-meizi and Rong Tiancai, who resided somewhere in the French Concession. They even offered to return the rickshaws for 12 yuan. Cai prepared the money on the evening before last (the 15th) to wait for the rickshaw to be returned. However, Rong claimed that 13 yuan was too little and used this as an excuse to delay. While the dispute was escalating, Rong took the opportunity to escape. Cai then tied up his accomplices, Liu Huaimao and Jie Zongjing, and sent them to the French Concession police station. The police station transferred them to the Ximen Branch Bureau, as the case occurred in the Chinese Concession. The branch bureau then sent them to the price investigation team for interrogation and assistance in apprehending the main criminals and accomplices in order to fundamentally eliminate the crime.

### Rickshaw Pullers Petition This Morning to Avoid Carrying Raincoats

Public Works Department Representative Promises to Submit for Review

Rickshaw pullers in the Special District are required by the Public Works Department to carry raincoats even on sunny days, and the licenses are often misused.

They were received by Mr. Shituolin of the Traffic Management Department.

### New Facilities at the Sanatorium in its 26th Year

Opium has plagued China for a century, not only harming the body but also wasting money. It is a major obstacle to the rejuvenation of our Chinese nation. Since Director-General Chiang resolutely banned opium, the 26th year (of the Republic) marks a final turning point for opium addicts. However, most people smoke opium to alleviate pain caused by illness, leading to addiction. Therefore, quitting smoking is often feared. The Shanghai Lung Disease Sanatorium at 4 Daxi Road has recently added an opium detoxification department. The location is completely separated from lung disease patients, only admitting opium addicts. There is no risk of contracting lung disease. Regardless of age, amount of smoking, or presence of illness, patients can quit completely and painlessly, unknowingly. To save the poor, hospital fees for third and fourth-class wards are waived. There are two types of detoxification programs: a special class for 100 yuan, and a second class for 80 yuan, and a third class for 60 yuan, regardless of the amount of opium smoked. All oral and injectable medications are included, with no other fees.

### Post Office Smooths Out Mail to Sichuan

Low Water Level in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River; Large Numbers of Civilian Boats Hired for Transfer

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1389 states: Recently, the water level in the Yichang-Chongqing section of the upper Yangtze River has been low, resulting in few sailings and a backlog of goods. This has led to a large accumulation of parcels destined for Sichuan and Guizhou provinces in Yichang and Chongqing. As a result, the transfer of parcels to Sichuan has been inevitably delayed. To avoid prolonged delays, the Post Office has specially hired dozens of civilian boats to travel between Yichang and Chongqing during this period when shallow-draft vessels cannot resume sailing. It is estimated that the journey from Yichang to Chongqing will take approximately 30 days. This is hereby notified to all. Director Zha Peilin, February 15th.

### Architect Zhuang Jun Returns Home After Inspection Tour

Architect Zhuang Jun, who recently returned to China after an inspection tour of Europe and the United States, has extensively studied architecture during his travels across Europe and the New World. He has also observed progress in both material and spiritual aspects in various countries, further emphasizing the need for China to catch up quickly. Regarding architecture, his observations suggest that building forms are increasingly economical and practical. Therefore, few people are now creating ancient styles.

He has gained much from this trip and will pay special attention after returning to China.

### Merchants and Residents of Longhua Town Petition for Rectification of the Ancient Temple

Wandering Monks Occupy the Temple, Neglecting Practice; Debts Go Unpaid, Leading to Abuse

Longhua Temple in Longhua Town, southwest of this city, is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai. Every year in the third month of the lunar calendar, during the temple fair, ladies and gentlemen from all over come to visit the scenic spot. However, since Abbot Xingkong retired, the Buddhist Association once sent a monk to take over, resulting in disputes. It is now learned that the temple is still occupied by Yuanming, a wandering monk from Sichuan, causing internal chaos. Local people have risen up to drive him away. Liu Peiren and others, merchants and residents of Longhua, submitted a petition to the municipal government the day before yesterday, requesting that the Buddhist Association be instructed to appoint a high-ranking monk to take over and reorganize the temple. The petition states: "Longhua Ancient Temple is one of the monasteries in Shanghai. Before June of last year, Abbot Xingkong retired due to old age, and Yuanming immediately occupied the temple, claiming to be the abbot. His various illegal acts are too numerous to describe. As a result, monks from all directions have left. Now, among the 70-80 monks in the temple, all are wandering monks from Yuanming's hometown of Sichuan Province. Not only do they neglect practice in the temple, but they also engage in many improper behaviors. All the temple's belongings have been pawned. The monks often cause disturbances, with no discipline or rules left. There are many outstanding debts. We merchants, who do business in the town, have outstanding debts from the temple for goods purchased or financial transactions. During the recent lunar New Year, when we went to the temple to collect debts, we were abused and even assaulted by the wandering monks. If this continues, the famous ancient temple will be controlled by wandering monks with no morality. Not only will our creditor's rights be unsecured, but it is also feared that this will violate the government's original intention to preserve historical sites. Therefore, we jointly petition the government to quickly expel Yuanming and instruct the Buddhist Association to appoint a high-ranking monk to take over and reorganize the temple."

### Old Servant of Hong Yanbin Wrongfully Accused of Theft; Commits Suicide

Hong Yanbin, a native of Ningbo, currently residing at 31 Wanguan Lane, Luban Road in the French Concession, is now the director of the Maritime Affairs Bureau in Hankou. When Hong was a compradore on merchant shipping vessels, Sun Kengsheng (approximately 30 years old this year), a native of Shaoxing, worked as a tea server for Hong. Later, when Hong was transferred, Sun also left his job and returned to his hometown. Recently, Sun learned in his hometown that his former employer, Hong Yanbin, had been promoted to a new position. Therefore, he came to Shanghai last year and asked Hong's family to hire him or recommend him, temporarily staying at Hong's residence. The day before yesterday, thieves suddenly visited Hong's home, stealing silverware and other decorations from the living room. The next morning, when this was discovered, the servants suspected Sun of the theft and gossiped behind his back. When Sun learned of this, he impulsively took his own life. At 10 a.m. on the 16th, he used a kitchen knife to cut his throat in Hong's kitchen, bleeding all over the floor, and collapsing on the ground.

However, starting on January 23rd of last year, her living allowance was cut off. Unable to bear it, she came to Shanghai on January 20th of this year to find Ma, but he avoided meeting her. Therefore, she is temporarily staying at 86 Xinling Village, Caishi Road, but her livelihood is unsustainable. She was forced to come here to voice her grievance. Following the instructions of well-meaning people, she went to ring the grievance bell. She was then questioned in court by the prosecutor and left crying.

### Letter

To the Editor: I am writing to you on behalf of the family of Mr. Yan Pinzheng. We were shocked to read the news article in the Shen Bao on the 16th of this month, "Abortion Case at Dasheng Hospital: Civil Suit for Over Ten Thousand Yuan." Mr. Yan Pinzheng has always been known to abide by the law. Whether he is guilty or not in this case, we should wait for the legal judgment. The truth will be revealed. However, the report stated that the defendant has hired someone to reconcile with the victim's family and compensate for the losses in order to reduce the sentence. This is absolutely not the case. I believe this is based on inaccurate rumors. Please send a letter on our behalf requesting a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Lan Xuzhang, February 17.

### Letter from Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and Others to Tungyee Creditors (Continued)

Please discuss the percentage of recovery again. According to the mediation plan and repayment method,

The above table is based on the total amount of existing assets, properly organized and distributed, or converted into cash for return, or the property rights and claims are guaranteed by stocks and bonds, all of which refer to speedy mediation and early resumption of business. If we follow the bankruptcy procedure and liquidate step by step, this percentage is very difficult to achieve. The reason is ㊀ that the value of the property varies depending on the method of disposal. Bankruptcy requires auction, while liquidation can be negotiated. The price of an auction is necessarily lower than that of a negotiated transaction. ㊁ Negotiation allows for waiting for a better price, while auction does not have this opportunity. ㊂ Buyers in an auction will wait until the price is reduced to the lowest level, while negotiation can be based on the market price as a standard. In special cases, it may even be higher than the market price. ㊃ Mediation and resumption of business allows for interest to accrue on funds without interest, and non-productive assets become productive. ㊄ Some accounts are easier to collect after resumption of business than after bankruptcy. Summarizing these six points, according to the accountant's realistic estimate, the obvious loss would be at least one million yuan. Then how can the percentage be high? Moreover, quick recovery can generate profits, while delayed recovery only leads to consumption. If interest is included in the calculation, the advantages and disadvantages are even more different.

Please use practical examples to prove this. In recent years, financial events have been frequent, and bank failures are common. Examples include Minghua Bank, Wuhua Bank, Wing On Silver Company, Meihua Bank, Jiande Bank, China Industrial Bank, Dahuhu Bank, Ningbo Industrial Bank, and Guangdong Bank. Among them, Minghua, Wuhua, Wing On, and Meihua have been in a stalemate until now, with no end in sight. Jiande and China Industrial Bank have been bankrupt for many years, although they eventually reached a settlement, the creditors have suffered huge losses. The delays in Riye, Shijie, and Dahuhu have also caused great losses. Ningbo Industrial Bank has experienced several twists and turns and has only recently resumed business. However, having a solution is always better than having no solution. Only Guangdong Bank stopped business not long ago and resolutely mediated. On the day of its resumption of business, it was a great success. The creditors' losses were relatively minimal. If these banks had promptly sought mutual understanding and assistance from both debtors and creditors and engaged in reconciliation or mediation, they could have saved countless time, eliminated countless expenses, and reduced countless losses. The recovery of claims could be quick, and the percentage could be high. Why wait for a long time, and ultimately have to take a huge discount or even disappear? As the saying goes, learn from the past to guide the future. Since the advantages and disadvantages are so obvious, how can the creditors not be able to distinguish them? Why are some still hesitant, suspicious, and unable to decide? Is it because they still have doubts about the mediation plan, such as: doubts about the real value of stocks and bonds, fears about the responsibility of shareholders, and concerns about the funds for the resumption of business? Now we will explain them one by one, as follows:

First, regarding the real value of stocks and bonds, the value of stocks and bonds depends on whether the assets they represent are reliable. After Tungyee stopped business, accountant Xi Yushu cleaned up and reviewed the accounts. Later, the court ruled for bankruptcy and appointed accountant Li Ding to clean up and review the accounts. Later, due to mediation, accountants were selected to participate in the review. The quantity and nature of its assets have long been publicly studied and can be seen in the liquidator's report and the bankruptcy administrator's files. Therefore, the mediation plan proposes to extract 1.36 million yuan of relatively reliable assets from the assets of 1.7 million yuan as the new company's capital, which is reasonable. Although this asset, if fully converted into cash, may not actually be 1.36 million yuan, the difference will not be very large. It must be understood that valuation and realization have inherent differences in nature. For example, if cash is used to purchase property in the morning and the property is converted into cash in the evening, the value cannot be the same. Moreover, a company's large and complex assets have a fixed value for wealth creation and a special value for effectiveness, which is difficult to measure in cash. In short, the new company's capital of 1.36 million yuan in the mediation plan certainly represents reliable assets, and its denominations have considerable circulation value. It is by no means inconsistent with the reality. Those who doubt the value of the shares are empty and have not deeply examined the asset situation. As for the assets represented by non-interest-bearing bonds, ㊀ overdrafts, ㊁ credit loans, ㊂ temporary accounts payable, and ㊃ collection items, the certainty of these four items is certainly not as good as the former. However, according to estimates, they are not entirely unreliable. In the future, those who buy bonds for profit after the mediation is established must exist. Moreover, the new company's profits are guaranteed, and its circulation value is unquestionable.

Second, regarding the issue of shareholder responsibility, the new company is still a limited liability company. According to the Company Law, the responsibility of shareholders is limited to the shares they hold. In other words, if the new company unfortunately fails, shareholders will have no other responsibility except for the loss of the value of their shares. Now, assuming that the new company does not offer savings or long-term deposits, and its business scope is limited to several stable and liquid trust businesses or banking businesses, not only will shareholders not be liable, but even shareholders who are elected as directors or supervisors will not be liable if they do not engage in embezzlement. Why? Not offering savings makes the new company a purely limited liability company, and even directors and supervisors do not bear joint and unlimited liability. At worst, shareholders who do not intend to continue operating can sell their shares at any time and completely transfer all their shareholder rights and responsibilities to others, and the issue of responsibility will no longer arise. (To be continued)

### Yarn

Yarn's Reactionary Decline

Closing Shows Further Pullback, Resulting in Only a Slight Drop

The yarn market declined in the morning, but suddenly rose towards closing in the afternoon. The market situation was quieter than the previous day, as major players were largely inactive. However, a portion of twenty-count "Five Blessings Shepherd" yarn, totaling 4,000 bales, was released from the Ewo factory (Jardine Matheson). Meanwhile, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market trended downwards, and general sentiment remained weak. Nevertheless, current yarn business was reportedly not bad, with strong demand continuing from Yunnan, Tianjin, and other inland regions.

Major Players Release Marked Yarn

In the forward marked yarn market, prices trended downwards for all months at the opening due to the excessive bullishness of the previous day. Simultaneously, Osaka Sanpin yarn fell by 3.1 to 4 yuan, further dampening confidence. As a result, a reactionary decline occurred, with massive selling from companies like Jin Chang, Chang Feng, and Heng Yi, loosening the market. However, there was no indication of major players absorbing the supply. Current yarn trading was not as active as the previous day. Consequently, prices for all months fell by 9 jiao to 1.24 yuan compared to the closing prices of the 10th. At the afternoon opening, the market was calm, with prices slightly declining, as Chang Feng and others continued selling. The Sanpin yarn market was experiencing a severe downturn. By closing, current yarn trading was reported to be more active than in the morning, with over 2,400 bales changing hands. Chang Feng suddenly began buying, causing prices for all months to jump by 9 jiao to 1.2 yuan. The selling consisted of 2,350 bales from Heng Yi, 750 bales from Cheng Ji, 2,800 bales from Jin Chang, 600 bales from Tai Xing, 900 bales from Ren Feng, 1,600 bales from Wang Tai Xing, and 6,250 bales from Chang Feng. The buying consisted of 2,300 bales from Da Fu, 900 bales from Da Feng, 1,050 bales from Xing Chang, 2,250 bales from Tai Chang, 1,100 bales from Run Kang, 3,050 bales from Xin Cheng, and 950 bales from Shen Ji. The daily high and low prices are listed below.

Sales of Current Yarn Remain Strong

A total of 2,492 bales of current yarn were purchased by various guilds throughout the day. Selling prices were stable. The purchase amounts by each guild are listed below.

The cotton market initially declined but then recovered, showing a tendency for large rises followed by small corrections. However, the overseas cotton industry continued to weaken, leading to moderate confidence. Yet, some speculators remained strongly bullish on prices and did not ease their buying efforts. Therefore, the overall sentiment remained firm.

Spot Cotton Remains Strong

At the opening of the spot cotton market, prices declined due to falling prices for American and Indian cotton, as well as the excessive gains of the previous day, leading to widespread profit-taking and a sudden loosening of holdings. Prices for all months fell by 0.35 to 0.6 yuan. However, demand was particularly strong for the current month. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.35 to 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, except for the current month, which remained unchanged. At the afternoon opening, the market was calm, with prices for all months falling by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. After the first trading session, prices rose with the yarn market. Consequently, prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The selling consisted of 2,100 dan from Yi Chang, 2,700 dan from Yuan Yi, 1,600 dan from Ren Feng, 1,900 dan from Tong Ji, 3,900 dan from Heng Yi, 2,000 dan from Ming De, 8,100 dan from Tai Xing, 3,400 dan from Chang Yu, 5,400 dan from Da Chang Cheng, 2,500 dan from Da Chang, 3,500 dan from Sheng Yuan, 4,100 dan from Yi Kang, and 5,500 dan from Yuan Xing Chang. The buying consisted of 1,700 dan from Xie Cheng, 5,500 dan from Feng Tai, 4,000 dan from De Da, 6,800 dan from Da Fu, 2,700 dan from Ju Xing, 2,200 dan from Yu Da, 2,400 dan from Geng Feng, 4,100 dan from Chang Feng, 2,000 dan from Fu Kang, 6,000 dan from Xin Cheng, 16,400 dan from Chang He, and 2,100 dan from Xin Yong. The daily high and low prices are listed below.

Current Consumption Improving

Factories are experiencing more active yarn sales, leading to increasing demand for raw materials. Source unknown.

Increased Hedging Sales of American Cotton with Loaned Funds

American cotton opened lower, with prices for all months falling by one pound sterling. The initial market was more active due to increased hedging sales of cotton with loaned funds. Sales also occurred in New Orleans. Speculators largely took profits. Simultaneously, the stock market and other commodities declined uniformly, leading to strong selling pressure. Dealers were the only buyers. Japanese brokers bought March contracts at lower prices. At the closing, the public sold, leading to market weakness. Spot prices fell by nine pounds sterling, and futures fell by six to twelve pounds sterling. Spot prices for English cotton were unchanged, and futures fell by one point. Indian cotton initially rose due to scattered dealer buying but weakened due to continued profit-taking by speculators. Overall, Pingguoer rose/fell by 0.25 rupee, Omlara fell by 0.55 to 0.75 rupee, and Bairokhi fell by 0.75 rupee. Original telegraphic report on the left (dated 17th).

According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecasts for the 17th were: Bairokhi at 220 rupees, Omlara at 202 rupees, and Pingguoer at 176 rupees, all falling by half a rupee.

### Piece Goods

Cotton Cloth Sales Fairly Active

Dye Factories in This Street Slow to Buy

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued its positive trend. Prices for most goods remained generally stable. Tianjin and Guangdong guilds continued to show strong demand for white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Tianjin guilds mainly purchased "Flower Bird Dragon Gate" fine cloth produced in Dongpi and Qingdao. Shanghai factories' "Blue Double Fish" fine cloth and fine twill were also procured. Altogether, over 300 bales of current fine cloth were purchased, along with nearly 100 pieces of fine twill, coarse twill, lightweight coarse cloth, serge, line fabric, and poplin from this factory. Guangzhou and Wuzhou ordered over 200 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, various grades of coarse cloth, and poplin from this factory. Dye factories in this street were slow to buy due to not yet having resumed operations. Shantou, Xiamen, Jinan, and other guilds showed considerable demand for printed fabric, satin, serge, and drill. Fuzhou guilds mainly purchased blue cloth and plain twill. Zhejiang routes Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, and Taizhou purchased various weights of coarse cloth, Dongpi fine cloth, and mixed colors. Small amounts were also traded with various ports along the Yangtze River, mostly at opening red market prices.

### Securities

After Consecutive Gains

Public Debt Bulls Take Profits

Class C Down Over One Yuan

Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants' Stock Exchange experienced slight uncertainty. Some bulls exited the market, mostly seasoned bulls taking profits. However, overall confidence had not weakened. Various rumors circulating previously could not be confirmed. The temporary decline was due to the exiting of some players, preventing prices from falling sharply. Market sentiment remained strong. With only five days left in the February futures, another round of infighting was expected. Yesterday, after an initial rise at the opening, prices fell. This month's Class E opened sharply higher by 0.9 jiao, causing some bulls to exit, resulting in a subsequent decline of 0.6 jiao. The market moved from high to low, causing a slight shift in sentiment. Class C fell the most, down 1.2 yuan, due to the large gains of the previous day. Other classes fell by only 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. In the second session, Class E fell by 0.5 to 0.6 jiao, making up for the deficiency of the first session. Class C recovered by 0.15 jiao. The market gradually stabilized. In terms of buying and selling, Numbers 5, 10, 35, and 47 sold in the opening session, while Numbers 4 and 11 bought. In the second session, Numbers 10 and 47 continued to sell, while Number 35 switched to buying. Number 4 continued to absorb. As a result, prices fell by 0.2 jiao to over 1 yuan. The total trading volume was 8,985,000 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table below (units in 100 yuan trading units).

### Grains

Futures Flour Suddenly Turns to Selling

Foreign Wheat Plummets, Changing Sentiment. Heavy Trading Activity in the Market

Yesterday, the flour market exhibited a sharp decline across all months, primarily due to the plummeting prices of foreign wheat. Chicago wheat fell sharply, with near-term prices down 0.6 jiao and long-term prices down 2.1 jiao. Canadian wheat fell 0.7 jiao for near-term and 0.56 jiao for long-term. Liverpool wheat fell 1-2 pence. As a result, the market sentiment shifted unanimously due to the sharp decline in foreign wheat. The opening price for the current month fell to 1.13 yuan, a decrease of 0.725 jiao from the previous day. However, intense selling by the bulls was met with relentless buying by factories, causing the price to recover by 0.02 yuan. Trading activity for March/April was extremely high, with initial declines of 0.04-0.05 yuan followed by continued weakness. July new flour was initially slightly lower by 0.01-0.02 yuan due to large-scale hedging by overseas players, but subsequently weakened as factories also began hedging. Based on the current situation, the decline was partly due to foreign wheat prices, but also due to changes in holdings and increased activity from non-industry bulls, all seemingly focused on this.

Both Futures and Spot Wheat Fall by 0.06-0.07 Yuan

Yesterday, the wheat futures market experienced a general decline in all months after the morning opening. This was due to the continued decline in foreign wheat prices, with falls ranging from 0.2-0.3 jiao to 0.56-0.7 jiao and 1-2 pence. The market's focus is currently largely dependent on foreign prices. Seeing such a sharp decline, resistance was difficult. Opening prices immediately fell by 0.06-0.07 yuan. Subsequently, trading activity decreased, with less movement. It is rumored that the majority of the near-term standard contracts were held by Tianjin factories. Although these were formal transactions, the market value of the goods was not in the Chinese style, so it was close to speculation. However, the holdings were absorbed and not released, so there was little dynamism. The spot wheat market also saw price declines of 0.06-0.07 yuan across the board due to the fall in standard foreign wheat prices. Opened at 6.7 yuan for Bengbu Yanghe wheat and 6.65 yuan for Jiangbei wheat. Reported that over 8,000 bags were traded.

Xi'an Guild Resumes Purchasing Ji Jing Rice

Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market saw approximately 10,000 bags arrive, with a corresponding amount sold, stabilizing the market. However, inventories remained abundant and new arrivals continued to pour in, leading to pressure from holders to sell quickly, resulting in a weak market. However, sales of Ke Hua rice were active, with new inquiries from Shantou and Beiyang in addition to the usual sales within this street and to Xiamen. The Xi'an guild, which had been inactive for some time, resumed operations with the return of peace and the restoration of transportation, purchasing 600-700 bags of Ji Jing rice. However, the lack of purchasing from the Guangdong guild prevented the market from improving. A total of 8,394 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,500 bags of Hunan rice, and 250 bags of Han coarse rice were offered throughout the day.

Year-End Rice Purchases Satisfied, No Large Outlets for Eating Rice

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total arrivals from various guilds numbered over 30, with approximately 6,400-6,500 shi of goods. Of these, 14-15 were of Bo Dao rice. With sufficient year-end rice purchases completed by local households, sales were very quiet. Only Zi Shang rice saw some activity, with Qingdao and Tianjin guilds purchasing 2,500-2,600 bags of Bo Dao rice, leading to a weakening market. Hou Geng prices fell by 0.15-0.2 yuan. Bo Dao rice was barely holding steady. Du Jian was slightly soft. Yin Yuan saw no market.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from various ports downstream numbered over 30 vessels. Sales were even weaker than the previous market. White Geng prices fell slightly by around 0.1 jiao. Bo Dao prices fell slightly. Early rice was scarce, with some small demand and stable prices. Yangbu Xian prices fell slightly by several fen to 0.1 jiao. Du Jian prices were stable. Ke Jian prices were weak. Bai Yuan prices fell slightly by several fen to 0.1 jiao. Prices for all other goods exhibited a downward trend.

Foreign Firm Sesame Falls 0.15 Yuan

Soybeans Also Drop 0.05-0.06 Yuan

Foreign firm sesame was facing stagnant sales as the foreign firms remained inactive, with only the Central Trust Bureau making inquiries. Yesterday, a total of 300 tons were transacted in both the morning and afternoon sessions at prices of 14.9 and 14.85 yuan, respectively, down 0.15 yuan from the previous market. Current spot raw sesame was only being sold in small quantities by local merchants, with 50 bags of Haozhou sesame and 70 bags of Kuixi Kou sesame traded. Prices remained unchanged. Soybean purchases by oil pressing factories have tightened significantly due to the continued decline in the Dalian market, and sales have also decreased in other markets, causing prices to fall by 0.05-0.06 yuan. A total of four truckloads of Bengbu beans, 152 bags of Xicheng beans, 147 bags of Dingjia Zhou beans, 800 bags of Sha Huang beans, 24 bags of Du beans, and 400 bags of Zha beans were traded.

Dalian Repeatedly Reports Declines, Standard Oil Bean Cakes Also Fall Sharply

The standard oil bean cake market initially saw some improvement in sentiment due to a temporary rebound in the Dalian market. However, the Dalian market's weakness was difficult to reverse, and prices soon declined. Brokerage firms, having received the news earlier, were the first to sell off. Yesterday, Dalian telegraphs reported further sharp declines, causing even greater fear and weakness. Brokerage firms continued to sell actively, leading to an immediate sharp decline in opening prices. Standard oil fell sharply by 0.6-0.7 yuan, sesame cakes fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan, and standard soybeans fell by nearly 0.1 yuan in the near month and a significant 0.18 yuan in the far month.

### Sugar Market

Hainan Red Arrives with Over 5,000 Bags Yesterday

Chao Sugar Telegram Reports Increase of 0.3-0.4 Yuan. Zhang Diaoqing Opens with Over 2,000 Bags

Yesterday, the trend for foreign sugar was flat and soft, while domestic Qing and Red sugars remained firm due to the rise in production prices. The guild trading desk traded 24 coarse white current goods at 20.95 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. Transit goods were at 7.55 yuan. East White No. 4 current goods (J mark) were offered at 23.1 yuan but were not traded. Other goods were offered at the original price without any transactions. This factory's cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 22 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were discounted. According to a telegram from Chao sugar yesterday at 5 PM, Qing, Red, and White sugars all rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The sales agents continued to offer Chongti Qing at 14.25 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 14 to 14.1 yuan, and cotton red at 15.7 to 15.64 yuan, totaling over 600 bags.

Yesterday, the Japanese and American silk markets declined slightly. New York recent term fell by 0.03 yuan and far term fell by 0.02 yuan. Yokohama spot rose by 5 yuan and futures fell by 5 yuan. Lyon was unchanged. In the sea silk market, white factory Jing B grade Yangfan silk's offered price was 800 yuan, higher than before the new year, but there were no transactions. Foreign firms slightly sold the red market yesterday. For example, Xinfu sold Green Sailor grade 20-22 denier in 10 packs, priced at 750 yuan. It was said that the silk was sold by the Nie Household, so the price was lower. Currently, silk merchants are holding prices for these silks at around 780 yuan. Yesterday, a small amount of Jili silk was traded with African firms, such as Red Peach brand priced at 695 yuan and Golden Bird brand at 685 yuan. The market prices were similar to before the new year, but market sentiment was stronger.

### Metals

This Factory's Yuan Nails Should Not Be Sold

Recent transactions of Yuan nails from this factory have been mostly purchased by foreign guilds. The inventory of fellow merchants is limited, resulting in insufficient allocation. Furthermore, due to a shortage of raw materials, the factory's output is shallow, so the offered price is 13.5 yuan per barrel, 0.5 yuan higher than the red market. It is found that there are as many as 400-500 barrels offered. Other small color varieties are strongly positioned due to less output, such as four-fen sizes at 17 yuan, five-fen sizes at 18.5 yuan, and six-fen sizes at 20 yuan. However, Pi goods are ultimately unpopular varieties, so not many are offered.

### Oil Market

Tung Oil Industry Profits Not as Good as Last Year

Tung oil is a special product of our country. All paint factories in the world rely on it as a raw material. Therefore, our country's export trade ranked first last year, and the domestic output has also increased year by year. Last year, the national export volume was estimated at more than 100,000 tons. Although the central market is in Hankou, many foreign merchants also conduct procurement deep into Sichuan and Hunan. This port's foreign trade volume was about 10,000 tons for the whole year. Since the establishment of the Industrial Department's vegetable oil factory in the second half of the year, all exported oil must be refined by the factory. On the surface, it seems to have concentrated the industry, but foreign merchants' oil factories still refine oil as before, while Chinese merchants engaged in this industry are subject to more restrictions and not as free as foreign merchants. Therefore, the profits of tung oil firms in this port last year were not as good as the previous year. According to people in the industry, it is feared that this year will be even worse than last year. The surplus dividends of each firm are listed below (omitted).

### Miscellaneous News

Fennel Spring Plate Increases 2 Yuan

Fennel spring plate continued to trend upward. Yesterday, it was heard that sales agents offered over 200 pieces of Nanning fennel at 39 yuan and over 100 packs of Beihai fennel at 38 yuan, an increase of about 2 yuan compared to before the big settlement.

### Statistics

Living Expenses Index Soars in the 25th Year

Purchasing Power of Silver Dollar Greatly Reduced

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs announced the cost of living index for the city in the 25th year, stating that the cost of living index for workers in the city was highest in the 19th year, with an annual total index of 116.79. Since the economic decline began in the autumn and winter of the 20th year, the index has gradually decreased year by year. By the 22nd year, it was only 97.13, a decrease of 16.83% compared to the 19th year. There was not much change in the 23rd year. The 24th year showed signs of recovery. After the promulgation and implementation of the legal tender act on November 4th of that year, the value of currency decreased, and prices uniformly rebounded. The annual index slightly increased. This year (the 25th year) continues the upward trend of the previous year, and the index continues to rise. The second half of the year, in particular, showed a clear upward trend. This is mainly because the harvest in various regions this year was still considered abundant, the rural economy gradually showed signs of recovery, the sales of essential goods were smooth, and the continuous economic decline and reduced production in recent years meant that inventories were limited. Once sales were brisk, the supply felt inadequate. In addition, the improvement of international market conditions, the effectiveness of the currency reform, and various political and economic influences also contributed to the increase in prices. As wholesale prices rose, the cost of living index also increased. This was not only the case in this city, but also in other cities such as Tianjin, Beiping, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Nanning, etc., where the cost of living index or retail price index also showed the same increase in percentage. This is clear evidence that China's economic situation has begun to turn around. The following is a table of the cost of living index for workers in Shanghai for each month of the 25th year.

Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index for the 25th Year of the Republic of China (15th Year of the Republic of China equals 100)

The rise and fall of the total index often follow the same trend as the food category. Starting from January of this year, it rose monthly. By March, the index reached 107.10, an increase of 9.80% compared to October of last year (the food category index was 93.65 in January and 99.89 in March). In April and May, the total index fell due to a drop in the food category. From June, the trend resumed upwards. Until September, all category indexes except fuel were lower than the previous month, so the total index declined. In October, the food category index slightly decreased, but the clothing index rose sharply, and the total index was slightly higher. This was the only month in the entire year when the food category index differed from its usual trend. There was not much change in October. In December, the prices of various commodities rose sharply, and the total index reached 108.86, the highest peak since September of the 21st year (the food category index was 101.31). The annual average was 105.04, an increase of 6.40% compared to the previous year. The highest monthly value for the whole year was 108.86 in December, and the lowest was 102.68 in May, a difference of only 6.18, and the trend was relatively stable.

In September of the 24th year, each silver dollar could be exchanged for 341.35 copper coins. On November 4th, the government announced the implementation of legal tender, which sharply reduced the exchange rate to 299.55 coins. Soon after, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that each dollar should be worth 300 copper coins, with no fluctuations allowed. Although in reality, due to supply and demand, it was impossible to fix the rate at the legally mandated 300 coins (such as the purchase of copper coins and the approaching end of the year, which created high demand), the average exchange rate in December of this year was only 296 coins. However, this was only a difference of more than 7 coins compared to the highest average exchange rate in March, when each dollar could be exchanged for 303.15 coins. This difference was still limited. In the 23rd year, the difference between the highest and lowest copper coin exchange rates was more than 30 coins.

### The Loyalty of Shi Quan

— Ru Bi

A loyal and righteous person is incompatible with a traitor.

During the late Northern Song Dynasty, the Jin army occupied Bianjing, and Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong were taken to the north by the Jin. The world was in chaos for a time, and some loyal and righteous heroes were unwilling to surrender to the Jin. They all ran to the high mountains and forests to become bandits. Shi Quan also became a great king on Mount Taihang.

Later, Emperor Gaozong ascended the throne, and the Song Dynasty retained half of the country. He appointed generals such as Yue Fei and Han Shizhong to fight against the Jin. For a time, there was an atmosphere of restoration. Shi Quan had long heard the stories of Yue Fei's loyalty and righteousness in the world, and now he was a marshal leading troops to fight against the Jin. This was a good opportunity to serve the country. Shi Quan inspected his followers and joined Marshal Yue's army to work together to recover lost territory and wipe out national humiliation.

Shi Quan followed Marshal Yue, killing enemies in the east and west, conquering in the south and north, suppressing many rebels, and fighting many battles with the Jin. They were truly invincible, and the Jin soldiers were terrified upon hearing their name. Even children were afraid of the name of the Yue Family Army.

Who knew that at that time, a great traitor appeared, Prime Minister Qin Hui. He had originally been captured by the Jin, but was later released and rose to the position of prime minister. He always helped the Jin and harmed his own country. He strongly advocated making peace with the Jin and not fighting against them. However, Marshal Yue's views were exactly the opposite of his, so he hated Marshal Yue. Therefore, just when Marshal Yue had defeated the Jin army at Zhuxian Town in Henan, and was preparing to march north to raid the Jin's base camp, and at the same time, the loyal heroes in the north were preparing to respond to the Yue Family Army, Qin Hui falsely issued an imperial decree, sending twelve gold tablets in a row, summoning Marshal Yue back to the capital, framing him in prison, and then killing Marshal Yue and his three sons at Fengbo Pavilion.

When the news of Marshal Yue's murder reached the camp, the entire army, both officers and soldiers, were as if they had lost their parents, and their cries shook the earth. The generals all said: "Now that traitors are in power in the court, single-mindedly selling out the country, what is the use of our fighting battles at the risk of our lives? Even Marshal Yue, with such great merits, was killed by the traitors. We will not be able to escape in the future. It is better to save our lives and go back, and wait for an opportunity to repay the country and kill all the enemies."

So most of the generals dispersed, some went home, and some still went up the mountain to become great kings.

Shi Quan returned to Mount Taihang, depressed all day long, only thinking about things. He thought: "I am Chinese, and I should be loyal to the country. I have received great kindness from Marshal Yue, and I should also repay him, and inherit Marshal Yue's ambition. Although we cannot fight against the Jin for a while, and cannot kill all the enemies, killing the traitors is the same. I should go to Lin'an to kill Qin Hui, eliminate a great harm for the country, and avenge Marshal Yue. I should do this, so that I am worthy of being a great man."

Shi Quan thought for a few days, and the more he thought, the more he felt that he should go to kill Qin Hui, so he decided to go to Lin'an to do this great thing. He did not tell his other brothers, and on a night with a big moon, he quietly went down the mountain.

Needless to say, Shi Quan traveled day and night, eating when hungry and drinking when thirsty. When he arrived in Lin'an. He was in no mood to appreciate the scenery, so he found an inn to stay. The next day, Shi Quan bought several kinds of sacrificial offerings, took them out of the city, set them up in an open space, and kowtowed to the sky several times. He was offering sacrifices to Marshal Yue and his sons.

While kowtowing, Shi Quan prayed: "Marshal Yue, two young generals, you were loyal in life, and you must become gods after death. Shi Quan came to Lin'an to assassinate the traitor Qin Hui, to eliminate harm for the country, and to avenge Marshal Yue and his sons. May the spirits of Marshal Yue and his sons in heaven bless Shi Quan, and let Shi Quan succeed in this great thing."

After Shi Quan finished praying, he stood up, staring blankly at the sky, and tears flowed down his eyes. He stood for a while, and seemed to remember something, so he quickly wiped away the tears, packed up the sacrificial offerings, and walked along the West Lake, intending to return to the city.

Things were too coincidental. Shi Quan heard people on the road say: "Prime Minister Qin has gone to Lingyin Temple to burn incense, and the procession is very lively!" And more than one person said this. Shi Quan heard this, quickly reached into his waist and felt the sharp knife hidden there. The knife was there! He thought: "This thief deserves to die! I don't need to go back to the city, I will just lie in ambush on the main road in front of Lingyin Temple, and wait for the traitor to return, and when he passes by there, I will kill him with one knife, how satisfying!"

Shi Quan turned around and walked towards Lingyin Temple. After walking not far, he threw the sacrificial offerings in his hand on the open ground to free his hands and feet. Walking to a place not far from Lingyin Temple, there was a bridge. Shi Quan thought: "This is a good place to hide."

So Shi Quan hid under the bridge, waiting for Qin Hui to return.

Originally, Qin Hui had been feeling guilty since he had harmed Marshal Yue and his sons. As soon as he closed his eyes, he saw Marshal Yue and his sons, and he was terribly afraid. He told his wife, Lady Wang, who advised him to go to Lingyin Temple to burn incense and repent. Qin Hui thought it made sense, so he chose this day to go to Lingyin Temple to burn incense.

Inside Lingyin Temple, Qin Hui met a mad monk who spoke sarcastically, scolding Qin Hui coldly and satirically. Since this person was a madman, Qin Hui could not get angry even if he was upset, so he had to keep it in his stomach. After burning incense, he went back to the yamen. Qin Hui was sitting in the sedan chair, still feeling upset.

As they were walking, the guards suddenly saw a person lying under the bridge, so they reported to Qin Hui: "Reporting to the Prime Minister, there is a person hiding under the bridge."

Qin Hui was in a bad mood, and it was a good opportunity to vent his anger on this person, so he said: "It must be a thief, go and catch him." The guards took the order and went to arrest the person.

Shi Quan was lying under the bridge, and when he saw the Prime Minister's procession from afar, he knew that Qin Hui was coming, and the blood in his body immediately boiled. But his heart was very calm, and he held the sharp knife tightly in his hand, waiting for Qin Hui's sedan chair to stop, so that he could jump out and stab this great traitor to death with one knife!

Who knew that Qin Hui's sedan chair stopped, but the guards pounced towards the bridge. Shi Quan knew that things were bad, but he did not want to escape, but instead jumped out, waiting to fight desperately.

Shi Quan fought several rounds with Qin Hui's guards, and injured several people, but he was outnumbered and was finally captured and taken to Qin Hui's sedan chair.

Qin Hui saw Shi Quan's face full of murderous intent, and had to muster his courage to ask: "Who are you, and why are you here to assassinate this official?"

Shi Quan widened his strange eyes and shouted loudly: "Qin Hui, traitor, listen to me, I, your father, do not change my name or surname, I am Shi Quan, a general under Marshal Yue. My brothers followed Marshal Yue and risked their lives on the battlefield, defeating the Jin army greatly. It was a good opportunity to take advantage of the situation to recover lost territory, but you, a traitor, falsely issued an imperial decree, and tricked Marshal Yue and his sons into harming them. Traitor, what benefits have you received from Wushu, to sell out the country and frame the loyal and good like this? You really have no heart. I am here today to kill you, a traitor, to eliminate harm for the country, and to avenge Marshal Yue and his sons. It's a pity that things were not successful, I can only die... Qin Hui, traitor, I cannot tear you to pieces while alive, and I will become an evil ghost after death to capture your soul! Traitor! Traitor!"

Shi Quan's hateful voice was incessant, and his teeth were clenched. Qin Hui was scolded until he was sweating profusely and was ashamed and angry. He said repeatedly: "This is an assassin, take him away and execute him! Take him away and execute him!"

Shi Quan shouted loudly: "Traitor, listen to me! I, your father, am a loyal and righteous man, I cannot let your traitor's knife cut my head!" He also shouted to the sky: "Marshal Yue, two young generals, Shi Quan did not succeed in his mission, I am coming to follow you."

Shi Quan exerted force with both arms, broke free from the guards' hands, jumped up, and jumped towards the bridgehead, crashing his head against it. Sadly, a loyal and righteous man passed away in this way.

### Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)

— Wu Bixiong

— The First Person to Know About Microorganisms —

About two hundred and fifty years ago, there was a Dutchman named Antony Leeuwenhoek. He was the first human being to discover a world that people had never experienced before. This world is a group of tens of thousands of different kinds of small organisms, sometimes harming human beings, even causing death, and sometimes benefiting the people, in some parts of the industries that make human beings rich, they are simply indispensable. In terms of the true happiness of mankind, we find that discovering such a world is always more important than discovering a new continent or an ocean with many islands.

Before talking about the career of this pioneer in the microbial world, we might as well take a look at the situation in various aspects of that era: Speaking of the family, the father had supreme authority, and the children in the family only had absolute obedience. You were not allowed to doubt anything. If you dared to defy the taboo and ask your father about some customs, you were not allowed to doubt the question. Then your doubting attitude could get you a real slap in the face, or perhaps be driven out of the family by your father. Society was also the same. You were not allowed to say "no" to traditional beliefs and rituals, you were not allowed to protest, or even doubt, otherwise you would be suspected of blasphemy. At that time, Europeans in general were beginning to sweep away superstition, but those who were doing it did not know how foolish they themselves were! Although science had begun to sprout, the science of that time neglected the basic "experiment" work of science. "Science", after all, is just "experiment", adding precise observation and clear thinking in "experiment"; because of this, various studies have the hope of gradually approaching the truth. However, Tervetus was burned at the stake for disregarding customs and dissecting a corpse without authorization; Galilei suffered long-term imprisonment because he dared to prove that the earth revolved around the sun. They were breaking down superstition on the one hand, and on the other hand, they treated the functions of these efforts to break down superstition in this way! This was the society at that time! This was the science at that time!

In such a world, Leeuwenhoek was born in 1632 in a small town in the Netherlands. He lost his father early and was raised entirely by his mother. He stopped studying at the age of sixteen and went to work as an apprentice for a grocer in a foreign country. During his apprenticeship, he studied tirelessly, and the shop became his school.

At the age of twenty-one, he returned to his hometown and opened a grocery store himself. Later, he became the gatekeeper of the local town office. It was at this time that he developed a strange habit of grinding glass. It turned out that he had heard people say: if very pure glass is carefully ground into a lens, using it to look at things will be much larger than what can be seen with the naked eye. The time from twenty-one to forty years old was completely spent on this work. This was the basic work for his discovery of microorganisms. Without this effort, he would not have become the pioneer of the microbial world.

Leeuwenhoek was not naturally intelligent, his temperament was very stubborn, and he received very little education. He only understood Dutch, which was a kind of vulgar language that was despised at that time, and was commonly used by fishermen, shop assistants and workers. The intellectual class spoke Latin, but Leeuwenhoek was completely clueless about it. A Bible written in Dutch was his entire collection of books. This is so noteworthy! It turned out that this kind of "ignorance" was his good fortune; because it isolated him from the unconsciousness of the scholars of that time, what he relied on was his own eyes, his own thoughts, and his own judgment.

Leeuwenhoek did not go to buy ready-made lenses, he felt that it was always better to do it himself. He learned the method of grinding crystal, and his achievements surpassed those of the famous Dutch crystal grinders. The diameter was less than three millimeters, but its smooth and symmetrical appearance was truly worthy of the saying "divine workmanship". Very small things, when placed under it, looked magnified many times, clearly and accurately, which was amazing. As for other metal accessories, he also refined them himself in the furnace. In an environment where he suffered all kinds of cold ridicule and sarcasm from his relatives and friends, he actually created the simplest and most primitive microscope. Now we can buy a high-end microscope for hundreds of dollars, turn the spiral a few times, and observe all kinds of objects under the lens, perhaps without knowing how this device is made. Leeuwenhoek was not like this.

Whenever he had time, he used his lens to observe everything, whether it was the muscle fibers of whales or the fingerprints on his own hands. He could look at a piece of wool or rabbit hair for hours and hours. When he saw a fine hair turned into a thick strip under his lens, he jumped up happily. He carefully dissected the head of a fly; stuck its brain on the fine needle of his microscope, planting and wondering at the same time. He studied the cross-sections of twelve different trees, and observed the inside of plant seeds. He also saw fleas and lice, which simply made him go crazy with joy. In short, Leeuwenhoek was like a puppy, sniffing everything, regardless of good or bad, fragrant or smelly.

Leeuwenhoek's attitude towards research was very rigorous. He never made decisions lightly. He would not write a word or make a drawing before he was sure. He said:

"People who have just used a microscope to look at things, say today that they saw this, and tomorrow say that they saw that, even experienced observers are deceived. I have spent so much time on this kind of observation; but I am working happily, not worrying about those who say 'Why bother so hard? What good is this?' I do not write anything for these people, but only for thinkers who love the truth."

He worked hard in this way for twenty years!

In the second half of the seventeenth century, European pioneers and seers woke up. They no longer believed in Aristotle's theory, nor did they blindly follow the Pope's holy words. Like that Dutch gatekeeper, they did not regard anything as true knowledge unless they had experienced or understood it themselves. In England, several revolutionary scientists organized a secret society to develop new sciences. This group was the later Royal Society, which was famous all over the world. At that time, the members included Robert Boyle, the founder of scientific chemistry, and Isaac Newton, the master of physics. (To be continued)

### Review of "A Comprehensive Treatise on Chinese Marriage Law"

— Liu Man

Written by Zhang Shen, published by Commercial Press

Due to the instinctive demands of human sexual behavior and the natural laws of reproduction, the union of two sexes began in primitive times. At that time, human wisdom was not yet developed, and life was simple. Although there were no grand marriage ceremonies like today, it already had a simple form of marriage, that is, the union of two sexes to live a permanent sexual life together, on the one hand, to adapt to the physiological instinct, and on the other hand, to conform to the natural laws of human reproduction. Later, human life gradually became more complex, and human wisdom gradually developed. The marriage laws that prevailed in the previous ignorant era naturally could not be applied now. In this way, a new form of marriage was hatched from the customs and habits of society and the trajectory of human evolution. Thus, there were marriage laws such as "betrothal is wife, elopement is concubine," and "a woman who媒self-marries is ugly and untrustworthy," and even some people came out to stipulate marriage ceremonies, which were announced by the ruling class for the common people to follow. The establishment of the Six Rites by the Duke of Zhou is the most concrete example. Due to the evolution of the process of human evolution and the constant succession of the times, the marriage laws and forms of this union of two sexes also varied. In modern times, when science is prosperous and culture is developed, the marriage form of these two sexes has also formed its new style, which is completely different from before.

History tells us that the formation of modern marriage systems and laws is indeed not accidental, and has its own origins and evolution. In order to study the trajectory of human evolution, we have to study the origins and evolution of marriage. The book "A Comprehensive Treatise on Chinese Marriage Law" written by Mr. Zhang Shen can help you understand the origins and evolution of marriage systems and laws, and understand the trajectory of human evolution.

This book "A Comprehensive Treatise on Chinese Marriage Law" starts from the social phenomenon of marriage and goes to the legal phenomenon, explaining the system and laws of marriage, the origin and evolution, etc., very clearly. In the introduction, it is divided into five chapters: Chapter 1 Introduction, Chapter 2 Evolution of Marriage System, Chapter 3 Legislation of Marriage, Chapter 4 Nature of Marriage, Chapter 5 Forms and Customs of Marriage. After reading this introduction, we can have a full and clear concept of the concept of marriage and its historical development. Especially in Chapter 5, Forms and Customs of Marriage, the marriage customs of the past are presented to us, such as bigamy and remarriage, consanguineous marriage, affinity marriage, uxorilocal marriage and adoption of child brides, jealousy, concubines, adoption of husbands and pawned wives, early marriage and non-marriage, etc., which enable us to know all the marriage customs and their evolutionary process.

In the main body of the book, it is divided into five chapters according to the title of the Civil Code, and the customs of various marriages are explained and analyzed with reference to the articles in the Civil Code, which is very convenient for readers who do not have legal knowledge. Not only that, but the author also uses the articles of the Investigation Record of Civil and Commercial Customs of the Judicial Administration Department as the main source of narration of marriage customs, and quotes them in each paragraph according to their nature and cause. In this way, the general reader can have something to refer to with the regulations promulgated in law, needless to say, it is very beneficial to the reader.

Generally speaking, this book "A Comprehensive Treatise on Chinese Marriage Law" expounds the social phenomenon of the marriage system from the perspective of legal science, so that readers have a clear outline of the nature of marriage and its historical development. Undoubtedly, this is not only helpful for researchers of marriage law, but also for readers of human history.

### "New Book Criticism and Introduction"

— Dai Yingfu

— Culture Construction, January Issue —

The January issue of the Culture Construction Monthly is a special issue titled "New Book Criticism and Introduction." Half of the content in this issue follows the usual format, while the other half is entirely composed of criticism and introductions of new books. This section includes as many as twenty articles, which can be considered a suitable quantity for a special issue. Now, what we want to do is to provide a general overview of this type of criticism and introduction. However, it is impossible to discuss each of these twenty articles individually in this short space; therefore, we can only pick out a few to talk about.

First, there is "China at the Crossroads" written by Chen Shifu. This book is in English, authored by Zhang Pengyang; it is written specifically for European and American readers. Chen Shifu's introductory text to this book can be described as concise and powerful. He explains the importance of the book at the beginning, and then proceeds to introduce it chapter by chapter. Finally, he extracts the author's conclusion and uses it as his own. The conclusion is as follows:

Luo said:

"I believe that the strength of Western culture is the scientific method, and the strength of Chinese culture is a rational outlook on life. We hope that the Western scientific method and the Chinese rational outlook on life will gradually combine."

The method of introducing the author's conclusion, as Chen does, is the most powerful, as it can give readers an accurate understanding of the original book.

Second, there is "The Powerful America" by Fan Zhongyun. This is also an English book, written by an American, Eugene J. Young. Fan's writing on this book is a combination of introduction and criticism. He explains the special features of this book at the beginning, that is, it contains many unknown stories. Then, he introduces the three most important chapters in the book. Those three chapters are: "Strong and Weak Japan," "Will the Chinese Mainland Be Divided at Will?", and "America Controls the Balance of Power." Fan introduces the chapter on China as follows:

"...However, using Japanese oppression to promote Chinese unity and build up military strength to drive out Japan, then the danger may be even greater than Japan. Therefore, according to the author's intention, it is best if North China can be independent and form its own country, and Japan must not interfere. The three countries, Britain, America, and Japan, will thus reach a compromise. At the same time, he also advocates that South China and Central China should be separated and form their own countries."

Of course, Fan has faithfully introduced the author's argument, but he has not fulfilled his responsibility to provide strict criticism. Such erroneous arguments from an American standpoint should be corrected. True, Fan has expressed his protest in the conclusion; however, this protest is ultimately too weak and does not match the strength of the introductory text.

Third, let's talk about "On International Law, Volume One" by Di Chen. This book is in Chinese, written by Li Shengwu. Di Chen's writing on this book is purely an introduction. His introduction method is very clever. He first explains the fact that the great powers despise international law, and its necessity. Secondly, he proceeds to introduce it chapter by chapter. In conclusion, he says: This book on international law is very good and is a necessary reading for the Chinese people; because China has suffered greatly from the great powers' contempt for international law.

Fourth, there is "The Psychology of Literature and Art" written by Sun Fuxi. Because Sun is an artist himself, he uses the perspective of an artist to explain the importance of this book. This is also a purely introductory text. First, he very uniquely quotes the original author Zhu Guangqian's confession. Secondly, he explains the shortcomings of Chinese art, which has never been based on theory, and then talks about the need for literary and artistic theory. Finally, he uses the following two sentences as a conclusion: "The psychology of literature and art is a recipe for literary and artistic creators and critics. As for its content, we will wait for everyone to read the original book and then look for an opportunity to introduce it." Therefore, this can be said to be a very faithful and powerful introductory text.

Originally, there were two other articles, such as Feng Sanqiu's "Critique of Rural Construction in China" and Wang Fuquan's "A Glimpse of Japanese Research on Chinese Academics," which also needed to be discussed, but due to space limitations, we had to give up. In short, the "New Book Criticism and Introduction" special issue of the Culture Construction Monthly contains extremely serious, faithful, and reliable texts that are definitely not comparable to the advertising texts of bookstores; its benefit to the reading community is of course not to be ignored.

### "Biography of Fabre"

— Gu Xiong

Authored by G. V. Legros, translated by Lin Yanfang, published by Commercial Press

The insect world is a vast garden that is quite available for us to study; but ordinary people, upon seeing this phenomenon, sigh and say how great nature is, then immediately shake their heads and leave, never exploring its essence, and what they gain is only the knowledge of being able to sigh. Taking this attitude to deal with the world is following the beaten path, vanity; to study knowledge, then it is unlikely to have any remarkable achievements. When we see Fabre's spirit, we will truly feel unusually ashamed. Fabre's nature is "to be thorough in everything. If you study granite, then all the newly emerging questions along the way need to be clarified one by one, and you will not stop until the granite problem is finally solved." Look at how this enthusiastic scientist tirelessly ponders every small action of insects in difficult environments.

Bergson said: "Intuition is necessary to exhaust the source of life." Fabre's life was forever devoted to "intuitively exhausting the source of life." He believed that every action of various insects has meaning. What often makes ordinary people laugh can often arouse the deep thought of sages. The ordinary things we occasionally see on the paths we walk every day, if thoroughly researched, will be like the sun, moon, and stars, and the vast world, generating countless questions. Speaking of which, all things in the universe are a number, and within this number, there are infinite meanings hidden. If we can understand these active numbers and sort out or explore the implied meaning, then even a small, useless piece of land, for a lonely researcher, should not be an unexpectedly good art exhibition hall. Fabre is the one who leads us to this exquisite and frightening art museum.

Darwin was Fabre's enemy in biological theory, one advocating the theory of evolution, the other advocating the theory of instinct, but Darwin said in his letter to him, "Throughout Europe, I don't think anyone admires your research as much as I do." This clearly shows that this scientist was highly praised. Because nature is poetry, he is also called a poet. Indeed, reading his great work, "Souvenirs Entomologiques," is like returning to the poetic hometown: the spring-grieving cuckoo, the butterflies on the grass, the fireflies by the river on summer nights, the forever tearful katydid; these are all objects of poets, and they are also Fabre's objects. It is no accident that he was recommended as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

The life and deeds of this great French scientist are recorded in this book. The author, Legros, was Fabre's close friend and a keen scholar of science. The draft outline of this book was published before Fabre's death and had a preface by Fabre, which was very complimentary. He said: "The work of writing a biography is to narrate that person's life in an interesting way, and my friend fully understands this purpose, and can reproduce on paper the situations I have observed in the environment over the years, and can explain the methods I have followed, and my thoughts and all my research, and all my inventions, in a succinct and clear way. This work certainly has many difficulties, but he has achieved this masterpiece. The narration is so well-organized that even I can only marvel at it." From this book, we can roughly see this eccentric man who always wears a wide-brimmed hat, trekking in the scorching sun to watch bees courting, and patrolling the work of crickets at night with a lamp. He is a modern "self-taught" scientist who is not afraid of cold or heat and is stubborn (he despises knowledge from books, and only believes it if he has carefully observed it himself and deems it to be correct).

Because he used a popular pen to compile textbooks on animal psychology that are all based on experiments, he started a new trend in French education, so he is also recognized as a great educator. Most of his life was devoted to education for the sake of bread.

In this booklet, the author said that he tried his best to get the protagonist to speak for himself. Fabre's "Souvenirs Entomologiques" often reveals the autobiography of this lonely investigator, and this biography is just to select these fundamental meanings and connect them together.

Reading the biography of such a great scientist, poet, and educator will be a good help both in learning and in self-cultivation.

Fabre's famous work, "Souvenirs Entomologiques," has long been praised by the world, and there are translations in various countries, but not in China. Mr. Lu Xun once wanted to translate it, but unfortunately passed away. I hope someone can take on this task of introduction. What he bestows upon us will surely not be small.

### Improved Year-End Settlement

— Meng Ruo

The end of the year is difficult to get through. When industry and commerce reach this point, they generally find it difficult to cope. Especially in recent years, due to the sluggish market, operators feel even more miserable. In the past three or four years, many businesses in this city were unable to maintain themselves during the year-end settlement period and declared bankruptcy. This is naturally the impact of the global economic panic.

However, last year's situation was somewhat different. According to the report on the 14th, all industries in this city were able to safely overcome the difficulties. In particular, the financial industry showed a good situation, opening up a situation not seen in five years. The financial panic was most severe two or three years ago. During the year-end settlement period of the 23rd year, several banks and firms were forced to close. By the 24th year, the situation became even more tense, with 14 banks closing and 9 remittance firms going bankrupt. Last year, however, interbank lending rates were relaxed, foreign exchange was stable, the volume of negotiable instruments increased, and the prices of public bonds and securities trended upward, which can be said to be a period of financial stability.

Not only was this the case in Shanghai, but the news on the same day carried reports from various places, such as Fuzhou, Jiading, Changshu, Jiangyin, Changzhou, and Nantong, all reporting good news, saying that the situation in industry and commerce last year had improved. The year-end settlement showed good results in debt collection, and there were many who profited. This phenomenon is gratifying.

There are roughly two reasons for the improved year-end settlement last year. First, agricultural production was abundant in various places, so industry and commerce benefited from it and were revitalized. Second, the government implemented a new currency policy, which stabilized the financial industry.

However, this good situation may be temporary and may not be universal. For example, in Guangdong Province, according to the report on the same day, the economic situation was extremely bad last year, and all industries felt the difference between the past and the present. This is proof of this. In other places, industry and commerce probably remain as distressed as in previous years.

As far as the lives of the general people are concerned, the situation has not only not improved, but has even become more difficult. Because the prices of all goods in the market rose last year, and the degree of consumption increased. However, the rewards for hardworking farmers and workers, and small and medium-sized clerks who rely on salaries, remained the same. This cannot but affect them. Taking daily necessities as an example, firewood and rice were expensive in Shanghai last year, and fish, meat, and vegetables all rose in price. As a result, even if residents lived extremely frugally, they still suffered from the burden.

Comparing the above-mentioned situations, it can be seen that the improvement in industry and commerce last year was only an abnormal phenomenon. Because the revitalization of various industries must wait until the lives of the people are stable. Therefore, in order to hope that the market can become more and more prosperous in the future, it is necessary to find ways to improve the living standards of the people. Otherwise, the so-called improvement may be difficult to sustain.

### Early Spring Night Record

— Luo Zhihua

When spring comes, everything seems to change.

At night, I walk alone through the lonely street. The spring breeze gently strokes my face. The feeling is the same as usual: spring has begun. I raise my head. The color of the sky is like being painted with a thick layer of dark green oil paint, so moist and so beautiful. The moon is just a small bud, stuck on top, like a white sail floating in the ocean. The Big Dipper shines brightly. It has a scissor-like tail and two pointed wings, like a swallow, flying swiftly. The air is fresh and beautiful, with not a speck of dust mixed in it. From one end of the street, you can see the other end without any obstruction. The street lamps quietly emit light, like a giant eye, watching the growth of all things, and the rainbow-like halo surrounding it smiles slightly.

Every night, I look forward to the arrival of spring, remembering the names of the stars that my mother showed me when I was lying in her arms as a child. Now, it has really come. Sitting on the bed, listening to the drifting bells of the nearby Jesus Church, the footsteps of spring slowly move closer to my window. It gently reaches in with the fingers of the wind and shakes hands with me, saying:

"Spring has come!"

My heart is as happy as lying in my mother's arms.

I like spring, I like the moonlight of spring, and that Big Dipper. Because I am a child of spring, born in the bright spring. However, I have never been close to spring. I grew up in a painful life. However, I look forward to the arrival of spring, just like the words in Pushkin's poem:

"Misfortune's" faithful sister,

Is the "hope" from that dark ground

He encourages courage and joy,

What is coming is the great opportunity.

Every time spring comes, I always remember Eroshanko's prose "Spring and its Power" that I read when I was a child.

### "Old Shanghai"

— Chun Shen

Just living in Shanghai for a long time does not mean you are an "Old Shanghai," you must be very familiar with everything in Shanghai to be considered an Old Shanghai.

Old Shanghai people don't like to get cheap things, because "cheap" is definitely not good quality. For example, cod liver oil is a seasonal gift now, but cheap, miscellaneous brands of cod liver oil are not refined well and are ineffective. Old Shanghai people will never be fooled.

So when Old Shanghai people buy cod liver oil, they always go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy, because Wuzhou's own brand of milky white cod liver oil is precisely tested with the blue reaction method, and the vitamin content is abundant. Wuzhou's Earth brand malt extract cod liver oil is made with pure turtle cod liver oil and high-quality malt extract, etc. It tastes very sweet and is the most reliable.

### My Sleeping Method

— Bi Hu

In cold weather, because my limbs are stiff, I often suffer from insomnia, which is very distressing! Later, a friend told me that he taught me to wash my feet with hot water before going to bed, adding a small amount of "Yalin Sand" to the water. This can make the blood flow down, calming the brain and inducing sleep? Second, it can relieve itching and dispel dampness, eliminating athlete's foot; after implementing it according to the law, I really get a good night's sleep every night. And my wife also puts "Yalin Sand" in the water every night when she washes, and she is still very healthy! I think this is the effect of disinfection. So I wrote it out for everyone to use.

"Yalin Sand" is packaged in four types: four-ounce bottles, eight-ounce bottles, one-pound bottles, and two-pound bottles. Two-pound bottles are the most cost-effective. All Wuzhou pharmacies and large pharmacies sell them.

## Page 20

His passionate words have always inspired my heart. I always find them and read them quietly. But this year, I can't find them. Maybe they were lost in my hometown, or maybe they were squeezed into a corner. But I can't forget Eroshanko, the kind and respectable blind poet, those words that encouraged me year after year...

He said that spring is great and has incomparable power. He said: "Friends, spring lives with us. He dominates our fields and our gardens. He rules everywhere. He is about to pass through people's cold hearts, and he is also going to knock on the doors of souls drowsing in darkness and indifference. He covers our fields with a piece of green velvet blanket; he decorates our gardens with beautiful and fragrant flowers; he makes birds sing love songs, he makes rivers whisper words of hope, he makes the gentle evening breeze bring back his secret and dear dreams to the disappointed heart. He makes us forget all the loneliness of the long and cold winter nights, the betrayals of the cold and dark winter hearts; every walk to the fields and mountains shows us a new world of beauty; every night, at that time, the new moon sends down his warm silver kisses to the tired earth, is a new revelation"!

I have experienced all these words. Time passes quickly. After several springs, I have reached adulthood. After reviewing what he said, I took one of his questions and asked myself. He said: Under these various revelations, in the garden of your heart, "friend, what kind of seeds will you sow in spring"?

What kind of seeds have I planted in the past? Only one kind: let spring always be in my cold heart. But I never got any results. Only one autumn of one year, a friend sowed a seed of truth in my heart, and it grew up in the cultivation of me and my friend. Because of the growth of this seed, I only understood this year that spring can always live in our hearts. At the same time, I can also plant other seeds in my heart. So, what do I plant? There is only one kind that I like, which is figs.

I planted this seed.

I want to work silently, using the strength I have, to make the seeds sprout, grow, and bloom. However, the flowers cannot be seen by others. I don't need them to see them. Let it bloom secretly, wither secretly, and when people don't notice it, I will harvest it with the happy heart of spring, harvesting full, purple, and radiant fruit... That fruit is numerous, full...

It's late at night. The color of the sky is even more lovely. The red and green lights of the neon lights in the city dissolve into the blue of the sky lonely, turning into a micro-purple, like the color of ripe figs, like the color of figs poking out their faces from green leaves...

I closed the book, looked through the glass window, looked at this color, and had unspeakable spring happiness in my heart. The night wind blew in warmly, penetrated into my heart, and warm spring settled in my heart. Let me work silently and harvest my own fruits silently!

### Three Baldy

— Ma Feng

I haven't seen Three Baldy carrying his candy stall on the street for half a month. I saw him this morning. He is not like he used to be, he has no energy, his smile is gone, his skin is yellow and his face is thin, like someone who crawled out of a grave.

When Aunt Zhang met him, she opened her mouth in surprise.

"Old San, why did you come to the street before you got better? Look at the complexion on your face - it hasn't recovered at all!"

Three Baldy stopped carrying the load, looked at Aunt Zhang, smiled coldly - no, he smiled perfunctorily, shook his head, and said:

"What can I do? I've been sick for almost twenty days! All my money is spent. What can I do if I don't go to the street? Carrying the candy stall around the city can also relax my mind, so I don't have to stay at home and worry for nothing!..."

Aunt Zhang couldn't say anything, and nodded in agreement. Three Baldy turned his head to leave, but Aunt Zhang stopped him.

"I remembered something, Old San, please take the trouble to inquire about the price of rice for us. My man is going to the city tomorrow..."

Three Baldy agreed before she finished speaking! - He knew what Aunt Zhang wanted him to do: to inquire about the market so that she could go to the city to buy.

Three Baldy started walking on the road to the city.

The weather was strangely warm, and Three Baldy was not completely well - he was weak, and he broke out in a sweat as he walked. When he entered the city gate, he saw the police checking people coming and going as if something had happened, and he panicked: he looked uneasily.

"Oh, oh! I don't know what happened again!"

Three Baldy said to himself. He walked, trying his best to calm down: - No matter what it is, it has nothing to do with me! But he hadn't walked a few steps with his load when he was surrounded by four policemen. Three Baldy panicked. When a policeman came up and wanted to grab his arm, he became even more afraid: -

"What's the matter? Oh my, arresting rebels... arresting me..."

Three Baldy's face turned pale with fright. A consciousness drilled into his head, dodged away from the policeman's hand, dropped the load, and ran desperately out of the city. He kept turning his head to look: were they chasing after him? He turned his head to look, turned his head to look - he had to run even harder: red stars and green stars were spinning in front of his eyes; his legs were rising and falling with great effort, as if they were not self-reliant, as if he were stepping on cotton bales. Sweat was streaming down, and the hair that was more than an inch long was all standing up! - The hat was grabbed by the police when he ran out of the city gate.

Five or six policemen were chasing desperately behind Three Baldy, shouting loudly - let the policemen in front intercept him! The police siren rang.

Three Baldy had no way to go: there were people blocking him in front: there were people chasing him from the side! He couldn't find his footing in panic. What he saw in his eyes was a moat. He looked at the opposite bank - and jumped into the moat. The river water was flowing non-stop. He tried his best to swim. He opened his eyes to look: all around was dark, full of people. When Three Baldy was submerged by the river water and tried desperately to struggle to get up, lumps of mud fell into the river - splash splash splash... the river water jumped up... He was exhausted. He did not beat the river water - he sank down.

Three Baldy's body was placed next to the city gate, waiting for the medical officer's inspection. People crowded into an egg to see! Look! This opium addict. People chatted.

The body was examined: the face was smoky... death by drowning.

Three Baldy had no family members, and the body was buried in a public cemetery.

Three Baldy's candy stall can no longer be seen on the street. People in the town all thought he died of illness.

### New Year's Life in the Alleyway of the Abolished Calendar

— Written by Chen Haoxiong

### Official Style Writing

— Ye

Official documents going back and forth in officialdom are probably like lawsuits. It seems that only in this way can the dignity of being an official be maintained. So, over time, it has become a fixed pattern. Official documents to superiors must use phrases like "etc. because of this." If phrases like "etc. based on this information" are used, it's not just a joke. Moreover, it is said that the more ambiguous the meaning expressed in the text, the more it demonstrates that one is an experienced document writer.

When ordinary people file lawsuits, besides being "brought in for interrogation," they must first submit a written petition. Now there are "great lawyers." There weren't any in the Qing Dynasty, but there were similar "litigation masters." The petitions were also called "report lists." We can still buy them in the market today, "Four Great Wicked Litigators of Modern Times." Flipping through them, you truly feel that a "major event," once in their hands, immediately turns into nothing, or something is created out of nothing, ultimately causing the other party's family to be ruined and their people to die. In fact, examining their function closely, there are only one or two words, and these one or two words are ambiguous.

This kind of writing used in officialdom, once it reaches the level of the common citizens, its meaning becomes even more extensive. The common people have given it another name, called "official style writing," and its meaning has broadened to include everything that "emphasizes form over substance."

Since "official style writing" is a hypocritical decoration, a black shop selling human flesh buns, and hanging a sheep's head while selling dog meat, then even if the train arrives at the scheduled time, it can still be tens of minutes late. Even if civil servants are not in the office during office hours, and even though the long-distance bus compartment is prominently displaying a sign saying this bus is limited to "thirty-three people," it can still exceed to forty-three people, or even more than forty-three people.

So much official talk is spoken, so much "official style writing" is produced. If China does not get rid of "official style writing" one day, then it will be hanging an empty sign one day.

——How can we remove this sign?

### Miracle

— Luojia

I read a telegram in this newspaper, the date of which I cannot remember. The content of the telegram was: The World Catholic Congress held Children's Day today. A Filipino elementary school student named Fan Jiala crawled four hundred yards to the altar of the Congress and prostrated himself to pray. It was announced to the public that he lost his voice due to illness at the age of six and could not speak, and the doctors were helpless. Last year, he silently prayed to God, seeking help and vowing to be a devout believer in God for life. By the end of the year, he could gradually speak. The child then firmly stated: "I believe this must be God's work. God gave me my life first and restored my voice. I will wholeheartedly dedicate myself to God." Everyone was amazed and considered it a miracle.

This is naturally a "miracle." When I read "firmly stated," it was as if that mute Filipino elementary school student was actually reciting the "Gospel of Matthew" loudly in my ear. However, I happened to have a medical magazine on hand, with clinical experiences of famous doctors appended at the end. There was also a similar "miracle" in it, but the person who helped that unfortunate mute who "lost his voice due to illness" "gradually speak" was not "God," but a famous Japanese doctor. According to the record, the vocal cords were in a state of constriction, thus causing "loss of voice." It is now unknown to what extent that Filipino elementary school student "lost his voice"; but since it is said that he lost his voice due to illness and could not speak, it can be confirmed that he "had not yet become completely mute." When we were studying basic physiology in middle school, we already knew that pronunciation relies on the vibration of the vocal cords, like the sound track of a sound film. If something goes wrong with the vocal cords, then naturally one "cannot speak." However, the difference between the constricted state of the vocal cords and a true mute, as I am not a famous doctor, nor God, I am not in a position to make reckless judgments. That Filipino elementary school student's ability to "restore my voice" probably belongs to the former condition. The so-called "doctors were helpless" is just that those "generous" quack doctors recorded the credit on God's account.

However, to put it another way, I am not opposed to freedom of religion here. It is everyone's freedom for Chinese people to believe in Bodhisattvas and for that Filipino elementary school student to vow to wholeheartedly dedicate himself to God, but in the era of scientific enlightenment in the twentieth century, when medicine has already invented the use of X-rays to illuminate various diseases, asking Bodhisattvas for elixirs or silently praying to God is taking life too lightly.

"Every prayer is answered" and "miracles" are both promotional items, and all religious promotional items are even more "miracles" among "miracles."

Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM

Opening "Spring Chamber Complaint"

Curved railings, curved walls. Winding and twisting around the corridor. Walking back and forth through fragrant paths. A gust of wind comes, a burst of fragrance. Butterflies flutter. Swallows fly. Branches and leaves cast shadows on the weeping willows. But behold, the peach blossoms are bright as brocade. Willow catkins flutter wildly. And listen, the iron horses clang and the wind sounds. Orioles sing sweetly like drums and sheng flutes. The curtain hooks are not seen rolled up heavily. The lingering fragrance of Han Shou's incense from the burner. Thinking of me, muddleheaded and lingering with old hatred. Weary and lazy to embroider mandarin ducks. Jade comb does not smooth silken hair. Treasured mirror lavishly applies light makeup. All day long, sitting alone in the boudoir, the sound is silent. Aroused, I lie listlessly on the bed. Then call, add burning fire to the furnace. The maidservant busily decocts medicine. But hearing, the wind and rain patter sadly outside the window. The fox lamp is dim, the night is long with sorrow. I cannot help but think about right and wrong in my heart. Whispering to myself, secretly pondering. I remember, I and you had an appointment before. I only hoped to accompany my Xiao Lang morning and evening. Unexpectedly, a storm arose in the vast sea of love. Leaving me, alone and lonely, guarding the empty room. My intestines are broken inch by inch. Thinking and missing him, tears streaming down my face. From now on, the road is long and I cannot hope for news. Blood and tears stain my face, crying until I break. I feel bitter rain and loneliness. Sad wind rustles, forming bleakness. Only the lamp remains, dimly shedding red beans. Quietly, the gauze curtains are dim and without light. Alas, I hate my fleeting life. Tears soak through my silk clothes. Look, the green grass in the courtyard is green year after year. I only hate that strands of love cannot be tied for long. My dream soul vaguely matures as millet.

Hou Jiuxia "Double Pearl Phoenix"

Li Shude (940) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM

Opening "Lin Daiyu"

The beauty of Xiaoxiang's concubine is unparalleled. Hearing, the parrot reciting poetry wants to break its heart. Golden wind blows down autumn paulownia leaves. Her slender body feels the evening coolness. Stop the embroidery thread. Close the gauze window. Having bathed in the orchid chamber, she arranges her remaining makeup. Lightly applies snail ink to her green eyebrows. Lightly dyes rouge on her fragrant skin. Jade threads obliquely comb her greasy hair. Faded red shirt reveals her fragrant skin. Standing quietly on the jade steps, speechless. Gently waving a fan against the setting sun. The golden crow gradually sets in the western mountains. The moon rises on the treetops, reflecting the silver wall. Turning and twisting, she pities her beautiful shadow. Softly calling Xueyan to light the silver lamp. Ziju, a maidservant, asks her mistress. Why do you always sigh and shed tears? A heart full of secrets, no one knows. For whom do you become thin and lose your beauty? Helplessly, the night is long. Loosening her silk clothes, she goes to bed. Hearing, the rain beats on the banana leaves, wetting the crabapples.

### Random Notes on "Elastic Daughter"

In "Elastic Daughter," there are three dancers with different personalities. One is Fang Lizhu. She is a sophisticated young woman who has been disappointed in love several times. She believes that love is terrible. She is a hedonist.

One is Hu Xuehua. Her personality is eccentric. She does not quite understand the true meaning of love. She only hopes that she can get a comfortable home. These two roles are guest-starred by Yan Yuexian and Zhu Qiuhen, with excellent results.

The other is Mo Meipeng. She is oppressed by the burdens of life and has to engage in the dancer's life. She always wants to get rid of this bad environment, but she never fulfills her long-cherished wish. This role is played by Lu Ming.

### Assorted Notes on "Mr. Wang's Profitable Ways"

Mrs. Wang, Sang Shuzhen, who is short and terribly fat, and Mrs. Chen, Zhai Qiqi, who is thin and terribly tall, along with Miss A Yuan, Li Lin, who is young and beautiful, perform the folk dance "Beating the Lotus Palms" in "Mr. Wang's Profitable Ways."

Qin Shi Huang sought the elixir of immortality but did not succeed. However, modern science invented the "rejuvenation" thing in "Mr. Wang's Profitable Ways." Clearly, an old woman with wrinkled skin and white hair can actually turn into a young and beautiful girl, and a big dog can actually turn into a small dog, which is quite interesting.

### A Scene from "Streamlined Love"

### Newsreel of "Crossroads"

"Crossroads" is a work that depicts the suffering of unemployment using six educated youths as the warp and woof. The subject matter is very realistic and vivid.

Here, six different personalities and different developments are portrayed, forming a story of young people that is commonly found in this current society.

These six different characters are played by Zhao Dan, Ying Yin, and new talents Bai Yang, Lü Ban, Sha Meng, and Yi Ming. In the selection of characters, Shen Xiling had spent a lot of thought in advance.

Although "Crossroads" is a tragedy, the whole play is handled entirely with a comedic approach, which is very light and lively, and quite able to cater to the tastes of the general audience.

Wu Yin and You Guangzhao, two large fat people, play a poor unemployed couple here. Old You sings Peking opera and drinks yellow wine, and the performance is quite funny.
