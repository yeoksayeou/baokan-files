### Yangxing Town Advances and Retreats, I Hold the Line Against the Enemy at Qujiabang

The Battle of Yuepu: We Hold the Original Front Line; Our Air Force Attacks Five Enemy Ships at Night; Enemy Artillery Barrage Continues Unabated Around Zhanghuabang

The enemy uses all its naval, land, and air forces to attack Yangxing and Yuepu in multiple directions, bombarding with over a hundred cannons in a concentrated manner, and launching dozens of planes in a frenzy of bombing. Our loyal and brave soldiers shed blood to fight the enemy, advancing one after another. The area near Yangxing and Yuepu is ablaze, a scorched earth. After three days and nights of bloody battle, Yangxing Town advances and retreats. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented since the Shanghai War began. Ultimately, due to the overwhelming enemy artillery fire, to avoid excessive sacrifices, we withdrew from Yangxing yesterday afternoon, and the front line was shifted southeast to the Qujiabang area, actively preparing for a counterattack. In Yuepu, we are holding the original front line, still engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat. However, enemy reinforcements are arriving continuously, attempting to cut off our communication. Our army is fortifying every step, determined to die, and fighting desperately with the enemy. It is feared that the enemy will ultimately not succeed. The battle news from Luodian and Liuhe is relatively quiet, with the enemy still surrounded by us. In addition, around Wenzaobang and Zhanghuabang, the enemy is constantly bombarding with heavy artillery, causing minimal damage to our positions. At the Qiujiang Wharf, the enemy is still trapped on the riverbank, with no change in the Zhabei front line. Our air force attacked last night, bombing and damaging five enemy ships.

### Our Loyal and Brave Army Fought Bloody Battles at Yangxing

Retreating and Advancing: A Strategic Shift to Hold the Line at Qujiabang

The enemy concentrated its main force to attack Yangxing, with large numbers of tanks charging, supported by artillery fire and aircraft. A certain point on our front line was temporarily breached. Our fresh troops arrived and rushed to reinforce, launching a fierce counterattack against the enemy in the Yujiabang area northeast of Yangxing Town, engaging in an unprecedented charge and hand-to-hand combat. Our army advanced one after another, incredibly brave. However, Yangxing Town, from Yujiabang, has been turned into a scorched earth under the enemy's artillery fire and aircraft. After a day and night of bloody battle, by dawn yesterday morning, the enemy gradually became unsustainable and retreated outside Yangxing Town. Yesterday morning, the retreating enemy joined new troops and used over a hundred cannons to concentrate firepower, making a comeback and relentlessly bombarding our positions with over a thousand shells. At the same time, a large number of enemy troops advanced around our right flank to contain us. Under this difficult and arduous battle, our army strategically withdrew the front line to the Qujiabang area in the southeast. Fresh troops have arrived from the rear, preparing to launch a counterattack against the enemy.

The Central News Agency reports that, according to reports received at midnight, the focus of yesterday's battle completely shifted to the Yangxing and Yuepu lines. When the enemy advanced from the Wusong area, they relied entirely on fierce artillery fire as cover. It is estimated that the enemy's artillery participating in the battle totaled over a hundred cannons. Our army fought against the enemy's ammunition with flesh and blood. The bravery and heroism of the fighting spirit are truly earth-shattering and moving. When our army retreated from Yangxing the night before, the enemy did not notice and continued to bombard with heavy artillery for two hours before advancing with infantry. Our army waited for them to approach before launching a fierce counterattack. By yesterday morning, the enemy was ultimately unsustainable and collapsed, suffering heavy casualties. However, when our army re-entered Yangxing Town, the enemy bombarded again with heavy artillery and aircraft, and our army was forced to slightly shift the front line again. As of midnight, we were still closely monitoring the enemy in that area. Also, our army's position in Yuepu remained a straight line. Because Yuepu is close to the river, to avoid being surrounded by the enemy, we could not take the step of retreating strategically. However, the advance and retreat there are not critical. If the counterattack in Yangxing is successful, Yuepu can still drive straight in. Our army's new positions on the Yuepu-Yangxing line have been deployed and are waiting in formation to prevent the enemy from advancing further. The enemy's attempt to join forces with the remaining enemies in Luodian will definitely not succeed.

The Central News Agency reports that a large number of enemy troops, under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft, with tanks as the vanguard, broke through the first line of our Yangxing area yesterday (the 11th). After our army received reinforcements from the rear troops yesterday evening (the 11th), we joined forces to counterattack the enemy, advancing to the Yujiabang area east of Yangxing. Enemy ships anchored on the river concentrated artillery fire and bombarded our positions continuously throughout the night. At the same time, enemy planes also flew over and bombed until this morning (the 12th). From Yujiabang to Yangxing, all villages have been destroyed and turned into scorched earth. However, our soldiers are exceptionally loyal and brave, and although bullets are raining down, they do not retreat slightly and are still in bloody battle. At the same time, fierce fighting also occurred between Luodian and Liuhe from last night to this morning. The Central News Agency reports that the focus of the war has now shifted to the Yangxing area. The enemy has been reinforcing in Wusong for several days, transporting heavy weapons, and actively attacking, attempting to break through our encirclement. On the 10th, the enemy used many tanks to cover over a thousand infantry in an attack on the front of Yangxing. After being bravely repelled by our loyal soldiers, they began to concentrate bombardment with warships, artillery, and aircraft bombs. Yangxing Town has been turned into scorched earth. At that time, to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, our army retreated the front line. In the evening, we launched a counterattack, and the enemy stood firm in Zhuwen. After our army's bloody attack, the enemy gradually became unsustainable throughout the night, and Yangxing Town was recaptured by us. However, the enemy was still unwilling to give up. After dawn, they bombarded in turn with a hundred cannons, firing thousands of shells. At the same time, elite troops outflanked us from the right flank. For strategic reasons, we withdrew the front line to the Qujiabang area in the southeast and are still holding the line against the enemy with fresh troops.

### The Enemy at Zhanghuabang Fiercely Bombarded with Artillery All Day Yesterday and the Day Before

Nearby Houses Turned into Rubble; Our Army's Position Remains Immovable

The Central News Agency reports that the enemy and we are still facing off in the Wenzaobang and Zhanghuabang area south. The enemy has launched several attacks, but they have all been repelled by us. They are trapped along the coast and have made no progress, so they are extremely anxious. They are fiercely bombarding with artillery. From the 11th to last night, they continued for 24 hours without a moment's rest. Nearby houses have been turned into rubble, but our position remains immovable, and the soldiers on the front line are also vowing to defend to the death.

### The Enemy in Luodian is Still Surrounded

The Enemy in Liuhe Also Dares Not Attack

The Central News Agency reports that the enemy in the Luodian area has been surrounded by us for many days and has repeatedly tried to break through unsuccessfully. They now only have a small road leading to the sea and are waiting for reinforcements. Now that the enemy sees some progress in the Yangxing area, they are trapped and waiting to be relieved, so the battles on that line have been quite quiet for the past two days. Although a large number of enemy reinforcements have landed in the Liuhe area, after being dealt a severe blow by us, they have suffered heavy damage and are now reorganizing their positions, so they also dare not attack.

### The Enemy's Main Force Attacks Yuepu

The Enemy Advances Simultaneously by Sea, Land, and Air; Our Army Still Holds the Original Position

In addition to pouring all its strength into attacking Yangxing, the enemy is also using its main force to invade our Yuepu line. For three days and three nights, the enemy's combined naval, land, and air forces have been bombarding our positions non-stop. The entire line has been plunged into an unprecedentedly fierce bloody battle. In addition to concentrating fire with dozens of heavy cannons and fiercely bombarding, over a dozen enemy planes are circling over our positions, raining down bombs. Tanks are extremely active in front of the infantry. Our army is rising up to meet the attack, fighting hard and firmly, without retreating. Our army's mortars are bombarding enemy tanks, producing great effectiveness. At the same time, dense machine guns are firing on the advancing enemy, causing heavy casualties and losses to the enemy. However, reinforcements are arriving continuously. Last night, our army held the original front line, and this morning, both sides are still engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat.

### Our Air Force Attacks Enemy Ships Twice at Night, Five Ships Bombed and Damaged

The Central News Agency reports that our air force came to Shanghai twice last night, bombing enemy ships in the Yangshupu and Songkou areas. Although in the midst of dense artillery fire, they still calmly carried out their mission. Several enemy ships were hit and exploded, suffering heavy damage.

The Central News Agency, Nanjing, the 12th, Reuters reports that the government announced late tonight that the Chinese Air Force flew to Shanghai tonight to bomb Japanese warships. According to reports from flight masters, at least five Japanese ships were hit, including two cruisers. The Central News Agency reported that as of 11:30 last night, our planes had passed through the Huangpu River twice, and enemy ships continued to fire with anti-aircraft guns to prevent our attack, but our planes did not drop bombs and flew directly to Songkou to bomb enemy ships.

Our planes came to Shanghai once at 7:20 last night. When flying over the Huangpu River, they were discovered by enemy ships, and signal flares and anti-aircraft guns were fired all at once, like thunder. At that time, an enemy plane was scouting in the Pudong area, and they met in the air, engaging in fierce fighting. Gunshots were fired crisply in the air. After about a quarter of an hour of stalemate, our plane circled to the Yangshupu enemy positions and dropped bombs, causing a huge explosion. It then returned, passing over the Huangpu River. At the same time, at about 55 minutes, enemy anti-aircraft guns fired again, but our plane safely crossed and flew back to its original defense. At that time, our artillery also aimed and fired to coordinate.

### Enemy Planes Ran Rampant Again Yesterday

Scouting Everywhere Without Gaining Anything; Indiscriminately Dropping Sulfur Bombs, Causing a Big Fire

The Central News Agency reports that yesterday enemy planes again ran rampant in all directions. From 8:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the afternoon, they did not stop. The following is a summary of the enemy planes' rampage yesterday. At about 8:00 yesterday morning, six enemy planes took off from the enemy's temporary airport at the end of Yangshupu Road. After circling several times, they flew west to Zhabei Zhongshan Road and flew south along Zhongshan Road to Longhua, then flew back to the Gaochang Temple and Nanshi area to scout. From time to time, they scouted at low altitude and strafed our innocent civilians with machine guns. Then the six planes flew over Pudong to scout our Pudong positions. At about 10:00, the six planes were divided into two teams, one team of four, flying west to the Hongqiao Road and Route Cardinal Mercier area. They dropped six bombs near the Hongqiao Airport, destroying two civilian houses. One team of two always circled at low altitude over Pudong until 12:30. The two planes then circled Yangshupu and flew to the Zhabei area to scout. They dropped a bomb near the Macgregor Road station, destroying several civilian houses. They dropped five bombs in the Mongolia Road area, two of which exploded, destroying several more civilian houses. They then dropped two sulfur bombs near the Guangzhao Villa on Hengfeng Road and Guangzhao Road. The bombs fell on the poor people's thatched sheds, causing a big fire that burned fiercely. Because there was no water nearby, firefighters had to tear down nearby houses to prevent the fire from spreading. However, because the fire was too strong, rescue was difficult, and it continued to burn until evening before gradually subsiding. At 2:00 in the afternoon, two more enemy planes flew low to scout in Pudong, then flew to Nanshi, scouting at low altitude near the Ning Shao Company warehouse, and strafed our innocent civilians with machine guns. At about 3:00, the two planes flew to Zhabei and dropped two bombs in Nanggongyi Lane on Kulun Road, which immediately caught fire and burned fiercely. The houses in Nanggongyi Lane and Zhonggongyi Lane were all burned to the ground. Then the two planes flew to Pudong, circling back and forth, scouting at low altitude, and flew back to the enemy's temporary airport east of Yangshupu at about 6:00 in the afternoon. In addition, at about 12:00 noon yesterday, several more enemy planes scouted back and forth in the Yangxing and Yuepu area, dropping many bombs at the same time.

### The Enemy at Qiujiang Wharf Counterattacks Again

The enemy who landed at Qiujiang Wharf attempted to attack the downtown area. After being dealt a severe blow by our army, although the enemy has attacked again and again, for a week now, the enemy is still confined to the wharf and riverbank area, making no progress, only relying on solid buildings to block their retreat. The remnants of the enemy who retreated to Jungong Road harassed our positions last night under the cover of enemy warships' artillery fire in the Huangpu River. The reinforced troops were active on the left and right flanks, attempting to break through our Jungong Road defense line. After a certain unit of our army stood up to meet the attack, fierce fighting continued until noon yesterday, and the enemy had retreated and was still forced back to the vicinity of the wharf, retreating to the riverbank, surrounded by us on three sides.

### The Entire Pudong Front is Quiet

After the Japanese army engaged in a fierce artillery battle with our Pudong garrison the day before yesterday afternoon, they attempted to steal a landing near the Xinsan Well Pier (rumored to be the Chunjiang Pier or Huishan Pier, but these are inaccurate) near Qichang Warehouse. After our army bravely fought back, they were ultimately defeated and retreated. Therefore, the situation has now become calm again. Last night, the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River, in addition to encountering two air raids by us, spent the entire night in full alert for the return of our air force. Searchlights were constantly shining into the sky, revealing a state of panic, so they did not fire a single shot at the Pudong positions. The entire line was quiet yesterday morning. Only four Japanese planes circled and scouted in the ×××× area, flying very low. They had not flown away by noon. Observing their actions, they seemed to be scouting our army's positions in order to invade.

### No Change in the Zhabei Position

The Central News Agency reports that the enemy army again attacked our positions in the direction of the Patriotic Girls' School the day before yesterday at midnight. Our army calmly responded to the battle. When the enemy approached, we immediately swept densely with machine guns and attacked the enemy with hand grenades. The enemy army suffered heavy casualties and retreated unsustainable. At the same time, there were small contacts at various positions in Zhabei from the night before last (the 11th) to this morning. There have been no changes in the positions of both sides.

The Central News Agency reports that the enemy army attacked our positions in the direction of Baziqiao twice yesterday morning at dawn and at 9:30 in the evening. They were bravely repelled by the search army, and the enemy did not succeed.

### The Enemy Held a Temporary Meeting Yesterday

At 2:10 PM and 2:15 PM yesterday, two enemy destroyer No. 17s successively entered the Huangpu River, one berthed at buoy No. 1 and the other berthed at the Mitsubishi Pier behind the Japanese Consulate. At 4:30 PM, destroyer No. 21 successively berthed at the Mitsubishi Pier. All had a part of the enemy army escorting a small number of enemy officers ashore. A large number of black-plated cars arrived next to the Japanese Consulate on East Broadway Road. For a time, cars, horses, and dragons were crowded, and Broadway Road, which had been quiet for months, gradually became lively again, and the Japanese Consulate suddenly became bustling. At 5:00 PM, the cars successively drove away, and destroyer No. 20, which was berthed near the Japanese Consulate, also sailed out at this time. It is reported that this was a temporary meeting convened by the senior commanders of the enemy army invading Shanghai to report on the invasion of Shanghai over the past month and to discuss future counterattack strategies.

### Foreigners Inspect the Shanghai Front Line and Praise Our Army's Fighting Power

If Our Artillery Power is Equal to the Japanese Army, We Can Be Certain of Victory; We Have Sound Recommendations for Rescue of Wounded Soldiers

The Shanghai China Mail reported yesterday on the situation of the Chinese military front lines in Luodian and Wusong, which was specially praised. The article said, "The Chinese army guarding the 40-mile Luodian-Wusong area near Shanghai, which encountered a very large collection of mechanized armed forces, and the users were the Japanese army known for its fierce fighting, but it was still unyielding and coping with ease. Its bravery and discipline are truly worthy of the highest praise. What the former Chinese army was like, no matter what its true appearance was, was not something I wanted to discuss. Today, the divisions that resist the Japanese army's advance, even if their artillery power is far inferior to the enemy's, will never retreat. This can be said with the utmost firmness." These few words are the summary of the war correspondent, the Englishman Tielteman, after visiting the Chinese military front line. He has written several books on the Pacific region, such as "The Approaching Far East" and "The Uninspected Far East," which are all famous works of the time. This week, he inspected the Chinese military front lines in Luodian and Wusong. According to him last night (the 11th), "The battle in the Luodian area was unusually fierce, so I could not reach the front line of the Chinese army. I was forced at a certain point to abandon the car I was riding in and hide in a ditch for half an hour. At that time, the Japanese army bombarded with opening artillery, plus star shells, and occasionally a few heavy shells. The area near Liuhang was quite devastated. Then I went to inspect the Wusong front line and saw a large number of Chinese soldiers lying in the trenches, looking very happy, because they had just repelled the enemy's fierce attack. Looking from afar at the Chinese military front line outside Yangxing, the Japanese army seemed to have temporarily retreated to the second line of defense about a mile away. This can be distinguished by the firelight that occasionally appears in the surrounding darkness. The Chinese army in that area had some casualties, and the wounded were all gathered at several locations to wait for the Red Cross service cars to transport them back to Shanghai. However, what was more interesting than the actual situation of the Chinese military defense (because I had agreed with the Chinese military commander not to tell others about this, so I will not describe it), was the slight signs of the preparations I saw by the Chinese military commander to prevent the Japanese army from breaking through their positions. The trenches were all guarded by strong and well-equipped soldiers. My impression is that if the Chinese military's artillery power could be equal to the Japanese army's, then the soldiers who guard the important locations on this front line would definitely have greater achievements and show themselves off. In the night that the authorities called quiet, the Japanese army's artillery fire often concentrated on the Chinese military front line and the area behind the line, with shells dancing in the air like continuous beads, some of which were as large as six inches in diameter. The fierceness was reminiscent of the former Western European front line. The most distressing thing in the war zone was the lack of medical facilities for the loyal and brave soldiers. The wounded were often collected by their comrades and roughly bandaged. There may be doctors and nurses in the war zone, but I did not see them. The wounded all endured the pain, waiting for a long time before being transported back to Shanghai, because the ambulances could only arrive at the war zone at night, and they were afraid of being bombed by enemy planes in the air, so the lights on the cars were not lit, and even those who were seriously injured had to be delayed for a long time before they could be carried back. The bravery and dedication of the Chinese Red Cross volunteers is also to be admired. I rode in a Red Cross ambulance and helped to carry 30 seriously injured people from the war zone's dressing station back to the hospital, driving with the lights off on the road destroyed by artillery shells, which was extremely terrifying. Along the way, I saw more than 20 ambulances and military supply vehicles that had been modified roughly and overturned in the ditches on the side of the road because they could not distinguish the location in the dark night. Our car also almost overturned at a certain point. On the way, we stopped twice because we saw Japanese planes soaring nearby. Whether the Japanese planes mistakenly thought that our car was carrying bullets and dropped bombs to kill the 30 seriously injured and dying soldiers is unknown. Because the traffic behind the Chinese military front line is not wide, military supply vehicles and ambulances are indeed easily confused. For this reason, the journey that can be reached in about 80 minutes during the day took nearly five hours. When we arrived in Shanghai, the east was already white, so we quickly sent the wounded to the hospital. There are still many seriously wounded soldiers behind the front line, but after dawn, the rescue army cannot drive to save them, and they may have to be left for a day before they can be transported back. Red Cross workers told me that objects moving on the ground during the day are bombed by enemy planes when they see them. Whether this panic is reasonable, I will not make any comments. I only regret that the two sides of the war cannot agree to send wounded soldiers on a certain route at a certain time of day. This method benefits soldiers and children who fight with extreme loyalty (I have seen several young people under the age of 18 among the wounded), and can greatly help eliminate a kind of view in this unfortunate war. According to the opinion of neutral observers, the increase in the number of Chinese soldiers injured and killed is because the Japanese army actually controls the sky, and because rescuers are afraid of being attacked and bombed by Japanese planes, they only act at night, which is extremely difficult. If it is possible to clearly define the area to collect the wounded of both sides and avoid land and air attacks, then the fact that I saw many wounded soldiers in the Yangxing area being bandaged by their comrades, and that Japanese planes came to bomb the village only 30 minutes after leaving Liuhang, would not happen. Whether the Japanese planes' bombing injured the wounded again, I do not know. If it did not injure them, then it is really difficult to predict. If we do not clearly delineate the Red Cross area now, this kind of coincidence cannot be expected to be seen again." Regarding the section that the Japanese military spokesman claimed that there was a women's team in the Chinese army on the Song-Wu front line, Tiel said that he had not seen it. "If there is a women's team in the front line I saw, it would be difficult for me to recognize it, because the night I went to the front line was unusually dark. I sat on a pile of things and drank a bottle of beer. At first, I thought I was sitting on a bag of rice, but after 15 minutes, I realized that it was about 30 corpses. Near the front line, even if I wanted to strike a match, it was not liked by the commoners, because they were full of experience and knew that as soon as the Japanese soldiers saw the firelight, they could shoot straight at it." Tiel has seen the Japanese army many times in Manchuria and North China, so he knows them well. At the end of Tiel's day, "The former Chinese army is very different from the soldiers I saw guarding the trenches, blocking the main road from Huangpu to the interior, and being trustworthy and disciplined. They respond to the incredible hardships with a spirit of loyalty and bravery, and all the most complimentary words that can be written are worthy of them without shame."

The Shanghai Times said that several foreign inspectors went to the Chinese military front line on Friday night, as far as Qiujiang Wharf. On the way, they passed Zhongshan Road and unnamed alleys and bridges. Because it was dark, they could not identify them one by one. When the people returned, they all praised the battle strength and morale of the Chinese army on the Shanghai front line. The people left the western district at 6:00 in the evening, intending to inspect the positions everywhere, and returned to Shanghai the next night. However, because of the shelling of Japanese ships outside Wusongkou and the frequent attacks by Japanese planes, they hurriedly returned before dawn yesterday. The observers have not yet made concrete remarks about what they saw on this trip, but according to one of them, the Japanese army did not seem to have made much progress at the positions where the people went. The Chinese army was deeply hidden in the trenches, and they hid during the day to prevent Japanese planes from seeing them. In the past week, the fierce bombing by Japanese warships and the four-way throwing of bombs by Japanese planes seemed to have only destroyed some rice fields and several houses. However, according to Chinese military officers, the waiting officers often carefully kept the soldiers as far away from the houses as possible, because the bombing of the Wusong Baoshan Luodian front line by Japanese planes often targeted the houses. In terms of the number of shells and bombs used by the Japanese army, the number of Chinese soldiers who died and were injured as a result was very small. Another inspector, who had participated in the European War, praised the Red Cross staff and volunteers for their adventurous rescue of wounded soldiers and their tireless work.

### Japan's Armed Aggression Against Our Country Formally Appealed to the League of Nations

Based on Articles 3, 10, and 17 of the Covenant, Swift and Effective Measures to Address Threats to World Peace

[Geneva] The Chinese delegation here formally submitted an appeal to the League of Nations tonight regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict, based on Articles 3, 10, and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant. Article 3 stipulates that the League of Nations Assembly may convene when necessary to deal with any event within the scope of the League's actions or related to world peace. Article 10 stipulates that members of the League of Nations undertake to respect and maintain the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members against external aggression. In the event of such aggression, or any threat or danger of such aggression, the Executive Council shall devise methods for fulfilling this obligation. Article 17 stipulates that if a member has a dispute with a non-member state, the non-member state shall be invited to assume the obligations of a member of the League of Nations. If it refuses to do so and engages in war with a member of the League of Nations, the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant regarding sanctions may be applied to the country taking such action. In its appeal to the League of Nations, the Chinese delegation issued a formal statement stating that the Chinese government, in view of the unprecedented seriousness of Japanese aggression, has decided to bring the matter before the League of Nations again. In creating this situation, Japan is not only threatening the existence of China, but also endangering the security of other countries' territories and treaty rights. After recounting the Japanese military actions of the past two months, the statement continued, stating that Japan's dispatch of large armies to Shanghai is nothing more than an attempt to control Shanghai, the gateway to the Yangtze River basin, and to attack Nanjing. (Havas dispatch of the 12th from the Central News Agency)

Contents of the Application

Briefly stated, "Japan continues to threaten China's independence, as well as the territories and interests of foreign countries in the Far East, causing the situation in the Far East to be extremely serious. Since 1931, Japan has constantly provoked and attacked China. Japan's policy of conquering China is now obvious. Recently, Japan has again dispatched a large number of troops to North China and Shanghai, and has violated international law by bombing undefended cities. Therefore, the crisis in the Far East has now become a global crisis. Japan's aggression not only threatens China's independence and territorial integrity, but also threatens world peace. The Chinese government, therefore, believes that the League of Nations should immediately consider the matter and take effective measures to put an end to Japan's intolerable acts of aggression and slaughter, and to preserve the sanctity of international treaties. The Chinese government also hopes that the United States will participate in the activities of the League of Nations, as in the past, and that other countries with interests in the Far East that are not members of the League of Nations will also work together to eliminate aggression and restore peace in the Far East." (Havas dispatch of the 10th from the Central News Agency)

### Declaration by Our Delegation

Denouncing Japanese Atrocities

[Geneva] Our delegates to the League of Nations Assembly, namely Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, Minister to England Guo Taiqi, and Ambassador to Belgium Qian Tai, issued a formal statement to the press regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict upon their arrival here. They stated that in view of the unprecedented seriousness of Japanese aggression against China, the Chinese government has decided to appeal to the League of Nations again. The situation in the Far East has suffered an extremely unfortunate reversal in the past two months. This situation not only threatens China's existence and independence, but also endangers the security of the powers' territories and the rights enjoyed under treaties. When the Manchurian Incident occurred, the Chinese representatives to the League of Nations repeatedly stated that Japan was adopting a policy that violated international treaties in order to conquer China, rule Manchuria, and dominate the Pacific. The use of force to carry out its policies is the real reason why the Japanese armed forces have continuously provoked and invaded China since 1931. It is also the reason why Japan, after forcibly occupying the three northeastern provinces, has continued to invade Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Hebei. In the past two months, after Japan created the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7, it dispatched 250,000 troops to China. After forcibly occupying Beiping, Tianjin, Nankou, and Zhangjiakou, it continued to invade Shanxi and advance southward along the Jinpu and Pinghan lines. Since mid-August, Japan has concentrated 60,000 troops in the Songhu area, repeatedly attacking the Chinese defense forces, resulting in the loss of life of thousands of people, and the loss of property of Chinese and foreigners amounting to tens of millions of dollars. The purpose of Japan's dispatch of such a large force to Shanghai is nothing more than to control Shanghai, the gateway to the rich and prosperous Yangtze River basin and the main commercial city of the Far East, and then to invade Nanjing, the capital of China. Japanese air force has indiscriminately carried out killings and destruction in undefended cities, from Zhangjiakou and Datong in the north to Shantou and Guangzhou in the south. These cities are mostly unrelated to military affairs. Non-combatants and refugees gathered at various railway stations have been repeatedly bombed. Even diplomatic representatives of friendly nations who were traveling on official business far from the battlefield have been bombed and machine-gunned by Japanese aircraft. Japan completely disregards international law and the common humanity of respecting non-combatants. This is a shame to civilization. The Japanese navy, after concentrating its fleet at the mouth of the Yangtze River and in the Huangpu River, has been bombarding the bustling Shanghai and the densely populated and industrially prosperous Pudong area every day. Now, Japan has announced an illegal blockade of the entire Chinese coast, interfering with the legitimate trade of Chinese and foreign shipping. The principles of freedom of the seas and freedom of trade have been greatly undermined by this action of Japan. The crisis in the Far East has now truly evolved into a world crisis. Japan's aggression not only threatens China's independence and territorial integrity, but also endangers world peace in general. Therefore, the Chinese government and people are convinced that the League of Nations, representing a large group of peace-loving nations, should consider and adopt effective plans to stop Japan's intolerable continuation of aggression and brutal acts in China, and to uphold the dignity of international treaties. China also hopes that the United States, which values peace and international justice, will support the actions of the League of Nations as in the past, and that other countries with interests in the Far East that are not members of the League of Nations will also contribute their generous efforts to stop aggression and promote peace.

### Our Chargé d'Affaires in Austria Publishes an Article

China Is No Longer What It Used to Be, Will Respond to Attacks with Attacks

[Vienna] Tong Deqian, China's Chargé d'Affaires in Austria, recently published an article in the "Neue Wiener Journal," stating, "Why doesn't Japan declare war on China? A state of war has already occurred in China, which is known to everyone in the world. If Japan declares war on China, from a practical point of view, there will be very little change in the current situation. However, from a legal and moral point of view, the differences would be extremely significant. As for China, it has always advocated peace, but for the sake of defending against foreign aggression, China now has a strong air force. If Japan bombs Chinese non-combatant civilians and continues to do so, Chinese planes will also go and bomb Japanese cities one day." The conclusion stated that Japan proposed to China to conclude an anti-communist pact to jointly attack the Soviet Union, which is evidenced by documents. Although the Japanese government has denied it, it is of no use. (Havas dispatch of the 12th from the Central News Agency)

### League of Nations Assembly Opens Today

Spanish Prime Minister Presiding

[Geneva] The 18th regular session of the League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to open at 11:00 AM tomorrow, and will temporarily hold meetings in the old temporary venue. However, this is the last time. The meeting hall in the new League of Nations headquarters will be completed on the 25th of this month, and the General Assembly will then change to hold meetings there. When the General Assembly opens tomorrow, the President of the Executive Council, Spanish Prime Minister Negrín, will serve as the temporary chairman. In addition to the opening speech by the temporary chairman Negrín, a Credentials Committee will be formed and submit a report. As for Argentina, it is unlikely to send a representative to Geneva, but it will notify the League of Nations of this decision and reaffirm Argentina's right to continue to be a member state of the League of Nations. The issues to be discussed at this General Assembly will focus on the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish government delegation will request that the entire situation in Spain be considered, and will be supported by delegations from the Soviet Union and other countries. The Chinese delegation will also submit the Sino-Japanese issue for consideration by the General Assembly. In addition, the general economic and financial situation and the report submitted by the League of Nations Raw Materials Committee will also be the focus of the General Assembly's attention. The current economic difficulties and economic recovery issues are the most concerned by the representatives of the countries present. In short, the League of Nations Assembly is held the day after the successful conclusion of the Nyon Conference on the Mediterranean, and its prospects are certainly optimistic.

### Hull Declaration

Document Delivered to the League of Nations

[Washington] After Secretary of State Hull issued a written statement on July 16, expounding the various principles of peace policy, 56 governments have submitted replies, expressing their approval. (The reply submitted by the Afghan government has not yet arrived due to traffic delays.) Hull recently instructed the US Minister to Switzerland to copy this written statement, together with the replies from the governments of those countries, and send them to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, and explained that "the diplomatic policy of the United States is aimed at achieving lasting peace, which has been supported by more than 50 governments." (Havas dispatch of the 11th from the Central News Agency)

[Washington] Commentators believe that the US government's move is to show the League of Nations that the United States has first tried to prevent the Far East war, and at the same time encourage the League of Nations to adopt the same firm position. Although the extent to which the United States can participate in this League of Nations meeting has stopped here, because China will raise a protest about Japan's aggression at the League of Nations meeting, and at the same time, the civil war in Spain and the situation in the Mediterranean are very tense, the US move is indeed very noteworthy.

### Enemy Planes in Two Formations Invade Guangdong

Six Enemy Planes Fly from Taiwan in Different Routes, Our Air Force Shoots Down One Enemy Flagship

Guangzhou Dispatch: The enemy army has recently dispatched over ten warships to the Minnan and Xiamen sea areas along Shantou and Nan'ao, blockading our coastline. They have recently sent bomber planes to stealthily attack the hinterland of the northeastern region of Guangdong Province and the Humen Fortress. The first intrusion occurred at 5:40 am on August 31st. Emerging from the faint light of dawn, they advanced slowly. The first formation consisted of three giant bombers in a triangular formation, circling at an altitude of approximately 4,000 feet. Because it was just dawn, the lights on the planes were intermittently flashing. Citizens climbed onto rooftops to observe, learning that the enemy planes were coming from the northwest, seemingly following the Yuehan Railway line. Flying near Yuexiu Mountain, they turned east, feigning low-altitude bombing. Shortly after, a second enemy formation, also consisting of three planes, came from the east along the coast, attempting to directly enter the Guangzhou city area to bomb. These two formations came from Tainan, Taiwan, with Guangzhou as their meeting point. Those coming from the northeast passed through western Fujian, crossed the Guangdong border through Meixian, Jiaoling, and Pingyuan, turned out of Beiwang, and arrived in Shaozhou. Upon reaching Shaozhou at around 2:00 am on the 31st, they dropped four bombs. After bombing Shaozhou, the enemy planes followed the Yuehan Railway line south. Our air force, having received the news, immediately took off to intercept and surround the enemy planes. At this time, our fighter planes pursued the enemy planes and encountered the second enemy formation coming from the east, engaging in a fierce battle. The two enemy formations (totaling six planes) converged and attempted to enter the city airspace from the northeastern suburbs. Just as they flew to the southeastern corner of the city, the air defense units within the city opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, densely firing at the enemy planes, initiating an unprecedented aerial battle over Guangzhou. At that time, the northeastern suburbs of the city were filled with the booming sound of cannons, and cannonballs followed the enemy planes, exploding in mid-air with flames shooting out. The enemy planes, unable to fly low due to our dense artillery fire, turned east from the northern suburbs, allowing the city area to remain safe. The sound of anti-aircraft guns then ceased, and it was already around 7:00 am.

After the enemy planes fled east from the Guangzhou city area, they planned to exit Humen along the Pearl River basin and bomb the fortress, but our fighter planes had already intercepted them in the suburbs, pursuing the enemy planes to the Taipingxu area in Dongguan. Our fighter plane squadron leader, a certain Mr. He, discovered that the enemy bomber planes were using signal flags to request instructions from the enemy flagship. The enemy flagship also responded with signal flags. Our plane immediately overtook the enemy flagship at top speed and strafed it with machine guns. The enemy flagship was hit and severely damaged, crashing to the ground. The remaining two planes also escaped with injuries. Our planes, seeing them fly away, immediately returned to base. It was already 8:20 am, and the city had also lifted the alarm. The morale of the people in the city slightly stabilized. At 2:20 pm, another enemy plane was spotted at an altitude of 5,000 feet, flying from north to east. It did not drop any bombs when crossing the city area, seemingly a stray enemy plane fleeing in panic. Our planes received the news and immediately took off to pursue, chasing it to the Shilong Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, where the enemy plane disappeared. When the enemy planes came, Chinese traitors were distributed near various important institutions, sending signals to the enemy planes to identify targets. Military police arrested multiple individuals near the Finance Department on Shuihan Road and near the Tianhe Airport. They are currently under investigation and will be severely punished.

After the incident, investigations revealed that our air force shot down one enemy flagship during this enemy plane attack, which crashed in the Shanzhupeng area, more than forty miles outside the eastern suburbs of Dongguan County (the seventh district of the county). Local residents discovered it and reported it to the county government. The county government immediately sent personnel to investigate. It was found that the enemy plane's unexploded bombs detonated upon crashing to the ground. The bodies of the five enemy combatants inside the plane had been blown to pieces, leaving only five skulls. Enemy serial numbers, nicknames, talismans, diaries, maps, and enemy flags were found among the wreckage. The nickname on the cloth patch on the right read "Squad Leader Kono, 9th Squadron." The talisman was inscribed with the words "Respectfully transferred official amulet, Mist Chapter, Shrine of Ise, long-lasting protection." The star section of the enemy plane was completely destroyed, but the brand name next to the plane still existed, with the following description: ㊀ Plane name: Airframe, automatic control, equipment part number 20044, March Showa 12 (1937), Tokyo Measuring Instruments Co., Ltd. ㊁ Radio brand name: Radio communication device 942 Air Unit No. 2, Radio communication device special long-wave line transport LSAD No. 2, 458, modified March Showa 12 (1937), Sasebo Naval Arsenal. After the Commissioner of Dongguan County recovered the aforementioned wreckage, he immediately transported it to the province for disposal. Furthermore, it was rumored that an enemy plane was also found shot down in the Nianshan area of Zengyang County, but this has not been confirmed. Since the enemy plane attack on August 31st, the entire city has implemented a blackout at night on September 1st to prevent enemy plane night raids. However, according to intelligence, over twenty enemy planes in Tainan are preparing to invade again. We have increased our air force strength here and are prepared to intercept them at any time. (September 1st)

### Enemy Planes and Warships Repeatedly Reconnoiter Nantong

River Defense and City Defense Strengthened, Nantong Cotton Bumper Harvest but No Market

Nantong Dispatch: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the counties under Nantong have been repeatedly reconnoitered by enemy planes and warships due to their location at the intersection of the river and the sea. Fortunately, the local authorities have long deployed river defense and city defense, so the rear is increasingly consolidated. The details are recorded as follows:

In recent days, enemy planes have been coming and going不定 along the river and sea areas.

Enemy Warships Reconnoiter

In the Nantong and Haimen areas along the river, enemy warships in groups of three to five constantly reconnoiter and repeatedly fire artillery, intending to probe our strengths and weaknesses and even attempt to land. After our stationed troops immediately returned fire, they all immediately sailed away.

Cotton Bumper Harvest

The new cotton in Nantong has now been harvested, and the harvest is still good, but no one is buying it. Seed cotton is currently worth eight yuan per dan, also resulting in a situation where there are goods but no market. Since the Yangtze River was blockaded, transportation to various places in Jinghu requires roundabout detours. Transportation between Tonghu is slowest, requiring four days. Telephone and telegraph lines between Shanghai and Nantong have been cut. Telegraphs are transferred via Tianyangzhen, and mail is transported by inland river to Taixing and then forwarded, with delays reaching about a week. The city is peaceful, and rural primary schools will all open on September 6th.

### Yu Province, Huaxian County, Severe Flooding

Over 600,000 Disaster Victims, Countless Property Losses

Huaxian County Dispatch: All five districts of this county have suffered from heavy rain disasters this time. Furthermore, due to the long-term, sealed-off, extended, and accumulated water and the flooding of the Qin River overflowing its banks, it flowed from the fourth and fifth districts of Huaxian into the third district of Weinanpo. The accumulated water of Junyi and the flooding of the Wei River overflowing its banks flowed from the northern part of the fifth district and the first district into Weinanpo. The accumulated water and river water of Tangyin and Neihuang flowed from district into Weinanpo, causing the entire county to become a swamp. The county is located in the former course of the Yellow River. Except for Shaling, most areas are low-lying. Among them, the first, third, fourth, and fifth districts suffered the most. Although the terrain of the second district is slightly higher, the northern part of the district suffered from the breach of the Wei River, making the disaster even more tragic. The floodwaters are still surging. The county has now established a flood relief committee, urgently telegraphed the authorities to request urgent relief, and solicited food from wealthy gentlemen, merchants, and residents in the county, sending personnel to the disaster-stricken areas to distribute it. According to investigations, approximately 4.48 million mu of autumn fields were affected by the disaster this time, and 3.279 million mu of land were affected. The amount of autumn grain lost is over 4 million shi, worth approximately over 20 million yuan. Over 200,000 houses collapsed, worth approximately 4 to 5 million yuan. Property losses are countless. As for the number of disaster victims, there are approximately over 600,000 people, of which over 300,000 people are exposed to the elements every day, crying out for food. At this time of engaging in the war of resistance against external aggression, Huaxian County is located on the front line of national defense. Merely relying on local relief funds is like a drop in the bucket. How can it help the situation? Therefore, we hope that the authorities and wealthy charitable individuals will provide assistance together to save the people from the disaster.

### Changshu

Order in the City Restored to Normal

Enemy planes came to bomb three times, the first time in the afternoon of August 23rd, and the other two times in the morning and afternoon of September 1st. As a result, over twenty civilian houses were destroyed, and over forty innocent civilians were killed, and over fifty were injured. Since then, the morale of the people has been slightly affected, and some have moved to the countryside. Various government agencies below the county government have also temporarily changed their office locations. Until the 7th of this month, the county government received an order from the province to restore the government agencies to their original locations and encourage shops to open. County Magistrate Chen Fu immediately convened County Chamber of Commerce Chairman Pang Diancai to discuss methods to restore the commercial market. The offices of various agencies have also returned to normal. As for the areas along the river, our defenses are extremely solid. Enemy warships frequently travel outside the harbor, but there are no other significant movements, so it is extremely peaceful.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Broadcasts a Speech to the United States

[Nanjing] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, gave a broadcast speech to the United States at 7:00 am on the 12th. The following is the text of her speech:

"Today, speaking to the American people, I find it rather difficult to express myself. The recent unfortunate events that have occurred continuously in and near Shanghai have caused some Americans and other foreign nationals to lose their lives, suffer injuries, or experience other hardships. The painful memories still linger in my heart. But I must ask you to believe without a doubt that Generalissimo Chiang and I deeply regret these unfortunate events and share the grief with the families of the deceased and those who have suffered injuries, especially since some of the dead and injured are our personal friends. The Chinese government is doing everything possible within its power to prevent similar incidents from occurring. In fact, these kinds of incidents would not have occurred if the Japanese had not used the public concessions as a base for fighting in Shanghai. In recent years, China has been making rapid progress in its modernization efforts, unifying the Chinese nation, and building a modern country. But the Japanese do not want to see this, so they launch surprise attacks before we have completed our work, wantonly destroying everything. They show no regard for the safety of the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people. The recent events in Shanghai are clear evidence of this. The Japanese, wherever they live in China, use it as a base to infringe upon the Chinese people. The methods they adopt are either to use military actions, or to sell opium and other drugs to harm the physique of our nation, or to plot conspiracies to undermine the power of our central government. Any American residing in China can tell you this. The Japanese military not only deceives its own people but also deceives the whole world. To cover up their conspiracies, they spare no pretext. For example, they recently openly claimed that the Chinese side had spread cholera germs to their troops in Shanghai, so they would take retaliatory measures. May I ask what kind of retaliatory measures Japan will take? Use poison gas? And what is the reason for this? Is it because they have failed to subdue China as they had hoped for five weeks? Japan has concentrated the power of its army, navy, and air force, relying on its latest weapons, cannons, and tanks, to achieve its goals. But our troops have been fighting bravely, so they cannot help but be indignant. Judging from Japan's current actions in China, you can all see that Japan's intentions are sinister and cruel. According to a pre-determined plan, Japan has been preparing for this attempt to conquer China for many years. To achieve this goal, they will not hesitate to completely annihilate our Chinese people. What is strange is that all the nations are standing by with their arms folded, as if it were none of their business. Is it because Japan's daily propaganda of fabricated facts has won them over? Or is it because Japan has hypnotic skills, and the world's politicians have fallen under its spell? Japan's simple mantra that this is not a war but merely an incident” seems to have a bewitching magic, driving the world to silence. Even Konoe's declaration on August 28th, in which the Japanese Prime Minister claimed that Japan intended to whip China to make it submissive and dare not resist again, seems to have had no effect in awakening the world and making it feel that this is a great calamity in progress. The great powers signed the Nine-Power Treaty to avoid this great calamity. The Nine-Power Treaty was established specifically to insure China against Japanese aggression. The great powers also signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact to prevent war and established the League of Nations to stop aggressor nations from unreasonably infringing upon weaker countries. What is strange is that these treaties have now disappeared without a trace, which is unprecedented in history. What is even more worrying is that the complex structure of wartime international law, which has gradually formed over the years and is designed to restrain wartime behavior and protect non-combatants, has also turned to dust along with these treaties. Therefore, this world has now returned to the barbaric era where the weak are prey to the strong. Not only do soldiers die on the battlefield, but their families, women, and children are also spared. All of this is what Japan is now trying to do in China. However, civilized nations cannot be blamed for the collapse of treaties and the occurrence of large-scale massacres of innocents in this twentieth century. In 1931, when Japan occupied our Manchuria, the nations allowed it to begin. In 1932, when Japan bombed the residents of Zhabei, Shanghai, in their sleep, the nations actually condoned it to continue. Now, Japan is launching another large-scale invasion, with its iron hooves trampling all over China. The nations are also tacitly acquiescing and turning a blind eye, to the point where Japan even believes that it is free to destroy schools and destroy cultural institutions everywhere, doing whatever it wants. Nankai University in Tianjin, Hebei Women's Normal College, and Hebei Institute of Technology have been destroyed by artillery fire, and it is still not enough. They add oil to make sure that the remnants are also turned to ashes. Shanghai University, a church-affiliated school, was destroyed by the Japanese heavy artillery and air force's artillery fire. Tongji University in Wusong has disappeared completely. Nanjing Central University and Nanchang Baoling Women's School have also received the favor of Japanese aircraft bombs. This is still not over. Nantong American church-affiliated hospital, Zhenru Red Cross Hospital, and several other Red Cross rescue stations were deliberately bombed. Japanese aircraft even strafed the British ambassador and dropped bombs, and the Japanese Foreign Minister is now shamelessly denying that Japanese aircraft could not have done this. Fortunately, the British military attache can prove that it was indeed Japanese aircraft. To deny that the Japanese government is still making such pronouncements. If the heinous acts of killing and destruction at the beginning of the war are as described above, then what will happen later when Japan threatens to completely wipe out China, and what will the end be? For now, let's not discuss it. Its determination to destroy Chinese cultural relics has already begun, and the achievements of American religious and cultural undertakings in China over the years, through hard work and diligence, will also be destroyed by this barbaric atrocity. The American church-affiliated organizations have received enthusiastic donations from the American people and have made great contributions to China's rejuvenation. If Japan is allowed to do as it pleases, then these church-affiliated organizations themselves will not be completely destroyed, and their work will also be severely damaged, because Japan accuses these organizations of cultivating future resistance forces. In fact, Japan is deeply jealous of foreign forces, whether these forces are cultural or commercial, and wants to destroy them or even completely eradicate them. Overseas countries should clearly understand these facts. Therefore, I am deeply concerned about the safety of European and American women and children in China. The Chinese people have always admired the services of foreign missionaries in China, but I am compelled by circumstances to reluctantly assist in their withdrawal in the short term. Even if a few foreigners still want to stay and share the hardships with us, I can tell the people of Europe and America that the Chinese government will do its best to assist in the transportation of those who are fleeing the war, so that they can reach the coast. We sincerely wish to protect foreign nationals in China, but Japan today has announced the blockade of the Chinese coast and demanded that all countries stop supplying China with arms, wanting to cut off China's arms supply so that it will have problems protecting its own people, while Japan can still import all kinds of killing weapons without restriction. Such a brutal demand is unprecedented. We hope that the countries of the world will not accept it. Japan dares to make such a request, seemingly having great confidence in its right to control the world, because it has openly declared that it wants to subdue China and now hopes to obtain international assistance to put us to death, as if it is confident that no one in the world dares to disagree. This may also be the case, but if the countries of the world remain silent about Japan's slaughter and destruction, then human culture will truly be nearing its end. China has always been considered cowardly and lacking military preparation, but now it has decided to abandon its policy of tolerance and will no longer endure the aggression, slaughter, and unreasonable insults of the violent enemy. The whole country has risen up to fight for the survival of the nation. In this war of resistance, I would like to commend the loyal support of our patriotic compatriots overseas, which will be a major factor in our country's final victory. Here, I would like to express my gratitude to the overseas Chinese for their generous donations on behalf of Generalissimo Chiang, and I will protect our struggle to defend our territory and will not fail to live up to their cooperation and encouragement. I would also like to express my gratitude for the sympathy and spiritual assistance of friendly countries. The sympathy of friendly countries has given us great excitement and is also necessary, as we still need to rely on the wisdom and fairness of the countries of the world so that the bizarre rumors spread by Japan day and night will not have a negative impact on the world and China. I also hope that our claims and efforts will be supported by treaties, which China sincerely abides by and maintains. (To be continued) (Central News Agency, 12th)

Current Commentary

### The Future of "Mud Feet"

-- Yu

The British writer Otley Lanner uses "mud feet" to describe Japan, meaning that the two legs supporting Japanese imperialism are as fragile as if made of mud. Since the war in Shanghai has been going on for a month, this metaphor has become increasingly accurate. Here, we will use the various events that have been unfolding recently to verify this.

First, let's start with the military. It has only been a month since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai. It is estimated that they have mobilized over 100,000 troops, 100 warships, 1,000 cannons, and over 200 airplanes, all of which are the most elite and newest types. But what has been the result? Initially, they retreated step by step in the Hongkou district. Then, they suffered heavy losses attacking Pudong. Recently, the landing troops in the Wusong and Baoshan area have been severely battered after fierce resistance from our army. From August 13th to 31st alone, in the corner of Shanghai, we shot down over 60 airplanes and damaged over 10 warships. The number of casualties is said to have reached over 30,000. The full-scale war is only in its initial stages, and the enemy army is already in such a difficult situation. As the war zone expands and the war becomes protracted, the decline in their fighting power is predictable.

Second, in terms of the economy, according to the estimates of John Tannen and others in the book "When Japan Goes to War," the cost of war for Japan in the first year will be at least 13.6 billion yen. At most, the entire country can provide 12.6 billion yen, a shortage of 1 billion yen. The panic in the second and third years will be even more intense. The Shanghai war proves that this estimate is not too high. According to a certain British person who used to be a naval officer, the Japanese army is currently consuming 1 million yen per day in the Shanghai invasion war, just in terms of military supplies. The Shanghai war is only the beginning of a long war, and it is only a corner of the full-scale war. The consumption is already so high. When the war expands, if we calculate it by a factor of 20, then the daily military supplies will require 20 million yen, about 7 billion yen per year. If other expenses are doubled, it will be in line with Tannen John's estimate. The only way to make up for the shortage of over 1 billion yen is to borrow foreign debt. However, this is an extremely difficult task. The international situation is increasingly unfavorable to Japan. Who will give it sympathetic assistance? The above is the overall picture of Japan's economic predicament. If we look at it separately, then the raw material problem, the production problem, the taxation problem, the public debt problem, and the people's livelihood problem are all impossible to solve. It is truly unknown how to raise the funds for this year's huge budget of over 5.4 billion yen. The current existing phenomena are: trade continues to reverse, raw materials are in massive panic, prices continue to soar, securities plummet, and international economic sanctions are brewing. It can be said that the Japanese economy has reached an extremely dangerous point.

Third, we must talk about the severity of the internal contradictions in Japan. On the 6th of this month, the House of Representatives Budget Committee held a meeting. The government and the opposition party's members asked the government many questions about the relationship with China. It can be seen that the government and the parliament are not fully integrated. Although the additional budget of over 2 billion yen was passed, it is said that this was the result of using threats and inducements to prevent members from speaking out. In fact, at least a portion of the capitalists (especially those who operate exporting goods and those who have huge investment interests in China) have deep resentment towards the military, because the military has destroyed their profits. According to the Japanese's own estimates, the economic losses in Shanghai have broken through 50 million yen as of August 29th, which is a huge increase compared to the 30 million yen during the January 28th Incident. Recently, it has been reported that the Japanese industry is brewing an anti-war movement. This is worth noting. Secondly, the Japanese masses are becoming increasingly aware. The tears shed at various train stations in Japan to see off soldiers going to China will eventually converge into a revolutionary torrent. Furthermore, unstable factors are growing in Korea, Taiwan, and Ryukyu. Japan's internal crisis is only a matter of time.

In short, Japan's mud feet are, as the Soviet News reported, "by no means a reliable foundation for conducting a large-scale war." As long as we resist to the end, the disintegration of the "mud feet" is inevitable.

### Establishment of Mediterranean Agreement to Ensure Freedom of Navigation

England and France Invite Italy to Participate; Agreement to Be Signed Tomorrow and Take Effect Immediately

⊙ Nyon, Switzerland. The Mediterranean Conference continued this afternoon, lasting two hours. A complete agreement was reached on the following measures:

㊀ Within the territorial waters of each participating country, its own navy will conduct surveillance. ㊁ The navies of England and France will also monitor the entire Mediterranean Sea. ㊂ If a merchant ship belonging to any participating country is attacked by a submarine, and the submarine complies with all provisions of the "Submarine Warfare Humanization" agreement (signed by England, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan on November 6, 1936), then the warships of that country (i.e., the country whose merchant ship was attacked) may sink the submarine. ㊃ If the submarine does not comply with the above agreement's provisions, it will be considered a pirate, and warships of any country may sink it.

The above agreement will be formally notified to Italy by England and France, and Italy will be invited to participate. If Italy accepts, then the Adriatic Sea area will be designated for Italian surveillance. In addition, there is an annex to the agreement, stipulating the routes to be taken by merchant ships of various countries to ensure their protection. It is expected that the above agreement will be signed no later than the 14th of this month and will take effect immediately without going through ratification procedures. It is generally believed that once the agreement is implemented, acts of piracy in the Mediterranean Sea will cease. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

⊙ Nyon. It has been learned that the task assigned to the fleets of England and France under the agreement reached at the Mediterranean Conference is to protect the sea routes between the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal. The navies of other countries will be responsible for surveillance within their own territorial waters and will make their ports available to the warships of England and France. Furthermore, the Black Sea coastal countries (i.e., the Soviet Union, Romania, and Bulgaria) will conduct their own surveillance along the Black Sea coast. If Italy accepts participation in the agreement, it will be asked to monitor the sea area from the port of Genoa to the island of Sardinia. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

⊙ Nyon. A special dispatch from Havas News Agency's diplomatic correspondent reports that the naval authorities of England and France now believe that after the implementation of the agreement reached at the Mediterranean Conference, freedom of navigation in the Mediterranean Sea can be ensured. It is expected that England will send 35 destroyers and France will send 55 destroyers to the Mediterranean Sea. Once the agreement is signed, these warships will arrive in their designated areas in five or six days to carry out surveillance missions to stop all acts of piracy. In addition, the agreement reached at the Mediterranean Conference only addresses submarine attacks. Attacks by other warships and aircraft will be handled separately. This issue is quite thorny, and experts from various countries have begun to study it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

[Geneva] The nine-nation conference on the Mediterranean issue in Nyon, after lengthy discussions today, has reached full agreement on measures to crack down on submarine atrocities in the Mediterranean Sea. This agreement is widely regarded as a victory for British and French policy and will soon be communicated to the governments of participating countries. The agreement includes the following points: ㊀ Each country shall be responsible for security within its own territorial waters. ㊁ England and France shall have general administrative powers in all parts of the Mediterranean. ㊂ Any submarine that does not comply with the London Naval Treaty shall be considered a pirate. With the passage of the above-mentioned proposals, the work of the conference is largely complete. It is expected that the conference can be concluded on Monday after representatives of each country have received instructions from their home countries. In addition, Italy will be invited to participate in the general administration of matters relating to the Adriatic Sea, while Germany will be informed of the work of the conference in accordance with its previous promises. Furthermore, this new plan, which replaces the previous zoning plan, will be implemented on the 14th of this month. England and France will dispatch fifty destroyers to engage in maritime administration. However, ships of the warring parties in Spain will not participate in the administrative plan and will not be protected. Hereafter, if a submarine sinks a ship other than a Spanish ship without surfacing, it constitutes an act of piracy, and the administrative warship may sink it upon seeing or hearing it. If a submarine displays its nationality on the surface and sinks a foreign warship, it commits an act of war. Regarding the submarine attacks by the warring parties in Spain on ships of other countries, it is now stipulated that if the submarine surfaces and displays its flag, giving the crew of the other ship a chance to escape before sinking the ship, this act will give rise to relations between states but not international relations, as it is an act of war against the country whose ship was sunk, and patrol warships will not interfere. However, if the submarine does not comply with these regulations, its behavior is sufficient to trigger League of Nations relations and will be regarded as piracy and be subject to sinking. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Public Announcement

Declaring that Neither Side in the Spanish War is Recognized as a Belligerent Group

⊙ Nyon. The secretariat of the Mediterranean Conference issued a public announcement at 10:30 PM, first declaring that the governments of the participating countries have not recognized either party in the Spanish Civil War as having the right to exercise the rights of a belligerent group. It then explained the surveillance measures agreed upon at the conference, stating that if a submarine is found near a merchant ship after the ship has been attacked, and the circumstances suggest that the submarine was the attacker, then it should be sunk immediately. For the sake of implementing the surveillance measures, the countries participating in the Mediterranean surveillance measures shall order their submarines not to navigate in the Mediterranean Sea, except when accompanied by other warships or conducting exercises in designated areas. In addition, the Balkan Entente countries attending the conference (i.e., Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia) have also been quickly dismissed due to various difficulties, and have expressed their gratitude to the chairman of the conference, namely French Foreign Minister Delbos. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Impressions from Rome

England and France Managing Sea Lanes; Italy Will Find it Difficult to Recognize

[Rome] The initial non-official impression in Italy of the Nyon Agreement is that, regardless of other matters, in terms of prestige, Italy will find it difficult to accept the sea lanes of the Mediterranean being managed by England and France. However, it is believed that Italy will agree to join the management plan after fully considering the agreement. However, this invitation should come from the Non-Intervention Committee rather than from Nyon. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 12th)

[Rome] A leading Fascist Party figure declared today that because Soviet Russia has also endorsed the British and French plan for Mediterranean management, Italy will refuse to participate. However, Italy's formal decision will be announced only after the draft plan is delivered to Rome and studied in detail by Italy. (National Telegram, 12th)

### Berlin's Indifference

Unwilling to Fall into a Whirlpool; Maintaining Unity with Italy

[Berlin] Germany's attitude towards the Nyon Agreement is that, on the one hand, it is unwilling to be drawn into the whirlpool of Mediterranean disputes beyond what is necessary, and on the other hand, it is maintaining unity with Italy. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 12th)

[Berlin] Regarding the agreement reached at the Mediterranean Conference, the general public here is very indifferent. Official sources believe that if the signatory countries are all honest and reliable, this agreement may well produce good results, but it is a pity that there is a traitor (referring to the Soviet Union) within. It is also said that the various maritime surveillance measures decided upon in the agreement are woefully inadequate. Any submarine can still fire torpedoes at a merchant ship and then slip away unnoticed. Therefore, Soviet ships will certainly continue to engage in piracy in the Mediterranean Sea. Germany, which has no desire for the situation to ease, believes that the surveillance measures agreed upon by the countries may not be of any help. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Londoners Rejoice

[London] After the news of the rapid agreement reached at the Mediterranean Conference spread here, the general public was very pleased and believed that the countries concerned would be able to implement the agreement with the same speed. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Parisian Public Opinion Satisfied

[Paris] After the agreement was reached at the Mediterranean Conference, the newspapers here expressed satisfaction, believing that the principles of mutual assistance and collective security have been strengthened, and that the united relationship between England and France has been re-demonstrated. Le Petit Parisien reported, "The Mediterranean Conference has achieved rare success due to the close cooperation between England and France. The Nyon Agreement is based on the principles of collective security and mutual assistance among the Mediterranean coastal countries and declares the establishment of a new era in the history of international treaties." Le Journal reported, "The Mediterranean passage is jointly monitored by England and France, which shows the superior position occupied by each country." L'Intransigeant reported, "The Mediterranean, which Italy considers an inland sea, is now being spiritually and materially reclaimed by England and France." Le Figaro reported that the principle of mutual assistance has now been revived, which is very gratifying. The left-wing newspapers expressed reservations about inviting Italy to participate in the Mediterranean Agreement. The Confédération Générale du Travail's organ, Le Peuple, reported, "Italy should be directly responsible for piracy in the Mediterranean Sea, but it colludes with Germany and flatly denies it, trying to cover up its mistakes. Now it is invited to participate in international police tasks, which is a flaw in perfection." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)

### Britain Develops New Type of Sea Mine

Powerful Weapon for Dealing with Submarines

[London] The Sunday Referee recently reported that the British Admiralty has developed a new type of sea mine that automatically explodes when a warship sails to a certain distance. It goes without saying that it is triggered by a warship touching it. This new type of sea mine is especially convenient for dealing with submarines. Even minesweepers and other ships with shallower drafts that can sail at sea without touching the mine will no longer be safe in the future. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)

### Czech Founding Father Masaryk Critically Ill

⊙ Prague. Czech founding father and former President Masaryk, who has been ill for many days, suddenly took a turn for the worse today. Doctors have diagnosed him with pneumonia. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Comparison of Land and Sea Military Strength of the Peace and Aggression Camps

China, Russia, England, and France Have Strong Combat Power; Cannot Be Matched by the Japan-Germany-Italy Group

[Washington] According to observations by military experts here today, the military strength of the Germany-Italy-Japan group is far inferior to that of the China-England-France-Russia group. In terms of naval power, although China is almost nonexistent and Russia's strength lies only in submarines, the naval power of this group is still not weaker than that of the Germany-Italy-Japan group. For example, Japan has 223 warships, Italy has 273, and Germany has 116, but England alone has 381, and France also has 204. As for land forces, China has approximately 2 million combat-ready troops, England has 1,282,869, France has 6,952,083, and Russia has 15,000,000, for a total of nearly 23 million combat personnel. On the other hand, Japan has 2,310,000 combat-ready personnel, Italy has 6,484,172, and Germany has 2,560,000, for a total of only 11 million, less than half the strength of the former. Furthermore, the China-Russia-France-England group is rich in minerals and has developed military industries, which is unmatched by the strength of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Therefore, if a major war truly breaks out between these two major groups, it is not difficult to imagine who will be victorious. (National Telegram, 11th)

### Local Associations Request the Municipal Party Department and Social Affairs Bureau to Register Unemployed Workers

Preparing to Provide Support According to Category When Needed; Hoping to Find Ways to Provide Adequate Relief

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, many factories have been destroyed by the enemy, and those that have not suffered disaster have also closed down one after another, resulting in hundreds of thousands of workers becoming unemployed at the same time, forming an extremely serious problem. In view of this, local associations have already sent letters to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that registration be carried out and that efforts be made to provide adequate relief. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, many factories have been destroyed by bombing, and those that have not suffered disaster have also closed down one after another, resulting in hundreds of thousands of workers losing their livelihoods, with no food or shelter, a truly pitiful situation. These workers have all been employed for many years and possess considerable skills. For the sake of future industrial recovery, we cannot sit idly by and watch them become displaced and suffer further losses. Our association feels that this problem is very serious and believes that the Municipal Party Department (Bureau) should (together with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department) conduct registration of all types of workers in each district of the city, so that when factories need them in the future, they can be supplied according to category. If it is possible to find ways to provide adequate relief, it will be beneficial both to the public and to private interests. In addition to sending separate letters, we are writing to inform you, hoping that you will promptly review and handle this matter. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department (Municipal Social Affairs Bureau)."

### Tzu Lien Hui Pays Attention to Refugee Hygiene

Ministry of Interior Sends Personnel to Investigate Reception Centers

The Shanghai Tzu Lien Hui Refugee Relief Committee for War Zones has, as of yesterday, established a total of 47 reception centers, as well as one rescue hospital and one refugee hospital each, and one large squad of monks providing rescue, with a total of over 30,000 refugees housed in these facilities. Although some are sent back to their hometowns every day, the number of refugees received invariably exceeds the number sent away many times over. The enormity of food consumption can be seen from this alone. Even in terms of medical expenses alone, the daily cost is already considerable. Because the association has always attached great importance to the refugees' daily lives, food and drink, and other hygienic facilities, and since true cholera was discovered in this city, the association is even more concerned. In addition to actively trying to prevent it, it specifically notified all facilities yesterday to pay close attention. The general content of the notice is as follows: "In view of the current autumn season and the war, cholera (i.e., Asiatic cholera) is prevalent. All reception centers should pay attention to the refugees' daily lives, food and drink at all times. If symptoms of the disease are suspected, they must be sent for diagnosis as soon as possible and absolutely isolated. If true cholera is discovered, they should be sent to the hospital for treatment immediately and reported to the association for assessment, etc." Furthermore, it is reported that the refugees received by the association are mostly alone, without any possessions, and the weather is getting colder. How can they keep warm? Although donations of clothing and bedding have been made from all walks of life, the number of refugees is so enormous that it is far from sufficient. Therefore, in addition to actively managing this matter, the association deeply hopes that people of goodwill will, in accordance with the spirit of compassion, enthusiastically donate clothing and bedding or cash and food to benefit the war refugees. The merit will be immeasurable.

The Ministry of Interior recently sent Director Tsai to Shanghai to investigate the achievements and statistical numbers of the refugee reception centers organized by various agencies and organizations, as well as the number of refugees who have been sent out and the number who can return to their hometowns, and the number of refugees whose hometowns are in the war zone. It is reported that he is scheduled to return to Beijing on the 14th to report to the central government and find ways to provide relief.

### Shanghai South Health Office Continues to Work as Usual

Setting Up First-Aid Stations to Rescue Wounded Civilians

The South Shanghai District of this city is densely populated and commercially prosperous. Since the outbreak of the August 13th war, the city's appearance has turned quiet, but the number of residents in the district is still not small. In order to maintain the health of the citizens, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has specifically ordered the South Shanghai District Health Office to continue working as usual. It is reported that the office usually pays close attention to diagnosis and treatment, cleaning, meat inspection, and epidemic prevention. During the Shanghai war, the office still regarded the above tasks as its main business and continued to work hard. At present, due to the change in household registration, the number of outpatient visits is around seventy or eighty people per day. In terms of cleaning, there are 160 cleaners who handle garbage, feces, and other cleaning matters. About dozens of pigs and cattle are inspected daily in terms of meat inspection. Inoculations against epidemics are also being carried out as usual. In order to quickly rescue wounded civilians, first-aid stations have been set up to meet emergency needs. Any citizen injured in the district can go there for treatment. In this time of enemy aircraft wreaking havoc and people's minds in turmoil, it is truly commendable that the office can remain calm and work tirelessly.

### The Front Needs a Large Number of Bicycles Urgently

Soliciting Comfort Food; Continuing to Receive

According to a high-ranking military officer speaking to reporters, the front lines urgently need a large number of bicycles to transport supplies due to the extension of the battle lines. Donations from all walks of life can be sent directly to the Bide Primary School on Rue Lafayette. According to someone from the local association, the solicitation of comfort food for the public was once suspended to prevent traitors from poisoning it. The association has resumed collecting it yesterday and will transport it to the front lines after inspection by experts. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate generously.

### The Central Government Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Commend Police Officers

Special Allocation of 10,000 National Currency Dollars for Reward; Police Director Sent to Shanghai to Express Personal Condolences

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, a full month has passed. The central government believes that during this anti-enemy period, the entire police force of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, from the director down, has worked hard in the line of duty, participating in the war of resistance on the front lines and maintaining public order in the rear, working diligently day and night, which is commendable. A special allocation of 10,000 national currency dollars has been made for reward, and Director of the Ministry of Interior Police Affairs Yu Kun has been sent to Shanghai to personally convey the central government's condolences. It is reported that Director Tsai believes that maintaining public order and assisting in defending the territory are the inherent duties of the police. However, since he has accepted the central government's goodwill, he cannot refuse it. Therefore, it has been decided that when the funds are distributed, half will be used to reward the police officers, and the other half will be used to purchase national salvation bonds to fulfill their national duty.

### Traitors Executed

Total of Ten People Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday

The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters discovered ten traitors and spies: Wang Jinkui, 28 years old, from Gaoyou; Xu Zhengshun, 33 years old, from Nanjing; Yang Panbao, 26 years old, from Changzhou; Xiao Changde, 23 years old, from Siyang; Liu Kegui, 20 years old, from Haimen; Shen Congfa, 36 years old, from Anhui; Tian Mancang, 30 years old, from Hebei; Liu Xiaoshan, 32 years old, from Huaicheng; Dai Xiaosanzi, 20 years old, from Yancheng; and Wang Zengxiang, 28 years old, from Shaoxing. After interrogation and confession, they were escorted to Xieqiao at 6:00 PM yesterday and executed by firing squad as a warning.

### Traitor Caught Signaling, Arrested

The 6th Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross, led by team leader He Huijun, went to the front line yesterday to rescue wounded soldiers. On their way back, while passing near Fanwangdu, Chen Huobo, the leader of the first group of the team, caught sight of a traitor signaling in that area. He immediately got out of the car, bravely stepped forward, arrested him, and sent him to the Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation.

### Sea Cable Communications Between Shanghai and Other Places Restored

Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, December 12, Sea cable communications between Shanghai and other places in the world have been restored today (Sunday). The telegraph office has connected a new line from the point where the submarine cable was broken, passing through the Huangpu River to Shanghai, to temporarily maintain sea cable communications. However, placing the cable in the Huangpu River makes it vulnerable to damage by ships' anchors.

### Italian Troops Arrive in Shanghai by Ship

The Italian cruiser Montecuccoli left Singapore for Shanghai on the afternoon of the 11th, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th. It is reported that the ship is carrying 800 Italian army personnel, who are coming to Shanghai to protect their country's expatriates and to assist in maintaining the safety of the International Settlement.

### Shanghai Relief Association Sends Refugees from North Jiangsu

Two Thousand Fellow Villagers from Taizhou Safely Arrive Home Last Night

On September 11, the reception group of the Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee received 1,707 new refugees today, sent 1,038 refugees out of the facility, and actually had 96 refugees in the reception center, with a total of 33,541 refugees. Also, the repatriation group handled the repatriation of 1,998 refugees from various reception centers and charities, with destinations in Suzhou and Wuxi, transferring to their original hometowns in northern Jiangsu.

The Taizhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association chartered the foreign ship Shenbian a few days ago to send more than 3,000 fellow villagers back to their hometowns. The ship set sail from the Jinliyuan Wharf at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday and safely left the port. It is now known that the ship safely arrived at Haimen, a district of Taizhou, last night.

### Various Groups in the City Send Telegrams to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Expressing Respect

Support Association Collects Large Quantities of Comfort Goods; Sending Personnel Today to Comfort Soldiers at the Front

Today marks the one-month anniversary since the start of the patriotic resistance war in Shanghai on August 13th. During this time, our troops have fought bloody battles, gaining renown throughout the world. Perseverance is victory, and the future is extremely bright.

The troops at the front stand like mountains, the soldiers in the sky soar like bulls, thwarting the fierce offensive of the strong enemy and increasing the glory of the nation, all thanks to your virtue and might, which is extremely inspiring. We, the members of this association, pledge to spill our last drop of blood to support the government and the supreme leader. We respectfully send this telegram, begging for your consideration.

### Lending Committee Handles Lending to Fellow Businesses

Factories Can Borrow Money if Needed; Can Submit Collateral The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance on August 13 of this year, requesting that the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications be ordered to inform fellow banks and money houses to adjust finances as usual and maintain the market. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance approved the report with the Qian Zi No. 14328: "The report has been received. Since the incident occurred, in order to invigorate finances and stabilize the market, the Ministry has long ago discussed with the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank to organize a lending committee to handle lending to fellow businesses for turnover purposes. If the national products factories need to borrow money, they can submit collateral directly to the bank or money house with which they do business, and request the lending committee to review and handle it."

### Yesterday Morning, A Major Robbery and Resistance with Gunfire Occurred on Avenue Édouard VII

Dahua Auto Dealership Suffers Losses of Over 10,000 Yuan, Two Robbers Arrested, Three Passersby Injured

The Dahua Auto Dealership, located at 1392-1306 Avenue Édouard VII (i.e., Chongqing Road) in the Public Concession, was founded by Shanghai businessman Zhu Chengyou. Zhu is from the town of Wusong Yangxing, which has been the site of fierce battles between enemy and our forces for the past two days. Unexpectedly, at around 6 AM yesterday morning, five ruthless robbers, each armed with a handgun, broke into the Dahua Auto Dealership through the back door and went straight to Zhu's bedroom on the second floor. They forced him to remain silent and proceeded to ransack the place. As a result, they not only stole all the gold, silver, and valuable ornaments but also took a briefcase containing 7,335 yuan in legal tender, with total losses estimated at over 10,000 yuan. After obtaining the loot, the five robbers fled through the back door. Zhu, concerned about the safety of his entire family and business given the stolen 7,000-plus yuan, rushed out and shouted for help to catch the robbers. The robbers then opened fire to intimidate him. A Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road police station fired six shots at the robbers. The robbers also fired back in resistance, resulting in two robbers being shot and captured, while the other three managed to escape. All the stolen goods were taken away by the three who escaped. Stray bullets also injured three passersby. The police station, recognizing that this major robbery occurred during a tense period, is giving it special attention.

### Implementation of Management for the Cattle and Sheep Industry and the Transportation of Slaughter Cattle

The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Guild, in accordance with an order from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to prevent slaughter cattle from aiding the enemy, has drafted twelve measures, which have been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. It is reported that the management measures are now scheduled to be implemented on the 16th of this month. All cattle and sheep industry professionals, including slaughterhouses, beef shops, and stallholders, must comply with the measures and register with the guild immediately. The full text of the measures is as follows: Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Guild's Measures for Managing and Transporting Slaughter Cattle: 1. In accordance with the order of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the guild has specially formulated these management measures to prevent slaughter cattle from aiding the enemy. 2. A management committee will be organized, consisting of nine members elected from the industry to manage the process. It will be named the Slaughter Cattle Transportation Management Committee. 3. The guild will create a permit for transporting slaughter cattle and submit it to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for its seal of approval, which will then be forwarded to the military medical authorities in this city. The authorities will instruct military police along the way to refuse entry to the city to anyone transporting cattle without this permit to achieve restriction. This permit is free of charge and valid for one-time use. After use, it must be returned to the guild for cancellation. 4. When cattle dealers from the cattle market transport cattle into the city, the cattle market is responsible for obtaining a permit from the guild, which will be given to the cattle dealers for use. 5. Cattle markets must record the names of buyers and the number of slaughter cattle purchased by each buyer in detail every day and report it to the guild for verification the following day (e.g., cattle sold today must be reported the next day). 6. Slaughterhouses must pre-determine the number of cattle to be slaughtered and register it with the guild in advance. After the cattle are slaughtered and cleaned, the name of the buyer and the number of cattle sold must be reported to the guild in detail the following day. 7. Slaughterhouses that directly purchase cattle from other areas for slaughter must report to the guild for verification to ensure that they are not aiding the enemy. The guild will issue a permit and send a letter to the military police along the way to certify passage, or request the municipal government to issue a passport for protection. 8. Shops and stallholders that sell beef must first register with the guild. The estimated daily sales volume must also be reported for examination. If there is a buyer purchasing whole carcasses, they should first declare the purpose to the guild in writing and apply for a purchase certificate. Only after the guild has investigated and confirmed that there is no possibility of aiding the enemy may the purchase be made. Otherwise, beef shops and stallholders are not allowed to conduct transactions involving whole carcasses of beef. 9. Considering the current market conditions, the daily slaughter of cattle is temporarily limited to 80 yellow cattle and 40 water buffalo, regardless of size. This restriction only applies to sales in the city market and does not include the needs of the military police authorities. 10. If anyone violates these measures and transports cattle privately, they will be reported to the authorities by the guild for punishment as aiding the enemy upon verification. 11. These measures will cease to be effective on the day the war ends. 12. These measures will be submitted to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for approval and submitted to the Garrison Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Police Bureau for record.

### A Strange Odor Suddenly Erupts in the Carefree Dance Hall

Dancers, Male and Female, All Experience a Peculiar Smell

Amidst the tense atmosphere of the ongoing war at the front, the Carefree Dance Hall on Rue Keymays, reopened on the 8th of this month under the name of a businessman from the friendly nation of the Philippines. In the past few days, the dance hall has been crowded with patrons, all of whom are Chinese gentlemen. Unexpectedly, at around 9 PM last night, someone entered the dance hall and released a type of gas similar to ammonia. Instantly, the entire dance hall was filled with a strange odor, causing great disorder. At the same time, the musicians in the orchestra felt their breathing become abnormal, and they had to temporarily stop playing their beautiful music. As for the dancers, they simultaneously demonstrated a type of gas mask-like pose, using handkerchiefs as temporary masks. After this commotion, although some dancers left in disappointment, many who were reluctant to leave remained, embodying the sentiment that "the country may fall, but the dance must go on." After about half an hour, the strange odor dissipated, and the dance hall seemed to revive from suspended animation, returning to its original state.

### Number of Refugees from Taicang and Jiading Arriving in Shanghai

The association immediately dispatched personnel to properly arrange them in various shelters of the Municipal Relief Committee.

### Cultural Organizations Telegraph the National Government to Confiscate Enemy Assets in China

Confiscate Their Assets to Fund Wartime Casualties and Injuries; Suspend Boxer Indemnity Payments to Support Wartime Cultural Reconstruction

The Shanghai Professors and Writers Association's Wartime Cultural Construction Committee held its third meeting yesterday, chaired by Chen Xianmo. In addition to deciding to actively proceed with the establishment of a wartime university, it was also decided to support the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Shen Bao's proposal to confiscate enemy assets in China and suspend the Boxer Indemnity payments. A telegram was sent to the National Government's Executive Yuan to adopt and implement these measures to demonstrate punishment. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the Esteemed Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing: The Japanese bandits are rampaging and invading on a large scale. Their navy blockades our coasts, and their airplanes attack our cities, wantonly bombing cultural institutions and harming unarmed civilians. How can this be tolerated? Retaliatory measures should be adopted immediately, confiscating enemy assets in China and suspending Boxer Indemnity payments to demonstrate the great justice of wartime retaliation and compensation. The proposals of the Shanghai Shen Bao and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce are entirely justified and should be adopted and implemented immediately. Furthermore, we earnestly request that the confiscated enemy assets in China be used to fund wartime rescue and treatment of the wounded, and that the suspended Boxer Indemnity payments be used to support wartime cultural reconstruction to demonstrate punishment. Respectfully submitted by the Wartime Cultural Construction Committee of the Shanghai Professors and Writers Association.

### The Enemy Advances from Eastern Shanghai, Intense Fighting on Jungong Road This Morning

As of Noon, Enemy and Our Forces are Still Engaged in Hand-to-Hand Combat; Our Forces in Yanghang Construct Strong New Defenses; No Fierce Fighting from Luodian to Liuhe

This morning, we received reports from the front lines, with the war situation in the different sectors as follows: (1) In Yanghang, the enemy forces have not been able to make any advances due to heavy losses. Our forces are reorganizing new defensive positions through reconnaissance and constructing strong defensive works in preparation for a counterattack. (2) In the Yuepu area, due to the local situation in Yanghang, our forces have temporarily abandoned their original positions and are defending new lines in preparation for a counterattack. (3) Yesterday afternoon, enemy forces in Luodian launched attacks on our forces in small guerrilla groups along different routes. Our forces immediately responded with a fierce counterattack, causing the enemy forces to suffer a crushing defeat with heavy casualties. The squad leader, Igawa, was also killed. A diary was seized by our forces, revealing that the enemy in Luodian is the 12th Division from Kurume. In addition, many enemy soldiers were captured. After suffering this defeat, the enemy forces were relatively quiet along the line from Luodian to Liuhe at night, with no fierce fighting. (4) In order to support the Yanghang line north of the Yunzaobang, the enemy forces stationed at the Qiujiang Wharf launched attacks on our forces' positions in Yinxiang and the city center this morning. As of noon, both sides were still engaged in intense fighting. (5) Last night, 2,000 enemy troops in Yunzaobang attacked our positions at the South Sijing River but were repelled by our forces. Our forces continue to hold their original positions at the South Sijing River.

According to reliable sources, after the tense situation in Yanghang and Yuepu, our forces have firmly defended their new positions and constructed strong defensive works to avoid the strength of the enemy warships and are determined to annihilate the enemy's strength through land warfare. Currently, our forces have completed the deployment of new defensive lines from Qingyun Road and Baziqiao in Zhabei to a certain place two miles west of Jiangwan, Miaohang, and Yanghang, and to Luodian. They are waiting in full battle readiness, vowing to inflict heavy losses on the enemy forces and weaken their land combat capabilities. Intense fighting broke out in the Yinxiang and city center areas in the eastern district this morning. The other lines are relatively quiet.

### Fierce Fighting Breaks Out on Jungong Road Today

The Enemy Launched Another Fierce Attack Starting at 4 AM Today; Our Forces Responded Bravely with Heavy Artillery Support

Military sources confirm that the enemy forces at the Qiujiang Wharf, after being heavily attacked by our forces on three sides and routed when they attacked the city center area, did not dare to attack for the past two days. They were primarily reorganizing their remnants and continuously receiving reinforcements. Therefore, starting at 4 AM this morning, the enemy warships first launched a barrage of concentrated artillery fire on our positions on the lines in the city center area and Yinxiang. They then sent out large groups of infantry and light machine gun teams to attack our positions. Our forces immediately responded bravely along different routes. At the same time, our artillery units also provided support with heavy artillery fire. As of noon today, both sides are still engaged in bloody fighting in the villages near Jungong Road and around Wuquan Road.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy forces at Qiujiang Wharf have been forced back into the wharf by our forces. This morning (the 13th), the enemy forces received reinforcements and launched an attack on our positions on Jungong Road. At the same time, the enemy forces in Yangshupu also attacked our positions in Yinxiang, attempting to encircle our forces. Our forces rose up to meet the attack, and fierce fighting continued until noon.

### Enemy Warships Shell the North Railway Station and Other Locations

Our Artillery Forces Immediately Responded with a Fierce Counterattack; Multiple Shells Landed on Pengpu Road and Other Locations

With the center of the war shifting outward, the concession line seems relatively quiet. Today marks one month since the outbreak of the war, and the front line remains unchanged as it was at the beginning of August 13th. However, enemy warships shell the area every night, and last night there was also heavy artillery fire targeting our positions at the North Railway Station, Tiantong'an Road, and Shishan Road. Our artillery forces responded with a counterattack, and multiple shells landed in areas where the enemy forces were concentrated, such as Pengpu Road and Miller Road. At the same time, the sounds of mortars and machine guns indicated skirmishes between forward outposts, which occurred intermittently. The sound of gunfire could be heard within the special zone.

### Intense Fighting South of Yunzaobang Last Night

Enemy Forces Attacking Were Repelled by Our Forces

The enemy forces stationed south of Yunzaobang, confronting our forces across the South Sijing River, launched an attack last night (the 12th) with a force of 2,000 men. Our forces lay in ambush within the trenches. When the enemy approached, they leapt out of the trenches at a command and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy forces were routed and fled in disarray. Our forces did not pursue them. There have been no changes on that line, which remains unaffected by the fighting in Yanghang.

### Yanghang and Yuepu Wait for an Opportunity to Counterattack

The Enemy Suffered Heavy Casualties and Dared Not Advance; Our Forces Rapidly Deploy Fresh Troops to Annihilate the Enemy

Since the 10th, the enemy forces in Wusong have been attacking our Yanghang line with heavy artillery fire. The town of Yanghang has become scorched earth under the concentrated bombardment. After several counterattacks, our forces safely retreated to new defensive lines. The enemy forces, suffering heavy casualties, are also reorganizing and replenishing their ranks and dare not advance. Therefore, the fighting on that line was quiet last night (the 12th). Fresh troops have been rapidly deployed in preparation for a counterattack. As for the Yuepu area, due to the local situation in Yanghang, our forces have also abandoned their original positions and are defending new lines, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack in coordination with the Yanghang front.

### Enemy Aircraft Harass the Area This Morning

Machine Gun Fire in Nanshi and Zhabei; Eight Incendiary Bombs Dropped on Gonghe Road, Causing Fires

At 6 AM this morning, four enemy aircraft scouted over Nanshi and the Huangpu River, strafing areas such as the 16th Wharf, Pengjia Ferry, South Pier, and No. 10 Wharf with machine gun fire, fortunately without causing any casualties.

A small squadron of enemy aircraft circled over the Nanshi area at around 6 AM this morning, but because there were few pedestrians, they took no action. At 9 AM, enemy aircraft returned and strafed pedestrians with machine guns. Then, they flew near Yangjia Ferry in Pudong and dropped two bombs, but they did not explode. Later, an enemy aircraft flew across the Huangpu River to the city, flying low for reconnaissance.

At 7:20 AM this morning, four enemy aircraft also went to Zhabei to scout, flying very low and dropping eight incendiary bombs. Fires immediately broke out in Zhen'an Lane on Gonghe Road. The fires were very intense, and the fire brigade from that area was dispatched to put them out. However, due to insufficient water supply, it is feared that the fires cannot be extinguished immediately.

At approximately 1:40 PM this afternoon, six enemy aircraft flew to Bailianjing in Pudong and bombed the area, dropping more than ten bombs, destroying dozens of civilian houses. However, the number of casualties has not yet been determined.

### Enemy Cruiser Hit and Burning

Our Air Force Drops a Large Number of Bombs; Two Enemy Warships Damaged at the Time

At 7:20 PM and 11:30 PM last night, our aircraft launched two night raids on Shanghai, bombing enemy warships over Yangshupu. According to a Reuters report, Nanjing officials reported that a total of five enemy warships were hit by our aircraft that night. Details were recorded in today's morning newspapers. This morning, officials announced that our air force launched a night raid on Shanghai last night, bombing enemy warships in Yangshupu and Songkou. Our air force dropped a large number of bombs, and it was immediately witnessed that two enemy cruisers on the Yangshupu riverfront were hit and caught fire, burning fiercely. Our air force, seeing that the objective had been achieved, safely returned in triumph. Many other enemy warships were also hit and injured, but details are still under investigation.

### Enemy Ships Continue to Transport Troops and Armaments Ashore

Before dawn this morning, two more enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships sailed into the Huangpu River. One, the "Tottori Maru," docked at the Osaka Wharf, where more than a thousand enemy soldiers disembarked. The other, the "Kimigasa Maru," docked at the China Merchants Wharf, where a batch of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies were unloaded ashore.

### Unusual Quiet on the Pudong Front

No Sound of Gunfire for Fifty Hours

After the Japanese army's two failed attempts to invade Pudong, the entire line is in a state of no fighting. The Japanese warships in the Huangpu River have been severely damaged by our land and air forces and are in a state of disarray and panic. They are afraid of the accuracy of our artillery fire in targeting them in Pudong and dare not open fire again to avoid being targeted. Currently, no sound of gunfire has been heard from either side for fifty hours. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy only used a few airplanes to fly to various places in Pudong to drop bombs as a demonstration. At night, armed speedboats patrolled the river surface in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas but never dared to approach the Pudong coastline to avoid being shot at by our forces. This morning, three or four airplanes reconnoitered over Pudong, flying higher than yesterday.

### Brief Report on the War Situation Near the Concession

(Special dispatch, 13th)

### Enemy Warships Transport Troops to Tanggu

They are all transported to Tanggu by barge for landing. There are many enemy soldiers in Tanggu now, and some civilian houses have been occupied. (Central News Agency, 12th)

### Enemy Warships Roam Outside Lianyungang

[Xuzhou] The enemy warships that arrived earlier in Lianyungang have not yet left. They plundered one of our civilian ships, arbitrarily beat and insulted the crew, and forced them to reveal military information before releasing them. On the 10th, an enemy aircraft carrier arrived in the waters 60 li outside the port. At night, it used searchlights to probe our shore. Our soldiers stationed on Dongliandao discovered six aircraft on board the enemy warship with telescopes.

### Various Countries Express Sympathy for Our Appeal to the League of Nations

Our Representatives Inquire of Various Parties; Countries Should Assume Treaty Obligations

[Geneva] Special dispatch from Haskas News Agency diplomatic correspondent: The main purpose of the Chinese government's appeal to the League of Nations is to urge the revival of the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues established by the League of Nations Temporary Assembly in 1933. This committee is composed of 23 countries: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, Portugal, Ireland, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, and Canada. The greatest benefit after its revival is that the United States will also be able to participate. The reason why the Chinese government's legal counsel advocated resubmitting this appeal is that Japan announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27, 1933. Therefore, China must resubmit its appeal in order to invoke the provisions of Article 17 of the Covenant regarding conflicts between member states and non-member states. In addition, the Chinese government has also invoked Articles 3 and 10 of the Covenant this time. According to Article 3, the League of Nations Assembly may deal with any event that concerns world peace. Therefore, if the Executive Yuan submits a draft resolution to the Assembly after discussing China's appeal, the Assembly only needs to convene the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues instead of forming another committee to deal with it. It seems that the main purpose of the Chinese government is to promote a common policy among the major powers of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East, which can also be achieved. As for Article 10 of the Covenant, which concerns respecting and maintaining the territorial integrity and political independence of member states, the Chinese government has also invoked it. Its benefit, from a theoretical perspective, is that after accepting China's appeal, the Executive Yuan will inevitably invite Japan to assume the obligations of a member state in accordance with Article 17 of the Covenant in order to resolve the dispute, but Japan may not accept it. Chinese sources here recently stated that the reason China submitted the appeal was in the hope that "the League of Nations would announce to each country the obligations that major powers should assume." This hope is not too extravagant. As a result of recent inquiries with various parties, there is a strong belief that it can be fulfilled as desired. (Central News Agency, Geneva, 12th)

### Total Number of Japanese Residents Evacuated

Over 30,000 Have Returned Home, Approximately 20,000 Awaiting Evacuation

Since the Japanese army launched a large-scale war of aggression in North China, followed by the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Japanese residents in China had no choice but to swallow their anger and abandon the assets they had cultivated in China for two or three decades, and were forced to return to their country. All of them resented the militarists' pursuit of war with gnashing teeth. According to news from Tokyo, as of September 1st, a total of 35,042 Japanese residents in China had been forced to return to their country. Those evacuated from North China included 2,054 from Jinan, 289 from Zhangdian, 133 from Zhoucun, 187 from Boshan, 346 from Liushan, 698 from Zhifu, 153 from Weihaiwei, 16,337 from Qingdao, 7 from Baotou, 14 from Zhenghe, 139 from Longkou, 136 from Fangzi, 46 from Weixian, 7 from Suiyuan, 464 from Zhangjiakou, 32 from Taiyuan, 7 from Baoding, and 8 from Shijiazhuang. Those evacuated from Central China included 1,785 from Hankou, 13 from Shashi, 107 from Yichang, 96 from Changsha, 35 from Chongqing, 40 from Yanhu, and 76 from Jiujiang. Those evacuated from East China included 41 from Nanjing, 13 from Zhenjiang, 80 from Suzhou, and 59 from Hangzhou. Those evacuated from South China included 48 from Yunnan, 579 from Shantou, 8,413 from Xiamen, 2,077 from Fuzhou, 580 from Guangdong, and 68 from Dehua. As for the more than 1,200 people recently evacuated from Hong Kong, and those evacuated from Shanghai earlier, they are not included in the calculation. Currently, there are still 19,810 Japanese residents and 4,869 Koreans and Taiwanese residing in Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan.

### Commander Wang Strenuously Directs Combat While Ill

According to reports from relevant sources, Commander Wang Jingjiu has been suffering from malaria recently, but he is still strenuously directing combat. There was no fierce fighting on that line on the 12th. Our troops are still holding their original positions without any changes.

### War Affects Silk Mill Shutdowns

Although Zhejiang Province's Autumn Cocoon Loan is Secured, Shanghai Merchants Lack the Funds to Purchase

Zhejiang Province's autumn cocoons are about to enter the market. The Provincial Silk Control Committee has specially borrowed 8.5 million yuan in autumn cocoon loans from the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Bank to lend to various silk factories and surplus cocoon merchants. It is stipulated that 30% of the funds can be applied for loans from the Seven Banks. The loan contract has already been signed. According to inquiries from the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association yesterday, the factory sites of Shanghai silk factories are all located in Zhabei, Hongkou, Nanshi, etc. Now Zhabei and Hongkou have been reduced to war zones, and Nanshi has entered a state of war, so silk factories are unable to start work. Only the British-owned Jaho Silk Factory on North Chengdu Road in the International Settlement is barely operating. Since being hit by stray bullets a few days ago, it has also announced its closure since yesterday. Shanghai silk factory merchants and surplus cocoon merchants are experiencing extremely tight credit during this extraordinary period, so they are unable to purchase autumn cocoons from Zhejiang Province.

### Over Two Hundred Cases of Cholera

Most are Refugees

A case of true cholera was discovered in Shanghai a week ago. The epidemic has not subsided in recent days. According to investigations by the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Health Department of the French Municipal Council, the number of cholera cases in the two settlements has reached 235, most of whom are refugees.

### Anhui Compatriot Association Sends Telegram to Console Commanders Zhang and Yang

Your Excellency's Command is Effective; Our Troops Have Repeatedly Achieved Success

There are approximately hundreds of thousands of residents from Anhui Province in Shanghai. In the Pudong industrial area alone, there are over one hundred thousand people from Anhui. During the recent war, the Japanese army's atrocities have severely affected Anhui refugees. The Anhui Compatriot Association has established a wartime relief committee to expand relief efforts, and has publicly elected Yang Xiaotian, Wang Yucheng, Xu Jingren, and seventeen others as party affairs committee members. Yesterday, the association also sent a telegram to console our loyal and brave anti-Japanese commanders Zhang and Yang. The telegram reads, "To Commander-in-Chief Zhang Wenbo, the Japanese invaders are attacking south, and Shanghai is defending its position. The city and society are in turmoil, and the people are suffering. Your Excellency is leading troops to defend the country, engaging the enemy in battle. For over a month, although the enemy's army is large and its equipment is sophisticated, it relies on our troops' loyalty and bravery to defeat their ferocious attacks. The reputation of the nation has greatly increased, and international attention has turned. All our troops' successes are due to your Excellency's effective command. The country relies on you, and our hometown is honored. Compatriots in Shanghai are even more fortunate. However, as the war prolongs, refugees gather, and all parties are providing relief, but Anhui is uniquely lacking. It is a shame to watch our fellow villagers move around without providing relief. In accordance with the principle of respecting our hometown and the proposal of offering help, we have organized the Anhui Compatriot Association Wartime Relief Committee to handle all reception and repatriation matters immediately. We worry that the task is heavy and our abilities are lacking, so we sincerely hope that you will consider our hometown and provide guidance and support. Thirty million villagers will express their gratitude. We respectfully send this telegram to console you, awaiting your instructions." Another telegram sent to Commander Yang reads, "To Commander Yang Xiaotian, the Japanese invasion of Shanghai is an unprecedented catastrophe. Our troops are charging forward with blood and courage, one after another, and their reputation has intimidated the enemy. This is all due to our officers and soldiers' loyalty to the country and their willingness to sacrifice themselves. Your Excellency's strategy and defense of the local area are even more commendable. The country relies on you, and Anhui is honored. In addition to proceeding with the relief of fellow villagers, we respectfully send this telegram to express our condolences. The Anhui Compatriot Association Wartime Relief Committee humbly salutes you."

### Brief Commentary

— Xiang

It has only been a month since the start of the Shanghai War. Talking about the small gains and losses in this month is nonsensical. Now some people want to settle the accounts for this month as a small summary. This is probably not the time because our national policy is to fight a long-term war. To get a final conclusion and a final report, these fragmented accounts cannot be cleared. We have ways to deal with losses and bankruptcies. We also have ways to increase capital and revitalize business. Those who hope for the company's collapse and profit from it, please do not harbor such dreams. These dreams must be shattered.

### Painful Recollections (II)

— Special Correspondent Shu Di of This Newspaper

㊁ The Ancient City Sank Like a Leaky Ship

The shock and agitation experienced by the people of Beiping at the time of its fall was compared by some to "a bolt from the blue," and by others to "a sinking ship." In fact, anyone who was in Beiping at the time would find the second analogy more accurate: the unexpectedness was the same, but the scene of everything being completely turned upside down silently and without a trace was indeed like a sinking ship.

In the more than twenty days since the Lugouqiao Incident, the morale of the people of Beiping had been "calm" – and sometimes even surprisingly "calm." For example, on the day of the Battle of Zhangyi Gate, the streets near it were surrounded by heavy troops and a temporary curfew was announced. However, in the neighboring streets beyond these streets, the reporter witnessed some shops still operating as usual; when the shop assistants heard a "boom," a shell falling nearby, they shrugged their shoulders and nonchalantly exclaimed, "Scary!" The library remained open, government offices continued to function, and public places were still bustling. Compared with the scenes the reporter saw in various places on this trip to the south, this was a completely abnormal "calm." However, we cannot simply attribute the root cause of this abnormal "calm" to "dullness," or "deep-rooted servility," as some people say, or even to the "broad-mindedness of the people of Beiping," as some intellectuals describe it. If we look deeper, we can immediately discover that underneath it is a kind of casual, optimistic feeling: "Beiping will never fall!" Why? First, even if international relations are complicated, the nations will not stand idly by when things are most critical, right? Second, it's not a fortress, nor is it a commercial port, so what's the point of the Japanese occupying it? - Suppose the nations stand idly by and the Japanese act recklessly, then what? - Then, third, our China will not abandon Beiping! Absolutely not!

Looking at it this way, no matter what, there is only one conclusion: China absolutely cannot abandon Beiping! The government authorities and Chairman Chiang's repeated declarations are the most powerful guarantee, and the loyalty and bravery of the Twenty-ninth Army are the next most powerful guarantee. Here, we are already dealing with the actual strength of our defense, so everyone is talking about how brave the soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army are, how the central army is gathering in the vicinity of ××, and that they can arrive in Beiping in a few hours. On the other hand, they are even more confident and have spent more than twenty days optimistically. To take a step back, the matter of losing it in the short term is simply beyond imagination!

Who can deny that the optimistic basis of the people of Beiping is not rock-solid reality! Everything is practical! And it's obvious! As for the final result, the reason why it differs so greatly from their estimates is not because of their misperceptions of the above aspects! But in fact, it is because they forgot a most important aspect when making their estimates, which is that they only paid attention to the static state of each aspect, and did not take into account all the possible mutations that would arise due to various relationships when they actually took action.

I, personally, was one of the collective, intuitive optimists in Beiping at the time. Not long before that, a friend was traveling south. The day before leaving Beiping, he looked at the entire view of Beiping from the top of Jingshan Mountain, and sighed with reluctance: "Such a beautiful landscape, in a month's time, I'm afraid it won't belong to me anymore!"

I immediately laughed at him for being neurotic, and asserted: "How long our total strength can defend north of the Yellow River, then Beiping will definitely be able to defend until then."

Saying that Beiping would be lost in the short term? - This, at that time, was simply a delirious dream beyond imagination!

July 28th was a clear day. The sound of artillery fire and gunfire around Beiping, which had started on the night of the 27th, did not stop all day. Victory news flew in like snowflakes, and the extra editions of the newspapers were published up to eight or nine times. The whole city was in a frenzy. Everyone undoubtedly believed in the victories of our various forces, as if everything was natural and everything was absolutely true: they completely ignored some of the bizarre aspects of the news itself, and completely forgot the constant circling of enemy planes overhead. At five o'clock that afternoon, an enemy plane dropped an extra edition of the Tianjin Yongbao newspaper in the air. It contained empty news such as the enemy's "great victory" in Nanyuan and other places in Beiping. This only aroused everyone's ridicule, thinking that it was the usual trick of the enemy to cover up their failure. Otherwise, why would it be so empty!

Among the many victory messages, the first to arrive was the recapture of Fengtai. This was around twelve o'clock noon. From then on, news kept coming, and the frenzy shown in the city of Beiping was really touching: both sides of the street were completely filled with people. Whenever a person in military uniform walked by, men, women, old and young, regardless of whether they knew them or not, would applaud and cheer in unison. Many young men and women students, some climbed onto utility poles, some stood on stools, and some even rode on their companions' shoulders, here and there, to publicize and raise funds for the people. When people were walking on the street, from time to time, a Boy Scout hat or cloth helmet, turned upside down as a money container, would be sent in front of them; a male or female student would bow and say:

"Elders, please donate some money to慰勞 the wounded soldiers."

Around six o'clock that day, we suddenly received bad news: our troops in Nanyuan were indeed not fighting very well. At eight o'clock, we received some even worse news; in short, the whole situation was likely to change suddenly. At this time, we happened to run into an important person from the Jicha government, and hurriedly asked him about the actual war situation.

"Don't worry." He laughed as if we were asking too nervously. "There will definitely be better news tomorrow, I can tell you."

At twelve o'clock, the police officers of the police station went door to door, instructing people to prepare garlic, vinegar, cotton, gauze, etc., in order to make simple gas masks. It is said that the enemy would release poison gas the next day. (It was later learned that this measure had the same effect as spreading false victory messages; however, at the time, everyone undoubtedly believed it, and thought it was enough to prove that the enemy had collapsed in defeat and was angry.)

Doubts could not be dispelled, nor could they be confirmed. Until around twelve o'clock, the sound of artillery fire and gunfire subsided. We would rather embrace the terror of poison gas and the expectation of a better victory, and fall asleep, preparing to welcome the morning of the 29th.

Around five o'clock in the morning of the 29th, the sky outside the window was fish-belly white, and a cool breeze blew in. It was another good day. I was sleeping soundly when I was suddenly awakened by the hasty and reckless sound of the door being pushed open.

A friend, Mr. So-and-so, staggered in and collapsed on the rattan chair, muttering with a pale face: "Last night, Zhang Zizhong..."

Okay, no need to say any more. My heart leaped, and I immediately understood that our doubts were completely confirmed!

Everything seemed like an unbelievable dream, yet everything was so rock-solid. This ancient Beiping actually sank to the bottom of the water like a leaky ship in an instant. The fate of our group of more than one and a half million people who had not prepared in advance and were sunk down in confusion could only be slowly explored in the muddy water.

There were sighs everywhere. I saw tears in the eyes of many people.

### Battle Situation on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line for Several Days

Jinan Communication: The battle on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line has been quite fierce in recent days. At 7:30 a.m. on the 4th, about a thousand enemy troops in the Liukou area north of Machang, under the cover of artillery and tanks, launched a fierce attack on our positions. Our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, killing many enemies. At 7:40 a.m., more than ten enemy planes suddenly arrived over Machang, circled east of the station, and then flew to the Xianhe Liukou area more than ten miles northeast of the station to bomb, dropping many bombs. At 8:15 a.m., enemy planes dropped more than two hundred bombs in Tangguantun Liukou Xianhe and nearby towns and villages, bombing indiscriminately without any targets, which was inhumane. The Xianhe Bridge was bombed and destroyed, and Tangguantun Station was once lost. After 3:00 p.m., our army recaptured it. At the same time, our troops west of the Grand Canal advanced fifteen or sixteen miles from Xiaowangzhuang, and our troops in the area of Wumu City recovered the area around Dazhuang. The battle did not stop until late. In total, the enemy army suffered nearly a thousand casualties throughout the day, and we also suffered some casualties. On that day, our army set up defensive works in the Tangguantun West Machang North Xianhe area, and the troops on the left and right flanks also advanced forward.

Around 2:00 a.m. on the 5th, more than a thousand enemy troops, under the cover of artillery, launched a fierce attack on our front-line positions. A certain unit of our army calmly fought back. By dawn, the enemy army was defeated and retreated. Our army still firmly defended the positions near Machang North Xianhe, killing many enemies and seizing many weapons. Three sections of the railway there were also destroyed. From 5:00 p.m., our army again came into contact with the enemy army near Xianhe. Our armored train fired from Machang to assist in the battle. The two sides exchanged fire with machine guns and artillery, and the battle was extremely fierce. Gunfire could be heard near Cangxian until after 6:00 p.m., and the battle was still not over. Our army reinforced the attack to the north and finally repelled the enemy in the area at 9:00 p.m., killing many enemies. The enemy in the Liukou area also launched a fierce attack on us. The battle was also extremely fierce. A certain brigade of our army rushed to reinforce and finally repelled the enemy late at night.

At dawn on the 6th, our army marched north in large numbers, and the enemy retreated in defeat. Our army then recaptured Tangguantun Station at noon and pursued and killed the remaining enemies north from Tangguantun. The enemy army suffered many casualties. In the afternoon, the enemy increased its reinforcements and counterattacked. Our army had just recaptured Tangguantun and had no time to build defensive works, so it still firmly defended the area near Xianhe. At around 4:00 p.m., a large enemy force, under the cover of armored trains, launched a fierce attack on our army's positions. Our army fought back bravely. The second team of our armored trains also fired fiercely at the enemy's armored trains at Xianhe Bridge, shooting extremely accurately. The enemy's armored train's machine gun was destroyed by our shells. The enemy then sent another locomotive to try to tow the armored train back, but it retreated after being fiercely attacked by our army's artillery. Before nightfall, the front line temporarily ceased fighting and still faced each other across Xianhe. On that day, our security team had arrived on the right flank to participate in the battle. A certain brigade of ours advanced north from Xianhe, making rapid progress. At the same time, there was a traitor group of about two thousand people, all dressed in Japanese army uniforms and well-equipped with weapons, who sneaked from Tianjin to Hancun northeast of Cangzhou (some say Hankou). When a certain brigade of ours got the news, it defeated them, killing and wounding many and capturing some alive. They confessed that they were forced by the Japanese army to fight on the front line.

On the 7th, from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our armored trains north of Machang, but our army bravely repelled them. However, a shell exploded in front of the Machang station building, destroying the station's south road room and rail tracks, killing and wounding four or five people. At the same time, the Xianhe Bridge was destroyed, and three miles of railway south of the bridge were demolished. In the afternoon, our reinforcements had arrived at the front. That night, in addition to advancing along separate routes on both flanks, two or three teams of armored trains fired artillery at the enemy's positions north of Machang from Machang, firing more than a hundred shots, which were extremely accurate. Eighty or ninety percent of them hit, killing countless enemy soldiers. The enemy army then retreated to Tangguantun in a panic, and we took advantage of the victory to pursue them.

On the morning of the 8th, our army recaptured the positions north of Machang. At the same time, our left and right flanks advanced more than twenty miles. The left flank reached the area of Yaomadu north of Dacheng, and the right flank reached the vicinity of Sidangkou north of Xianhe. More than a hundred enemy plainclothes teams north of Xianhe were defeated by us, and many were killed. Since the afternoon, the enemy army has again launched a fierce attack on our positions. Machang North and both flanks have been engaged in fierce fighting. Our senior military officers have all gone to the front line to inspect and command, and morale has been greatly boosted.

At dawn on the 9th, about six thousand troops from the Tenth and Fourteenth Divisions of the enemy army, under the cover of artillery and aircraft, launched a fierce attack on our front-line positions and flank positions in three routes. The front was near Xianhe north of Machang, the right flank was near Sidangkou Wantouqiao, and the left flank was in the area north of Dacheng. The 某某某 three brigades and security team of our army fought back separately, and the fighting was very fierce. By noon, the enemies on all routes were finally repelled. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and approach Tangguantun. In the afternoon, the fighting was still very fierce. The enemy army could not hold out and retreated to Tangguantun and north. Our army did not pursue any further, so by evening, the front-line battle had turned silent. The second and third teams of our steel-clad soldiers were all guarding the area between Qingxian and Machang in front. The entire area of Xianhe and north of Xianhe was garrisoned by our army. We are setting up new positions in Xianhe. Feng Zhian ordered road workers to assist in the work, and the people also voluntarily participated in the work, so it was completed that night. The railway from Xianhe Bridge to Zhaoxinzhuang, about three miles north, has been demolished. Together with the previous demolition, it is six miles. The Japanese steel-clad vehicles were blocked and could no longer come south. Our army still followed the original plan and attacked the rear of the enemy army from both flanks.

### Our Report to the League of Red Cross Societies on Enemy Aircraft Repeatedly Bombing Rescue Workers

### The Municipal Federation Requests Maintenance of Workers' Livelihoods

Allowing Them to Lose Jobs and Be Idle - There Are Fears of Hidden Dangers in the Rear

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday submitted a telegram to the National Government stating: "To Lin, Chairman of the Nanjing National Government, We have received the suggestion from Committee Member Yu Chuanding of this Federation, which states in brief: 'In order for the government to economize financial resources, it has ordered all national party and government organs to implement staff reductions and salary cuts. At this time of full-scale war of resistance, everyone should strive to serve the country. If they are allowed to lose jobs and be idle, they are likely to be used by the enemy, deepening the hidden dangers in the rear. Therefore, salary cuts must be implemented, but layoffs are especially likely to cause harm,' etc. Given this, it concerns national plans and people's livelihoods, as well as social order. The livelihoods of all public and private sector workers throughout the country should be planned and maintained as a whole. Based on the aforementioned circumstances, it is appropriate to forward this to your government for adoption and implementation. With utmost sincerity, Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation."
