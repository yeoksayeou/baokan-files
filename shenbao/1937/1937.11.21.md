### Our Army in Jiaxing Retreats to New Position

Main Fighting Forces Deployed on the Sujia Road Front; We Still Maintain Original Front Lines Between Changshu and Fushan

[Hangzhou] Due to strategic considerations, our army in Jiaxing retreated to a new position on the afternoon of the 18th. A portion of the enemy forces entered the city at 3 PM. The main fighting forces are deployed on the Sujia Road front. Our fresh troops continue to arrive and will actively counterattack. According to the enemy's Taipei broadcast, the enemy force occupying Jiaxing is the Kataoka unit. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)

(Huadong News Agency) The enemy's fierce bombardment of Jiaxing on the right flank destroyed the city walls. Zhapu was overly exposed, making it difficult to attack and even harder to defend. Therefore, the strongholds of Zhapu and Pinghu were successively abandoned. Currently, our army is firmly defending the line from Haiyan, Haining, and Xiashi to Changan, Shimen, Chongde, and Nanxun, maintaining close contact with the left flank. The Pingwang point has also been moved backward. The enemy is transporting many speedboats from Wangjiangjing, adopting guerrilla tactics, and threatening to seize Nanxun and Hangzhou.

(Huadong News Agency) The enemy on the left flank has been fiercely attacking Fushan and Suzhou for days. Some strongholds between Changshu and Fushan were breached, but our army bravely counterattacked and maintained the original front lines. The enemy attacked Changshu City from Xiejiaqiao in Fushan to the south, but after our fierce counterattack, the situation has turned from danger to safety. Furthermore, on the central section of the Jinghu Road front, the enemy fiercely attacked the vicinity of Zhengyi. Our army has either destroyed or defended important strongholds, making it difficult for the enemy's conspiracy to succeed.

### Glimpses of the Current Situation in Towns South of the Huangpu River

Since the enemy troops landed at Jinshanwei, towns south of the Huangpu River have fallen, disrupting transportation and leading to isolated news and varying reports. A person who walked from the south of the Huangpu River to Shanghai gave a detailed account of the current situation in the area, stating that after the enemy troops landed on the coast, they divided their forces to advance on Songjiang, Jiaxing, and other places. The route into Songjiang followed Zhangyan, Tinglin, and passed the Mishi Ferry (a newly built highway), causing considerable damage to Zhangyan and Tinglin. Tinglin town was eighty to ninety percent destroyed. The enemy troops who landed on the beach must have rested in Tinglin, where they likely set up a command post or supply station. Songyin and Zhangze suffered less damage, and enemy troops are currently stationed in these two places. On the 6th, about fifty or sixty enemy soldiers from Tinglin arrived in the town of Yexie, which is located on the banks of the Huangpu River. At that time, our army had rushed from Nanqiao to intercept them, resulting in a battle at the Niu Cai Garden area about three miles from the town. Later, our army was ordered to retreat, so the battle stopped in a few hours. The enemy also did not occupy the town, considering it not a strategic area. However, enemy aircraft dropped bombs once, fortunately falling into the river. To date, the town is unharmed. Generally, people have gradually returned to the town, seeing that it is relatively stable. Desheng Port Town is a key entrance in the Huangpu River. Currently, an enemy shallow-water warship is stationed in the river to defend it. Enemy transport ships and boats pass through here every day. The person who came to Shanghai on foot from Pudong said that towns along the way south of Zhangang had not suffered from the war and were mostly intact. The areas to the north were mostly destroyed by artillery fire, and due to the rise of hoodlums in Puxi, theft was rampant. Residents flocked to Pudong, because the enemy troops in Pudong had all left, making it relatively peaceful. Near Shanghai, farmers along the way carried vegetables across the Huangpu River to sell, because all the enemy troops had gone to the front lines, and there was not a single soldier there, so there was no obstruction. As for Songjiang, the bombing within the city was very severe. According to eyewitnesses, from the Zhuganhui Electric Light Company, one could look directly to Bailongtan without any obstruction. The essence of the area was completely in ruins. The areas bombed were more intense to the west. To the east, to Huayang Bridge, there was no major damage, only a small wooden bridge on the Songhu Highway at the east entrance of Huayang Bridge Town was destroyed. Although other areas were occasionally hit by bombs, the damage was minimal, not as severe as rumored. Residents have all evacuated to the countryside, and there is no sign of life in the city or outside, like entering a dead market. There are many corpses on the roads from Songjiang along the highway to Shanghai, a truly tragic sight.

### Enemy Warships Arrive with Large Quantities of Munitions

(Central News Agency) On the evening of the previous day and the morning of yesterday (20th), four enemy transport ships arrived in Shanghai: the No. 308 transport ship Misakisan Maru, the unknown number transport ship Chojusan Maru, the Nijiri Maru, and the unknown No. 65 transport ship. They docked at the Huangpu Wharf, the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, Floating Dock No. 6, and the China Merchants Bureau China Wharf, carrying munitions. The No. 418 transport ship Jinno Maru, which sailed to Shanghai on the 19th, is currently docked at the Huangpu Wharf, unloading dozens of cars.

(Central News Agency) At 8 AM yesterday morning (20th), the No. 374 transport ship Ginyo Maru, converted from an enemy merchant ship, sailed to Shanghai, carrying approximately 1,000 soldiers from the 12th batch of the enemy's seventh reinforcement army. They landed at the Osaka Wharf.

(Central News Agency) The number of enemy warships in the Huangpu River increased again yesterday. In addition to 16 transport ships, the number of destroyers increased to nine, currently docked at Floating Docks No. 44, No. 40, No. 9 (two ships), No. 8, No. 7 (two ships), No. 5, and No. 1. Three gunboats are docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf, the New Mitsui Wharf, and Floating Dock No. 15. One torpedo boat is docked at the China Merchants Bureau China Wharf, and three cruisers, totaling 16 ships.

(Central News Agency) At around 8 AM yesterday morning, two enemy cruisers, the Kuma and the Ohoki, sailed to Shanghai, docking at Floating Docks No. 10 and No. 12. Including the enemy flagship Izumo, the number of enemy cruisers that sailed to Shanghai has increased to three.

### Enemy Troops in Pudong Transferred to the Front

Due to the tense military situation at the front, the enemy's motorcade defending the Pudong area had already transferred part of its forces to the front lines for reinforcements. Last night, they were ordered to transfer another part, carrying supplies and weapons, urgently via the Yangjiadu ferry crossing. They crossed the river in boats to Nanshi, where they transferred to heavy trucks to rush to the front. There was chaos on the Pudong Avenue, which only returned to its original state after two or three hours. Currently, less than one-third of the soldiers remain in Pudong, stationed in the Pudong Bank, Shudetang Chinese Medicine Store, Chenmin Elementary School, the Wu family alley, the Wu family, and the Tianzhang Paper Factory. The lower-level command post is located in the Chen family, a wealthy household in Yangjiazhai. Another team of military police is stationed in the Pudong Li neighborhood on Dongchang Road to assist in surveillance. However, with a force of less than 300, the distribution of defense duties is becoming increasingly difficult. As of this morning, there were no signs of the enemy east of Pudong South Road and the Jiu'an Cemetery Jinjia Lane area. Theft has risen sharply in nearby villages. The enemy, unable to cope adequately, is accelerating the training of 150 newly recruited puppet police, who have now formally stationed in the Pudong Branch, with plans to put them back on duty tomorrow morning (21st).

(Central News Agency) Due to the tense military situation at the front, all the original enemy troops defending the Pudong area have been transferred to the front for reinforcements. Pudong is now guarded by puppet Manchurian police, with six men per squad. Except for the squad leader, who is an enemy soldier, the rest are from Northeast China. The squad leader carries a box cannon, while the puppet Manchurian police have no firearms, only wooden sticks, and are assigned to various guard posts by the enemy. It is reported that due to the small number of personnel, there are no traces of enemy troops in the vicinity of Gaoqiao Town.

### Enemy Establishes Supply Station in Minhang

(Central News Agency) After our army retreated from Nanshi in Pudong, both banks of the Huangpu River are controlled by the enemy. They are using waterways to transport grain and machinery. Enemy warships have been busy coming and going in recent days. It is also learned that the enemy has established a supply station in the Minhang area and occupied our Shanghai County government and other institutions in Beiqiao, storing large quantities of military equipment there before transferring it upstream. It is also learned that the enemy's headquarters is also located there.

### Our Small Ships Forced by Enemy to Transport Munitions

(Central News Agency) The dozens of our small ships docked in South Huangpu, after being towed to the Mitsubishi Wharf and painted with numbers, have already carried munitions to the upstream of the Wusong River once. Yesterday afternoon, those small ships had already returned and are now docked on the Huangpu Wharf surface. The enemy ship Misakisan Maru, which has just arrived from Japan, is unloading its bullets into the small ships, preparing to head to the front again.

### North-China Daily News on the Citywide Refugee Problem

Promoting the Resumption of Factories and Returning Refugees to Pudong Are the Most Important Ways to Alleviate the Serious Situation

The North-China Daily News published an editorial yesterday, emphasizing the importance of addressing the refugee problem in this city. It stated that there are currently 126,000 unemployed and destitute people in the various shelters in this city, who must be supported for at least half a year. In addition, there are about 600,000 people who are dependent on charitable relatives and friends, but these relatives and friends are already in financial straits and will not be able to sustain them for long. According to a survey by the French Concession, there are a total of 48,000 homeless people in the concession who have no food or clothing. The Public Concession has not yet determined the exact number, but it is approximately 8,000. Usually, 185,000 people in the Public Concession rely on factories for their livelihood. Now that factories in the northern and western districts are gradually resuming work, they have absorbed 50,000 workers. There are still approximately 135,000 people without work, making life difficult. Fortunately, refugee groups are sending refugees back to their hometowns. If the refugees from Pudong who have come to Shanghai can be returned to their villages, it can reduce Shanghai's burden. Furthermore, they can grow crops to supply Shanghai, alleviating the food shortage in this city. The Japanese authorities are also aware of this need, but are hesitant due to concerns about guerrilla attacks. However, the residents of Pudong and the surrounding areas are not comparable to people from other provinces and pose no such danger. The relaxation of the unemployment situation in Shanghai will also benefit the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese should encourage the refugees of Pudong to return to their hometowns. After the number of refugees in Shanghai decreases, it will be possible to cope with the unemployed who have no hometown to return to and who call Shanghai home. However, even that is not easy. Another aspect that requires special attention is that if Shanghai's industry is to recover, the authorities must prevent skilled workers from leaving Shanghai due to prolonged idleness. The Labor Planning Committee of the Chinese and Foreign Yizhen Association is already concerned about this. In short, the refugee problem now requires the cooperation of municipal authorities and others and must be addressed with a spirit that is not afraid of difficulties.

### Zhu Yaohua Dies of Serious Injuries

He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but did not recover after more than ten days. It is reported that he died of serious injuries, and all who heard the news expressed their sorrow.

### Children's Welfare Association Rescues War-Zone Children

The meeting was opened by Chairman Luo Yunyan. General Secretary Xu reported on the association's affairs, stating that the China Children's Welfare Association of America had sent a telegram to President Kong of this association, suggesting that the construction funds for the Nanjing Children's Welfare Experimental Area be used for the expenses of rescuing Chinese war-zone children. President Kong has already replied that he agrees. Deputy General Secretary Chen Tiesheng was dispatched in June to the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan to rescue disaster-stricken children. He cooperated with local government agencies and charitable organizations to establish 12 shelters in Sichuan, housing 5,000 disaster-stricken children, and five shelters in Gansu, housing 1,000 disaster-stricken children. He also entrusted the Xi'an Orphanage to house 300 disaster-stricken children. The shelter period is set for one year. In Shanghai, this association cooperated with the International Relief Association to rescue children in the Nanshi refugee area. The Shanghai War-Zone Children's Shelter is currently housing more than 170 children and needs to be expanded. The following motions were then discussed and passed: ㊀ The draft outline of rescue methods for war-zone children was referred to Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Yan Fuqing, and other committee members for review and implementation. ㊁ The China Children's Welfare Association of America's suggestion to transfer the construction funds for the Children's Welfare Experimental Area to the rescue of war-zone children was referred to Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Yan Fuqing, and other committee members, along with representatives from the China Children's Welfare Association of America, Baker and Fei Wusheng, for research and implementation. ㊂ The motion to expand the Shanghai War-Zone Children's Shelter and the Shanghai Children's Hospital's request for a subsidy, as well as the requests from the Children's Welfare Associations in Chengdu and Lanzhou for formal recognition, were referred to Luo Yunyan, Lin Kanghou, Wu Weide, Liu Shi Liming, and other committee members for joint review. ㊃ The Shanghai Street Children's Education Association is operating quite well, and this association subsidizes it with 100 yuan per month.

### Two Elderly Men in Pudong Display Commendable Integrity in Their Later Years

Threats and Inducements Fail to Move Them; The Puppet Maintenance Association Cannot Be Established

Since the enemy troops occupied the towns in Pudong, they have been eager to use local respected people for their purposes, in order to stage their puppet show, but they have repeatedly run into walls, so that many puppet maintenance associations in various places cannot be established. It is learned that Zhang Xuezhou of Zhoupu Town, nearly seventy years old, is usually enthusiastic about local affairs and is deeply respected by the local people. After the enemy troops occupied the town, they tried in many ways to persuade him to serve as the chairman of the maintenance association, but Zhang was unmoved. He quietly came to Shanghai a few days ago and told people, "I am a member of the Chinese people. Because of my old age and declining strength, I cannot serve in the war of resistance. How can I still be willing to be driven by the enemy?" Furthermore, Qin Yanqi, seventy-eight years old, of Chenxing District in Pudong, has served as a director of the Shanghai Charity Association and is a keen patriot who has been running social undertakings. The enemy admired his name and asked someone to persuade Qin to return, threatening to burn his house if he did not return. Qin heard of this and said, "If the country is not saved, what is the use of having a home? Let them do it." Such as these two elderly men, truly display commendable integrity in their later years.

### National Government Moves to Chongqing

Declaration Issued Yesterday; Will Engage in a More Extensive and Protracted Struggle

[Nanjing] The National Government recently issued the following declaration: Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, Tianjin and Beiping have fallen, and the war has spread. The National Government, recognizing the endless aggression of the violent Japanese, decided to resist and defend itself. The people of the whole country, filled with righteous indignation, and all the officers and soldiers, loyal and courageous, rose up. The invaded provinces have all made extremely urgent efforts and extremely heroic sacrifices. In the corner of Shanghai, the war of resistance lasted for three months. Officers and soldiers from all over the country rushed to the aid, arriving in the evening after being ordered in the morning. They built trenches with their flesh and blood on the front lines, determined not to retreat. The violent Japanese poured out their sea, land, and air forces to attack in a continuous cycle. Although the positions were reduced to ashes, the morale of the army remained as solid as gold. The courage in the face of battle and the heroism of those who died in the line of duty truly demonstrate the spirit of national independence and lay the foundation for the revitalization of China. Recently, the violent Japanese have become even more greedy and sent troops westward, approaching our capital. Their intention is nothing more than to use their violence to force us into an alliance under the city walls. They do not know that from the day we decided to resist and defend ourselves, we knew that this was the final moment. For the sake of the nation's life, for the sake of the national character, and for the sake of international justice and world peace, we have no room to surrender. Anyone with blood in their veins is determined to be a jade shard rather than a broken tile. The National Government, in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in a long-term war of resistance, has moved to Chongqing today. From now on, it will engage in a more extensive and protracted battle with the masses of the Chinese people and the vastness of the land. Everyone is determined to die, and their blood and land will be united as one. No violence can separate them. With international sympathy from abroad and national unity at home, we can continue to resist and achieve the goal of maintaining the survival and independence of the nation. This is hereby declared, and we encourage each other. November 20, 26th year of the Republic of China (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)

[Chengdu] The provincial government, upon hearing that the National Government moved to Chongqing on the 20th, sent a telegram of welcome. The original telegram read: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government: Upon reading our government's declaration, we know that in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in a long-term war of resistance, you have moved to Chongqing. This firm declaration shows the spirit of resisting the enemy. The re-establishment of the existing base and the winning strategy are ultimately in our own hands. Not only can we gain international sympathy, but also encourage the loyalty and love of the Sichuan people. After reading, we lead 70 million people to welcome you. Please accept our reverence. Liu Xiang, Deng Hanxiang (acting name), stamped with the Sichuan Provincial Secret Seal." (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)

The general public opinion among the Chinese people is that they are determined to resist to the end and are strongly opposed to surrender and compromise.

### British Chargé d'Affaires Denies Japanese Newspaper's Report of Our Request for Mediation

Our Embassy in the UK Also Firmly Denies This. British Ambassador to Japan's Meeting with Hirota Only Related to the Shanghai Situation

[Nanjing] This morning, British Chargé d'Affaires Archibald Clark Kerr, speaking to a Reuters reporter here, firmly denied the news reported in the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun that Nanjing dignitaries had requested him to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute and inquire about the Japanese side's ceasefire conditions, saying that this statement was absolutely unfounded. The British Chargé d'Affaires plans to go to Hankou soon to maintain direct contact with responsible personnel of the Chinese government. (Reuters, 20th, Central News Agency)

[London] Recently, foreign sources have released a message claiming that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, and certain important figures around Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, had requested the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Archibald Clark Kerr, to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. Upon hearing this, the spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the UK immediately and firmly denied it, saying that this was propaganda with ulterior motives. In fact, "this kind of action could never be done by such figures." Privately in China, it is said that the envoys of various countries stationed in China are eager to seize every opportunity to promote peace in the Far East, which the Chinese government is not unaware of. Among British diplomatic circles, it is said that "we know nothing about it, and even the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Archibald Clark Kerr, has not reported a single word about it," indicating that this news is not credible. (Reuters, 20th, Central News Agency)

### Dr. Gonser De Forest of the United States Writes a Letter of Advice to the Japanese People (Part 2)

Fearing that Abandoning the Right Path Will Lead to Irreversible Calamity. Invading China Will Be Despised by People All Over the World. Repent Quickly and Avoid Being Fooled by the Warlords to Avoid Collapse.

I understand that your attitude towards China stems from nothing but bullying and fear. China's remarkable progress in recent years is undeniable. You have always bullied them, and upon seeing their progress, you have turned to fear. It is this fear that has led to this military action. You believe that if you do not take immediate action to subdue China, China will become too strong in the future and will be impossible to subdue. All the reasons you have given above are empty talk. This is the real reason. It is clear that you want to subdue China.

I believe that there are two ways for you to subdue China: one is by force, and the other is by friendship. Now you have chosen the first way, which is to create an eternal and irreconcilable hatred for yourselves. You may say, "Defeat China and make them powerless to resist. What is there to fear from deep hatred?" But I really dare not believe your statement. Can you really conquer this nation of four hundred million people? Do not use India as an example. China and India cannot be compared. Even if Britain loses India, it will not harm the fundamental existence of the country, because Britain and India are extremely far apart. As for China, even if you can conquer them today, if China can become strong one day, their strength will be more than enough to destroy you, because you are too close to China and are insignificant compared to China.

I am deeply afraid that your warlords have led you into a reckless gamble. Although you may win temporarily, the path they have led you on is extremely dangerous. Moreover, your victory is not certain. The longer the war lasts, the deeper the harm will be. Your conflict with China will become irreversible.

You have already gone down the wrong path. You could have taken the road of coexistence and co-prosperity, gaining countless benefits through friendly relations. Your schools could be filled with Chinese students, your factories could be filled with Chinese raw materials, and you could supply each other's needs. But now you are determined to create a cruel environment, whether it is a physical war or an intangible war, this environment will continue endlessly.

You have already gone down the wrong path, and the result will only be sorrow. The attitude of the whole world towards you has also changed. In the past, all the countries of East Asia admired and praised you, and hoped that you would be their strong leader. In their eyes, they thought you were their guarantee, and through you they could avoid the invasion of Westerners. Now they are greatly disappointed and greatly panicked, because you yourselves are starting to invade and encroach upon Asia. You have lost your qualifications as a leader because of the times. You gained it in the past but lost it in the present, because you are now holding a knife and cutting off the limbs of China. You could have won the sincere obedience of the whole of China and the whole of Asia, but because of the militarism and bellicosity of your warlords, you have abandoned all sense of gratitude. Your lifeline lies in trade, but you cannot force your enemies to trade with you. As a result, you are cutting off your own lifeline with your own knife.

If you say that what you are doing is what Europeans have already done, then I will answer that accumulating evil is not enough to make a good deed. Why do you have to imitate Europe? The Europe of today is a warning to you against using force to oppress the Chinese people. Jesus Christ said, "Those who live by the sword will die by the sword." Is not the current situation in Europe a proof of this saying? Decades ago, did not Europeans use force to invade all parts of the world? Now this sword has turned back to the Europeans, and they will perish under this sword. God is eternal, and their righteous judgment does not ask about East or West, nor does it ask about skin color. Your country may also collapse before God, because the moral relationship between cause and effect is like this. If you sow injustice, you will naturally reap injustice. If you sow violence, you will naturally reap violence. The time for reaping may not be today, nor may it be tomorrow, but since God is eternal, this law of cause and effect is naturally unavoidable.

I am very sorry to write this unusually emotional letter, but this letter is written to a friend, and the wording is full of infinite disappointment and sadness. I hope that there will be another rising Japan to guide us. The current Japan under the dictatorship of the military is not what I dream of and hope for. Not only that, but I have just come to live in China. I have seen countless Chinese villagers being arrested from unarmed villages, and I have seen many villagers looking up to the sky waiting for machine gun bullets raining down. They certainly do not want to be treated so cruelly, and your civilians have no resentment against them. It can be seen that this kind of behavior is completely unnecessary and is an unforgivable sin.

Friends, I urge you not to listen to the kind of propaganda that leads you to the pain of long-term hatred and long-term war. You should rather listen to your far-sighted politicians and be friendly to China. Turn back quickly and start your right path again. People with strong character can change their ways, while people with weak character are unwilling to change even if they know they are wrong. Please try to be a strong person. With just one turn, you can win the hearts of the people. Do you think it is too late? That is not necessarily the case. I have recently talked with many responsible Chinese leaders, and I believe that as long as Japan is willing to extend a friendly hand, they will definitely welcome it with both hands. But given your current attitude, they are prepared to fight to the end. World opinion agrees with China. I am just expressing this opinion. You may think that I am too biased, but you must know that I did not want to speak. This article is just a cry of my infinite sorrow, and the words in this article are no more intense than what I said to the Chinese leaders about the weaknesses and sins of their country. Moreover, I have just returned from the United States, and everyone in the United States who has heard my speeches knows that I also clearly criticize the sins of the American nation without any leniency.

Everyone has shortcomings, but what is most important at present is that there is a major crime in the international community of the world, that is, Japan's crime of invading China. It is an infringement on China, an infringement on world peace, an infringement on your own interests, and an infringement on your relationship with the whole world. Turn back, I hope you will become a Japan that does not go down the wrong path. Then we will follow your leadership and receive your gifts. But at present, there is nothing to say. If you do not stop your aggression against China for a day, then we will have no cooperation with you, whether it is cultural, moral, spiritual, or economic. We are forced to say this today. When we say this, our hearts are full of infinite pain and infinite hope, because what we say is a sincere advice to a friend.

### Chamber of Commerce Cables Jiangsu Provincial Government for Approval to Purchase Vegetable Cattle in Northern Jiangsu

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday regarding the shortage of vegetable cattle in Shanghai. The cable reads: "To the esteemed Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Government, previously, the Shanghai market for vegetable cattle was designated to be purchased from Wujin, Danyang, and Wuxian by your government.

Awaiting a reply. Sincerely, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."

### The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is Properly Planning Relief for Unemployed Workers

Dispatching to the Rear for Production in the Short Term

The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, considering that after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, factories in the war zone were destroyed by artillery fire, and factories in the concession area were mostly unable to start work due to the war, resulting in a large number of unemployed workers being displaced, apart from the association finding ways to request the Municipal Relief Committee to send a portion back to their original places of origin, a large number of those remaining in Shanghai are currently being counted, and about 3,000 people have registered with the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee. The Federation of Trade Unions is currently working with the committee to properly plan relief, and plans to send the registered workers to the rear in the short term in order to introduce them to work and engage in production.

Since the start of the recruitment, all sectors have been actively implementing it. Yesterday, those who went to respond included 41 Chinese employees of the British-owned China Soap Company, each donating one yuan, and children Wang Miaorui and Pan Jinlin, each donating three yuan.

### Sufficient Stocks of Chinese Medicine

Since the change in the Shanghai situation, the disruption of water and land transportation has caused a shortage of various goods coming in. However, the reporter learned from the Chinese Medicine Industry Association that although many shops in the Nanshi medicinal materials industry have been destroyed, the various drugstores usually have sufficient stocks, so there is no cause for panic. Therefore, it will definitely not affect patients, and the selling price is also kept balanced with that before the war. Moreover, the consumption of some tonics and medicines has been sharply reduced, such as white fungus, which has fallen in price quite a lot. However, there is a slight shortage of herbal medicines, but it is currently sufficient to cope with the situation.

### The Current International Situation and Our Country's Diplomatic Line

— Zhang Zhirang

Japan's expanded aggression against China has already created the current situation of Anglo-American cooperation. This cooperation is an extremely important event in the history of world politics. It has changed the situation in the Pacific for more than forty years and is constantly affecting the movement of European politics.

Since Britain concluded an agreement with Japan in 1894, it has allied with Japan to contain the European and American powers on the Far Eastern continent, and allied with Japan to contain the United States in the Pacific. After the World War, the opposition between Britain and the United States intensified, and the confrontation between the United States and Britain and Japan in the Pacific was particularly significant. Although the United States convened the Washington Conference, concluded the arms limitation treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty on Chinese affairs, and enabled China and Japan to conclude the Shandong Question Resolution Treaty, it made every effort to prevent the Anglo-Japanese alliance treaty, which had expired, from being renewed. However, the spirit of Britain's alliance with Japan did not disappear until the July 7th Incident. It initially refused to cooperate with the United States on the Manchurian Incident, and always let Japan go. Then, when Lytton went around Japan to China, it still hoped to compromise. Finally, on the eve of the July 7th Incident, it was still conducting negotiations with China. It was not until the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the start of China's all-out resistance, and the exposure of Japan's ambition to invade all of China that Britain woke up, abandoned its policy of allying with Japan to contain the United States, and changed to the path of allying with the United States to contain Japan. It strongly advocated justice in the League of Nations and repeatedly expressed its eagerness for American cooperation.

Since Roosevelt took office as president, he soon decided to ask fewer foreign affairs and concentrate on solving domestic problems. In the middle of the Italo-Abyssinian War and the Spanish Civil War, he successively formulated the Neutrality Act and the Permanent Neutrality Act. When China's all-out resistance began, the United States was at the peak of isolation. Unexpectedly, in President Roosevelt's Chicago speech on October 5, he suddenly changed direction and expressed his willingness to cooperate with various countries to isolate the international outlaws. The American representative's views at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference were roughly the same as those of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is now also in discussions with Britain to revise the commercial treaty. These facts all show that the situation in the Pacific in which Britain and Japan joined forces against the United States has changed to a situation in which Britain and the United States joined forces against Japan. Under the old situation, the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Sino-Japanese War since the Manchurian Incident have continued to occur in the Pacific. This change in the situation will of course have the same major opposite effects here.

Not only that, but the practical cooperation between Britain and the United States, as well as between Britain and the United States and France and the Soviet Union, has consolidated the international peace front and strengthened the role of the Franco-Soviet relations. On the one hand, it makes it possible for the great powers to jointly contain Japan, and on the other hand, it makes it easier to complete the prerequisite for the Soviet Union to actively assist China. Because if the Soviet Union wants to give me active and powerful assistance, it must first obtain the consent of Britain and the United States; otherwise, it is afraid that once Britain and the United States have doubts, it will suffer both sides. Now that Britain and the United States' attitude toward Japan has been quite clear, their support for the Soviet Union to assist me in this way is of course very great. These are all things that our country should pay special attention to when determining its diplomatic line.

Of course, the cooperation of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union promoted the conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and following this agreement, the British Ambassador to Italy visited the Italian Foreign Minister to discuss the issue of negotiations between the two countries. However, it was soon discovered that the time for this negotiation had not yet arrived. At the same time, Britain sent Privy Councilor Halifax to Germany in a private capacity to talk with Hitler for as long as three hours. However, the contradictions between Britain and Germany over colonies, the contradictions between Germany and France over Central Europe, and the contradictions between Britain and France over Spain have no hope of being resolved satisfactorily. The same is true of the contradictions between Britain and Italy over the Mediterranean and East Africa, and the contradictions between Britain and France over Italy over Spain. Therefore, the possibility of compromise between Britain and Germany and Italy is really small, and the danger of the peace front breaking down is almost zero. Moreover, if both sides can make concessions to each other and temporarily reach a compromise, then reducing the contradictions in Europe and enabling Britain to have more energy to deal with the problems in the Far East is not a bad thing for the anti-aggression front.

As for the United States, it will not have any good feelings about the Anti-Comintern Pact, which contains the role of expanding fascist forces. The fascistization of South American countries is what the United States is most wary of; the assimilation of European countries is also what the United States does not want to hear. This can be clearly seen from the United States' attitude towards the coup in Brazil and its dispatch of Ambassador Breth to Poland.

Under such an international situation, our country's diplomacy should, on the one hand, make good use of the tendency of cooperation between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to obtain joint action against Japan; on the other hand, promote the United States and Britain to support the Soviet Union to further provide individual assistance; this is the correct and easy path, is there any doubt?

### The Soviet Union Takes Precautions to Deal with the Crisis in the Far East

Milan The semi-official "Italian People's Daily" here declared last night that the Moscow government had formally notified the Barcelona Republican government that Soviet Russia could no longer provide assistance to the Spanish government forces because it felt threatened by Japan and had the possibility of being involved in the Sino-Japanese War. The newspaper pointed out that this declaration indicates that the Soviet Union's supply of volunteers and military supplies to Spain will be suspended, and the Soviet Union's interest in the Spanish conflict will cool down. (20th, Haitong Telegraph)

### Cecil Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan

[New York] Lord Cecil, who won the 1937 Nobel Peace Prize, declared here today that economic sanctions against Japan by only a few countries would be enough to stop Japanese aggression. There are two bases for this: 1. Only a few countries buy Japanese goods, and 2. Japan only purchases raw materials from a few countries. Therefore, if several major countries can unanimously implement economic sanctions, they will definitely be effective. (19th, National Telegraph)

### Pittman Expresses Disappointment with the Results of the Brussels Conference

Washington Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman told Associated Press reporters today that he was quite disappointed with the results of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, the Nine-Power Treaty does not expect to be as important as a treaty. As for the reason why the United States does not implement the Neutrality Act, it is because the purpose of the Neutrality Act is only to protect the United States, not to oppress other countries. As of now, the United States is not in danger of being involved in the whirlpool of the Far Eastern war. If there is such a development in the future, such as naval blockade and submarine attacks, then this law will be enough to protect the United States. Democratic Senator Lewis proposed that President Roosevelt investigate the situation of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and withdraw the American representative if necessary. (19th, National Telegraph)

[New York] "The Washington Post" recently published an article declaring that the Brussels Conference only condemned Japan's acts of aggression, which is really not enough. Democratic countries must take effective steps against aggressors. The report also pointed out that Britain, the United States, and Canada are currently supplying Japan with various materials, which Japan is using to invade China. Therefore, the United States must declare a boycott of Japanese goods and stop selling goods to Japan. The conservative "Commercial and Financial Chronicle" stated, "The Anti-Comintern Pact" and the Brazilian coup proved that fascism has attacked democratic countries. "Under the slogan of anti-communism, fascism is threatening democracy. The Brazilian fascist coup has a great impact on American interests." "The New York People's Forum" criticized the Brussels Conference, calling it an ineffective organization. (19th, Tass News Agency)

### Major Reshuffle of Italian Cabinet Members

Significant political developments are expected. Prime Minister assumes concurrent role of Minister of Colonies. Osto succeeds as Governor-General of Abyssinia.

[Rome] The government issued an order today reshuffling a large number of cabinet members. This move indicates that there will be significant changes in Italian politics. Prime Minister Mussolini's concurrent role as Minister of Colonies suggests that Italy will intensify its activities in Africa and accelerate the development of its newly occupied territories there. While the position of Undersecretary of Colonies is assigned to Fascist Party Army Commander De Vecchi, the Governor-General of Abyssinia will be assumed by Duke Osto, as the Duke belongs to the House of Savoy. Italy's conquest of Abyssinia was carried out in the name of the royal family. It is now known that Duke Osto will likely travel to Abyssinia at the beginning of next month. Regarding economic policy, the newly appointed Minister of Exchange and Currency, Guarneri, formerly served as Minister of Finance and enjoys a high reputation. Currently, Italy's economic policy is geared towards self-sufficiency, with Guarneri effectively acting as its dictator. Secondly, the promotion of Licini, head of the Fascist Youth Organization, to Undersecretary of the Ministry of Corporations is also extremely important. The addition of an Undersecretary to this ministry is due to the fact that as Italy's politics and trade have already been controlled, the production of various industries will inevitably be subjected to control as well.

Garcelli is appointed as the civil administrator of Addis Ababa (i.e., the capital of Abyssinia), and General Garavello is appointed as the garrison commander of Addis Ababa. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)

[Rome] According to official news released today, Duke Osto has succeeded General Graziani as Governor-General of Abyssinia. General Graziani is known as the "Liaoyang General of Italy" and is a confidant of the Italian King. However, he recently resigned due to poor health. Mussolini sent him a letter expressing the nation's gratitude for his contributions to the conquest of Abyssinia. Duke Osto is the eldest son of the late Duke Osto, is currently 39 years old, and is one of the most popular members of the royal family. He strongly supports the Fascist system and has served in the cavalry and air force. His wife is Princess Francine. (Reuter dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)

### Japanese-Italian Solidarity

New commercial treaty to be signed next month. Manchukuo to join Anti-Comintern Pact.

[Tokyo] The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated today that "Manchukuo" will join the Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy on November 25. On that day, the full text of the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by the five countries of Japan, Germany, Italy, "Manchukuo," and the Spanish National Army Government will be released in the capitals of the five countries. Yesterday, the "Asahi Shimbun" reported that Japan will formally recognize the Spanish National Army Government on November 25. (Reuter dispatch, 19th)

[Tokyo] The Japanese government, due to the establishment of the Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact and wishing to exercise spiritual and political solidarity with Italy, will also establish trade relations with Italy's new colony of Abyssinia without treaty relations. Therefore, it has decided to conclude a new Japan-Italy trade treaty. Ambassador Hotta, stationed in Italy, has been conducting negotiations with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based on instructions from his home government. Recently, the governments of Japan and Italy have completed the informal signing of the Japan-Italy Comprehensive Trade Treaty. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently rushing to process the treaty documents and will soon consult with the Privy Council to take the necessary procedures. At the latest, the formal signing can be completed in Rome in mid-next month. Regarding Abyssinia, which Germany has recognized as Italy's new colony and with which it has concluded a trade treaty, the Japanese government's conclusion of a new Japan-Italy trade treaty will make this fact even more evident. The friendly relations among Japan, Germany, and Italy, which have been embodied in the Anti-Comintern Pact, will be further strengthened in substance. As a result, the amount of Japanese exports to Italy is estimated to increase from 5-6 million yen to 10 million yen. The main categories of goods will be cotton products, sundries, and food. As for the amount of Italian exports to Japan, the aim is to balance Japanese and Italian exports and imports, with both sides generally agreeing to equal imports. The items imported from Abyssinia will be leather, livestock, and various grains, while an equal amount of industrial salt will be imported from Italian Somaliland. The Italian government intends to use the conclusion of the new trade treaty as an opportunity to formulate a new tariff system for Italy's East African colonies, including Abyssinia, Somaliland, Eritrea, and Cyrenaica. (Domei dispatch, 20th)

### Germany and Russia to Mutually Close Consulates

[Berlin] Germany and the Soviet Union have previously decided to close several consulates mutually established in each other's countries. It is expected that only Moscow, Kiev, Novosibirsk, and Minsk will remain. German sources believe that trade between Germany and the Soviet Union is decreasing daily and is almost entirely concentrated in Moscow. Therefore, there is no need to establish consulates in other parts of the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet consulates in Germany will also be reduced as much as possible, with Soviet consulates being established only in two cities in northern Germany. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)

### US Plans to Add Two Battleships

Secretary of the Navy requests Congress for funds

[Washington] According to the annual report submitted by Secretary of the Navy Swanson, the United States is not building warships as quickly as Britain, but it is still the world's second-largest naval power, with a total of 325 warships, totaling 1,083,330 tons. Among them, only 113 vessels, totaling 869,398 tons, have not reached the end of their service life. Britain has a total of 285 warships, totaling 1,260,398 tons, of which 181 vessels, totaling 1,042,000 tons, have not reached the end of their service life. Japan has a total of 200 warships, totaling 745,694 tons, of which 171 vessels, totaling 708,158 tons, have not reached the end of their service life. In light of this situation, Secretary of the Navy Swanson plans to request Congress to allocate funds to build two battleships to replace old ships that have reached the end of their service life. He also wants to add first-class cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. The United States does not intend to accelerate its shipbuilding efforts, but this would be reconsidered in "unavoidable circumstances." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 19th)

Johnson is the fifth person to be commissioned to form a cabinet since Janson resigned on October 25.

### Enemy Ships Return to Yuhuan and Toumen to Bombard

Artillery fire can be heard in the urban area.

Taizhou Correspondence. On the afternoon of the ninth, at 2:00 PM, four enemy ships suddenly arrived off the coast of Toumen Town, Yuhuan County, firing more than ten shells at the shore. The Yuhuan urban area and nearby areas could clearly hear the artillery fire. However, our defenses are tight. At about 5:00 PM, the enemy ships began to sail in other directions. Also, at 8:30 AM on the morning of the tenth, nine enemy bombers were spotted over Wenling, flying from the Yuhuan sea towards the northeast.

### Enemy Planes Repeatedly Attack Xia Bengbu, Still Reported Safe and Peaceful

Shops Gradually Reopening for Business, Citizens Calm, Stable and Unchanged

Bengbu Correspondence. Since the enemy planes have bombed Bengbu three times, the citizens have become accustomed to it, remaining calm as usual. Most of the stores on the major bustling streets, such as Dama Road, Erma Road, and Jingyi Road, have reopened for business. It is reported that some of those that have not yet reopened have done so because their employees have returned to their hometowns, which is indeed difficult to overcome. The police department has been dispatching personnel to persuade them separately, so it is expected that they will gradually return to normal. However, in the evenings, because there are fewer electric lights and citizens do not go out much, the bustling scene is no longer like before. Movie theaters have difficulty showing films as usual, and there are few viewers. Theaters have all announced that they are closed. The singers in the music halls have mostly migrated elsewhere to find other places to settle down.

During the curfew imposed on the night after the third enemy air raid, military police arrested four traitors disguised as beggars: Wang Xiaosuo, Wang San, Wang Kunshan, and Xia Anmin. They were taken to the battalion headquarters for questioning. They all confessed that they had been instigated by others to act as traitors in Bengbu, spying on military intelligence without denial. Xia Anmin (from Yangzhou, addicted to opium) even confessed that he received a subsidy of 30 yuan per month from the enemy, and a Kangxi copper coin was found as evidence of his role in espionage. The three traitors surnamed Wang were sent to the capital for disposal, while Xia Anmin was sent by the military police to the Xuzhou-Haizhou Garrison Command in Tongshan for legal processing on the afternoon of the ninth.

Enemy Soldiers Burn Our Merchant Ships

Li Changshun's sailing vessel from Yancheng, carrying goods northward from Shanghai a month ago, was anchored next to Grandma Mountain outside the lower harbor of Qingkou, Ganyu County. Unexpectedly, at about 5:00 AM on the morning of the ninth of this month, 12 enemy sailors from an enemy ship off the coast of Lianyungang approached the ship in a small motorboat. They drove the twelve crew members away. The enemy soldiers then poured more than 500 barrels of raw oil loaded on the ship onto the hull and set the ship on fire. The crew members have reported the truth to the local garrison.

Crackdown on Reactionary Organizations

Zhong Biqian, the district chief of the fifth district of Shuyang County, previously captured a member of the Big Heaven Society, Ji Hanling, in Tangjian in that district. Subsequently, according to his confession, he captured Zhang Zhucheng and other accomplices of the same name in Huanan Township in that district. They have been sent to the county government for interrogation. According to investigation, the Big Heaven Society is a disguised organization of the Sage and Virtue Dao, and its function is still to incite ignorant people and plot illegal activities.

### Adverse Weather on the Zhejiang Sea Delays Delivery of Tribute Rice to Shanghai

First Batch Expected to Arrive in Port Today or Tomorrow, Sale Price Set at 8.5 Fen per Shanghai Sheng

After the Shanghai Municipal Council and the China Southern Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase Saigon rice to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents, the first batch of 25,000 bags, loaded on the Jia Ying, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The Chinese government specially approved tax-free imports. Rice merchants began to complete payment and rice distribution procedures yesterday. The details are as follows:

Jia Ying Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today

The Saigon rice purchased by the Municipal Council in cooperation with the China Southern Rice Industry Company totals 115,000 bags, each weighing 220 pounds, totaling 198 Shanghai Jin, equivalent to 1 Shi and 2.5 Dou. It has been loaded onto foreign ships and set sail for Shanghai, designated exclusively for maintaining the food supply for Shanghai residents. The first batch of 25,000 bags, loaded on the Jia Ying, a ship of the British Taikoo Steamship Company, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (21st), unloading at the Jinliyuan Wharf. However, due to the adverse weather on the Zhejiang sea yesterday, it may be delayed until tomorrow morning (22nd). The second, third, and fourth batches of 30,000 bags each will be completely delivered by the end of this month.

The Chinese Government Grants Tax Exemption

Yesterday, sources in the grain industry revealed that the purpose of the China Southern Rice Industry Company's cooperation with the Municipal Council to purchase foreign rice is to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents. The money earned will be used for refugee relief. Therefore, the Chinese government has specially approved tax-free imports. As for the distribution method of the first batch of 25,000 bags of foreign rice, 10,000 bags will be allocated to member rice shops of the Rice Merchants Association for retail sales, and 5,000 bags will be allocated to relief organizations for refugee relief. Today, the Rice Merchants Association stipulated that 300 businesses in the Public Concession and 200 businesses in the French Concession will handle retail sales, with each business receiving 40 bags. The price for retail sales is 8.5 fen per Shanghai Jin, and each person is limited to purchasing 1 yuan's worth.

Association Announces Rice Collection Procedures

The Rice Merchants Association issued a notice yesterday regarding the procedures for member rice shops to collect rice, as follows: (1) Payment date: Starting from Saturday, November 20, until Sunday, November 21; (2) Payment location: Bank of China, 276 Sichuan Road; (3) After the rice payment is completed, the bank will issue a delivery order. Please pay attention to whether the rice payment and delivery order are consistent, and consult with the Bank of China. Although today is a Sunday, which is normally closed, the Bank of China will be open as usual to facilitate payment for rice.

Price of Tribute Rice for Rice Shops

The Rice Merchants Association stipulates the price for member rice shops to collect tribute rice: For the first batch of 20,000 bags, (1) Delivered at the wharf: 16.15 yuan per bag of national currency; (2) Delivered at the warehouse: 16.45 yuan per bag of national currency, plus an additional 0.25 yuan per bag for external fees. Previously, the price for collecting rice stored by the Municipal Council was approximately 17.34 yuan per bag of national currency. This price is slightly lower, so the retail price has also been reduced from 9 fen to 8.5 fen per Shanghai Jin.

500 Rice Shops Undertake Retail Sales

The distribution method for the first batch of Saigon rice arriving in Shanghai has been decided as follows: 20,000 bags will be retailed by member rice shops of the Rice Merchants Association, and 5,000 bags will be used by relief organizations to maintain the food supply for refugees. Currently, 300 companies in the Public Concession, including Deng Rentai, and 200 companies in the French Concession, including Baohe, have started paying at the Bank of China yesterday based on the rice collection certificates issued by the association. Each company can collect 40 bags of rice, and each company will distribute 4 bags per day. The selling price is based on the agreement of the association, at 8.5 fen per Shanghai Jin, and each person is limited to purchasing 1 yuan's worth. It is reported that in the future, all 1,500 rice shops in the city will sell at the market price stipulated by the authorities of the two concessions, with each Shanghai Sheng set at 8.5 fen. There are also plans to lower the price of rice in the future, so that the food supply for the people will be abundant and worry-free.

Strictly Prevent Rice Shops from Hoarding and Speculating

After the rice supply in Shanghai once became insufficient, all parties paid close attention to the matter, as it concerned the food supply for the people. Everyone suspected that some rice shops had hoarded a large amount of rice to sell at a higher price. Therefore, the concession authorities attached great importance to this issue. The French Concession, in particular, dispatched several Chinese and Western detectives every day to search the rice shops within the concession. The police are now seriously preventing rice merchants from hoarding. If a shipment of 5 Dou of rice is discovered on the road, the source will be thoroughly investigated. If it is found that there is private selling, severe punishment will be imposed.

Investigating Population to Distribute Food

The French Concession authorities, in order to ensure the food supply for the Chinese constables of each police station, specially printed forms to investigate the population of the constables' families, preparing to distribute food. It is stipulated that only wives and children are entitled to this right. Parents, brothers, and sisters are not eligible.

French Authorities Also Purchase Foreign Rice

In addition to dispatching Chinese detectives to investigate the amount of rice stored in various rice shops within the concession and strictly prohibiting hoarding, the French Concession authorities, in order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents, have also ordered a large amount of foreign rice from French Indochina to be shipped to Shanghai. Also, before our army withdrew, rice ships carrying a total of about 20,000 Shi of rice arrived in Shanghai from Jiangsu and Zhejiang and were anchored in Nanshi. After our army withdrew, they could not unload the cargo. Now, the French authorities and Father Jacquinot, at the request of various rice industry groups, have negotiated with the Japanese side to release the ships.

### 鎭海要塞封鎖期間德平定期開甬

The Fortress Command Reluctantly Makes Exceptions, Scheduled to Set Sail for Ningbo on the 24th

Since the Zhenhai Fortress Command prohibited navigation for all Ningbo-bound liners from various foreign companies operating in this port starting on the 17th, the Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing was the first to suspend service and reroute to Wenzhou. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's (華義公司) De Ping had already sold tickets, and many passengers had boarded. The company repeatedly requested permission from the Zhenhai authorities to operate one more trip, but the request was denied, and the ship has been docked in Shanghai for four days. The company sent personnel to the ship to refund tickets to passengers, but the passengers were unwilling to disembark and unanimously expressed their willingness to wait on board until the ship could depart for Ningbo. Yesterday, the company telegraphed Ningbo again, requesting the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to consult with the Fortress Command to see if an exception could be made to allow the De Ping to transport the Ningbo refugees who had already boarded back to their hometowns, so as to avoid leaving the refugees stranded in Shanghai. By the afternoon, the company had received a reply telegram from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, stating that they had conveyed the request to the commander of the Zhenhai Fortress, and Commander Wang indicated that he was inclined to agree to make an exception once more, but the date could not be determined. They would await notification to the Chamber before telegraphing Shanghai again to order departure for Ningbo. Therefore, the De Ping had already completed the export customs clearance procedures for departure to Ningbo yesterday and informed all passengers on board to wait for the departure date. If it could sail on Monday (i.e., tomorrow), that would be best, but if not, it would definitely depart for Ningbo on Wednesday. According to another source, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been ordered to suspend service due to our military authorities' blockade of the Zhenhai sea entrance, prohibiting ships from entering and exiting. Taikoo's Xin Beijing has already rerouted to Wenzhou, and the China Merchants' En De is also determined to reroute to Tongzhou. However, because tickets for the De Ping have already been sold and many passengers have boarded and are waiting to depart, unwilling to refund their tickets, the company telegraphed the Ningbo Fortress Command again to request an exception. It is now learned that permission has been granted for the ship to sail to Ningbo on the 24th, and all purchased tickets will be valid. However, it will first sail to Tongzhou this morning, so ticket sales have already begun yesterday. Grand cabin is 15 yuan, official cabin is 8 yuan, room cabin is 5 yuan, grand economy is 3 yuan and 5 jiao, small economy is 1 yuan and 3 jiao, and deck berth is 4 yuan. As for the Shanghai-Ningbo tickets sold previously, passengers can reclaim the original price from the company. The China Merchants Company posted a notice at the entrance yesterday, stating that the De Ping has received a telegram from Ningbo, granting permission to sail to Ningbo next Wednesday (i.e., the 24th). Passengers are requested to board the ship next Wednesday. Purchased tickets will remain valid. Those who do not wish to go may return their tickets for a refund. Special notice. The reason for not transferring via Zhoushan for Shanghai-Ningbo traffic is that, if not passing through Zhenhai, the ship could sail directly to Chuanshan and reach Ningbo via the Ningchuan Highway. However, ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, such as Taikoo's Xin Beijing, China Merchants' En De, and De Ping, have too deep a draft and can only sail to Dinghai, not directly to Chuanshan. Therefore, a small ferry would be required to continue the journey from Dinghai to Chuanshan, causing much inconvenience to passengers. This is also the reason why China Merchants has temporarily abandoned operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route.

### 世界航輪陸續來滬

World Liners Continue to Arrive in Shanghai

With the Shift of War to the West, the Tense Situation in Shanghai Gradually Eases; British Taikoo Blue Funnel Line's first world liner, Glengarry, entered and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying passengers and cargo. It is also reported that a second world liner, Sapredon, will arrive in Shanghai on the 24th, and a third liner, Dencalion, will enter port on the 26th. The cargo manifests have arrived in Shanghai in advance, with extremely small quantities, both liners carrying less than one hundred tons, a huge difference compared to the usual two to three thousand tons per trip. It can be seen that Sino-foreign trade has been greatly affected by the war, causing a sharp decline.

### 連日大潮浦水上陸

Successive Days of High Tide, River Water Floods Ashore

Low-Lying Areas Become Waterlogged

For the past few days, the port has experienced high tides. Low-lying areas in the Chinese and foreign concessions have become waterlogged. Yesterday was especially severe. From around 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., along the Bund area of the Huangpu River in the foreign concession, water flooded ashore. The area south of the Customs pier, being lower in elevation, was particularly affected, with water depths reaching one foot. Due to the strong northeast wind, the Huangpu River and the floodwaters merged, creating huge waves and almost turning the area into a vast expanse of water. Other areas, such as Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, Four-Ma Road (i.e., Fuzhou Road), the Daxin Street intersection, the entrances of the Sincere and Wing On department stores on Nanjing Road, and the section leading to the Small Garden, experienced knee-deep water. Sewage drains overflowed with tidal water, as if subterranean dragons were irrepressibly rising. In the French Concession, the vegetable market street, east and west Zilaihuo Street, and other areas also experienced severe flooding, no less than in the Public Concession. In Zhabei, north of the Suzhou Creek, from Tianhougong Bridge westward, along the river through Pentang Lane Bridge, Laozha Bridge, Old Garbage Bridge, to New Garbage Bridge, the lowest points had water depths of no less than three feet. As a result, shops, businesses, and residents in the area were living in water. North Zhejiang Road, Haining Road, and other low-lying areas also had standing water, knee-deep in some places and ankle-deep in others. South of the First Special District Court, a large open area was flooded, creating a channel. The wasteland behind the Bank of Communications warehouse and along the river on Guangfu Road, west of New Garbage Bridge, were also merged with the Suzhou Creek. The New Zha Bridge ferry crossing, through the Sampan Factory, New Bridge, to Tanzikou, was also flooded. This high tide was truly unprecedented in recent years.

### 美敎士規戒藍金

American Missionary Reprimands Rankin

Do Not Make Critical and Absurd Remarks, Assist China in Times of Urgent Difficulty

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many foreigners have righteously expressed fair opinions in Western newspapers. However, there are also those who are narrow-minded and take advantage of the situation to criticize the Chinese authorities. For example, an American missionary named Rankin recently sent a letter to the North-China Daily News, taking issue with the Chinese government's rejection of registration for church schools, and making bizarre remarks criticizing China, involving the Sino-Japanese War. Yesterday, the newspaper published a letter from another American missionary, reprimanding Rankin, showing that justice is in people's hearts and that the biased views of one or two individuals will not escape public criticism. The letter stated: "The letter from Mr. Rankin published in your newspaper on November 16, regarding the Chinese government's attitude towards Christian schools, has attracted my attention. I am also a missionary, and I do not wish to endorse everything stated by this gentleman. If my information is correct, he must be an isolated missionary who is merely self-promoting. I belong to a church with hundreds of missionaries and am an officer of an organization related to more than 500 missionaries. The vast majority of these missionaries do not agree with Rankin's remarks and are as sincere as I am. I cannot help but feel that it is absurd to raise such issues at this time by those who consider themselves friends of China. I sincerely hope that our friends of China will believe that the vast majority of missionaries do not hold the same attitude as Mr. Rankin and will do their utmost to assist China in its time of urgent difficulty."

### 內地交通梗阻滬通航運擁擠

Inland Transportation Disrupted, Shanghai-Tongzhou Shipping Overcrowded

Jiangsu Routes the Only Throughway, Foreign Vessels Operate Extra Sailings

After the transformation of the Shanghai battle situation, land and inland waterways transportation between Shanghai and the interior regions was disrupted. Inland residents remaining in Shanghai who wished to leave and return to their hometowns found it particularly inconvenient. All routes of transportation depended on foreign shipping companies to maintain operations. Consequently, foreign ships sailing from Shanghai have been fully loaded with passengers in recent days. The Shanghai-Tongzhou route is especially congested, as residents along the Shanghai-Nanjing line are returning to their hometowns by taking ships from Shanghai to Nantongzhou, then crossing to Zhenjiang or Nanjing, and then traveling to their respective destinations. Therefore, all passenger and cargo transportation on Taikoo's Xin Beijing, China Merchants' En De, and other ships is abnormally congested.

Another report states that, since the tense situation in Shanghai disrupted land transportation, the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Tongzhou routes have become the only important transportation routes. Now that the Shanghai-Ningbo route has also been ordered to temporarily suspend service, the passenger and cargo volume on the Shanghai-Tongzhou route has suddenly increased. In addition to the British Taikoo's Wuhu and Wuxue, and Jardine Matheson's Pinghe and Tonghe, the Italian China Merchants' De Ping has also joined the operation of this route.

### 海關行政保持現狀

Customs Administration Remains Unchanged

According to Reliable Reuters News, the Japanese Side Will Not Take Further Action

Reuters, Shanghai, 20th: Reuters has learned from reliable sources that the Japanese side will not take further action to disrupt China's customs administration. It is noted that the Chinese Customs anti-smuggling fleet in Shanghai, as well as a dredger from the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, have recently been intercepted by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. However, given the international nature of Chinese Customs and the wide scope of customs duties as collateral for the Boxer Indemnity and foreign debt, the Japanese authorities' actions are of great concern in several respects. However, there is also a belief that the Japanese actions are purely temporary or will not take further actions to disrupt this important institution, nor will they divert the revenue guaranteeing the repayment of foreign debt for other purposes. The Shanghai Whangpoo Conservancy Board is also an institution governed by the international agreements of 1905 and 1912. The Board's function is to maintain the channel of the Huangpu River, which is of great importance to the convenience of ships of all countries, and Japan is also a signatory to the aforementioned international agreements.

### 恢復遠東航綫大來正加考慮

Dollar Line Actively Considering Restoring Far East Routes

American Importers and Exporters Unanimously Request, Transportation Can Be Restored in the Short Term

After the Shanghai battle, the Dollar Line Steamship Company's Far East routes were temporarily suspended to avoid danger, causing American goods to be unable to be transported to China and Chinese products unable to be exported, greatly affecting American importers and exporters. According to statistics, the losses suffered by American businesses in these three months are difficult to quantify in detail. Now that the Shanghai battle has shifted inward, the danger in Shanghai has decreased, and insurance premiums have also been greatly reduced. Therefore, American businesses have requested the company to restore the Shanghai route to resume transportation. It is reported that the company is already considering it and it is expected to be implemented soon. It is reported that our country's famous products, such as tung oil, are most popular among American manufacturers, and the American side has repeatedly telegraphed Shanghai requesting shipment.

Now, in view of the gradual restoration of order in Shanghai, it has decided to plan the reopening of the Pudong factory. Approximately one thousand male workers from the machine, coppersmith, and printing departments have been assigned to enter the factory at 6 a.m. every morning via a special ship from Puxi to the factory pier in Pudong to prepare everything. They return to Puxi on the same ship at 5 p.m. The workers wear the company's prescribed yellow uniform. The factory will officially reopen after the preparations are completed. The factory employs approximately four thousand male and female workers, and its products include cigarettes of the brands "Great Britain", "Old Knife", "Sky Bridge", "Fairy", and "Front Gate".

Commentary

### 英美互惠商約談判

Anglo-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement Negotiations — Appropriate

The initial contact between the United Kingdom and the United States to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement has been quite successful. According to statements made recently by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and US Secretary of State Hull, formal negotiations will begin soon. Furthermore, the governments of Canada and Australia have respectively indicated that the British dominions will also negotiate trade agreements with the United States. The United Kingdom and the United States, as two major democracies, have always held a leading position in the world economy. At a time when the world is threatened by war, consolidating the economic ties between the two major countries can also lay the foundation for political cooperation. As the New York Times rightly said, this event will undoubtedly have a stabilizing influence on the situation everywhere in the world.

Now, let's examine the possible impact on the Far East. The United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have traditionally formed a three-way balance of power in the Far East market. The fundamental motive behind Japan's recent acts of aggression is to seize the markets of the United Kingdom and the United States, in addition to destroying China's emerging national industries. However, Japan's economic structure is inherently unsound and has been burdened by the heavy weight of aggressive warfare, which will only lead to economic collapse. Japan's attempt to achieve economic goals through military means is ultimately a delusion. Currently, the United Kingdom and the United States seem unable to effectively stop Japan's aggressive warfare. In fact, the arms race between the United Kingdom and the United States against Japan is gradually intensifying. The current move by the United Kingdom and the United States to unite their economic forces through the conclusion of a reciprocal trade agreement has profound implications for the political situation in the Far East. This is because economics, politics, and military affairs are a trinity, interconnected. Japanese newspapers commented on the Anglo-American trade agreement as an action by the democratic bloc to counter the countries that have concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact. This shows that militaristic Japan is indeed feeling considerable pressure.

### 南市難民區組織漸具體化

The Organization of the Nanshi Refugee Zone Becomes More Concrete

Food Shortage is Again Felt, Medical Needs are Urgent, Father Jacquinot's Views on the Refugee Zone

Since Father Jacquinot of the International Relief Committee has been making great efforts to maintain the Nanshi Refugee Zone, the situation has become increasingly well-organized. The coal and salt transportation problem has also been negotiated, and they can be directly delivered into the zone. Currently, in order to intensify the work and make it more concrete, the various staff members of the refugee zone have been assigned, as follows:

Estimated Staff

① Office in the Zone: Director Pan Zhijie, Clerks Jiang Zhiqing, Xu Hongkang, Lu Deshen, Cao Xiangshen; ② Food Distribution: Pan Shousheng, Yang Yanjun, Lu Zhiqian, Wei Qingyan, Lu Bingxiang, Jiang Chuibing; ③ Management of Refugee Children: Chen Tiesheng, Zhao Jian, Xu Zuotong, of the Catholic Orphanage; ④ Transportation: Lu Longqi; ⑤ Supervision and Cleaning: Feng Yangshan, Zhang Xianqing, Qi Bingzhang, Mu Jialiang; ⑥ Hospital and Medical Care: The Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Red Cross Society will be responsible.

Donations Received

In addition, the association received donations in the past two days as follows: The Wang brothers, Wang Yilin, Wang Yiji, Wang Yipeng, Wang Yijun, donated three yuan each; Wang Zhaozhang, one yuan; Employees of the China Soap Company, forty-one yuan; Xia Dajin, three yuan; Pan Liping, Miao Ruifang, Pan Jinlin, three yuan each; Luo Ruihong, one yuan. In addition, the Rotary Club is voluntarily responsible for providing food for 1,000 refugees daily at the No. 4 shelter on Xiaoshadu Road, with a temporary limit of two months, and will continue to take responsibility afterward, having already recognized 3,000 yuan.

Food Depleted

According to news from the International Relief Committee, although the food for the Nanshi Refugee Zone has been maintained for the past few days thanks to the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life, the remaining food has been depleted due to the large population. Recent donations have been very few, causing difficulties in providing food for the refugees. In addition to actively finding ways to purchase large quantities of food for assistance, the association also hopes that enthusiastic people will continue to donate to save the disaster victims.

Pitiable Deaths from Illness

Many refugees in the refugee zone are suffering from illness due to the recent bad weather. Furthermore, the lack of doctors in the zone often leads to deaths. The Red Swastika Society has set up a mortuary in the zone to collect the remains of deceased refugees. It is estimated that approximately nine refugees die each day. The Red Swastika Society is responsible for providing coffins and burial.

Medical Issues

The Shanghai Times reports that a hospital has been established in the Nanshi security zone yesterday. A wealthy Chinese man has generously lent a large residence for this purpose. The sick and wounded in the zone are being cared for by French Daughters of Charity and Chinese nurses. Chinese and foreign doctors are also providing daily consultations. There are currently not many beds in the hospital, but they will be increased at any time. It is hoped that two more hospitals will be established in the zone in the next few days. The difficulty lies in the supply of medicines, but it is expected that philanthropists will come forward. Vaccination of the refugees will begin soon to prevent the outbreak of epidemics. Currently, seven or eight corpses are being abandoned on the streets every day. There are also daily deaths in the refugee shelters. The Chinese Medical Association is also providing medical care to the refugees, providing much assistance. It is expected that the medical work will be ready in a few days.

Categorized Budget

The budget for the zone is now divided into four categories: ① Hospitals and medical supplies, ② Cotton clothing, ③ Food, ④ Miscellaneous. The last category includes efforts to expand the refugee zone to the south of Nanshi. All garbage is being incinerated to ensure the cleanliness of the streets. The committee has inspected vacant houses along Minquan Road to accommodate additional refugees. Yesterday, another 4,000 refugees arrived in the zone from Pudong. A total of 150,000 pancakes and steamed buns were distributed to the refugees yesterday. When the refugee zone was first established, it was limited to 30,000, but since its establishment, the number of people has increased daily. It is currently still able to cope, but the nutritional content of the food is still insufficient. Six ships are currently loaded with rice from Vietnam to Shanghai, which will arrive within days, so a hot meal can be provided to the refugees. The committee is in great need of soybeans to prevent beriberi among the refugees. According to Father Jacquinot's remarks to a reporter yesterday, the Nanshi refugee zone can serve as a model for Europe in the event of future wars. A place can be designated to settle the poor non-combatants. Specially trained groups from neutral countries should then rescue the civilians of the warring countries.

### 亞洲旅館昨晚盜刧

Robbery at the Asia Hotel Last Night

One Robber Killed on the Spot, Two Injured by Stray Bullets

Wu Zhenghua, the owner of the Tailong rice shop in Yangjiadu, Pudong, has some assets. Recently, due to the fall of Pudong, Wu and his family rented room 237 in the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, attracting the attention of thieves. At 6:30 p.m. yesterday, several thugs suddenly broke into Wu's room, threatening and intimidating, ransacking boxes and cabinets. They robbed him of 285 yuan in national currency and five savings passbooks before escaping with their loot. Wu, together with the hotel staff, followed and pursued them. As the robbers stepped out of the main gate, they fled towards Henan Road. The owner reported the incident to the police station of the Public Concession, who then chased after them, blowing their whistles frantically. One robber fled into Jinlong Street, turned south onto Shandong Road, and then to Guangdong Road, where nearby police officers gathered after hearing the alarm. They opened fire on the robber, hitting him in a vital spot, killing him instantly. During the hail of bullets, two people were injured by stray bullets. One, Ah Rong, the doorman of Fuxing Garden on Wuma Road, was shot in the waist and was seriously injured. The other, Yang Jiequan (from Wuxi, 20 years old), was injured in the left ear, with the bullet passing through. It is reported that Yang is a refugee from the Yiyuan Shelter. The robber who was killed was transported to the morgue by Chinese police officer No. 2728 from the Old Zha police station for examination. The injured were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### 牛惠霖醫師逝世

Dr. Niu Huilin Passes Away

Liver Disease Aggravated by Worries about National Crisis, Untreatable, Encoffining at 2:00 PM Tomorrow, Funeral at 3:00 PM

Dr. Niu Huilin, a famous doctor, had contracted liver disease due to overwork. He had been unable to practice medicine for several months. The death of his younger brother, Dr. Niu Huisheng, caused him further grief and worsened his illness. With the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, Niu was treated at the Jiaxing Gospel Hospital. He was then escorted to Shanghai by five famous American doctors. After ascites was drained from his abdomen, his condition improved slightly. However, concerned about the severely wounded soldiers and major surgeries, he still directed relief efforts from his sickbed from time to time. He was particularly concerned about Madam Chiang's car accident and injuries on her way to Shanghai. Overwork then caused his illness to turn for the worse. As our troops retreated to the second line of defense, his family did not dare to inform him. Unexpectedly, he learned of the intense military situation in Suzhou and Jiaxing last night, and his illness suddenly worsened due to worry and grief. He passed away suddenly at 7:00 a.m. this morning at his home on Jing'an Temple Road. His wife and sons were by his side, in great sorrow. On the orders of Madam Ni, a funeral service will be held at his home at 2:00 p.m. on the 22nd, followed by a funeral procession at 3:00 p.m., temporarily placed in the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, awaiting selection of a date for burial in the Universal Cemetery. Yesterday, Generalissimo Chiang and his wife, and Director Kong and his wife, sent condolences to Shanghai.

Brief Biography of Niu

Dr. Niu Huilin was 49 years old and from Shanghai. After graduating from St. John's University at a young age, he studied at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School in London, England, where he obtained a medical doctorate. From 1913 to 1914, he served as the Director of Outpatient Clinics for Internal Medicine, External Medicine, and Otorhinolaryngology at the London Hospital in England. From 1914 to 1916, during the height of World War I, he served as the Director of Severely Wounded Soldiers at the Ipswich Hospital in England. From 1916 to 1918, he transferred to the Metropolitan Hospital in London as the Director of Surgery for Severely Wounded Soldiers. In 1918, his father passed away, and he resigned and returned to China. In that same year, he served as the Vice President and Director of Surgery at Renji Hospital in Shanghai until he resigned in 1934, when he became a surgical consultant at the hospital. From 1922 to 1927, the Chinese Red Cross Society Headquarters appointed him as the President of the Seager Road Red Cross General Hospital and as the President of the Red Cross Epidemic Hospital. During the Lincheng train robbery, the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan, and the disastrous impact on overseas Chinese, and the Qi-Lu War, Dr. Niu personally led the relief team as the commander-in-chief, along with doctors Jiao Xisheng and Fang Juying, to provide treatment. From 1922 to 1926, he also served concurrently as the President of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road. Starting in 1920, at the request of patients, he established Lin Sheng Hospital on Qiqi Road, and set up clinics at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Avenue Foch, until the present. During the January 28th Incident, he served as the President of the First Hospital for the Wounded Soldiers of the Shanghai Local Council, the Surgical Consultant for the Severely Wounded at the Red Cross 42nd Wounded Soldiers Hospital, and the Medical Officer of the Chinese Squad of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, holding this position since 1922. For more than ten years, he also served as a professor of surgery at St. John's University in Shanghai. The Central Government also appointed him as a medical consultant to the Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Railways, the Department of Health, and the Central Hospital. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters also appointed him as a medical consultant. He served as the President of the Chinese Medical Association for two consecutive terms. During his lifetime, he established numerous hospitals and medical schools. His abdominal surgeries were especially well-renowned. The former Governor of Hong Kong's wife, suffering from an abdominal tumor, telegraphed for a famous surgeon from London to perform the operation, but then telegraphed again, stating that his surgical skills were not as good as Dr. Niu's, so she chartered an airplane to bring Dr. Niu to Hong Kong. She recovered quickly after the surgery. His fame is known worldwide.
