### Minister of Finance Kong Elaborates on China's National Debt Policy

Willing to Borrow Foreign Loans at Low Interest Rates to Consolidate Domestic Debt; Construction Projects Welcome Cooperation from Friendly Nations

[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, today received an interviewer from the "German General Report" and issued an important statement on China's foreign debt policy. Minister Kong first pointed out that all countries should undoubtedly recognize the great work accomplished by the Chinese government, the Kuomintang, and the people of the entire country. He can use this trip to reassure friendly nations about this fact and takes pride in it. He then stated that the Chinese people are now arranging everything within the country and welcome help and cooperation from all other countries to jointly seek the construction of a "New China" in friendly competition. Minister Kong then elaborated on China's foreign debt policy, pointing out that the current situation in the international capital market is extremely conducive to issuing loans, and China's economic development is suitable for foreign capital investment, with the government's customs revenue as the supreme guarantee. This year's customs revenue will be at least 450,000,000 silver dollars or more, while the foreign debt guarantee is only 100,000,000 silver dollars, and the domestic debt is no more than 200,000,000 silver dollars, so there is still 150,000,000 yuan available as a loan guarantee.

Secondly, Minister Kong solemnly stated that the purpose of China raising foreign debt is not for building railways or starting industries, but is limited to accepting long-term loans for the purchase of materials. If it is to stabilize China's currency, then China can do without foreign capital, but it is not easy to seek a reasonable investment that also keeps the domestic currency balanced. Minister Kong then mentioned the success of issuing domestic public bonds in recent years and stated that the Chinese government should continue to work along the previous path to establish a railway system and industries, and strive for complete self-development without using debt. Minister Kong then stated, "China is prepared to accept low-interest foreign loans to change its high-interest domestic debt. According to the current situation of the financial and capital market, there is obviously an opportunity to do so." China currently has about 20,000,000,000 yuan of domestic debt, with an interest rate of six percent per week. However, due to the low selling price, the interest can reach eight percent. If foreign debt can be borrowed at four percent per week, the government will save 80,000,000 yuan in interest each year, which can be used to revitalize industry. Minister Kong finally pointed out the unity of China, the establishment of transportation networks and industries, the increase in foreign trade, and the military success in suppressing the Communists, saying that the areas occupied by the Communist Party are extremely small. Finally, Minister Kong solemnly declared, "The Chinese government's foreign policy can be summed up in one sentence, that is, it is willing to cooperate peacefully with all nations in the world that hold the same policies and principles."

### China's Construction

Progress in Both Spiritual and Material Aspects; French Newspaper Praises Chiang's Continued Contributions

[Paris] The newspaper "Le Temps" recently published a dispatch from Nanjing by the famous reporter De Boschke, detailing China's progress in recent years. He wrote, "In general, China's material progress is indeed thriving, and the progress of transportation and the development of the highway network are particularly obvious. Moreover, thanks to the development of transportation, the progress of major cities has gradually spread to inland towns and villages. Various other construction projects are also actively underway. In addition to material construction, there is also the 'New Life Movement' dedicated to spiritual construction. General Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan of China, is its chief initiator. We only need to read Mr. Chiang's published speeches and the new creeds put forward by the New Life Movement to know that its purpose is to establish a kind of socialism with Christian characteristics. This can be gradually implemented under Mr. Chiang's planning. It can be seen that China will rely heavily on Mr. Chiang's leadership in the future."

### De Wang Convenes a Meeting of Bandit and Puppet Leaders in Jiabusi Temple

Decided to Reduce the Scope of the Puppet Inner Mongolia Military Government; A Certain Party Sets Up a Disguised Espionage Agency in Northern Chahar

[Beiping] The puppet Inner Mongolia Military Government led by De Wang was previously criticized for its poor performance. The puppet government's original budget was 500,000 yuan per month, including 400,000 yuan for military expenses and 100,000 yuan for political expenses.

### Zou Minchu, a Guangdong Provincial Committee Member, Is Dismissed and Investigated for Manipulating Finance

An Official Who Actually Engaged in Private Speculation; Escorted to Nanjing by the Security Office

[Guangzhou] In early May, rumors about the Guangdong provincial currency system were rife. The Guangdong silver market reopened at this time, and speculators seized the opportunity to manipulate finance, causing extreme confusion in the market reports for a time. According to the orders of the Ministry of Finance, the provincial authorities immediately stopped futures trading. After a thorough investigation by President Chiang, it was found to be related to Zou Minchu, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee. It turned out that Zou had established the Hengji Bank in Guangdong, managed by his brother Zou Qingfu. Zou was also the chairman of the Guohua Bank and bought and sold futures in the name of Hengji and Guohua. After receiving the report, President Chiang believed that Zou, as an official, openly engaged in private speculation, which was extremely illegal. If he was not punished, how could officialdom be cleaned up? He immediately dismissed Zou from his post and telegraphed Guangdong to escort Zou to Nanjing for investigation and handling.

### Record of the National Handicraft Exhibition

— Our Reporter Mingxin

The National Handicraft Exhibition, jointly organized by the National Economic Construction Movement General Assembly and the Ministry of Industry, officially opened on May 20th at the Capital Art Exhibition Hall. A total of 23 provinces and cities participated, including remote provinces such as Gansu, Erdos, Yunnan, Chahar, and Ningxia, all exhibiting products. The total number of exhibits reached 27,484. Due to the inability to collect items from the four northeastern provinces, a small number of items found by the exhibition were displayed separately. The exhibition was scheduled for one month and was supposed to close on June 20th. As of the 13th, the number of visitors had reached over 60,000. Due to the location, tickets were required at a price of one dime, yet the daily number of visitors remained overwhelmingly crowded. This was because the exhibits were comprehensively collected and many were rarely seen on ordinary days, a dazzling array of beautiful objects, demonstrating the painstaking efforts of those who collected them. Our reporter, at the invitation of Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, went to Beijing to visit, accompanied by Mr. Xu Xin-yi, representative of the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, and Mr. Wang Ji-lin, representative of various member newspapers, and eight others. They took the overnight train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at 11 PM on the 12th and arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 13th. After a light breakfast, they telephoned the Ministry of Industry. Minister Wu assigned Wu Cheng-fu, secretary of the ministry, and Gu Yu-xuan, director of the Central Industrial Testing Institute of the ministry, to greet them with a car and accompany them to the Art Exhibition Hall on Guofu Road for a visit. They also provided explanations one by one, for which we are deeply grateful. The following is a brief record of what I saw and heard.

The venue borrowed the Art Exhibition Hall and a portion of the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. The Art Exhibition Hall, consisting of three floors, served as the main exhibition hall, with exhibits displayed in ten categories. Part of the second floor of the National Assembly Hall served as a comprehensive exhibition hall and a special exhibition hall. The comprehensive exhibition combined local specialties for display. Among the special exhibitions, the tea exhibition room was beautifully arranged, with harmonious lighting and even color schemes, which was quite rare. The exhibits collected from various units included 1,422 items from Hebei Province, 113 items from Suiyuan Province, 23 items from Ningxia, 461 items from Qingdao City, 37 items from Weihaiwei, 993 items from Jiangxi Province, 1,284 items from Shandong Province, 172 items from Chahar, 6,252 items from Shanghai City, 226 items from Shanxi Province, 3,383 items from Jiangsu Province, 887 items from Yunnan Province, 1,201 items from Nanjing City, 853 items from Anhui Province, 118 items from Henan Province, 1,169 items from Zhejiang Province, 322 items from Hunan Province, 1,677 items from Peiping City, 779 items from Fujian Province, 1,110 items from Tianjin City, 430 items from Sichuan Province, 4,400 items from Guangdong Province, and 700 items from Gansu Province.

The exhibits in the exhibition were primarily clothing, including all items for apparel. Due to the large number of items, only the essential ones are listed here, such as local cloth, printed cloth, lace, embroidery, thread brocade, and handmade clothing, hats, shoes, and leather goods, all comprehensively displayed. Among them, there were a Mieleng Buddha crown, a Ban brush Buddha attire, and a green flower hat, each extremely exquisite and eye-catching. The most valuable of the metallurgical products were Yunnan Wugang black steel, bronze, and spotted copperware, along with Fujian filigree silver ware, supplied for exhibition by Yunnan Gonghexiang, Baoyunxiang, Yunxinglong, and Fujian Yezhenfeng. It is understood that this spotted copper can be used directly for manufacturing after being mined, as its copper is pure and does not require further refining. There were also old-style hairpin bracelet copper molds and remaining pieces, which were also rare items. The second floor housed pottery, with participants from Anhui, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, and other provinces. Various ancient and contemporary utensils and figures included magnetic split porcelain, famille rose, fine details, mille-fleur gold ground, as well as Yixing pottery, Peiping glazed tiles, glass utensils, historical and modern weights and measures, paper materials, pigments, medicines, and more. Participants were all well-known units from various regions and categories. At the entrance was a model of the Temple of Heaven in Peiping, resplendent and dazzling. The entrance to the third floor featured a carved gilded screen. Next were lacquerware, coral, ancient and modern musical instruments, bamboo and wood handicrafts, ivory carvings, jade screens, gold lacquer screens, and Phoebe zhennan wood gilded ruyi scepters from Yangzhou, Fujian, and Pingyang, Zhejiang, known worldwide, along with Qingtian stone carvings. Ancient and modern printing techniques, writing brushes, ink stones, fans, lamps, embroidered screens, and other items were all famous and valuable exhibits. A section of the National Assembly Hall was dedicated to a special exhibition of national tea, with various red and green teas, as well as Oolong and pre-Qingming teas, tea bricks, flower teas, and more, all comprehensively displayed. All tea-producing areas across the country participated, and the walls were covered with comparative charts of China tea export quantities, maps of China tea export countries, and detailed maps of tea-producing regions. From the charts, it could be seen that after 1925, China tea had plummeted in the international market, and there was an urgent need to catch up. In addition, there was a tasting room, equipped by the China National Tea Corporation, where all participants could take a short break and enjoy free tea. Adjacent to the right side of the National Assembly Hall was a handicraft sales area, with about 300 vendors, specializing in various handicrafts and food items. Famous merchants from all over the country gathered, and prices were lower than usual, so it was crowded all day long, no less than the iron exhibition sales area.

In addition, in order to study various handicraft manufacturing methods and improve manufacturing processes, the exhibition selected major handicrafts and created 311 various models, which were displayed realistically and exquisitely. The creation of these models was greatly assisted by the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum. The various models are listed below, including a complete set of mule carts, three wheelbarrows, two types of human-powered waterwheels, one animal-powered waterwheel, one windmill waterwheel, a complete set of oil pressing models, a complete set of Shaoxing wine making models, a complete set of tofu making models, a complete set of iron smelting models, a complete set of textile works, a complete set of sugar making models, a complete set of paper making projects, a complete set of soy sauce brewing models, a complete set of porcelain industry models, a complete set of Yixing pottery industry models, a complete set of glazed tile works, a complete set of salt field models, ten sets of ship models, one set each of cattle and sheep skin rafts, two sets of large saddle carts and sedan chairs, one set of Taiping carts, one set of camel sedan chairs, one set of Jiawozi carts, one set of sleds, one set of ice beds, two sets of Zhou Dynasty chariots, one set of compass cars, one set of ancient mileage counting cars, various Chinese architectural models, and a complete set of glass manufacturing models. These models will serve as a reference for improving manufacturing methods, and many of the exhibits have already been purchased and can be taken away after the closing. One part has been negotiated by the Shanghai Municipal Government and will be transported to Shanghai for display during the 10th anniversary of the municipal government. All research and improvement work is said to be entrusted to Mr. Gu Yuxuan.

Although the Xingzhong Company is currently in a dilemma due to difficulties in increasing capital, it is still the only channel for Japanese investment in North China to avoid competition with other Japanese companies. It is reported that Yasukawa recently reached a three-point agreement with Sogawa Shinji, president of Xingzhong Company, namely: ㊀ All investment responsibilities in North China will still be handled by Xingzhong Company; ㊁ When Xingzhong Company needs funds, the East Asia Development Company should provide loans; ㊂ All mining, cotton planting, and silk weaving businesses that the East Asia Development Company has already started to operate should continue to be handled by the East Asia Development Company. Other businesses, although the East Asia Development Company has not started operating, but has concrete plans prepared to start, should also be undertaken by the East Asia Development Company.

### Tragedy Occurs During the Dragon Boat Race in Zhenjiang to Celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival

More than 30 People Fall into the Water, Six Bodies Recovered

[Zhenjiang] Today is the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival. A boat race was held here, with nearly 100,000 spectators along the riverbank. Due to the excessive number of people, the gangplank at the Zhenjiang-Tongzhou ferry pier broke, causing more than 30 people to fall into the water. At that time, the water patrol team's lifeboats rescued more than a dozen people and recovered the bodies of six children. The rest are still being searched for. (Special dispatch, 13th)

[Zhenjiang] On the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival, all stores in Zhenjiang closed in the afternoon. It was also a regular Sunday holiday, so the market was quite lively. Especially the dragon boat race, which had been banned for many years, was approved by the provincial police department at the request of the public. Therefore, despite the drizzling rain, the crowd watching the dragon boats by the river was still overwhelming. The police department sent two teams of police officers and water patrol teams to maintain order on the river and along the riverbank. After 3 PM, just as the dragon boat race was about to begin, the pontoon bridge built at the Zhengtong pier in front of the Jianghai Customs House suddenly broke due to the overcrowding of spectators. Spectators on the bridge fell into the water one after another. Despite emergency rescue efforts, by the time of the telegram, six drowned bodies had been recovered and more than a dozen people were injured. The search is still ongoing.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Military Treason Case in the Soviet Union

— Hua

The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union tried the treason case of eight generals, including Tukhachevsky, the day before yesterday. As the evidence of guilt was clear and all the defendants confessed, they were all sentenced to death. This event is another major case following the Zinoviev-Kamenev case last summer and the Radek case this spring, but its importance surpasses the former. According to the news from TASS yesterday, the defendants' crimes included "being employed by the military intelligence agency of a certain country that has unfriendly relations with the Soviet Union, systematically providing secret information to the military of that country, carrying out sabotage to weaken the power of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, preparing to defeat the Red Army when the Soviet Union is attacked, and deliberately assisting in the division of the Soviet Union and the restoration of the power of landlords and capitalists in the Soviet Union." These charges are, of course, more serious than the acts of treason of Zinoviev and Radek. Military treason is not only an extreme crime in the Soviet Union, but is also deserving of death in any other country.

However, in the eyes of countries around the world, such a major case will inevitably cause no small surprise, especially because the eight people who were sentenced this time were all high-ranking generals of the Soviet Red Army. The newspapers of Germany and Japan have taken this opportunity to issue arguments about the weakening of Soviet national defense capabilities, as if this incident is indeed quite unfavorable to the Soviet Union. However, with this possibility of being unfavorable, why did the Soviet authorities have no choice but to do this? This is indeed a topic worth studying for those of us who pay attention to international affairs. Therefore, I would like to make a brief objective analysis of this case based on my limited knowledge.

First. We feel that this case is not unrelated to the Soviet Union's foreign policy. According to the charges against Tukhachevsky and others, the first item mentioned that they were employed by the military intelligence agency of a certain country unfriendly to the Soviet Union, which is significant proof. Who is this so-called certain country? Everyone can understand it. According to the current international situation, Japan is less likely to attack the Soviet Union, while a certain European country poses a greater threat to the Soviet Union. Recent news from Polish newspapers says that German-Soviet relations seem to be returning to a state of rapprochement, especially because the German National Defense Force has always advocated alliance with Russia. However, this news was immediately denied by the Moscow authorities. Observing from the sidelines, we feel that this news has several functions. First, it should be deliberately released by the German side to alienate France and the Soviet Union. Second, it is said that Tukhachevsky has always had good relations with the German military. From this, we can infer that Tukhachevsky may have recently advocated being pro-German. However, Soviet policy is decided at the center, and the current Soviet policy towards Europe is to firmly maintain the French-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and pursue a path of peace. Due to errors in Tukhachevsky's understanding, he may have fallen prey to the enemy's provocation, and this error was enough to cause a treasonous act leading to his death.

Second. This case also shows the Soviet Union's characteristic of ruling the military through the Party. The military is guided by the Party, and the Party is based on the state's general policy. This policy can be revised at any time according to objective circumstances. In the past year or two, the Soviet Union, in view of the serious threat from aggressors, has worked hard to expand its military. During this period, there may have been relatively lenient guidance for military personnel. As a result, a few military personnel, due to errors in their political understanding or the pursuit of personal ambition, committed the great mistake of betraying the Party and selling out the country. The reform of the Soviet military district management system last month was the prelude to the centralization of military control. Following this, there was the demotion and transfer of Tukhachevsky and others, and the suicide of Gamarnik out of fear of punishment. This shows that the purging of the military through political power is proceeding step by step. Tukhachevsky and others could not avoid confessing their guilt and being punished due to their political mistakes and personal degeneration. However, during this period, the transfer of military personnel was carried out smoothly entirely under the direction of political command. This shows that the political fighting power of the Soviet army is indeed a unique feature.

Naturally, the most fundamental reason for this major Soviet case is still military treason. Patriots should be protected by national law, and traitors should be severely punished. This is the principle of any country, not just the Soviet Union. We should view the execution of Tukhachevsky and others in this way.

### U.S. Economic Committee to Discuss Abolishing the Silver Purchase Act

Submitting a Memorial to the Government Explaining the Reasons

[Washington] The Economic Committee submitted a memorial to the U.S. government today, advocating the abolition of the Silver Purchase Act, saying that there is no reason to continue purchasing silver at high prices to subsidize U.S. silver mines, which puts financial relations in a bind. Such legalized subsidy policies are not desirable, and they have a great impact on the stability of the national currency. (National Telegram, 13th)

### Execution by Firing Squad for Eight Soviet Traitors

Voroshilov Announces the Crimes, and Exhorts the Red Army to Be Loyal to the Country

[Moscow] Official sources have formally announced that eight high-ranking Red Army generals, including Tukhachevsky, Yakir, Uborevich, Kork, Eideman, Feldman, and Putna, have been sentenced to death by a military tribunal for treason against the state and the Red Army, and were executed by firing squad today. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)

[Moscow] Today, Defense Commissar Voroshilov issued a special order to the Red Army, announcing that the military leaders sentenced to death, including General Tukhachevsky, have all been executed by firing squad. He stated that the government and the Soviet Military Council held a special meeting from June 1st to June 4th, during which he presented a report on the treasonous, counter-revolutionary, military-fascist group organized by Tukhachevsky and others. The crimes committed by Tukhachevsky, as uncovered by the Internal Affairs Commissariat, include: 1. Selling intelligence to a certain fascist country; 2. Actively promoting anti-Soviet warfare; 3. Conspiring to obstruct the transportation of war supplies to the front lines during wartime; 4. Plotting to seize Soviet power and cede Ukraine to Germany. The order concludes by urging officers and soldiers to cultivate their conscience, be loyal to the army, and thereby compensate for the damage inflicted on the country by the traitors. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 13th)

[Moscow] Marshal Voroshilov, People's Commissar for Defense of the Soviet Union, issued a proclamation stating: "The Military Council of the People's Commissariat for Defense of the Soviet Union held a meeting from June 1st to 4th, attended by key government officials. During the meeting, my report was heard and discussed concerning the treasonous, counter-revolutionary military-fascist organization uncovered by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs. This organization was of an absolutely conspiratorial nature and had been established for a long time. It had built bases for sabotage and espionage within the Red Army. The Red Army can now rest easy knowing that the court has delivered a just verdict on these traitors and carried out their deserved punishment. This is not the first time that the Soviet court has justly and severely punished Trotsky-Zinoviev terrorists, assault teams, spies, and assassins. These traitors, under the command of the despicable fascist traitor Trotsky, who betrays workers and peasants, use funds from foreign intelligence agencies to carry out their treasonous activities."

The proclamation further pointed out that among the treasonous traitors recently uncovered, there were also counter-revolutionary espionage elements who had established nests within the Red Army. The ultimate goal of these traitors was to "liquidate our country's Soviet system by all means and at any cost, destroy the Soviet regime, overthrow the government of workers and peasants, and restore the rule of landlords and capitalists in the Soviet Union. They plotted to assassinate party and government leaders, and did everything possible to maliciously sabotage the national economy and national defense, conspiring to weaken the Red Army's power and cause it to fail in future wars. They sold our country's military secrets to the enemy, damaged the Red Army's glorious military strength, and generally did everything possible to promote an enemy invasion of the Soviet Union. They prepared to use their direct acts of treason to disrupt frontline technology and material supplies, as well as operational command, causing the Red Army to collapse on the front lines and overthrow the Soviet government when war broke out. They expected the assistance of their employers in certain foreign military and fascist circles, and as the price for this assistance, they were prepared to cede Soviet Ukraine and divide our country's territory."

"These traitors knew well that they could not gain the support of the workers, peasants, and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and dared not reveal their true faces. Instead, they spread deceptive schemes among the people and Red Army soldiers. However, these organizers and leaders of espionage organizations who were directly colluding with bourgeois and fascist countries' military departments have now been uncovered and punished according to the law by the Soviet judicial organs. The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, as the loyal and reliable bulwark of the Soviet regime, has now resolutely cut off the ulcers on its healthy body and quickly cleaned them up. The Red Army was, is, and always will be an irresistible force. The Red Army will always be the flesh and blood of the people who are victoriously building a new socialist life. The entire Red Army, from soldiers to the highest commanders, was, is, and always will be a great fighting group solidified as one. In our unparalleled Red Army, there will never be a place for traitors who betray the motherland. We must increase Bolshevik vigilance tenfold, improve and fundamentally transform our work in all aspects. We must enhance self-criticism, thereby rapidly and completely liquidating the consequences of the destructive activities of the people's enemies." (TASS dispatch, 13th)

### Betrayal of the Party and the Country as a Warning

Editorial in Russian Pravda

[Moscow] Pravda's editorial states, "The Soviet Union's hundreds of millions of workers are filled with hatred upon hearing about the treasonous activities of military figures who betrayed the Party and the country. Workers, Red Army soldiers, intellectuals, and collective farmers in mass meetings throughout the country have unanimously demanded the execution of these traitors and have unanimously supported the verdicts. The vigilant eyes of the dictatorship of the working class have exposed the final military espionage core of a certain group, and its resolute hand has shattered this core, leaving no trace of it on the earth. This proves the increasing power of the Soviet system and the vigilance of the Soviet intelligence network. This also proves the panic of a certain group's intelligence agencies, even though they have years of experience in provocation, espionage, and subversive activities. All their cunning cannot help the fascist intelligence agencies operate in our Soviet Union. By crushing this last military espionage core, we have not only consolidated the Red Army's power but have also exposed all the conspiracies and schemes of a certain country. Every attempt to attack the Soviet Union will be the beginning of the end for the Goebbels-esque regime." The editorial continues, "These imperialists, especially Germany, are furious at seeing our socialist country become increasingly strong. The consistent goal of the fascist leaders of certain countries is to defeat the Red Army, divide the Soviet Union, destroy the glorious victories of the Soviet people, and turn them into slaves of fascist barbarians. This is the work that the eight fascist spies executed yesterday, the main military espionage core of a certain country, were preparing to carry out. This verdict is the voice of the Soviet people. The Soviet system has liberated hundreds of millions of oppressed people, giving them a new and happy socialist life. German imperialism is attempting to conquer and enslave these people. The shameless dreams and conspiracies of these villains will never become reality. The Soviet people and their glorious workers and peasants are an irresistible force. Today, the end of their bourgeois intelligence agencies has arrived. The Soviet people are strengthening their vigilance tenfold, and the strength of our intelligence network lies in having the entire people as its backing. The eight military spies have now been crushed at the request of hundreds of millions of people. The death of rabid dogs is indeed cause for celebration." (TASS dispatch, 12th)

### Trotsky Issues Statement

The Reason for the Deaths of Military Leaders: Resulting from Discord with the Army Chief

⊙Mexico City The anti-faction leader of the Communist Party in Mexico, Trotsky, recently made a statement to our correspondent regarding the case of the eight high-ranking generals of the Soviet Red Army who committed treason, stating, "National defense interests have been sacrificed for personal gain." General Tukhachevsky and the defendants had made outstanding achievements in leading the Red Army, and their talents were unmatched, except perhaps by Cavalry Inspector General Budyonny. As for the crimes that the Soviet government has accused the defendants of, they are not substantiated. I deeply believe that the cause of this case stems from the discord between General Tukhachevsky and People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov. General Voroshilov is a mediocre talent who only knows how to obey Stalin's orders and has no other strengths. In short, Stalin's actions have dealt a major blow to the Red Army, and the Red Army has been shaken in spirit. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Berlin Shocked

[Berlin] After the news of the execution of eight high-ranking generals of the Soviet Red Army reached here, German military figures were initially skeptical about the conflict between Soviet dictator Stalin and Red Army generals such as Tukhachevsky, but now they are greatly shocked. However, they still believe that the Red Army's reputation will not be damaged as a result. Political figures, on the other hand, believe that this move will greatly weaken the Red Army's reputation, and they anticipate that a serious reaction will occur in the Soviet political situation as a result. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)

[Berlin] After the execution of high-ranking Soviet Red Army generals such as Tukhachevsky, German newspapers generally used the term "cruel despotism." The Lokal-Anzeiger reported that "assassination has become a principle in the Soviet Union." The Abendpost reported that the rumors of German officers attempting to communicate with Red Army leaders were absolutely false. "If people say that German officers would actually engage in such behavior, it is an insult to Germany. There is no sense in such conjecture." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Japan's Political Situation Can Be Maintained at a Moderate Level This Year

The Government Tries to Avoid Friction with Political Parties; No Concrete Measures to Control Prices

[Tokyo] After the Central News Agency correspondent returned to Tokyo, the observation of Japan's political situation is that it can generally be maintained at a moderate level this year. Although the reasons for the collapse of the Hayashi Cabinet are extremely complex, the most important reason seems to be the inability to alleviate the friction between the government and political parties, as well as the social unrest caused by rising prices. Furthermore, the Hayashi Cabinet's excessive clumsiness in handling matters increased various unnecessary frictions, which was also a reason for the overall resignation. Initially, Yuki Toyotaro's finances were praised by all parties, but because its substance was not much different from Baba Eiichi's finances, it became increasingly tinged with one-sided color, favoring capitalists and military industries, which eventually aroused opposition from all parties. On the other hand, the failure to promote the Manchurian Five-Year Plan caused the military to gradually lose faith in Yuki. In addition, Sato Naotake's diplomatic stance toward China made some feel that Sato lacked an understanding of Japan's traditional spirit toward China, so it was necessary to force his resignation. The above two points were the secondary reasons for the Hayashi Cabinet's overall resignation. The establishment of the Konoe Cabinet was to eliminate the bad phenomena left over by the Hayashi Cabinet. Therefore, the main mission of the Konoe Cabinet is to eliminate various unnecessary frictions within the country and control prices. Regarding the first point, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have currently expressed their goodwill support for the new cabinet. At the same time, the new cabinet members, starting with Konoe, have expressed no intention of organizing a new party. In that case, the existing political parties will not take an opposing attitude toward the new cabinet. Although the existing political parties hold an absolute majority in the parliament, their unity and environment also cannot allow them to realize their attempt to restore party government. Therefore, they have no choice but to temporarily maintain the so-called "right and wrongism" to deal with the current situation. For this reason, it seems that no confrontational situation will occur between the government and political parties when the special parliament is held in July. Regarding the second point, rising prices have become an inevitable trend. The large amount of excess imports necessitates the implementation of import trade control. However, controlling import trade and implementing high taxes further stimulate the rise in prices. The difference in international trade will inevitably lead to a problem, that is, how to maintain the balance of international payments. The continued soaring of prices and the excessive tax burden will inevitably lead to labor disputes demanding increased wages and worries about the instability of the general public's life will increase accordingly. The new cabinet has not yet found concrete measures to control prices. At least within ten years, Japan's military budget can only be expected to increase and not decrease. According to current rough estimates, the budget for the next fiscal year will at least break through 3.2 billion or 3.3 billion yen. Therefore, how to compile such a huge budget without increasing tax rates again is one of the most serious problems encountered by the Konoe Cabinet. Regarding diplomacy toward China, although the new cabinet wants to complete the task of adjusting relations between the two countries that the previous cabinet failed to complete, since the inconsistent factors existing in Japan have not been eliminated, it will still not accept our country's consistent desire to clear political obstacles. Therefore, if the situation in Japan does not change, there is no hope for an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, but it may not necessarily worsen. The current public opinion here regarding the Konoe Cabinet expresses less expectation than when Konoe formed the cabinet. This may be due to the many contradictory factors within Japan's political and economic layers. Therefore, it is difficult for anyone who comes forward to shoulder this great difficulty and handle this tense situation to plan policies that can satisfy the wishes of the people and conform to the trends of the times. The Konoe Cabinet faces many difficulties, let's see what brilliant plans the young prime minister has. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)

### The Iron Ring Defense Line is Breached; the Port of Bilbao is in Danger

The Rebel Army Adopts a Dense Offensive Strategy; the Defending Army Decides to Make a Do-or-Die Stand with Reinforcements

⊙Bilbao After two days of fierce fighting, the Nationalist forces have breached the "Iron Ring Defense Line" of the government forces, and the fate of the Port of Bilbao has reached an irreversible stage. The so-called "Iron Ring Defense Line" is a ring of small mountains surrounding Bilbao, about seven miles from Bilbao, with three trenches built, and six layers of barbed wire in many places, including communication tunnels. Since the Nationalist forces have breached this impregnable defense line, it is expected that they will soon be able to bombard the houses in the city of Bilbao with heavy artillery. It is also reported that when the Nationalist forces attacked the "Iron Ring Defense Line," they used a dense offensive strategy, concentrating their forces in one place, forming a wedge shape that gradually penetrated. The Basque side suffered extremely heavy losses. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)

⊙Bilbao The rebel army has now broken through the outer defense line of the city. The Basque president has rushed to mobilize 10,000 reservists as reinforcements. According to the rebel army's battle report, the Nationalist forces have occupied Noro village in northeastern Bilbao. Several thousand Nationalist troops, taking advantage of the high ground from Mount Vivo, are advancing directly towards Bilbao. Several rebel army planes flew over the area this afternoon and carried out large-scale bombing, killing about thirty people. (Guomin News Agency, 12th)

⊙Bilbao The one who broke through the "Iron Ring Defense Line" of Bilbao was Colonel Valero, 38 years old, who led the First Navarre Brigade. The brigade advanced along a two-mile-wide front line, with 48 aircraft in front, densely dropping bombs and fiercely bombing. Later, in the evening, they broke through the Basque army's defense works on Mount Castelmendi and Mount Santa Maria. The Basque army, having been under intense artillery fire and aerial bombing for five hours, fought to the death to resist, but felt exhausted. At this point, their fighting spirit had declined, and they gradually retreated. According to the Nationalist army, more than 200 Basque army soldiers were killed in the battle, and 50 were captured, including one captain and one lieutenant. At the same time, the center of Bilbao city was also fiercely bombed by German-made aircraft with bombs and machine guns for an hour. Its intention was clearly to disrupt the rear while the Nationalist army continued to attack the "Iron Ring." This offensive was extremely fierce and can be called a major battle of the new era. It is estimated that 10,000 artillery shells fell on the three-mile-wide ridge defended by the Basque army, averaging one explosion every thirty seconds. According to the prisoners, the Nationalist army's artillery was mostly manufactured in Germany and Italy, and commanded by officers from those two countries. The frontline battle continued late into the night. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### England, France, Germany, and Italy Reach Agreement on Diplomatic Note to Spain

Requesting Expansion of Security Zones; Four-Nation Agreement Stipulates Four Items

[London] Regarding the issue of adequate guarantees for England, France, Germany, and Italy when exercising supervisory powers in Spanish territorial waters, the four governments have now reached complete agreement on the wording of the diplomatic note to be sent to the warring factions in Spain. The representatives of the four countries have agreed to send the original text to the Non-Intervention Committee as a sign of respect to the committee. The return of Germany and Italy to the Non-Intervention Committee depends on receiving answers from the warring factions. It is said that the four countries' diplomatic note to the warring factions in Spain requests that the warring factions demarcate safety zones within or near ports for foreign warships to exercise their supervisory duties. The warring factions should also solemnly guarantee that they will not attack these warships, so as to avoid any further unfortunate incidents. If an incident occurs, the four countries should consult each other on how to deal with it. It is said that in the previous negotiations among the four countries, no one had ever questioned the right of self-defense that warships should have when attacked. However, as a result of negotiations and agreement, approximately no retaliatory actions will be taken abruptly before the four countries have had adequate consultations. Furthermore, the location for future consultations among the four countries will likely remain in London, in the form of diplomatic negotiations, rather than adopting the method of a naval admiral's conference. Furthermore, after the meeting concluded yesterday, a statement was issued stating that the diplomatic notes that the four countries sent to both warring factions have been agreed upon and have been sent to the chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, requesting that he inform the representatives of the other member states. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 13th)

According to informed sources, the agreement established by England, France, Italy, and Germany stipulates four items as follows: 1. To advise the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War to expand the system of safety zones in Spanish ports as much as possible, and to guarantee that incidents similar to those that have occurred in the past few weeks will not happen again, and that foreign ships will be respected; 2. The governments of England, France, Germany, and Italy will determine the procedures for mutual consultation, and in the future, when new incidents occur, these consultation procedures must be followed before appropriate measures can be taken; 3. These consultation procedures do not abolish the right of self-defense of the warships participating in the supervision; 4. The countries agree not to engage in retaliatory actions before conducting consultations. It is also heard that the agreement recognizes the principle of joint and consistent action by the warships of all countries participating in the supervision. Any attack on any participating warship will be regarded as an attack on all countries participating in the supervision. If this situation occurs, England, France, Germany, and Italy, the four countries participating in the supervision, should conduct consultations as soon as possible, probably in London, jointly held by the British Foreign Secretary and the ambassadors to England of France, Germany, and Italy. Although the attacked warship retains the right to self-defense, it must not take retaliatory action before conducting consultations. However, the agreement does not specify what kind of disciplinary measures can be taken when new incidents occur. However, according to well-informed sources, England and France both oppose taking military retaliatory measures. In any case, the implementation of disciplinary measures can only be decided by the governments of England, France, Germany, and Italy, and should not be decided by the officers of the warships participating in the supervision. Also, if, after consultations, the injured country believes it is not satisfied, the agreement does not specify what to do. However, England, France, Germany, and Italy have agreed that if the consultations fail, the principle of joint and consistent action will be immediately cancelled when the injured country takes disciplinary measures or demands compensation independently. In this case, the other three countries will not be bound by the injured country's unilateral actions. In addition, England and France proposed the principle of making the warships participating in the supervision international in nature. After a long period of discussion, it has been accepted by Germany and Italy. As for the implementation methods of internationalization, the Adjustment Committee will decide on it in the future. It will probably be decided to have neutral inspectors board the warships participating in the supervision at any time for inspection. Regarding this level, the principles that the four countries have already agreed upon will also be notified to the warring factions in the West, in order to prove that the countries participating in the supervision are determined to avoid all new incidents.

### Prime Minister of Belgium Leaves France for America

International Economic Cooperation - Success or Failure Hinges on America

[Paris] The Prime Minister of Belgium, Paul-Henri Spaak, departed from Cherbourg, France, at 8:30 PM today aboard the steamer "Berengaria" for America. Before his departure, he gave an interview to a reporter from "Le Temps," stating that he was entrusted by the British and French governments to investigate the possibility of removing international trade barriers. Subsequently, he and his close economic advisor, Mr. Fraire, jointly conducted investigations with various European governments. The results obtained so far are summarized as follows:

㊀ The British government expresses deep sympathy for international economic cooperation, but insists that the arms race among countries must first be fundamentally eliminated, and that the United States and Germany should participate in this economic cooperation. At present, Britain should take a wait-and-see attitude.
㊁ Although France is a colonial empire and can adopt a policy of economic self-sufficiency, the French government is still prepared to make its best efforts to promote economic cooperation among countries.
㊂ Germany is prepared to abandon its policy of economic self-sufficiency, but only on the condition that various countries grant it certain economic concessions. The so-called economic concessions refer to the granting of long-term loans, the extensive import of German goods, and monetary and political stability. As for the path to achieving political stability, one is to recover former colonies. Among Germany's pre-war colonies, at least the Cameroons colony in Africa must be returned to Germany (Cameroons borders French Sudan and was a French mandated territory after the Great War). The second is to amend the Covenant of the League of Nations, in which Article 16 concerning sanctions should be abolished. The third is to enable German workers to be employed abroad.
㊃ If Italy can be granted loans by various countries to meet the needs of developing Abyssinia, Italy is also prepared to engage in economic cooperation with other countries.
㊄ What the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands and Belgium require is nothing more than greater freedom for international trade. This is evidenced by the recent agreement concluded by the countries that signed the Oslo Convention.

In addition, Prime Minister Spaak further stated that if the goodwill of the governments of various countries is to be realized, it is still necessary to obtain various necessary conditions. For example, Germany must revalue and stabilize its mark, and other countries must grant Germany loans as reserves. In short, if the economies of various countries are to be stable and their currencies are stable, they must go through a period of rectification. During this period, countries with excessive gold reserves should lend to countries with depleted reserves. As for the current currencies of various countries, Austria is the most sound, because Austria has a regional agreement with Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Austria first allows prices to be completely consistent at home and abroad. As for Belgium, it is the only country to maintain the gold standard exchange system. In the future, it is hoped that other countries will also restore the gold standard uniformly. However, if the stability of general currencies is to be achieved, it still depends on the clarification of the general situation. Finally, Spaak added that the success or failure of international economic cooperation really depends on the decision-making power of the United States. Therefore, this trip to the United States is extremely important. If the results of the inspection in the United States are quite smooth, he also intends to study the situation in the Soviet Union and Japan. (Central News Agency, 12th, Havas dispatch)

### Puppet Bandits in Chahar North Continue to Revolt

The Kangbao Police Squad Mutinies with Weapons - The Zhangbei Guards Also Plan to Join the Resistance - The Number of Martyrs Among the Righteous People Has Reached Over a Hundred - The Number of Those Implicated and Arrested Has Reached Over Seven Hundred

A dispatch from Wanquan states that since the people of Chahar North rose up to defend themselves on the first of this month, the puppet bandit army has seen a certain party engaging in a great deal of slaughter, arousing their conscience, and those who mutiny with weapons and refuse to be accomplices are constantly emerging. On the sixth of this month, the police squad of Kangbao County, numbering about a hundred, also mutinied with weapons in response to the righteous people of Chahar North. Unfortunately, it was too late, and the uprising was suppressed by the puppet army in less than two days. On the same day, a company of soldiers guarding the east gate of Zhangbei County town, under Bao Zichen's command, also mutinied with weapons, planning to escape into the mountains west of Rehe to wait for an opportunity to repay the nation. A certain secret service organization learned of this and immediately ordered a certain army's armored vehicle team to track and pursue them. They were caught up with in the wilderness of Yizhi, Chongli County. A conflict immediately broke out. Because the company of soldiers had few bullets, they were surrounded by a certain army's armored vehicle team after holding out for three hours and were all brutally murdered.

Recently, in view of the change in military and popular sentiment in Chahar North, a certain party has been trying to suppress it by all means. On the one hand, it has issued a general order to the puppet bandits' armies that all firearms, except for those used for sentry duty, should be sealed up by the heads of each unit every night and issued again during morning exercises the next day. Bao Zichen's unit in Zhangbei has been implementing this since the ninth of this month. On the other hand, they are restricting privately held firearms among the people. The various counties are now issuing orders to the people that all those who have firearms in their possession must report and inspect them within ten days. Those who conceal and fail to report them after the deadline will be charged with secretly possessing military supplies with the intention of revolt and will be executed.

According to sources from a certain related party, the number of righteous people who died in this self-defense by the people of Chahar North from the first to the ninth of this month in Chongli Xiangdousha Village, Zhangbei County Town, Kangbao County Town, and Nanhouchun and other places totaled more than one hundred. The number of those implicated and arrested on suspicion reached more than seven hundred, many of whom were families who generously went to their deaths together, and there were also families who were detained by a certain party and are currently being interrogated. Their spirit of refusing to submit for long and sacrificing their lives and property to seek survival and freedom is truly admirable. Unfortunately, they had no support, which led to this tragic tragedy, which only makes future generations tear their eyes and stand on end.

Since the self-defense of the people of Chahar North was suppressed, a certain secret service organization in Zhangbei has specially dispatched a large number of traitors to various places to gather information in order to understand the emotions of the people and the military and political situation in our inland areas. Between the fifth, sixth, and ninth of this month, a total of more than thirty traitors were dispatched from Zhangbei in succession. It is said that their destinations were designated as Suidong, Xinghe, Pingdiquan, and Zhangjiakou, and some of them went to Wuchuan, Guyang, and Taolin in Suibei via Shangdu. (June 10)

### The Xinzhong Corporation's He River Entering Jin Has a Major Mission

To Inquire into the Intentions of the Shanxi Authorities and Inspect Mineral Deposits - To Make a Final Evaluation of the Construction of the Jinshi Road

A dispatch from Tianjin states that Shinji Sogō, the president of the Japanese Xinzhong Corporation, has been running between Pingjin and Dalian since the middle of last month, working on so-called North China economic development. On the tenth of this month, he took the company's general manager, Hideichi Hojo, and secretary, Yō Yoshida, from Beiping to Taiyuan to visit Zhao Daiwen and Zhu Shouguang, hoping to pay his respects to the cabinet for a discussion. It is reported that Sogo's trip to Shanxi is to test the intentions of the Shanxi authorities on the one hand, and to seek profits in the process, and to inspect coal, iron, mineral deposits, and emerging industries on the other hand. The task is very important. The recent North China economic development issue has been intermittent. Those who do not know the situation may suspect that it has stalled. For example, the Jinshi Road and Longyan Mine incidents have been discussed by the Chinese and Japanese persons in charge for two years, but there is still no progress. The reasons for this are as follows:

㊀ The Japanese Army Command in Tianjin has devoted two years to the Jinshi Road and Longyan Mine incidents, but the financial groups are hesitant to invest, and it has not been successful. The military headquarters itself sees this as a major loss. This spring, Ikeda, the economic section chief of the Japanese Army Command, and Hashimoto, the chief of staff, returned to Japan one after another to lobby, pulling out the Oriental Development Company to invest. Yasukawa Yunosuke, the president of Dongtuo, came to China for inspection. However, when the military headquarters, Manchu Railway, and Xinzhong held a North China economic development forum in Dalian on the 13th of last month, the military representatives Ikeda and Adachi first proposed that Dongtuo wanted to invest in North China alone, which was strongly opposed by the Manchu Railway and Xinzhong Corporation, which was sheltered by the Manchu Railway. The meeting was equal to no result and ended unhappily. The two financial groups, Shanxing Zhongdongtuo, have a situation in North China where they cannot coexist. Therefore, Xinzhong Corporation, while preventing the intrusion of Dongtuo's forces, advocated increasing capital to 50 million yuan to break away from the Manchu Railway and become independent. This matter is still pending.
㊁ Among the so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China, only the export of Luyan to Japan and the Sino-Japanese navigation between Hebei and Chahar have been implemented. The Central Government has stated that there is no need to build the Jinshi Road. Even if it is built, it must be handled under the auspices of the Ministry of Railways. The Hebei-Chahar authorities have always obeyed the Central Government and should have no objection to this. However, the Japanese side is difficult to abandon the construction of the Jinshi Road lightly. The Japanese side's intention to build the road is to transport various mineral deposits from Shanxi Province on the one hand, and to support Japanese forces in the villages along the route on the other hand. Sogo's visit to Shanxi this time is to make a final assessment of the economic value of the Jinshi Road to determine whether there is a need to build it desperately. As for the exploitation of the Longyan Mine, it is estimated that an investment of 10 million yuan is required before iron can be produced. However, according to the Japanese side, the Longyan Mine is old and its efficiency is poor. Therefore, the Japanese side has also investigated the Jinling Iron Mine in Shandong and the Anshan Iron Mine in Puppet Manchukuo. Regardless of whether it can be mined, the dependence on the Longyan Mine has been reduced.

The Japanese side knows that the problems of building the Jinshi Road, the Longyan Iron Mine, and the Tanggu Port are not easy to handle. Recently, there have been two plans to improve wool and counter-planting cotton, taking the easy way. The Xinzhong Corporation has been purchasing land in Junliangcheng, east of Tianjin, numbering about 40,000 to 50,000 acres, planning to open it up as a cotton planting area to try to plant American cotton to supply the needs of Japanese yarn factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan. The expert Takahashi is responsible for presiding over the project. On the one hand, a cotton warehouse is being built in Tianjin to purchase cotton from various counties in Hebei Province. The capital is set at 9 million yuan. This matter may be realized within a month. As for the improvement of wool, it is done by the Japanese Shovel Spinning Company, which opens up a vast pasture in Zhangjiakou, Chahar Province, or other suitable locations to breed sheep to manipulate the foundation of wool. However, its plan has not yet been finalized. (11th)

### A Giant in the North China Drug Manufacturing Business is Arrested

Chen Kunyuan, One of the Four Great Kings, is Arrested - Chen's Wife Opens Fire and Wounds a Detective from the Japanese Police Station

A dispatch from Tianjin states that recently, the Japanese resident agencies in North China seem to be paying attention to the work of clearing drugs. One reason is that after the Hahe floating corpse case occurred, general opinion mostly pointed out that it was done by a drug trafficking organization under Japanese protection. Another reason is that international opinion recently believes that Japan is protecting drug manufacturing organizations in North China, producing in large quantities, distributing drugs in North China, and dumping them to the world. The Japanese side wants to save face and, since there is no way to defend the former rumors, it has no choice but to engage in sanctions and clean up the organizations under its jurisdiction that manufacture and sell drugs in order to quell world opinion. Kato, the chargé d'affaires of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, had already visited and expressed his determination to crack down on drug trading firms. This is the Japanese side's recent awakening to launch a crackdown.

The Japanese Concession in Tianjin has always been known to the world as a den for manufacturing drugs. Since this month, the Japanese police station has sealed up dozens of white powder houses based on the purpose of cracking down on drugs, and arrested more than a thousand drug addicts, who were extradited to our police station in batches. The police station then transferred them to the municipal relief center. The number of guests received by the hospital exceeded the quota, and it was temporarily full. In addition to this measure, the Japanese police station also investigated drug manufacturing and trafficking organizations. Chen Heling (Zi Kunyuan), a Shanghainese, 48 years old, is one of the four great kings of drug manufacturing and trafficking in North China. In the past, he partnered with someone surnamed Jia, who had been executed in Shanghai for drug trafficking, to operate a drug den. When the incident occurred, Jia was executed and Chen fled to Tianjin with his wife, Wang (39 years old), and moved to the Japanese Concession. Later, he and Wu Jiyuan (that is, Wu Ji Jade) set up a drug manufacturing machine in Beiping. It was broken by the military police the year before last. Chen independently set up Kangchang Foreign Firm on Shou Street in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, hiring Japanese Ronin Okada and others to use their names to manufacture and sell drugs in large quantities. He also opened rooms 56, 57, 62, etc. in Deyi Building in the Japanese Concession as a retail sales agency, and used Tang Amao and dozens of others as outside sales interceptors. All the major cities of Taiyuan, Sui, Cha, Hebei, Shandong, and Tangshanbeiping have secret rental transfer agencies. It is really a giant drug manufacturing den in North China. The production and sales are so widespread that those who hear it are shocked. Chen has accumulated millions of evils because of this. He and his wife live in luxury in the Japanese Concession at No. 2, 44 Kamo Street, Suma Street, almost like a prince. He has one son, two daughters, and the daughters are studying in a middle school in Tianjin, and the son is studying in Shanghai. At 7:30 am on the 10th of this month, the Japanese police station suddenly dispatched patrolman Yamayo to lead five detectives and broke into Chen's residence on Kamo Street. At that time, Chen had not yet gotten up. The Japanese police went straight into the bedroom and captured him. When Chen was arrested, he was still confident that he was generous and not very panicked. His wife was awakened from her sleep and, because Yamayo and others were all in plain clothes, suspected that they were bandits kidnapping him, and quickly took Chen's own pistol from the back room and fired three shots in a row, hitting Yamayo in the abdomen and arm with two bullets. Another bullet grazed a detective's arm. The Japanese detectives worked together to snatch the pistol. The Chens were then tied up and taken to the Japanese police station. The chief of the Japanese police station, Wakui, was very angry that the detectives were injured and immediately dispatched a large team of detectives to search Deyi Building and Kangchang Foreign Firm. Drugs and utensils were found in the 56, 7, and 62 rooms of Beiyi Building and loaded into four heavy trucks. The manufacturing materials and machines were also found in Kangchang Foreign Firm. Ronin Okada and Tang Amao and others fled. How the Japanese side will deal with the criminal is still under investigation. After Chen was arrested, the society cheered for a while (10th)

### Suzhou

Demolition of Houses Limited for Road Expansion

The Construction Bureau has decided to expand the ten major arterial roads in and outside the Xuanwu City, and construction is imminent. Residents on both sides of the road have been notified long ago to report the demolition by September 30. Currently, many people have reported the demolition in compliance with the order, but there are also many who are procrastinating and waiting to see. In order to facilitate the project, the Construction Bureau has decided to forcibly limit the demolition of houses, otherwise the Construction Bureau will decide to demolish them on its behalf.

### Wuxi

Factory Coal Panic

Wuxi is a factory area, and it needs about 600 tons of rare coal every day. However, the arrival of goods is rare and difficult to cope with. The reasons are that the Huaitong, Datong, and Zhongxing coal mining companies are mostly short of vehicles for loading and transporting, so the market price has soared. The former coal price was about ten yuan per ton, and now it is sold for fifteen or sixteen yuan per ton. The factories are very enthusiastic. If no coal arrives in the yard within half a month, there is a danger of the factory stopping.

Rain Affects Wheat

Two-thirds of the wheat in the four townships has already been harvested. The farmers are happy because they estimate that the harvest is still good. However, the recent weather has not been good, and the overcast rain has continued, causing the wheat in the fields to germinate, and the harvested wheat is at risk of mildew due to excessive temperature. It rained heavily all day on the 13th, and water accumulated in the fields, forming canals and pouring into the river. The farmers are very worried. If it does not clear up again, the losses will not be small.

### Yangzhou

Levy of Improvement Fees for Silkworm Cocoons

About 10,000 sheets of Jiangdu spring silkworm species are sold, and the rearing has all been on the cluster. Currently, Yang Rennong, the director and instructor of the Central Guidance Institute, said that the cocoon houses in the third district have already dried the fresh cocoons they have collected, and the weighing will be done soon. He specially accompanied the staff of Jiangsu Bank to the area on the 12th to collect the improvement fee of six yuan per stone to report and resolve.

### Ningbo

Suppression of Bandits Command Established

The 6th Security Command of Ningbo, in order to take advantage of the scattered disturbances and affect the security of the border between the three counties of Fengshengduan, specially set up the Fengningxinsheng four-county suppression of bandits command in Fenghua Shidi Lidi. The Deputy Commander Chen Ximin was appointed as the commander of the bandit suppression. Deputy Commander Chen went to Ershi on the morning of the 11th to deploy the affairs of the department, and the office was opened on the same day.

### Nantong

Local Cloth Silver Group Established

The banking industry in Shanghai developed the local cloth in various counties in the Nantong area and formed a local cloth silver group, investing 1.25 million yuan in one year. The loan plan has now been agreed upon. On the 12th, Ge Tan, the director of the Nantong Local Cloth Improvement Committee, went to Shanghai to sign a contract with the local cloth silver group.

### Taizhou

Interception of Smuggled Fertilizer Powder

At about 7:00 am on the 7th of this month, Zhang Cipan, a Dali person from Yueqing, was found at Jiangxiali, Xiling District, Shanghai, smuggling 28 bags of fertilizer powder. He was loaded into a pier after someone reported to Tianhexi Township Office, who sent people to check. It was confirmed that it was tax-evading chemical fertilizer powder. The smuggled goods were intercepted outside the township office, and the county government was notified to request a solution.

Details of the Meeting

The meeting commenced at 3:00 PM. Chen Zhigao, Xu Zuoliang, Yan Yinwu, Zhu Wende, Yu Chengxiu, Zhang Juansheng, and Yuan Yangan were publicly elected to form the presidium. All attendees stood at attention and paid the highest respect to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. The chairman solemnly read the will. Presidium members Xu Zuoliang, Chen Zhigao, and Yan Yinwu successively reported on the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement, stating that the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement had been resolved and adopted at the Judicial Conference. It has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for initial drafting, which is now complete and will be submitted to the Criminal Law Committee. Today, the Third Anniversary Movement Conference is held, inviting various organizations to attend, participate in unity, and cooperate to urge the government to formulate wrongful imprisonment compensation regulations and promulgate them for implementation to rescue the wrongfully accused people. Next, Mr. Wang Xiaolai spoke, hoping that the term "wrongful imprisonment" would be used more directly, and that this compensation was only a form of comfort. Why quibble over the words? Next, Chief Judge Qiao Wanxuan stated that wrongful imprisonment compensation has been implemented in advanced countries, and China should also formulate it. However, even with this law, it is still hoped that wrongful imprisonments will be reduced. To reduce the practical requirements for wrongful imprisonment, one is for prosecutors to reduce the prosecution of cases, and the second is to strictly enforce bail. If wrongful imprisonments can be reduced, and the legal profession can assist, wrongful imprisonments can definitely be prevented from happening. Everyone applauded. Subsequently, guests Lin Wopeng from the Second Branch of the High Court, Du Baoxin from the Shanghai Local Court, Qu Shaoheng and Wei Bozhen from the Municipal Medical Association, and others successively spoke, all expressing their support for this system, ultimately hoping to achieve a state where there are no wrongful imprisonments and no need for compensation. Next, Committee members Wang Weizhen, Cha Renwei, Tian Heming, Feng Meixue, Yu Chengxiu, Yuan Yangan, and others successively spoke, proposing four motions for discussion: (A) Requesting the government to announce the draft Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law; (B) Seeking opinions from all parties; (C) Requesting the passage of Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Regulations and appointing representatives to attend; (D) Promulgating and implementing the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Regulations as soon as possible. For the above motions, it was resolved to appoint seven representatives to be handled by the Executive and Supervisory Committee. The meeting adjourned with tea and refreshments. The atmosphere was quite enthusiastic that day, and the opinions expressed were very practical.

Radio Broadcasts

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili Ran Aground at Shipu En Route from Guangzhou to Shanghai

Encountering Danger Due to Heavy Fog Obscuring the Waterway, Haiyan Rushed to the Rescue, Passengers Arriving in Shanghai Today

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili ran aground in Hong Kong on October 21 and was only recently rescued. Not even two weeks later, the Haili encountered danger again. The Haili is a sister ship to the Haiwu. This time, en route from Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Shantou back to Shanghai, the ship collided with a reef in the waters off Zhejiang due to heavy fog. The ship sustained damage and began taking on water. All passengers on board are expected to be rescued and returned to Shanghai today. The general situation is described below:

Encountering Danger Near Shipu

The Haili is the regular vessel on the South China line. This time, it was fully loaded with cargo and passengers from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shantou, sailing back to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but the ship encountered severe weather yesterday morning while sailing in the waters off Zhejiang, near Shipu. Heavy fog obscured the waterway, causing the ship to collide with a submerged reef. As the ship continued to move forward, the iron plates of the hull were torn by the reef, causing significant damage. Seawater immediately flooded into the hold, creating a very dangerous situation.

Ship Owner Cables Shanghai for Help

After the accident, the passengers on board were extremely uneasy. The captain telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters for help, hoping to safely return the passengers on board to Shanghai first, and then repair the damaged hull and attempt to sail back to Shanghai for repairs. Upon receiving the telegram, the general and deputy managers and department heads immediately discussed rescue measures, as yesterday was a Sunday and also the Dragon Boat Festival.

Haiyan Dispatched to Rescue Passengers

After discussion among the staff, it was decided that sending a ship from Shanghai would cause delays during this tense situation. Therefore, after consultation among the responsible personnel, in order to act quickly and deal with the emergency, the Haiyan, which was currently in Wenzhou, was dispatched to assist the passengers on board. The head of the Wenzhou branch was also ordered to accompany the Haiyan to preside over the rescue. After the decision was made, a telegram was immediately sent to the Wenzhou branch to implement it quickly.

Passengers Expected to Arrive Today

Yesterday afternoon, another telegram was received from the Haili, stating that the Haiyan sent from Wenzhou had arrived near Shipu and had begun transferring all the passengers from the Haili to the Haiyan in batches using sampans. It was ordered to send them back to Shanghai first. It is expected that the Haiyan will be able to safely transport all the passengers from the Haili to Shanghai today. Furthermore, as the weather had gradually improved yesterday afternoon, the Haili's hull repair and sailing to Shanghai could proceed smoothly without major danger.

Overall Structure of the Ship

The Haili is one of the four new ships built with the Boxer Indemnity funds. The ship has a gross tonnage of 3,395 tons, a registered tonnage of 2,055 tons, and a cargo capacity of 200,400 cubic feet. It is 343 feet long, 47 feet wide, with a draft of 17 feet 6 and 3/8 inches. It has a horsepower of 2,500 and can travel at 13.6 nautical miles per hour. It has 14 first-class cabins, 18 second-class cabins, 40 third-class cabins, and 56 berths and 600 unberthed spaces in third class. The ship cost 1.4 million yuan and is currently insured for 1.12 million yuan.

### He Yingqin Discusses the Reorganization of Military Affairs in Sichuan and Xikang

Implementing in Full Accordance with the Central Government's Established Policies, Date of My Departure to Sichuan Not Yet Determined

Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, accompanied by Secretary Xie Zongyuan and Adjutant Zhang Guozhong, arrived in Shanghai by train on the evening of the 12th. Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Municipal Security Corps Commander Ji Zhangjian, and Municipal Police Chief Cai Jinjun all went to pay their respects. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, he went to Renjitang on Yunnan Road to preside over the Guizhou Disaster Relief Conference and discuss relief efforts. A reporter from the New News Agency visited him to inquire about the measures for reorganizing military affairs in Sichuan and Xikang, and when he would depart for Sichuan. According to He, the steps for reorganizing military affairs in Sichuan and Xikang will be decided entirely in accordance with the Central Government's established policies. The general situation was discussed and published by myself in Nanjing, and there have been no changes to date, so there is no need to repeat it. Guan Jiyu, the Central Financial Commissioner to Sichuan, has not met with me after visiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan. I have also not met with Lu Zuofu, the Director of Construction of Sichuan Province. Because Lu's whereabouts have only been seen in the newspapers, his actual whereabouts cannot be confirmed. As for the Central Government sending me to Sichuan to preside over the reorganization of military affairs, the rumors that Wu Daquan and Zhang Qun will accompany me are probably just external speculation, as I am not aware of it, so there is no point in discussing when I might depart for Sichuan. This trip to Shanghai is purely for Guizhou disaster relief matters and requires consultation with various parties in Shanghai to discuss methods, and I plan to return to Nanjing in a day or two.

### Energy Conservation Movement Closed Last Night

An Evening Entertainment Show Was Also Held

Former Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying suffered from otitis media and sought treatment from otolaryngologist Li Gang, who has already recovered. However, his energy was weakened after the illness. He was prescribed a body-strengthening and blood-nourishing medicine specially made from umbelliferous plants by the famous national doctor Fei Zibin, as well as Fei's created dietary therapy. He was instructed to take a small amount of chicken broth and several Xinghua longans every day. It has been quite effective in recent days, and he has fully recovered his health. As Xu will soon return to his post, it is necessary to ask Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions regarding future foreign policy toward Japan. He received a telegram from Chiang yesterday inviting him to meet in Lushan. Xu is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 14th to receive instructions. He will stay for several days and then go to Nanjing to discuss everything with Foreign Minister Wang and prepare for departure abroad.

### Foreign Ships Docked at the Qiujiang Wharf for the First Time Yesterday

Japanese Empress Docks in Shanghai En Route to Japan, Wharf Workers Work Exceptionally Efficiently

After the completion of the first phase of the Qiujiang Wharf project, it was put into operation on the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the British-owned Changxing Shipping Company's giant Japanese Empress arrived in Shanghai and docked at the wharf. Due to its perfect facilities and the skilled workers, the passengers were all satisfied. The ship will set sail from Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. On the 21st, the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso will dock at the wharf. The details are recorded below:

Wharf Transportation Facilities

The Japanese Empress is a giant ship that sails the Far East line. Each time it arrives in China, it docks in the Huangpu River, and passengers have to spend a long time going back and forth, which is particularly inconvenient. Now that the newly built Qiujiang Wharf is being used, all the difficulties have been resolved. Furthermore, the Qiujiang Wharf Management Office has fully prepared all the transportation tools to facilitate passengers. The magnificence of the wharf construction is also a major event. Behind the wharf, there is a large open space that can accommodate hundreds of cars. Silver taxis and Chinese-owned public buses that have been specially contracted by the management office, numbering more than a hundred, are also parked in the square for passengers to hire. As for the traffic in the square, twenty staff members and dozens of police officers are stationed to maintain order, and there is no chaotic scene.

Reception and Waiting Facilities

The management office originally stipulated that only those waiting to receive guests would be allowed to wait upstairs in order to facilitate the work of the wharf. The office has prepared tables and chairs for guests to rest and talk to passengers over the railing, but the space seems to be rather narrow. Although it was raining yesterday, there was an unusually large crowd of Chinese and foreign people waiting there. Those who came later had no room to stand. There were also many people braving the rain on the roof of the cargo warehouse to the left. However, children were prohibited from standing there to prevent accidents. As for the customs inspection room on the wharf, where guests were originally not allowed to enter, a temporary arrangement was made after receiving notification from the customs, so those with customs passes could still enter. There were also many people braving the rain and standing on the wharf.

Mooring Situation

The ship arrived at the wharf at 2:30 PM. Two management staff members led five sailors and more than a hundred workers to work at the pier. The procedures were very efficient, and it was moored in about half an hour. The Chinese and foreign people who came to pick up guests immediately went up the stairs to board the ship. The ship carried 580 passengers, of whom 231 came to Shanghai from various places. The remaining 349 were transit passengers who disembarked with their relatives and friends to hire cars to visit the city. They will still take the original ship to Japan this afternoon. It is reported that the ship only brought a few hundred baskets of tropical fruits. According to the person in charge of the management office, the wharf's facilities and work can be said to be satisfactory. The ship's freshwater needs were also supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant at 40 cents per ton. The China Travel Service handles all the needs of passengers. The next ship to dock at the wharf will be the Italian ship Conte Rosso, scheduled for the 21st. The time needs to be confirmed on the 19th.

### Lin Jinyu Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday to Attend the Audit Conference

Since the Ministry of Audit established audit offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Shanghai, and other four places and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway audit office in 1935, it has spared no effort in promoting accounting policies. Last year, audit offices in Shaanxi, Henan, Guangdong, and other provinces were also successively established.

He felt that it was necessary to conduct in-depth discussions on the direction of future accounting policy promotion. Therefore, it was decided to convene a joint audit conference on the 15th of this month.

### Deadlock in Yarn Trading Speculation Dispute Being Resolved

Du Yuesheng Advises Both Sides to Eliminate Prejudices; Government to Take Decisive Action When Necessary

Dagong News Agency reports: The yarn trading market turmoil led to the Ministry sending Vice Minister Cheng Tiangu to Shanghai to investigate and handle the matter. After summoning buyers, sellers, and brokers for talks, many brokers sent letters to seek opinions. It was decided that negotiations would continue this morning, but the sellers insisted on their original stance and refused to concede. Du Yuesheng is currently trying to mediate. If there is no solution, the Ministry will decisively deal with the situation by using the Exchange Act. Here is a record of the general sentiment:

Buyers Maintain a Firm Attitude

Since Vice Minister Cheng summoned representatives from both buying and selling brokers, as well as neutral representatives from the Exchange Council and the Brokers Association, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the buying brokers stated that they needed to consult with their clients to reply, because the selling brokers could not represent the opinions of the buying clients. Therefore, they immediately issued written letters overnight to seek opinions from the buyers. It has now been learned from relevant sources that the buyers (i.e., the buying side) are still firmly adhering to their original proposal and cannot accept a market price below the red card price of June 8th. It is currently found that the buyers hold more than 80,000 pieces of yarn in futures contracts for June, July, August, and September, and there are also more than 23,000 pieces in spot goods.

Du Visits Cheng for Discussions

After the selling brokers invited Du Yuesheng to mediate, the market was reopened on the morning of the 11th, with the buying side releasing 29,900 pieces of near and far-term individual yarns to maintain the market. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the buying side suddenly called for a higher market price, causing the market to be forced to suspend trading again, and the situation became more severe than before. The Ministry specially dispatched Vice Minister Cheng to Shanghai to investigate and handle the matter. Du visited his residence to report the situation and discuss solutions. It lasted quite a while. It is now learned that Du is still acting as a third party to mediate, trying to get the buying and selling parties to eliminate prejudices, negotiate openly, and avoid a stalemate.

Final Decisive Action

The selling representatives requested Vice Minister Cheng to apply the provisions of Article 154, Section 8 of the Exchange's Business Rules, to settle the price according to a ten-day average. All parties unanimously opposed this. Therefore, the Vice Minister granted an extension of time to allow the buying side ample opportunity to consider. It was decided to reconvene the responsible brokers at 10:00 AM today to continue discussions and listen to opinions to seek a solution. It is reliably learned that the government authorities, in order to maintain the Exchange's business, if the two sides cannot understand and compromise, will invoke the provisions of Article 154, Section 3 of the Exchange's Business Rules, "having orders from the competent authority," to take decisive action when necessary.

Buying and Selling Sides Each Have Their Own Story

Xin Sheng News Agency reports: After Vice Minister Cheng Tiangu of the Ministry of Industry arrived in Shanghai, in addition to summoning representatives from the Yarn and Cloth Exchange Brokers Association for talks, he consulted on handling methods the night before last. Chen Yu, a consultant from the Ministry of Industry, Section Chief Kuang Yunwen, Exchange Supervisor Wang Xiaolai, Local Association President Du Yuesheng, and Chairman of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange Mu Ouchu attended. After a long period of consultation, it was decided to wait for the responses from the brokers' representatives before reviewing and handling the matter. Furthermore, it was learned from the Yarn and Cloth Exchange brokers yesterday morning that the selling side believes that the soaring prices of yarn and cotton are due to manipulation by powerful figures. Therefore, they hope to settle the transaction according to the provisions of Article 154, Section 8 of the Exchange's Business Rules, stating that when it is impossible to reduce the risks of brokers and other related parties without closing the transaction, the price can be settled by averaging the price over ten days. However, the buying side believes that the soaring yarn prices are actually a result of reduced yarn inventory and the trend of brisk sales, not manipulation by speculators.

### Meiya General Factory and Jingwei Factory Resume Work and Then Go on Strike Again

Party and Government to Discuss Emergency Measures This Morning

The Meiya Jingwei Factory and the General Factory, in accordance with the approval of the Social Bureau, started operations at 6:00 AM yesterday. The Social Bureau sent Mu Guilin, and the Police Bureau sent a bureau officer and patrol officer to supervise everything at the factory. After earnestly persuading the workers, the workers entered the factory one after another. The General Factory had over a hundred people, and the Jingwei Factory had over three hundred people. However, after working until around 10:00 AM, after the representatives from the Social and Police Bureaus left the factory, the workers continued to strike, causing the machines to suddenly stop at 10:30 AM. The workers also did not leave the factory for lunch at noon and issued a declaration stating that they would go on a hunger strike. Upon hearing the news in the afternoon, the Police Bureau dispatched Yao, the chief of the Ximen Branch, to personally persuade them, but they still continued to strike as before until late at night. It is heard that the party and government authorities will convene this morning to discuss emergency measures to resolve the dispute as soon as possible.

### The Farmers Bank of China Promotes Land Loans

Focusing on Frontier Provinces Such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou; Establishing Farmers' Loan Offices to Enable All to Share the Benefits

The Farmers Bank of China is the authoritative agricultural bank in our country. In recent years, it has spared no effort in rescuing disaster areas with agricultural loans, promoting the organization of cooperative societies, and making progress. Since the head office moved from Hankou to Shanghai, General Manager Ye Zhuotang has been working at the bank daily. Regarding the bank's handling of land and rural loan matters in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, it was learned yesterday that the bank has decided to focus its promotion area for the above-mentioned business on provinces such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou, to develop the frontier, complete the mission of lending funds to farmers, revitalizing the rural economy, promoting agricultural production, and improving progress. ㊀ The standard for farmers' land mortgage loans is one-quarter of the assessed value of the provincial land. The loan procedures are based on the principle of cooperatives relending to their members, with a maximum of twenty yuan per member. The purpose is limited to agricultural improvement, water conservancy for drought relief, construction of agricultural housing and warehouses, agricultural experiments, and other necessary items to promote agricultural production. ㊁ In addition to establishing farmers' loan offices in Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, etc., all provinces that have not yet established such offices will universally establish them. This type of loan is not for profit, but to remove the shackles of farmers' economic hardship, so that farmers in various places who work hard can share the benefits. At the same time, negotiations are being held with the provincial governments to jointly operate agricultural warehouses, with the bank providing funds for the construction needs. At the same time, a large amount of funds are being prepared to open up storage and pledge services.

### The Supervisors and Committee Members of the Film Association to be Sworn in Today

The Shanghai Film Production and Industry Association will hold a supplementary inauguration ceremony for the executive supervisors and committee members tomorrow at the association's premises in the Pudong Building, followed immediately by the first joint meeting of the executive supervisors and committee members. Among the issues listed on the agenda, the Cantonese sound film issue and the new theater issue are the most important. According to the association's spokesperson, regarding the ban on shooting Cantonese sound films, the members of the association have never made any requests to the central government in the past. The Film Censorship Committee's issuance of an order banning the shooting of dialect films was a measure taken automatically by the China Film Association based on promoting the unified national language policy. When the ban was first issued, although there was no association organization at the time, the companies had once gathered to discuss asking for the order to be withdrawn. Later, they recognized that unifying the national language was indeed an important policy for uniting all ethnic groups and resisting foreign aggression. Therefore, they unanimously obeyed the ban. In addition to stopping the shooting of Cantonese sound films in Shanghai, the filming locations set up in Hong Kong were closed one after another. In the past, due to environmental factors, this ban could not be implemented in South China, causing great losses to the law-abiding companies. Furthermore, because film producers in South China used their special status to compete in shooting Cantonese sound films, the mission of Mandarin films to assist the national language unification policy could not achieve its publicity effect in South China and Nanyang. They deeply felt that the losses suffered had no value. Later, with national unification, the reliance on defying government orders in South China has been completely eliminated. The Film Censorship Committee, with great magnanimity, did not investigate the past faults of the companies in South China. In addition to setting up remedial measures to preserve the established facts, the implementation of the ban was repeatedly extended. The member companies of this association, or those who suspect that the central government has no determination to implement the ban, inquired on the 9th of this month, believing that if the central government does not intend to implement the ban, the member companies of this association not only have the full ability to produce Cantonese films, but can also plan to produce other dialect films. Upon receiving approval, it was learned that the central government has set July of this year as the deadline for shooting Cantonese films. The film companies in South China were therefore panicked and launched a "Save the Cantonese Film Industry" conference, attempting to resist stubbornly. They also made unfounded accusations against the member companies of this association. It is now heard that representatives from South China have gone to Beijing to request the cancellation of the ban. This association, taking into account the future of the industry and the value of respecting the law and following policies, will gather tomorrow to discuss and issue a statement to the people of the country in order to seek a fair judgment. As for New Earth films, although they have now naturally stopped being shown, the value and responsibility of the Public Works Department's censorship of films must also be estimated and studied. When New Earth films were shown at the Donghe Theater on the second day, the Secretary-General of this association personally went to buy a ticket to watch. In front of and inside the theater, in addition to the protection of the Japanese naval landing force, there were Chinese and Western detectives across the street from the theater, clearly responsible for protection. From this, it can be seen that the Public Works Department did not strictly prohibit the showing of New Earth. Furthermore, the Japanese are promoting that this film is a product of German-Japanese cooperation, and they will also ask the German consul whether the country agrees to cooperate on this film in the position of the German state.

### Feng Yixian and Others Initiate the Construction of a Memorial Stele for Zhang Qun

Zhang Made Contributions to Shanghai During His Tenure as Mayor

The Shanghai Municipal Government has decided to hold a tenth anniversary conference on July 7th in the city center, while simultaneously exhibiting agricultural, industrial, and commercial products and political and academic achievements to promote encouragement. It is heard that over a hundred people in the education sector, including Feng Yixian, believe that the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan, today's great construction, and the scale of a modern city should be attributed to the grand strategy of former Mayor Zhang Qun. Out of gratitude, the citizens should express something. When former Mayor Zhang Qun was in office, he sought to reduce expenses in everything, alleviating the burden on our citizens. Recalling that when he left, there was still 800,000 silver dollars in the treasury. The government was thrifty, the people were safe, and he had a good relationship with the community. Therefore, it has been specially proposed to erect a memorial stele at the tenth anniversary to preserve the memory of his virtue. Currently, joint initiators are being sought from all sectors. It is estimated that individuals contribute one yuan and groups contribute two yuan, and the total amount should not exceed ten yuan, to comply with Zhang's original intention of thrift and frugality. Those who wish to participate may quickly send a letter to Mr. Feng at the Municipal Education Association on Dajilu Road. A formal meeting will be convened and prepared in the shortest possible time. The location of the stele will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.

### The National Rice Inspection Team from Five Provinces and Cities to Gather in Shanghai and Depart Tomorrow

Gu Xinyi Banquets Anhui Representatives; Zheng Baozhao Will Be Recommended as the Head of the Team

The National Rice Transport and Sales Inspection Team organized by grain merchants from five provinces and cities including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei has been prepared and decided to gather in Shanghai tomorrow and depart by ship. Sun and Xu, two representatives of Anhui grain merchants, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, held a banquet last night to welcome them and discuss the establishment of a national rice transportation and sales company in five provinces and cities. Currently, representatives of grain merchants from Jiangsu and Hunan have decided to gather in Shanghai today. It is heard that the head of the team has been determined to be Zheng Baozhao, director of the Grain Transport and Sales Bureau. The purpose of the inspection is: ㊀ What types of rice and grain are most suitable for consumption in South China; ㊁ How to stabilize prices so that they meet the needs of both production and consumption; ㊂ What kind of organization of the market is reasonable to reduce costs, facilitate transportation and sales, connect feelings, eliminate gaps, and ensure that national rice is completely unimpeded in the country. The inspection locations are Fujian, Xiamen, Chaozhou, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other places. They will first go to Guangdong and then to other places for thorough inspection. The trip will take about a month. If time permits, they may go to Annam and Saigon to inspect the rice-producing areas. Gu Xinyi was previously nominated by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to participate as a representative, but now that Gu is busy with affairs, he has asked to withdraw and will nominate someone else to join.

### Chinese Buddhist Association Rectifies Alms-Seeking Methods

Striking Wooden Fish and Gongs Does Not Violate Current Systems

The Chinese Buddhist Association received a report from the Hankou City Branch regarding the reorganization of monastic alms-seeking methods. The association considered the matter feasible and, in addition to instructing all temples across the country to comply, specially replied to the branch yesterday: "The report and the outlines have been received and examined. The various methods prescribed are feasible and should be put on file. However, the reference to striking wooden fish, gongs, chanting, and barefootedness in Article 6 of the rules does not violate the current monastic system and should not be restricted. As for the fact that the supervisors, councilors, and alternate supervisors and councilors can all report to the police, which may lead to abuses, it should be decided by the council. It is hereby revised."

### The Public Works Department Again Bans the Screening of Humiliating Chinese Films at the Donghe Theater

Defense Line 8,000 Kilometers Long; Even More So Than New Earth

The Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that after the film "New Earth" was banned from screening by the Public Works Department, unexpectedly, the national policy film "Defense Line 8,000 Kilometers Long", which was about to be screened at the Donghe Theater, had problems after being screened for relevant authorities on the 12th. At 10:00 a.m. on the 12th, the police station of the Japanese Consulate General received a notice from the Public Works Department's Film Review Committee, banning the screening. (Reporter's note: This film completely depicts how the Manchukuo puppet organization developed and constructed, humiliating our country everywhere, exaggerating Japan's military might in Manchuria, and is even worse than "New Earth". The Public Works Department, in order to avoid stimulating the bad feelings of our citizens, justly banned the screening.)

### Narcotics Seized from Two Koreans

Totaling More Than Thirty Ounces; Arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai-Pingcheng Train

At around 7:40 a.m. yesterday, when the Shanghai-Pingcheng train arrived at the North Railway Station, two Koreans, Wen Zanlin, 38 years old, and Liang Guijun, 29 years old, were each carrying a suitcase. During a travel inspection by Jianghai Customs investigators stationed at the station, two large packages of heroin were found in the specially made waistbands (shaped like small vests) worn by the two Koreans, totaling more than thirty ounces. The two Koreans were taken to the Railway Police Station by Lun Wen and transferred to the North Station Branch for detention. Liang Fuchu, the chief of the branch, notified the Japanese Consulate to send Japanese personnel to the scene to take them back for interrogation and punishment. The more than twenty ounces of heroin were confiscated by customs.

### 76-Year-Old Overseas Chinese Has No Home to Return To

Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Helps Find Nursing Home

Yang Xishan, an elderly overseas Chinese from the United Kingdom, 76 years old, returned to the country alone on the 8th of this month because he did not forget his motherland, after being in the United States for more than 30 years. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, it was learned from the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau that after the elderly overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai, he had no relatives to rely on in his hometown of Tianjin, and they did not recognize each other. He had the feeling of "leaving home young and returning old." Furthermore, the overseas Chinese had no home to return to, so he was still staying at the Juegong Shun Inn in Shiliupu. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sympathized with his situation and has been trying to find a charitable organization with nursing home facilities to send him to for care for the rest of his life.

### High Tide on the Huangpu River During the Dragon Boat Festival

Reaching Nearly Eleven Feet; Low Roads Were Flooded

The tide on the Huangpu River was quite high yesterday morning. According to records from the Dredging Bureau, the high tide occurred at 3:10 a.m. yesterday, reaching nearly eleven feet. This was due to the low atmospheric pressure, which exceeded expectations. It began to recede at 6:00 a.m. and returned to normal by noon. Furthermore, during the high tide, gutters in front of the China General Merchandise Company on Sichuan Road, the Jincheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, and other places were seen to be overflowing with water.

### Robbers Open Fire to Resist Arrest on Tiantong'an Road

Five People, Including Men and Women, Captured; One Handgun and Eight Bullets Seized

Miao Yizhi, a detective officer from the 7th Brigade of the Municipal Central District Detective General Team, received a tip at around 5:00 PM on the 11th of this month that seven or eight robbers had come to Shanghai from Jintan County after looting and were hiding in a certain place. After receiving the report, the detective officer immediately reported to Squad Leader Cao Jinda, and squad leader Min Hensheng, who in turn reported to the General Team Leader Liu Huai, who sent Tao Jinsheng to assist the entire 7th Brigade in the investigation. After capturing two robbers, Xiao Qiu and Xu Hongfei, at the North Railway Station, they confessed that they had robbed a pig shop outside the east gate of Jintan County and brought a large number of items in suitcases. They also revealed that there were many accomplices with two handguns, but they did not know their addresses, but they often passed through Tiantong'an Road. After receiving the confession, the detective officers waited at that location for two days without success. At around 1:00 AM yesterday, Detective Miao and Tao Jinsheng, who were sent by the General Team, along with police officer Zhou Zhongying from the local police station, encountered six robbers in front of a barber shop at 641 Tiantong'an Road. The detective officers stepped forward to investigate. At that time, two robbers knew that the situation was not good and opened fire to resist arrest. The police officers returned fire. As a result, one robber, Zhang Yongqing, was captured. A handgun, number 400062, containing eight bullets, was seized. Fortunately, it was late at night and there were no pedestrians on the road, so no one was injured. After the robber was taken into custody, he confessed that his accomplices lived at 22 Tongji Road at the intersection of Hengfeng Road. The team then joined forces with the Hengfeng Road Police Station and sent officers to Tongji Road to arrest Wei San and Wei Chenshi, as well as seizing stolen ocean of one hundred and twenty yuan, which was confessed to have been looted from the Zhoujiaqiao Ancestral Hall in December of last year. Currently, a total of five robbers, including men and women, along with a handgun, eight bullets, and stolen goods, were sent to the Detective General Team for interrogation yesterday.

### Method of Compiling Income Tax Returns (32)

— Pan Shihao, Ming Shan

Editor's Note: Since its publication, the method of compiling income tax returns has been well-received by readers. However, due to space limitations, it has sometimes been difficult to publish even after strenuous efforts to reduce other submissions. As a result, readers have often been dissatisfied, frequently inquiring and urging us to complete the publication as soon as possible. Looking back to its initial publication four months ago, it is clearly no longer appropriate to delay further. However, publishing it in installments within the commercial news section would mean it is not known when we could fully complete it. Therefore, we have no choice but to use the space in this issue's special economic publication to publish all remaining articles. Another article, "Key Points of Revised Guidelines for Various Types of Income Tax Collection," will still have to wait for continued publication tomorrow. However, as there is also a large backlog of submissions for the special economic publication, and today's issue is again occupied by income tax matters, the editor expresses sincere apologies to all contributors of the special publication.

㊉㊂ First Category, Item One: Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Tax for Temporary Profit-Making Businesses Where Income Cannot be Calculated Based on Capital

Income tax for profit-making businesses is divided into three categories: A, B, and C. Item one refers to income tax from temporary profit-making businesses. These types of temporary profit-making businesses either have established capital or no capital at all. For those with capital, tax is levied on the percentage of actual net profit to the actual capital amount. When filing, the report forms for self-assessment of income tax for profit-making businesses under categories A and B are used. Those without capital use this form for filing.

According to the provisions of Article 12 of the Implementing Rules, income from buying and selling goods, securities, or gold and silver currency unrelated to the primary business is considered temporary profit. The same applies to non-business individuals who engage in the aforementioned buying and selling but do not settle with physical delivery on the agreed date. This article applies regardless of whether there is capital or not. As for whether temporary business income should be self-assessed or withheld, there are explicit provisions in Article 27 of the Implementing Rules. It states, "For those belonging to Item C of the first category, if there is a paying organization, the person in charge of the organization shall withhold the tax on behalf of the taxpayer. If there is no paying organization, the taxpayer or their agent shall pay it themselves." According to this provision, temporary profit-making income, such as that from trading in stock exchanges or markets, should be withheld by the broker who is the paying organization. Only when there is no paying organization, such as in ordinary market transactions, can the taxpayer (or their agent) pay it themselves. However, Article 12 of the Implementing Rules explicitly stipulates that income not calculated under the revenue item of the primary business is considered temporary profit-making business. Therefore, for any temporary profit-making income, as long as it is included under the revenue item of the primary business, there is no need for a separate income tax return. Even if the source of income involves a paying organization such as an exchange broker, the taxpayer can refuse the broker's withholding of income tax. However, the term "primary business" in Article 12 of the Implementing Rules should refer to profit-making businesses under categories A and B. Furthermore, it should refer to the fact that profit-making businesses under categories A and B must calculate the total income from their profit-making business, calculate the tax amount, and pay income tax to the local competent collection agency. If the taxpayer does not have this qualification, the paying organization should withhold income tax on their behalf. The report for such withholding is a separate Report Form for Withholding Income Tax on Income from Buying and Selling Securities, Goods, Gold, and Silver Currency, which is not within the scope of this form.

If a profit-making business has branches, and its head office is outside the Republic of China while its branches are within the country, or if the branches are outside the country while the head office is within the country, according to the provisions of Article 5 of the Implementing Rules, regardless of whether the capital is divided or not, profits generated from domestic business operations must be taxed as temporary profit-making business income and taxed at the tax rates specified in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. The tax rates in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations are for those whose income cannot be calculated based on capital, and naturally apply to the format of this form. However, according to the provisions of Article 1 of the Collection Guidelines for this category, the aforementioned situation of branches being outside the country while the head office is within the country refers to cases where the entire business location of the branches is outside the country. If only part of the branch is outside the country, the profit-making income of the domestic part can still be calculated based on capital. Only the profits from business operations in the foreign part need to be excluded from the net profit of the head office. It is common for domestic profit-making businesses to have some branches operating abroad. Taxing them entirely according to the provisions of Article 5 of the Implementing Rules would result in an unbearable tax burden. The Collection Guidelines supplement this by allowing them to still calculate income tax according to profit-making businesses under categories A and B, which is very appropriate. As for excluding the foreign profits from the head office's net profit, this is also naturally in accordance with the principle of territorial taxation. However, with such a division, the branches in the foreign part must divide or estimate their capital to be deducted from the capital of the domestic head office." The method of compiling this form is explained as follows:

㊀ Type of Business, Taxpayer's Name, Address: The taxpayer is the tax obligor, i.e., the filer of this form. The name, address, and type of business should be clearly stated in this form. The purpose of this form is often for temporary profits in ordinary markets, such as when a non-business individual buys or sells goods, securities, or gold and silver currency outside of stock exchanges or markets. Such profits may also be made by several partners. However, partnerships with established capital must use the Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Tax for Profit-Making Businesses under Categories A and B for filing, which is unrelated to this form.

㊁ Settlement Date, Reporting Date: The settlement date is the date on which the income from the temporary profit-making business is calculated. The reporting date is the date on which this form is filed. Both should be clearly stated in this form. According to the provisions of Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations, income tax for Item C of the first category, whether withheld or self-assessed, should be reported within one month after the settlement date. According to the provisions of Article 26 of the Implementing Rules, this type of income tax should be paid within twenty days from the settlement reporting date. The term "settlement" used in the articles refers to calculating the income amount in the accounting books. Whether this income has been actually received or not is not a concern of the tax law.

㊂ Total Revenue, Business Expenses: Total revenue is the total revenue actually received and receivable from business operations. Business expenses refer to necessary and reasonable expenses already paid and payable but unpaid in business operations, excluding bad debts, depreciation, and inventory consumption, as well as other donations and fees. This type of revenue and expenditure forms the basis for calculating the net profit amount, and should be clearly stated in this form. Revenue should include all profits from the current business operation. Expenses are subject to certain restrictions according to the provisions of Article 15 of the Implementing Rules and Article 14 of the Collection Guidelines for this category. In terms of legal intention, a detailed statement of revenue and expenses should be attached. Assets and liabilities should also be listed in a table for reporting. The provisions of Article 24 of the Implementing Rules are quite clear in meaning, but the format of this form does not have such provisions.

㊃ Net Profit Amount, Tax Payable: The net profit amount is the total revenue minus business expenses, which is the income amount. Based on this net profit amount, multiply it by the tax rate stipulated in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations to obtain the income tax payable, which should be clearly stated in this form. Article 7 of the Provisional Regulations states that income from the first category should be taxed based on net profit calculation, and the net profit amount recorded in this form is of this nature. According to the provisions of Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations, the tax rate for income from Item C of the first category that cannot be calculated based on capital amount is a progressive tax rate on the full amount. It starts from 30 per mille for income of 100 yuan or more but less than 1,000 yuan, and progresses to 200 per mille for income of 18,000 yuan or more. Compared to the tax rate for income tax under categories A and B, which has a maximum of 100 per mille, the tax rate is heavier, but income less than 100 yuan is not taxed.

The above is the method of compiling this form. After this form is completed, the taxpayer, i.e., the filer of this form, should sign and affix their seal, and file it with the local competent collection agency.

㊉㊃ Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Tax for Profit-Making Businesses Under Categories A and B Due to Merger, Dissolution, Closure, or Transfer

Article 22 of the Implementing Rules stipulates, "For profit-making businesses under categories A and B of the first category, if there is still income after merger, dissolution, closure, liquidation, or settlement, the income amount should be reported. If there is still income after bankruptcy is declared and liquidation is carried out, the bankruptcy trustee should report the income amount." Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines for this category states, "...due to merger, dissolution, closure, transfer, after liquidation or settlement...". This form is the report form used to report the income amount from this liquidation or settlement. The settlement of income amount for profit-making businesses under categories A and B of the first category is based on the net profit amount. The net profit amount is naturally the same as the difference between the total assets amount and the total capital and liabilities amount. However, there is a difference between the ongoing and liquidation settlement of various assets and liabilities. An ongoing settlement is based on use value, while a liquidation settlement is based on sales value. The same asset will naturally have different valuations depending on whether it is valued based on sales value or use value. The same liability will also have valuation differences depending on whether it is calculated based on a continuing nature or a settled nature. Usual settlements of items A, B, and C are ongoing settlements, while settlements at the time of merger, dissolution, closure, transfer, etc., are sales settlements. The net profit amount resulting from the latter will naturally differ from the former. Therefore, the nature of the income amount reported in this form differs from that calculated in the Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Tax for Profit-Making Businesses under Categories A and B. Suppose a certain business has reported its income at the end of the year according to the method of usual settlement. If it is also necessary to close the business by means of merger, dissolution, closure, or transfer, the assets and liabilities should be separately calculated to determine the remaining amount of property, which should be compared with the original property amount. The income tax should then be deducted from the excess amount. The purpose of this type of income tax seems to be to crack down on those who conceal their profits during usual settlements. Those who deliberately suppress the valuation of their assets or hide their revenue during usual settlements will have their true situation exposed during mergers, dissolutions, closures, and transfers, as they are required to settle based on sales value. It is only natural to calculate the excess over the original settlement amount based on the true situation and levy income tax. However, according to this meaning, it is only appropriate to levy tax on the profits that have not been taxed. The following can be listed as profits that have not been taxed:

㊀ Appreciation of Assets: Assets should be depreciated, bad debts should be written off, and intangible assets should be amortized during usual settlements, so the recorded amount on the balance sheet is often reduced below the actual amount. This reduction is legal as long as it does not conflict with the asset valuation method attached to the Collection Guidelines for this category. The competent collection agency naturally has no way to tax the profits hidden by the legal price reduction during usual times. However, assets should be revalued during liquidation or settlement. The first item of the asset valuation method stipulates that "at the time of merger, dissolution, closure, transfer, and liquidation, the market price shall be the standard for valuation," which means this. Therefore, for those whose actual asset amount is less than the book value, the value should be increased. Excessive provisions for bad debt reserves and depreciation reserves should be included in earnings. Items such as brand name and trademark rights that can be sold at a price higher than the book value should also be treated as profit. As for assets not on the books that can be sold for a price, they should be included in profit.

㊁ Deduction of Liabilities: Liabilities are valued at the full amount according to the book value during usual settlements. If part of the liabilities can be deducted during liquidation or settlement, it should be transferred to profit. For example, issuing bonds at a reduced price or receiving discounts on purchase accounts.

㊂ Revenue Receivable: If the calculation of profit and loss is based on actual receipts during usual times, the revenue receivable that has not been entered into the accounts must be estimated during liquidation or settlement.

㊃ Recovery of Donations and Fees: If the calculation of profit and loss is based on actual payments during usual times, the donations and fees already paid that can be recovered should be transferred to profit during liquidation or settlement. If the accrual system is adopted, any portion that can be written off should be written off.

㊄ Legal Reserve Fund: According to the provisions of Article 15 of the Implementing Rules, the income tax of limited companies and limited partnership companies can be calculated after deducting the legal reserve fund from the net profit amount. This legal reserve fund is the untaxed portion of retained income.

The five types mentioned above are untaxed profits. There is no need to calculate the tax payable on them during usual times. They should be calculated during liquidation or settlement. However, it should be noted that the valuation of assets can be higher or lower than the book value. Liabilities can be reduced, or new ones can arise. Other profit and loss items include revenue receivable and revenue to be returned. Donations and fees include those to be recovered and those to be supplemented. The entire account, whether it is profit or loss, must be summarized and reconciled to determine whether the property value during liquidation or settlement is higher or lower than during the usual settlement. If it is higher, the excess over the original property amount should be taxed, and the previously accrued legal reserve fund should be separately taxed. If it is lower, the accumulated legal reserve fund should first be used to cover the losses, and then the remaining amount should bear the income tax.

The reason why liquidation or settlement is required at market prices during mergers, dissolutions, closures, and transfers should be further explained. The original business of those who dissolve, close, or transfer their businesses through liquidation or settlement is terminated, and all property should be distributed immediately. It is only natural to settle at market prices after the termination of the business. As for mergers, according to popular understanding, the original business seems to exist in the business after the merger. However, from a legal point of view, the business organized after the merger is newly established, and the one being merged should be eliminated. Since the business is eliminated, it should also be settled at market prices, which are the settlement value.

Since the introduction of income tax, partnerships have been reorganized into companies one after another. Reorganization is legally the elimination of the old organization and the emergence of the new organization. If the price at the time of elimination of the old organization is higher than the closing price as of December 31, 1936, this form should also be reported, and income tax should be paid. As for the taxation of income from future mergers, dissolutions, closures, and transfers, the legal reserve fund portion should be limited to those generated after January 1, 1937.

The method of compiling this form is explained below:

㊀ Taxpayer's Name, Address, Type of Business: The taxpayer is the tax obligor, and their name, address, and type of business should be recorded in this form. In the format of this form, the words "(or Liquidator/Trustee)" are noted in parentheses next to the taxpayer's name, which is used by the designated liquidator or trustee handling merger, dissolution, closure, transfer, and other matters. The Company Law and Bankruptcy Law have provisions for the name of the liquidator. As for the trustee, this provision only exists in the previously abolished Provisional Regulations on Debt Repayment for Merchants. In terms of the jurisprudence of current laws, it seems more appropriate to call them liquidators. Any business owner, shop, firm, factory, etc., can serve as a liquidator. Persons other than the business owner can also serve as liquidators through the election of shareholders or the appointment of the court. When a person other than the business owner serves as the liquidator, the type of business recorded in this form should be the type of business of the profit-making enterprise being liquidated.

㊁ Settlement Date, Reporting Date: The settlement date is the settlement date of the income reported in this form, and the reporting date is the filing date of this form. Both should be clearly stated in the form. According to the provisions of Article 22 of the Implementing Rules, the income reported in this form should be reported to the local competent collection agency within twenty days from the settlement date. According to the provisions of Article 26 of the same Implementing Rules, the tax payment should be made within twenty days from the reporting date. The income tax reported in this form is a settlement income tax, which must wait until all accounts have been settled before this form can be compiled.

㊂ Original Capital Amount, Remaining Property Amount: Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines for this category stipulates the following for the remaining property amount after liquidation or settlement: "Except for those on which income tax has been levied, the portion exceeding the original actual capital amount shall be taxed on the excess portion." This actual capital amount and remaining property amount should be recorded in this form. According to the format of this form, it is the original capital amount rather than the actual capital amount. To comply with laws and regulations, it is of course advisable to change it to the actual capital amount. However, the income from liquidation or settlement must always be the difference between the property after liquidation or settlement and the property settled during the usual settlement before liquidation or settlement, plus the tax-free government bonds, which is the income amount. According to the provisions of Article 7 of the Implementing Rules and Article 6 of the Collection Guidelines for this category, the so-called actual capital amount is the paid-up capital plus one-third of various reserve funds and retained earnings. Compared with the above provision, the nature of the property settled during usual settlements seems to be different. Whether Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines should be revised seems to be worth considering.

However, on the other hand, the so-called "remaining property, except for those on which income tax has been levied, exceeding the original actual capital amount..." means that the remaining property should exclude the optional reserve fund and retained earnings on which income tax has been levied, and then compare it with the original actual capital amount. The remaining property after liquidation or settlement is the net asset excluding the optional reserve fund and retained earnings. If the original capital amount position in the form only records the actually paid-up or actually invested principal without including the reserve funds, etc., the portion by which the former exceeds the latter is the same as the total property after liquidation or settlement exceeding the total property settled during the usual settlement before liquidation or settlement, plus the untaxed legal reserve fund. Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines only needs to be explained in addition to what is called "original actual capital amount". Therefore, the original capital amount specified in the format of this form seems to be better than the original actual capital amount specified in the Guidelines.

㊃ Tax Payable on the Portion of the Remaining Property Amount Exceeding the Original Capital Amount: The portion of the remaining property amount exceeding the original capital amount, after deducting those on which income tax has been levied, is the income after liquidation or settlement. According to the provisions of Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines for this category, it should be taxed according to the tax rates in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. This tax rate is for those whose income from temporary profit-making businesses cannot be calculated based on capital amount. It starts from a minimum of 30 per mille and progresses to 200 per mille. Income less than 100 yuan is not taxed.

The so-called "deducting those on which income tax has been levied" naturally includes the optional reserve fund and retained earnings. The various actual reserves (i.e., reserves not intended to cover asset deficits) accrued during the usual distribution of profits should also belong to this category.

The above is a detailed description of the method of compiling this form. After this form is completed, the date should be recorded, and the responsible person of the report should sign and affix their seal, together with the liquidation report and settlement calculation report. They should be submitted to the local competent collection agency. The responsible person of the report is the liquidator during liquidation, the trustee during settlement, and the bankruptcy administrator during bankruptcy.

The liquidation calculation report or settlement calculation report is a detailed statement that must be separately prepared when reporting income from liquidation or settlement. This is explicitly stipulated in Article 23 of the Collection Guidelines for this category. The attachment of this type of detailed statement is naturally intended to indicate in detail the disposal of property and the source of income. Therefore, the gain or loss from the sale of assets and repayment of debts compared to the usual settlement before liquidation or settlement, as well as the organization of profit and loss accounts and the existence or surplus of the legal reserve fund, should all be indicated in this type of calculation report. The calculation method stipulated in Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines for this category, i.e., the portion of the remaining property amount exceeding the original capital amount excluding those on which income tax has been levied, should also be calculated in this type of calculation report.

㊉㊄ Report Form for Withholding Income Tax on Income from Buying and Selling Securities, Goods, Gold, and Silver Currency

Income from buying and selling securities, goods, gold, and silver currency is not within the scope of the primary business and is not included under the revenue item of the primary business. If a non-business individual earns income from this type of buying and selling, it is called temporary profit-making income. According to the provisions of Articles 12 and 27 of the Implementing Rules, if there is a paying organization, the person in charge of the organization should withhold income tax on behalf of the taxpayer. This form is used to report this type of income tax. Those who entrust a broker to trade on the stock exchange or market and do not have the taxpayer qualifications for profit-making businesses under categories A and B are most suited to the format of this form. This form is a report form and has an attached list to detail the income situation of each taxpayer. The amount recorded in the report form is based on the list. Therefore, when compiling the report form, the list should be compiled first. The method of compiling the list will now be explained first.

The income tax reported in the report form is a withholding tax. According to the provisions of Article 28 of the Implementing Rules, those withholding income tax should issue the income amount of each taxpayer. The purpose of the list is to comply with this article. The main items recorded in the list are as follows:

㊀ Withholding Agent: The withholding agent is the person withholding income tax. For brokers in the exchange, their account name should be recorded on the list. When settling transactions entrusted to them by clients, brokers should calculate the income tax based on the settlement income, withhold it on their behalf, and report and pay it in aggregate. However, clients who meet the provisions of Article 12 of the Implementing Rules to include it under the revenue item of the primary business can include the income from temporary profit-making under the revenue item of the primary business and wait until the end of each year to calculate the total income from profit-making businesses under categories A and B of this category and the income tax payable. Since there is no need for a separate settlement of profit and loss for each temporary profit-making transaction, there is no need for the broker to withhold income tax on their behalf. As for the broker themselves, who are originally profit-making businesses under categories A and B of this category, their income is not temporary profit or income. They should report their income amount and tax payable according to the format and compilation method of Form A of this category, i.e., the Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Amount for Profit-Making Businesses under Categories A and B, which is not within the scope of this report form and list.

㊁ Date: The date should be recorded in the list. According to the provisions of Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations, the withheld income tax for temporary profits should be reported within one month after the settlement. In the report form, there is only a settlement date but no reporting date. The list does not have a position for the settlement date for each taxpayer's income. Therefore, the notes at the bottom of the list also explain that this list must be filled out once a day, as temporary profits in the exchange are due to daily settled transactions.

㊂ Taxpayer: The taxpayer is the tax obligor, i.e., the income earner who bears the income tax. Their account name should be recorded on the list, which is the broker's entrusted client. According to the provisions of Article 2 on tax exemption in the Provisional Regulations, the income of legal entities in the first category that are not for profit-making purposes is exempt from income tax. However, according to the provisions of Article 13 of the Implementing Rules, non-profit legal entities or organizations that also operate for profit-making purposes are regarded as profit-making businesses. Therefore, anyone who entrusts a broker to buy or sell securities, goods, gold, or silver currency and earns income, regardless of whether they are a legal entity not for profit-making purposes, is a taxpayer.

㊃ Type of Business, Type of Income: The type of business refers to securities, goods, gold, silver currency, etc. The income amount is the profit from that business income. They should be separately noted in the list for each taxpayer. The income amount is the amount of profit earned from each temporary profit-making transaction. According to the provisions of Article 19 of the Implementing Rules, the income amount should be calculated at the settlement of each transaction. The income amount recorded in the list should be listed separately for each transaction.

㊄ Commission, Net Profit Amount, Withheld Income Tax Amount: According to the provisions of Article 7 of the Provisional Regulations, the income of profit-making businesses in the first category should be taxed based on the net profit amount. The broker's commission is a necessary expense for this business income, and the income amount minus the commission is the net profit amount. Based on this net profit amount, multiply it by the tax rate stipulated in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations to obtain the income tax amount to be withheld. The commission, net profit amount, and withheld income tax amount should all be noted in the list. If the net profit is less than 100 yuan, there is no need to pay tax according to the law. For those exceeding 100 yuan, the tax rate starts from 30 per mille and progresses to 200 per mille.

The above is the method of compiling the list. The income amount, commission amount, net profit amount, and withheld income tax amount in the list should each be totaled and recorded in the report form. What is recorded in the report form is based on the list. In addition to recording this type of amount based on the list, the report form must record the withholding agent's name, address, type of business, and settlement date. The date of tax payment, the name of the receiving agency, and the receipt number should also be recorded one by one. The responsible person should sign, affix their seal, and report it to the local competent collection agency. According to the provisions of Article 26 of the Implementing Rules, this income tax must be paid at the time of settlement and reporting.

The Report Form for Withholding Income Tax on Income from Buying and Selling Securities, Goods, Gold, and Silver Currency, and its attached withholding list, as described above, are all based on current laws and regulations and the formats issued by the Ministry. However, in Shanghai, after negotiations between the brokers' associations of various exchanges and the person in charge of the local competent collection agency, three key points have been newly decided: ㊀ For clients who include the income from this type of profit-making under the revenue item of the primary business and are not required by law to have the broker withhold income tax on their behalf, the broker is still responsible for reporting their income amount for comparison. ㊁ Clients who meet the qualifications in the previous item are limited to those with capital of 2,000 yuan or more and who have reported income tax for profit-making businesses. ㊂ The phrase "calculating the income amount at the settlement of each transaction" in the Implementing Rules refers to the profit and loss at the settlement of each transaction. However, it is also permissible to reconcile the profit and loss of multiple transactions to calculate income tax. This reconciliation must be settled at least once every three months.

Those who establish their own brands and accept clients' entrustments attached to the location of the exchange broker and then entrust brokers to trade on the exchange market using their own brand names as the account name are commonly referred to as small companies. The nature of a small company is no different from a broker without a broker's license, and they have no place on the exchange. However, in fact, they also have a considerable functional existence. It remains to be determined how to report and withhold temporary profit-making income for entrusted clients. From the perspective of the Exchange Law, small companies can only be regarded as introducers. The original entrusted clients should be accounted for in the broker's account, and the broker should report their income amount or withhold their income tax. From the perspective of the established habit, small companies can report or withhold the income amount and income tax of their clients themselves. The small companies themselves are also income tax taxpayers for profit-making businesses under categories A and B of the first category. It is hoped that the local competent micro-collection agency will indicate its attitude. (End of complete text)

### Agreed Cooperative Epidemic Prevention Measures by the Municipal Government and Concession Authorities

Increased Number of Vaccinations This Year

In order to prevent a cholera epidemic, the Municipal Government and the two Concession authorities have now decided on practical cooperative measures. It is reported that the Central Health Administration and the Public Concession authorities have prepared a large number of cholera vaccines, and the French Concession Board of Directors has also prepared 50,000 vaccines. Last year, the number of people vaccinated in the urban area was 461,354, in the Public Concession 224,036, in the French Concession 121,440, and at the Railway Health Office 15,320. The three authorities have decided to jointly launch a major publicity campaign this year, and the number of vaccinations is expected to increase. At the same time, various hospitals have also agreed to assist. Currently, the Municipal Hospital has prepared 180 cholera beds, the Public Concession 320, the French Concession 80, and the Yu Qiaqing Road Chinese Epidemic Hospital 6, etc. It is reported that the three authorities have now decided on a publicity strategy, asking citizens to pay attention to the following three points: ㊀ Be cautious about diet, do not eat raw or cold food; ㊁ Get vaccinated at various locations immediately; ㊂ If cholera symptoms are discovered, immediately send the patient to the hospital, and do not delay.

### Repeated Incidents of Negligence in Vacant Houses in Yangjing Town, Pudong

Another Fire Reported Yesterday Morning - An Unidentified Female Corpse Once Discovered

In the Dongzhakou area of Yangjing Town, Pudong, more than 40 thatched sheds were built during the 12th year of the Republic of China (1923). Due to years of disrepair, most of the facades are incomplete. Currently, there are more than ten families of Jiangbei origin living there, with the remaining houses vacant. In February of this year, a fire occurred in a vacant house, but fortunately it did not cause a disaster. Last month, an unidentified female corpse was discovered in a vacant house, and strange events have been occurring one after another. Yesterday morning, at around 1:00 AM, a fire broke out again in the vacant house numbered 832. Even during the intermittent rainy season, the roof surface was completely wet, yet fire broke through the roof. The fire was quite intense, and the patrol police sounded the alarm. Soon, the town's fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire, only burning down one and a half thatched sheds, avoiding a major disaster. Chief Cai of the police station in charge has ordered a summons to the house owner, Zhang, for questioning, to clarify the reason for the repeated fires in the vacant house.

### Strong Suspicion of Mother and Son for Killing and Hanging the Body on the Bed

Awaiting the Summoning of the Li Liao Mother and Son to Court for Interrogation and Investigation

Shen Zhang, the wife of Shen Liezhong, at No. 114 Xicun, Zhoujiadu, Pudong, was found hanging in front of the bed in the early morning a few days ago, with her head split open and blood all over the floor. This was reported previously. The day before yesterday, the deceased's husband, Shen Liezhong, submitted a petition to the local court, stating that his original surname was Cheng, 26 years old, from Nantong, and a technician at the Huafeng Enamel Factory. The deceased, Shen Zhang, was his wife, 24 years old, and her former husband had passed away. On the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar this spring, he was introduced by his aunt, Xue Shen, to marry into the family as a second husband. On the twenty-first of the same month, she received 77 yuan from a hui (mutual aid society) and 7 yuan in wages, totaling 84 yuan, all hidden in her waistband pocket. At that time, only Li Liao (also known as Mi Bo's mother), who lived together with them, knew about it. Suddenly, on the first morning of the fifth lunar month, she was brutally murdered, suffering knife wounds to her head and other places. All the hui money was also lost. Li Liao has an older son who works in a woolen mill, but he did not go to work that day. The Tangqiao police station in charge suspects Li Liao and her son and has arrested them one after another. He stated that he had only been married for half a month, and their love was strong, but the couple was suddenly separated, causing him deep pain. He requested justice, etc. The court appointed Prosecutor He Jingcen, accompanied by Coroner Shen, to the scene. The examination revealed that the deceased had indeed been murdered before being hanged in front of the bed to make it look like a suicide. The coroner filled out the death certificate and ordered the family to collect the body. In addition to the on-site investigation, the prosecutor also summoned the deceased's aunt, Xue Shen, and uncle, Zhang Shaoxiang, for questioning. They are waiting for the police局 to bring Li Liao and her son to court for further investigation.

### The Inside Story of Yarn Factory Foremen - Starting with Hiring, Then Selling Off Female Workers

Four Girls Boarded the Xiangyang Steamer to Anhui - Discovered by Investigators from the Relief Association

Many yarn factories have been opened in the Yangshupu area of the Public Concession, so there is also a large demand for female workers. Unexpectedly, there are some foremen or workers in the factory who have some influence and often go to Jiangbei to recruit girls from poor families, mostly around the age of seven or eight, bring them to Shanghai, and provide them with food, clothing, and accommodation. When they reach the age of twelve or thirteen, they rely on their influence to recommend them to work in yarn factories, and the wages they earn are also collected by these people. Some families even raise dozens of girls, with bunk beds set up in the house to accommodate them. When the foster daughters grow older, they arbitrarily force them to marry, so they can collect a sum of betrothal money, so they all profit greatly. Chen Lanying, a 21-year-old female worker from Taizhou at the Yong'an Yarn Factory, and her younger sister, Chen Xiao'er, 19 years old, and Zhou Zhaodi, 21 years old, from Yancheng, etc., were taken to Shanghai and raised by a worker named Li since they were young because they had lost their parents, and made them work. The year before last, when Lanying was 19 years old

### "Law" and "Human Sentiment"

— Quiet Observer

The "Endangering the Republic Case" of Shen Junru and the other seven gentlemen was opened for trial at the Jiangsu High Court the day before yesterday (the 11th). The judge has not yet pronounced judgment, and the outcome is currently unknown. Looking at general public opinion, most people hope they can be acquitted and released.

I am reminded of an ancient saying, "The kingly way is nothing more than human sentiment."

This is truly a golden prescription that will never fade! Be it the kingly way or the hegemonic way, be it impeccably grand classics or solemn and brilliant laws, they may rule the world with thunderous force; yet, there is always a truth residing coldly in everyone's heart, evaluating all right and wrong. This is "human sentiment." The common people are straightforward; their minds cannot hold so many articles. The grand principle is that anything that is considerate of human sentiment and reasonable, meeting the needs of the majority, is the basis of its existence. Otherwise, they will repay you with silent contempt.

It is said that the world is becoming increasingly civilized, and the only proof is that we have many laws, as strict as nets, densely covering the world, to eliminate all barbarism and evil. But conversely, the number of criminals is increasing. Is there anyone who loves crime as a habit? The reason lies in one thing: society is unreasonable, and the laws cannot adapt to the environment and era to compensate for society's defects, thus becoming unreasonable.

Forcing someone into a crime due to petty jealousy is the best example.

Not long ago, a news item appeared in the newspaper about a young girl who was already engaged and fell in love with a young man from the market. She became pregnant, and the young man's mother encouraged her to hire a midwife to induce an abortion. The matter was revealed, and the court filed a public prosecution. Abortion violates the prohibition, so the result of the trial was that the girl, the midwife, and the young man's mother were all guilty, while the young man alone was not held accountable. We think, is there anything more unreasonable in the world? Yet, according to the law, that is how it should be judged.

Therefore, in court, only the judge asks questions, and the defendant is not allowed to ask questions in return.

Getting rid of an unborn child is against morality, yes. But what if it isn't aborted? Does our society allow young girls to raise illegitimate children?

If such a counter-question were asked, the law would collide with the stone wall of human sentiment. Although the reasoning would still be extremely grand, it would be very "hegemonic."

However, it is not right to definitively say that the law does not consider human sentiment. But then there is another saying, "The situation is excusable, but the law is inexorable."

### Movement for Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment

— Li Yinfei

The Movement for Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment is now in its third year. In these three years, there have been some achievements: "The draft constitution announced on May 5, 1936, has a special article on the national compensation system: the National Judicial Conference has already resolved to have the Judicial Yuan submit it to the Legislative Yuan; this year's movement has resulted in a preliminary draft." It seems that the sound of footsteps is on the stairs, but when the person will come down is still unknown, and after the person comes down, whether it will be implemented, and to what extent it will be implemented, is even more uncertain.

Regarding the law, my knowledge is really too inadequate; however, I cannot say that I have no connection to it. In this prosperous age, "misfortune often comes from the sky while sitting at home." The situations vary in different places. There have been precedents where a red-covered "Call to Arms" was used to condemn someone as "reactionary." Those who usually can't help but read a little to fill their poor bellies are inevitably filled with apprehension, as if walking on thin ice.

Now, the preliminary draft of "Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment" is reportedly complete. When it will be announced and implemented is still unknown, but after implementation, "because the establishment of the compensation system for wrongful imprisonment will not only provide unlimited comfort, both spiritually and materially, to those who have suffered injustice and have been vindicated, healing the wounds inflicted on their hearts; but from a proactive perspective, it will enable officials in charge of criminal penalties to calmly and quietly seek the truth when hearing cases, without distorting the law, perfunctorily following procedures, or even fabricating unfounded charges," it will probably be able to achieve more or less. Although, "a perfect legal system should have no sentences," the existence of wrongful imprisonment already indicates that this country and society is not very sophisticated; and whether every wrongful imprisonment can be "vindicated" cannot be guaranteed now. However, it is better to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. "Judicial officials, mindful of the gravity of their responsibility, will examine cases and render judgments with greater care, indirectly achieving a preventive effect to some extent, which would generally be beneficial."

Therefore, I am extremely willing to provide as much support as I can for this "loud appeal" by the Bar Association, and because of this, I feel that the Bar Association's decision to only advocate and publicize it in June each year is too short, and there is a danger of sporadic effort.

And in addition to compensation for wrongful imprisonment, what cannot be left unsaid is how to ensure the implementation of the already established laws. Taking "small matters" as an example, such as the police often seen beating hawkers on the streets, is there such a provision in the law? And the detention must not exceed 24 hours, and if it exceeds the time, it must be sent to the court for trial, etc., I am afraid that only intellectuals who belong to the "higher Chinese" can enjoy this "privilege," right?

Naturally, this question is again reduced to "compensation for wrongful imprisonment," but before the law on "compensation for wrongful imprisonment" is announced and implemented, is this phenomenon allowed to exist?

And in various culturally backward villages, the law has become the genealogy of the gentry, which is even more of an "exception."

### A Visit to Ward Road Jail

— Special

The young children are divided into two categories: one is those sentenced to confinement in reformatories, and the other is those sentenced to confinement in prisons. This is because the First Special District Court often sentences young children aged 15 or younger to imprisonment, and youths aged 18 or 19 to reformatories, so they have to be confined separately, but their treatment is the same. The young children in the reformatory attend classes in the morning and learn crafts in the afternoon, while the other youths learn crafts in the morning and attend classes in the afternoon. Those with good behavior can also play various games in their spare time. Some young children study very diligently in the reformatory and have pure and kind natures, but once released from prison, they are again tempted by villains and become pickpockets. One young child explained the reason for his return to prison, saying, "If you don't steal outside, you'll starve to death." This is also the truth, so Assistant Warden Mr. Yan C.Y. Yen has contacted the business community to find jobs for many young children who have completed their sentences, but unfortunately, the public is not very enthusiastic about supporting this, and only the "Salvation Army Assistance for Released Prisoners Department" and a few other charitable organizations are willing to help, but unfortunately, they are all unable to do much because of insufficient funds. Anyone who has committed a crime and been in prison, no matter how willing he is to repent and start anew, others always feel some aversion to him. Therefore, finding jobs for these released youths makes people shake their heads at the first mention, which is the case in all countries, and Shanghai is naturally no exception.

Foreign criminals and foreign women are confined in another building. There are no Chinese women in Ward Road Jail. The meals of foreign prisoners are different from those of Chinese prisoners, and they enjoy more freedom than Chinese prisoners. Because there are not many of them (currently about 75), they are allowed to eat together. Except for foreigners who do not enjoy consular jurisdiction, criminals from other countries are confined in this prison, with Russians and Indians accounting for the most. Those sentenced to long-term imprisonment are confined separately. The consuls of these foreign prisoners' countries provide a certain amount of assistance per person per day. There are currently fewer than five women in the prison, who are cared for by female prison officers. They receive very good treatment. Their hardest work is making bedding and cleaning their cells, which is a task that every prisoner has to do every day.

Because there are so many Chinese, the working prisoners, more than two thousand, all live three to a cell. Although it feels a bit crowded, it reduces loneliness, so the prisoners prefer it. Work is a special enjoyment in the prison, because during work, they can occasionally talk to their companions, instead of being locked alone in a small room, as if in a tomb. Therefore, the working prisoners do not dare to commit offenses, lest they be expelled from the workshop and live that tomb-like life.

Before this new prison was built, a major prison break occurred in Shanghai in April 1929. At that time, a prisoner sentenced to death attacked a Western guard, seized a pistol, killed two Indian guards, and wounded three others. He was later shot and killed himself. After this incident, the guards in the prison were no longer allowed to carry weapons, and no one was allowed to leave the prison occasionally to deliver letters, etc., on behalf of the prisoners. We asked several prison officials why they thought the prisoners did not dare to attempt a prison break. Their answers were different. One said that because the life in the prison was better than outside, the prisoners had no intention of escaping. Another said that the prisoners knew that escaping would be difficult to succeed, so they naturally did not want to be foolish enough to do so. Both of these were quite reasonable.

Although the discipline in the prison is very strict, many prisoners, especially the general youths, feel quite settled in the prison. Naturally, there are also some who are very willing to get out of the cage as soon as possible. However, this is not something that children can do. The prison is surrounded by a 25-foot-high wall, and there are eleven watchtowers on the wall, guarded day and night by members of the Russian Legion. As long as there is any sign of trouble, the guard on the tower lightly presses a button, and the alarms all around will immediately sound loudly. Forty-six armed Russian soldiers, led by an officer, are ready to move out to deal with prison break incidents. In addition, there are 508 Chinese, Western, and Indian police and assistants guarding the prison.

### Sai Jinhua

— Jiu Chenhe

29

Sai Jinhua, considering the safety of the nation, and with the matter of peace hinged on her, did not refuse Li Hongzhang's request to talk to Mrs. von Ketteler. However, the wife of the ambassador because of the death of her husband insisted that the Empress Dowager pay for his life, and that the Qing emperor apologize, making Sai Jinhua feel this was reasonable and righteous, and creating difficulty for her. In the end, Sai Jinhua spoke about the greater picture, and expounded on the benefits for both nations, which finally got Mrs. Ambassador to agree to compromise.

To be helpful. For the sake of caution, the prisoners in the prison are not allowed to gather in large numbers. Each day, physical exercises are held in several batches, with a limited number each time. Prisoners eat in their own cells. Workshops are also limited to a certain extent, and each workshop has its door tightly locked, with an armed Indian guard standing outside the door. Prisoners are locked in their cells at 4:30 p.m., so they must have roll call before dark. They must all get up at 6:00 a.m. the next morning. The bolts on the cell doors are very heavy, and one person is dedicated to guarding each row of cells. Patrolmen make their rounds at night, and the guards must report to each station on time. If an accident occurs and the guards fail to report in time, an alarm will sound automatically.

These facilities and security measures undoubtedly prevent many prisoners from harboring thoughts of prison break. But if Ward Road Jail were to house the same number of foreign prisoners under the same conditions, it would be impossible to guarantee that they would not engage in prison break activities. Sitting alone in a small cell every day, with no companions and no diversions, only those with good behavior who can read occasionally get some books. This situation, except for Orientals, would cause agitation and disturbances. Apart from the two daily physical exercises, the only time the prisoners can dispel their boredom is when Chinese and foreign missionaries come to preach to them on Sundays. They occasionally cannot bear it and commit suicide by hanging, but this is a rare occurrence. The hospital in the prison has slightly better food and more comfortable living conditions, so they mostly hope to get sick, but how can they hope for illness if the illness does not come? Pretending to be sick cannot fool the doctor.

Prisoners can be visited by family or friends once every three months for ten minutes. But visitors must stand behind the rough wire mesh in the visiting room, a few feet away, with a narrow aisle for guards to pass through in between. Prisoners are not allowed to receive gifts, so they do not have the enjoyment of comforts, because even a wisp of smoke is enough to cause a stir. Their daily cost of living is 45 cents per person, with food accounting for 12 cents. Prisoners sentenced to death are confined in a separate row of cells. They are the same as the other prisoners and hold an optimistic outlook. What they hate is that after being sentenced to death, the execution is often delayed for a long time. When they walk the "last mile," they feel more heroic and brave than people of all other races. (The End) (Translated from the English Greater Shanghai Evening Post)
