Regarding the central government's view on the ratio between Guangdong currency and silver dollars, he believes there is no need for increase or decrease. The government already has a complete plan for rural development. The central government has not borrowed money from any foreign country at present. He will take a car to the province tomorrow morning, and then go to Qiongyai for inspection. He has decided to go to Yunnan, but whether he will go to Guangxi is undecided. (17th dispatch)

[Hong Kong] According to the Department of Finance, Song Ziwen's visit to Guangdong is mainly to organize the finance of Guangdong and Guangxi.

This rate will not exceed an increase of 5%. (17th dispatch)

The original telegram said: "Special Commissioner Guan Jiyu has returned to Sichuan and received your instructions. Yesterday, Chief Liu Zuofu also forwarded your handwritten letter. After reading it, I deeply admire your earnest teachings and am extremely grateful. However, after Chief Liu Hangchen relayed the military reorganization plan proposed by Minister He, I reported to you in a confidential telegram, respectfully accepting the plan. From the beginning, I never intended to reorganize the military in Sichuan by myself and then return it to the central government, and I have never had this intention. I believe that the reorganization of the military in Sichuan should be presided over by a committee. It is hoped that the committee can be established and operate as soon as possible. If the facts of reorganization are obvious, all rumors can be eliminated. According to Liu Hangchen, you have personally decided to appoint Minister He to preside over the Military Reorganization Committee. Please order him to come to Sichuan as soon as possible to discuss and implement the plan. As for the handwritten letter saying that I should still accommodate my opinions and not ignore the facts, it is my responsibility to report any ideas I have. I am grateful for your trust and responsibility. From now on, I will work harder to repay your kindness." (17th Central News Agency dispatch)

[Nanjing] Guan Jiyu telegraphed Beijing on the 17th, saying that Liu Xiang had expressed absolute acceptance of the points indicated in Chairman Chiang's personal letter regarding the reorganization of the military in Sichuan and Kang, and is now waiting for senior officials from the central government to enter Sichuan to preside over the matter.

### Liu Lu Yin Filed an Appeal

[Hankou] Liu Lu Yin's appeal was submitted on the 17th, stating that the content of the judgment was based entirely on conjecture regarding the facts, and the evidence was interpreted arbitrarily, even splitting up terms and forcing connections. For example, the "China Youth Anti-Japanese and Eliminate Traitors Special Service Team" was actually stripped of the word "Anti-Japanese" and changed to "China Youth Eliminate Traitors Special Service Team," causing a loss of authenticity. Its intentional bias is obvious to everyone. Criminal litigation adopts the principle of discovering the real truth. It is difficult to submit to such speculation and reckless judgment to convict people. In addition to submitting a separate statement of reasons, this is a request to review the files and send them to the second-instance court for review and relief. (17th dispatch)

### Three Committees of the Legislative Yuan Review the Reserve Bank Law

First Submitted to Ma Yinchu and Others for Preliminary Review Planned to be Submitted to the Yuan Meeting in September and October

[Nanjing] After the draft Central Reserve Bank Law was sent to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan for review, it was approved by President Sun to be reviewed by the Finance, Economy, and Legal System Committees as soon as possible. It is now learned that President Sun has changed the case to the Finance Committee to work with the Economy and Business Law Committees to handle it quickly. The Finance, Economy, and Business Law Committees held a joint meeting at the Yuan on the 17th to begin reviewing the case. Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Finance Committee, presided over the meeting.

After the meeting, Ma told reporters that the Central Reserve Bank Law is the fundamental law of national finance. When the central government discussed the case, experts had exhausted their efforts and spent two years determining the 29 principles of the case and the 12 transitional measures for reorganization, which shows the central government's emphasis on the case. Colleagues ordered to review the case must not act rashly and cause great harm. There should also be ample time for detailed research to ensure that the legislation is thorough. It is now scheduled to convene a preliminary review meeting starting this Saturday, but the summer vacation is about to begin, and it may be difficult to complete the review in a short period of time. At the earliest, it is planned to submit it to the Yuan meeting for review in September and October of this year. Ma continued to say that after the draft Central Reserve Bank Law is submitted to the Yuan, the regulations of the China Communications Banks and general commercial bank regulations should also be submitted to the Yuan in order. On the one hand, the national bank itself can be properly adjusted, and on the other hand, the business of the national bank and the commercial bank can be rationally distributed to seek the soundness of the entire banking system and the coexistence and prosperity of the banking industry. Ma also said that in recent years, local finance has been extremely depleted, and the Central Reserve Bank, which is in the position of a bank's bank, should be responsible for regulating it to avoid the malformation of finance. How the local financial organization and the Central Reserve Bank should be linked should also be stipulated by law. (17th Central News Agency dispatch)

### Current Commentary

### The Significance of Student Summer Service in Rural Areas

— Gao

President Chiang (蔣) recently gave a speech urging college and university students to use their summer break to serve in rural areas, recognizing this as the most effective work for saving the nation. His intention is that young people, while studying, must recognize the illnesses and shortcomings of society, and rise up together to bear the responsibility of reviving the nation. Chiang also earnestly and forcefully gave a leading directive, making this the important mission of a group of young students and clearly pointing out the common misconception that young people cannot save the nation while studying, considering this a great mistake. As the highest leader of the country places such expectations on students, how should young people strengthen their minds and bodies and strive to save the nation, so as not to fail this earnest expectation? We dare to elaborate on the meaning of what Chiang has pointed out.

Summer service in rural areas originally seems to be a small act. However, considering that this is the basic work for reviving the nation, the depth and greatness of its significance immediately becomes clear. Given the vastness of our country's territory, the complexity of its population, the difficulty of spreading education, and the lack of means to develop knowledge, the villagers scattered in remote areas are often muddled and unaware, hardly knowing of the Wei and Jin dynasties, let alone the Han. This is a common phenomenon among rural households. However, within their narrow scope, they are not without the power of unity, the emotion of excitement, the concept of love and support, and the spirit of loyalty and courage. It is only that they lack training on weekdays, leading to disordered steps. Moreover, due to prolonged isolation from the outside world, they inevitably become timid. Now, through the enlightenment of a large number of students and through close practical contact, we can activate their minds, dispel their doubts, clarify the nation's position, instill necessary knowledge, build upon their inherent strengths, provide appropriate training, follow their original spirit, and indicate the path they should take. Proceeding separately and developing step by step, it is not difficult to transform the ignorant and obsequious villagers, change their past appearance, and promote overall progress. Using this as the basis for saving the nation is truly the most effective work, not merely relying on physical strength to fulfill the responsibility of mutual assistance in a short period of one or two months.

As for the college and university students engaged in rural service, in terms of their own gains and losses, there is also something to be said. The analogy of peaceful pleasure as poisonous has been used for warning throughout history. During the idle days of the hot summer, it is difficult to avoid falling into decadence, which is of no benefit to the body and mind and makes one feel sorry for society. Now, being able to resolutely take on the work of leading the masses and taking the lead in awakening the deaf, there must be a special kind of happy emotion to inspire their spirit. Moreover, it can promote their own progress and develop their confidence in striving upwards. Who can tell the gain and loss? There must be those who can discern it. We further hope that the gentlemen engaged in rural work can still remember President Chiang's reminder to not forget to save the nation while studying and contribute their talents to the country at any time to promote the great mission. A shocking news is spreading daily. A serious incident occurred in Vladivostok.

### Shocking News Spreading Daily: Serious Incident Occurred in Vladivostok

White Russian Implements Party Purge, Chairman Commits Suicide, Political Situation Unstable, Moscow Uneasy

[Tokyo] Reliable sources here today received news from the Japanese side, again stating that a serious incident occurred in Vladivostok, but its nature was not explained. Considering the reports in various newspapers that the former Soviet ambassador to Japan, Yurenev (優列𣵀夫), was arrested, it seems not without reason. It is also learned that in Kiev and Odessa, the news of the execution of eight Red Army leaders caused great shock. Since the execution of these eight people, many people have been arrested, including not only Red Army staff officers but also German Soviet citizens and two foreign consulates who often went to Kiev and Odessa. According to the Asahi Shimbun's opinion, the Soviet Union is now standing at a crossroads, either restoring wartime communism or overthrowing Stalin's rule, one of the two must happen. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] According to local newspapers, due to differences in attitude between the Soviet Russian political police and the Red Army, infighting occurred in Vladivostok, and the entire port fell into chaos. Whether this news is true cannot be verified, as the port is now completely cut off from the rest of the world. Ships are prohibited from entering or leaving, and all trains and cars have been impounded. (National Hai Tong dispatch, 17th)

[London] According to news received here from Warsaw, the situation in Soviet Russia is becoming more serious day by day. In Moscow, the people feel deeply uneasy due to the nightly patrols of the political police and the army, which prohibit any gatherings. (National Hai dispatch, 17th)

[Moscow] The White Russian Soviet Republic, bordering Poland, recently carried out a major purge, involving the prime minister, state councilors, and members of the Communist Party Central Committee. This matter was announced at the Minsk White Russian Party Conference. It is said that there are secret Trotskyist spy and sabotage agencies within the country, overseen by the agricultural commissioner and the education commissioner. The "saboteurs" of the agricultural commissioner's department secretly harmed livestock and crops. According to a scientist at the Institute of Animal Diseases, he was ordered to apply cholera bacteria to cattle to kill their good breeds. It is rumored that collective farms are now used by Polish spies as places to hide. According to official news, the Chairman of the White Russian Republic, Chervyakov (契爾維亞哥夫), has committed suicide due to personal and family reasons. The former Prime Minister, Goloded (戈洛台德), has been arrested on charges of conspiracy. The independence of the White Russian Republic was recognized by the Soviet Union in 1919, and a military and economic alliance was concluded with it on January 16, 1921. The country includes the former Minsk government and part of the land of Vitebsk and Mogilev. It borders Lithuania and Poland to the west and Ukraine to the south. Minsk has a government university. The national population is about 200,000. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th, Reuters)

⊙ Warsaw. The Polish Telegraph Agency received a telegram from Moscow announcing that Sternin, Deputy Director of the Bureau of National Economic Statistics of Soviet Russia, has been dismissed and replaced by Saguja. The news agency continued that since Shi's new assignment has not been announced, this type of dismissal is usually a precursor to arrest. (National Hai Tong dispatch, 17th)

### Soviet Consul General in Harbin Recalled to Moscow

### Latvian Foreign Minister Visits Russian Authorities

[Moscow] Latvian Foreign Minister Manteš visited the Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, Molotov, today. It is generally believed here that this is a success of the policy of mutual support between Soviet Russia and the Baltic countries. Among the Baltic countries, Latvia is the most wary of Soviet Russia. The fact that a cabinet member from that country has come to visit and is formally received by the Soviet authorities makes Foreign Minister Manteš the first person. As for the purpose of this trip, it seems to be to negotiate a treaty. Regarding this, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov has already issued a statement expressing his willingness to respect Latvia's independence, which Foreign Minister Manteš will naturally take note of. In addition, Italy and Germany have been engaged in various activities in the Baltic countries for a long time, hoping to make each of these countries a vanguard against Soviet Russia. Now, Latvia, previously the most wary country, has also sent its foreign minister to visit, proving that the maneuvers of Italy and Germany have failed. The Soviet government believes that this is also of considerable benefit to world peace and that all those who wish to establish a collective security pact within the scope of the League of Nations are welcome by the Soviet government.

Newspapers and radio stations have published telegrams from workers and soldiers requesting the issuance of bonds. (National Hai Tong dispatch, 17th)

### US Far East Flagship Scheduled to Visit Vladivostok This Autumn for a Goodwill Visit

First Time in Fourteen Years

[Washington] The news reported in Shanghai that the US Navy Department plans to send the flagship "Augusta" of the Asian Fleet, commanded by Rear Admiral Yarnell, to Vladivostok for a goodwill visit this autumn has been confirmed today. This trip will be the first time in fourteen years that an American warship has visited a Russian port. (National Electric, 16th)

### Japan Actively Moving Towards Controlled Economy

Preparing to Organize the Japan Imperial Economic Conference; Ministry of Finance Decides to Strengthen Foreign Exchange Control

[Tokyo] Because Japan is now moving from a free economy to a controlled economy, the greatest mission of the Konoe Cabinet is to complete the economic planning program. It is reported that the current cabinet is planning to follow the procedures of the previous Hayashi Cabinet to organize the Japan Imperial Economic Conference as a consultation body for the realization of the entire planned economy. Before the organization of this conference, the Governor-General of Korea will convene the "Korea-Manchuria-North China Continental Economic Coordination Conference" in accordance with the outline determined by the Korea Industrial and Economic Research Society. Industrial and commercial enterprises related to Korea, Manchuria, and North China will be invited to participate. Cadres from the Korean Army, Kwantung Army, the Tianjin North China Garrison Army and South Manchuria Railway will form the core. Representatives from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs will also participate. The conference is scheduled to be held in mid-August this year. This continental economic coordination conference can be regarded as a precursor to the future Japan Imperial Economic Conference, so its significance is extremely important. The central issue of discussion will naturally include the method of Japanese economic forces invading North China. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)

[Tokyo] Japan is unusually anxious about this year's huge excess of imports and is close to intellectual exhaustion in maintaining the balance of international payments. Since March of this year, three batches of gold have been transported to New York, with a value of 150 million yuan. Now the fourth batch of gold, worth 50 million yuan, has begun to be shipped out. The amount of gold shipped out in the second half of this year will probably be smaller, but it will still not be less than 100 million yuan. For this reason, thoroughly planning imports has become the most urgent action. The validity period of the Exchange Control Law will end at the end of July. Under the current situation, it seems necessary to extend and strengthen it further. The Ministry of Finance has begun to discuss with relevant agencies the revision of the law to make it more restrictive. Under the current Exchange Control Law, foreign exchange below 30,000 yuan can be [processed] without waiting for the permission of the Ministry of Finance. The new law to be announced in the near future plans to reduce the above limit to 1,000 or 3,000 yuan. In the future, the revised law will effectively force various trades to obtain the permission of the Ministry of Finance, even if the amount of foreign trade is only a few thousand or three thousand yuan. The severity of the system can be seen from this. There is no doubt that foreign trade with Japan will also be greatly affected by the new measures. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### Japan Develops Aviation Industry

Preventing Investment Competition

[Tokyo] The enthusiastic expansion of Japan's military industry, especially in the aircraft manufacturing industry, is remarkable. In order to develop this industry, Japan has recently invested several million yuan of new capital. In addition to factories manufacturing aircraft and accessories, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nakajima Aircraft, Aichi Tokei Denki Seizo, Kawanishi, Tachikawa, and Tohoku Gas Electric Industry Company, Watanabe Iron Works, and Tokyo Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, the Aircraft Department of Kawasaki Shipbuilding, etc., three new aircraft manufacturing plants were established at the beginning of this year, namely ㊀ Yamato Aircraft Plant, with a capital of 12 million yuan, ㊁ Japan Aircraft Industry, with a capital of 20 million yuan, ㊂ Showa Aircraft Plant, with a capital of 30 million yuan. In addition, four factories manufacturing various parts of aircraft have been established. At the same time, the Kawanishi Tachikawa factory has increased its capital to expand its production capacity. On the surface, this is the beginning of a period of proliferation in the Japanese aviation industry. However, the current characteristics of the Japanese aviation industry are the intensification of financial competition, the differentiation of production, and the lack of standard products, which make the government authorities deeply concerned that the future development of the aviation industry will be seriously hindered by these weaknesses. Furthermore, the shortage of technically skilled labor has caused a comic situation of factories competing to hire labor and other similar disputes. For this reason, the military authorities are now planning to take advantage of the current sudden development of the aviation industry and work with the Ministry of Communications and Industry to formulate an "Aviation Industry Management Law" to prevent investment competition and stimulate the concentration of production and the standardization of products. Furthermore, in order to encourage the re-development of the aviation industry, prizes will be awarded to trial manufacturers, and import taxes on aircraft raw materials and income taxes for aviation industrialists will be exempted.

### Selection of President of Northeast Development Company Finalized

[Tokyo] The government is carefully considering the selection of the president of the Northeast Development Company (東北興業公司) because of the importance of its mission.

Prime Minister Konoe invited Yada to his official residence on the morning of the 17th and earnestly requested him to take office as president. Yada promised to reply later and immediately took his leave. It is generally expected that Yada's appointment will definitely be realized. (Allied News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### League of Nations Opium Committee Report Praises China's Anti-Smoking Achievements

Dissatisfaction with a Certain Country's Drug Policy Towards China

[Geneva] The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee's report, published today, states that due to the implementation of the 1929 and 1931 Geneva Conventions, there has been significant progress in the legal manufacturing of narcotics. The production of morphine and cocaine has only slightly increased compared to 1921 figures. Therefore, the amount of legally manufactured narcotics nearly matches global needs. The report also mentions the Chinese government's activities to ban drug use, aiming to reduce the number of smokers by one-fifth each year. It is said that after the Shanghai International Settlement strictly implemented the Chinese government's regulations, the number of Chinese secretly manufacturing heroin in 1936 has greatly decreased, and the same is true for other parts of China. However, the report expresses deep dissatisfaction with a certain country's foreigners smuggling opium, especially manufactured narcotics, into China, thereby undermining the Chinese government's efforts to ban smoking. The committee is also deeply concerned about the illegal trafficking and secret manufacturing of dangerous drugs in the Far East, stating that Hebei Province has become the largest center in the world for the illegal manufacturing of heroin.

### Dutch Gold Export Restrictions Relaxed

⊙Amsterdam. The Dutch Bank announced today that private storage of gold in the Netherlands may be re-allowed for unrestricted export. The announcement stated that the bank, upon the Prime Minister's orders, is prepared to unconditionally waive the restrictions in the ban on the export of gold coins and bars imposed in September 1936. The Dutch government's policy change is due to the recent continuous inflow of large amounts of gold, making it unnecessary for the Dutch Bank to maintain the ban.

### Germany Seeks Rapprochement with Britain and France; New Developments Expected in European Situation

French and German Chiefs of Staff Meet in Paris; Neurath to Visit Britain on Important Mission

[Paris] General Beck, Chief of Staff of the German Army, arrived here from Berlin at 9 PM last night. Many officials from the German Embassy in France were at the station to greet him. It is reported that Beck's visit is to meet with General Gamelin, Chief of Staff of the French Army, and other important French officials. The German Ambassador to France will host a banquet today to welcome Beck. Public opinion here welcomes the meeting between the Chiefs of Staff of Germany and France, considering it a clear symbol of progress in international relations. At the same time, it is speculated that German Foreign Minister Neurath's concurrent visit to Britain must have the same purpose. Beck will visit the battlefields near Nancy on his return to Germany. (National Maritime Telegraph, 17th)

[Paris] General Beck, Chief of the General Staff of the German Army, visited General Gamelin, Chief of Staff of the French Army, this morning after arriving here yesterday. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)

[London] Attention is being paid here to Foreign Minister Neurath's recent visit to Britain. This trip has become a topic of discussion among political figures. According to reliable sources, Neurath will stay in Britain for two to three days and hold talks with Foreign Secretary Eden and Prime Minister Chamberlain. He may also stay at Chequers over the weekend at Chamberlain's invitation. The definite agenda for the talks has not been announced, but it is emphatically stated that all issues concerning Britain and Germany will be discussed. The "Standard Evening News" commented on Neurath, pointing out that this action is entirely in accordance with the resolution of the Imperial Conference, that is, the difference in government forms should not hinder the friendship between the two countries. The "Star" reported that German Foreign Minister Neurath will negotiate with British politicians on the conclusion of a Western European pact to promote general peace in Europe. (National Maritime Telegraph, 17th)

[London] The "Daily Mail" foreign correspondent announced this morning that German Foreign Minister Neurath will raise the issue of colonial demands for discussion during his visit to Britain next week. It is reported that the representatives of the autonomous territories of the Imperial Conference have stated that if Germany agrees to participate in negotiations to resolve general European problems, they are willing to consider this issue. The correspondent stated that under these circumstances, the British government may be willing to discuss Germany's colonial demands and economic cooperation issues. (National Maritime Telegraph, 17th)

### Political Circles in Rome Closely Watching

[Rome] Italian political circles are paying close attention to German Foreign Minister Neurath's upcoming visit to Britain. Evening newspapers are publishing comments from Berlin stating that this visit will not affect the German-Italian axis. Generally speaking, this visit will ease the tense relationship between Britain and Italy. The Italian semi-official "Italian Daily" stated that there is no need to discuss the sudden change in German foreign policy, as German foreign policy is based on clearly defined principles, and the German-Italian axis is an expression of these principles. Although British-German talks are very important and should be closely watched, it is a conclusion that ignores the facts to believe that these talks will open up a new stage in European politics. The report also mentioned various issues between Britain and Germany, especially the colonial issue, which the British government will avoid discussing. (National Maritime Telegraph, 16th)

### British and French Public Opinion Express Expectations

[London] Regarding the invitation of German Foreign Minister Neurath to visit Britain, various newspapers here have continued to comment on it, all expressing satisfaction. The Daily Mail stated, "Mutual understanding between the peoples of Britain and Germany is the primary task. If the new government led by Prime Minister Chamberlain can strive to achieve something, it will surely be welcomed by the British people." The News Chronicle stated, "If Britain and Germany reach a mutual understanding based on maintaining and strengthening collective peace, Britain's prestige in Germany will also increase. We have always treated France as a friendly country and are willing to jointly maintain a collective security system. We also want to conclude a Western European pact with the relevant countries through the League of Nations, and then extend it to Eastern and Central Europe. Once Germany expresses sincerity and is willing to return to the League of Nations at an appropriate time and accept the Western European pact as a way to solve general European problems, it will be of great benefit to Britain, to Europe, and to human civilization. In short, this policy of Britain has been announced repeatedly and will not change. If Britain abandons France and abandons the collective security of all of Europe for temporary self-interest, it is a betrayal of the democratic front, and world peace will be greatly affected." (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)

[Paris] Regarding the invitation of General Beck, Chief of Staff of the German Army, to visit France, and the invitation of German Foreign Minister Neurath to visit Britain, the "Business Report" commented, "The German government is now prepared to consider the possibility of general disarmament. General Beck's visit will naturally be discussed with General Gamelin, Chief of Staff of the French Army. As for what British Foreign Secretary Eden should discuss with Neurath, the British and French governments seem to have agreed. Eden should test Germany's willingness to accept three things: ㊀ Germany should participate in the declaration of neutrality by Britain and France regarding Belgium; ㊁ The definition of aggressor in the new Locarno Pact; and ㊂ The procedures for identifying an aggressor. In addition, Eden should also inform Neurath that the relevant countries all hope that Germany will issue a declaration on the Central European issue to stabilize people's minds.

### Prime Ministers of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia Hold Meeting on Yacht

Romanian political figures have also said that the mutual cooperation of the three Little Entente countries in accordance with the consultation agreement should be reconsidered. Regarding this, Romanian public opinion has recently expressed dissatisfaction because Yugoslavia is not without bias towards Bulgaria, Italy, and Germany. This can be seen in the Romanian newspaper's tone. The World Report stated, "The mission of the Little Entente is not considered to be over by each other, but the recent incidents have made those who want to sow discord happy. Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović should have an explanation." (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)

### Rebel Army Fiercely Attacks Port of Bilbao

Cannon Fire Shakes the Heavens and the Earth; Defending Troops Fight to the End

⊙Near Bilbao. The rebel army today used airplanes and artillery to fiercely bomb Bilbao, the sound shaking the heavens and the earth. Large units of infantry are gradually advancing towards the southeastern suburbs. (National Telegraph, 17th)

⊙Bayonne, France. Bilbao, known as an unbreakable city for 700 years, is still engaged in a life-and-death battle between the two armies today, but the final fate has not yet been decided. According to information obtained here, the rebel army has been attacking the city for 75 days. The Basque defenders have suffered a total of 5,000 deaths and 17,000 injuries. The streets and houses in the city are filled with obstacles and hidden machine guns. It will take a lot of effort for the rebel army to completely occupy it. (National Telegraph, 17th)

⊙Madrid. Regarding the war situation in the area of the port of Bilbao in the Basque Country, according to the latest news, there are a total of 50,000 soldiers and officers in the city and suburbs of the port, all of whom are determined to coexist and perish with the territory. They are currently holding the defensive lines on the northeast side of the city and have not been attacked by the Nationalist army. In addition, on the northeast coast, the government army has also launched a counterattack, which has been quite successful. The "Labor World Report" here reported that the rebel offensive has been blocked near Mount Avril near the port of Bilbao. This mountain is enough to control Mount Begoña, and Mount Begoña is enough to control the city of Bilbao. Therefore, if the rebel army wants to advance to the city of Bilbao, it must cross these mountains, which is not easy. (Central News Agency, Havas, 16th)

### President Roosevelt Seeks Unity within the Democratic Party

Will Summon Representatives for Talks on Jefferson Island; Seeks to Resolve Differences of Opinion on the New Deal

[Washington] President Roosevelt has taken unprecedented measures to eliminate differences of opinion within the Democratic Party. Starting on the 25th of this month, he will convene 400 Democratic congressmen in three groups on the secluded Jefferson Island to discuss political affairs. During the meeting, reporters will only be allowed within fifteen miles of the meeting place, in Annapolis. President Roosevelt's move shows that his advisors fear that Democratic Party members will not only publicly split over the Supreme Court reform bill, but also over labor issues and social policies. Southern conservative Democrats are quite suspicious of the radical elements in the North and say that they may have surrendered to Lewis, the leader of the Committee for Industrial Organization. According to the opinion of the Southern Party members, the President should insist on opposing labor unrest, saving expenses and balancing the budget. However, the President believes that the country has granted privileges to implement a progressive and free policy, and he cannot abandon it halfway, causing the public to lose faith in democratic politics and move towards more dangerous remedies. It is reported that the entire administration will participate when the President holds meetings with Democratic congressmen. At that time, the President will do his best to reunite the deserters of the party. It is reported that the split between Congress and the President this time is the most serious critical moment since President Hoover. Recently, Vice President Garner suddenly left before Congress began to formulate Roosevelt's new laws and took a six-week vacation. It is said that Senator Robinson, the Democratic leader in the Senate, has sent a call for help to Roosevelt, saying that without a compromise, he will be unable to control the rebel party. Furthermore, the majority report of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the reform of the Supreme Court has caused the President to suffer extensive attacks, as the report explicitly denounced the President's plan as "an unnecessary, pointless, and extremely dangerous abandonment of constitutional principles."

### German National Church Designated as State Religion in Germany

[Berlin] The Ministry of Interior has issued an order recognizing the "German National Church" as the state religion of Germany. The so-called German National Church was founded by Dinter, one of the oldest members of the National Socialist Party. Later, Hitler granted him permission to leave the National Socialist Party so that he could concentrate on studying theology and preaching. He is known for his "Trilogy of Sins," namely, the sin of blood, the sin of love, and the sin of spirit. The National Church founded by Dinter has only a superficial relationship with Christian doctrine. He believes that the value of religion lies in blood, grace, and the manifestation of pantheism in everyone's soul. He opposes the doctrine of atonement and other Christian doctrines, considering them to be fabricated by Jews. The National Church still recognizes Jesus as the highest and unparalleled personality, but believes that Jesus came from the Aryan race of the Germanic people and that many of his gospels and sayings were fabricated by Jewish writers, thus gradually losing their truth. Dinter then compiled a new gospel based on the old gospels, considering it to be the truth of the Aryan gospel. Since the German National Socialist Party came to power, new sects have been extremely complex. The most extreme of these is the National Socialist "German Christianity," with Müller as its bishop. In addition, there are various "German religions," such as the Germanic mythology advocated by General Ludendorff, the German Faith Movement, and various old-style pagan religions that hold fire worship ceremonies in the forest, all of which can be called "German religions." The so-called German National Church is between the German Christian and German religious factions. (Central News Agency, Havas, 16th)

### Japanese Concession Police Station Detective in Tianjin Arrested for Protecting Opium

Implicated by Major Drug Dealer Chen Kunyuan; More Than Ten People Including Matsushita Accepted Bribes

Tianjin Correspondence. The search and arrest of drug dens and drug dealers by the Japanese Concession Police Station is still ongoing. On the morning and evening of the 14th, a large number of detectives from the Japanese Police Station surrounded the North China, Oriental, and Liang Hotels in the Japanese Concession to search. They arrested more than a hundred men and women who were selling and using drugs, and seized a large number of narcotics. They were all taken to the station for interrogation. The Chinese detective Liu Shouyan of the Special Affairs Department of the Police Station (commonly known as Five Roads), the Chinese Deputy Detective Che Wenxiang (commonly known as One Road), the head constable Xu Shupu (also known as One Road), and another police chief, Mr. Jia, were successively arrested for protecting the sale of narcotics. They were implicated by the major drug dealer Chen Kunyuan. They were dismissed and detained. However, the confessions of Liu and Xu implicated more than ten people, including the head of the Japanese Special Affairs Department, Matsushita, saying, "From Chen Kunyuan alone, we paid 20,000 yuan in protection fees every month. From other places, we paid 5,000 to 6,000 yuan to over 10,000 yuan. The money was managed by Matsushita and divided among them according to the size of the shares. We were just handling it for them." Matsushita was transferred to the Xiamen Japanese Police Station this spring. The others who accepted bribes with him are still working in Tianjin. Therefore, the Japanese Police Chief Wakui, due to concerns about connections, is still struggling to investigate the matter thoroughly. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent multiple senior criminal and judicial prosecutors to Tianjin to monitor the investigation. This has made it difficult for the people in the Japanese Police Station to be partial. Due to the searches of the Oriental, North China, Nedeyi Lou, China, and Xiyou Villas, and other businesses of this type, all those engaged in this kind of dark business are uneasy, and the organizers have fled. It is heard that Teng and Ji, who are as famous as Chen Kunyuan for selling and manufacturing drugs, have all fled far away. Chen Kunyuan's accomplice, Tang Amao, was captured by Japanese detectives on the 14th. Observing the actions of the Japanese in recent days, it seems that the Japanese are acting vigorously to clear the atmosphere of drugs in one fell swoop, but it is heard that this is only to temporarily cover up the eyes of the League of Nations. Their fundamental policy of spreading poison will never change. This is evidenced by the fact that the Japanese have not taken any action to ban the rampant opium dens in the pseudo-area of ​​eastern Hebei, which is enough to show that their current action does not have a thorough determination to eliminate opium.

As for Liu Shouyan, Li Wenxiang, Xu Shupu, etc. who were arrested, Liu Shouyan has been driven by the Japanese for the longest time, nearly twenty-five years. Xu Shupu has been driven for about five years. They usually rely on the power of the Japanese and do everything evil. Even political and military fugitives who sneak into the Japanese Concession, such as Shi You and Liu Guitang, have to bow to these people and condescend to establish close relationships with them in order to beg for protection from the Japanese. The protection fees they paid were also often considerable. Xu Shupu accumulated assets of 400,000 to 500,000 in just a few years. The source is self-evident. Therefore, when they were dismissed and arrested, everyone who heard about it praised them. (15th)

### Zhang Zhongying, a Righteous Man of Chahar, Plans to Seize Nanhaoqian

Leading a Crowd of Over Five Hundred with Guns and Horses Ready; Xing Ziqiang Also Gathers Comrades for Action

Wanquan Correspondence: The righteous people in various parts of Chahar North, who are brewing another uprising, are facing increasingly severe oppression from a certain faction and the puppet regime. The investigation methods are also becoming more stringent. Apart from hiding in the mountains and forests, they have almost completely lost their foothold in the villages and towns of Chahar North. Therefore, they have now changed their strategy. Instead of operating in secret and waiting to be arrested, they are rallying comrades to engage in open activities. As a result, armed civilians with complete firearms have frequently been spotted in various parts of Chahar North in recent days. They move in and out, keeping the certain faction busy with planning and the puppet regime exhausted from running around. The situation is becoming more active. A certain special agency, in addition to strictly ordering the puppet regime to take proper precautions against these armed civilians, has no good countermeasures.

The righteous man Zhang Zhongying, on the evening of the 1st of this month at 11:00 PM, called on righteous people to respond to Zhao Xiangchun and others, righteous people of Tao'er Miao Village, attempting to recover Shangdu. Unfortunately, the secret was leaked, and his ambition was not realized. Afterward, he hid in the Daqingshan area on the border of Suiyuan and Chahar, collecting comrades. In the past ten days, more than five hundred righteous people from various places have come to join him. Each person has a horse. Some even carry both long and short guns, as well as a machete. Because everyone shares the same hatred for the enemy, their unity is especially strong. On the 13th of this month, they were suddenly discovered between Shangdu and Shangyi. Their direction of advance seems to aim at recovering Nanhaoqian as their destination. The puppet army Chen Mingxuan's regiment stationed in Nanhaoqian (Liu Weiguang's department of Li Shouxin's direct line First Division) was very panicked upon hearing the news. They immediately telegraphed a certain special agency chief in Zhangbei, who then reported to Li Shouxin, and requested instructions. On the 14th, the special agency chief ordered the division to strictly guard and prepare.

According to someone from Chongli, Xing Ziqiang, who previously served as a military officer under Wang Ying, switched allegiance to Yang Shouchang's brigade after Wang Ying left, stationed in the Gonghui area. When it was reorganized into an independent regiment, with Chang Ziyi as the regiment commander and Xing as the company commander, he could no longer bear to live under the shelter of outsiders. He led dozens of his close subordinates, carrying full weapons and horses, and broke away from the rebel group, wandering in the mountains and forests between Chongli and Zhangbei. Xing usually valued his reputation highly. Although his men relied on the forest for refuge, they did not rob or disturb the people. He once told the villagers that once his strength was sufficient, he would definitely recover lost territory for the country in various parts of Chahar North in a guerrilla manner, and cause great disruption to the rear of the puppet regime. Whenever there were scattered soldiers deserting from the puppet army, he would try to collect them and persuade them to join. Now he has over a hundred men under his command, all with guns and horses. Recently, he secretly sent representatives to contact Li Tingfang, the commander-in-chief of the Chahar Anti-Bandit and Land Reclamation People's Self-Defense Army, to jointly carry out the work of expelling bandits and reclaiming land.

### The Rampancy of Smuggled Goods in Fuzhou

Silk and Cloth Shops Openly Sell Smuggled Goods; The Trade Association Cannot Impose Sanctions

Fuzhou Correspondence: Smuggled goods in this city are most prevalent in the silk and cloth and Jiangsu and Guangdong goods industries. Previously, due to intense public criticism, the silk and cloth group convened a meeting and decided to stop selling smuggled goods from June 1st. They also requested strict orders for those non-trade association member stores to join the trade association so that they could jointly abide by the decision. As for the remaining unsold stock, it was to be sealed by the trade association. However, the silk and cloth shops nominally accepted the trade association resolution. When the deadline came, they mostly made excuses that non-member stores were still in the majority. "If we don't sell, they will sell as they please," rewarding stores that do not join the trade association. Therefore, they requested an extension of the sales deadline. It is found that the sources of smuggled silk and cloth can be divided into three parts. One is the broker Zhou Zhuofan (i.e., Da Bi Zhuo, hoarding in San Guantang, Wenrufang); one is Yao Chunfan (i.e., Chengchun) Shi Qin (i.e., Shuidi Tuan, hoarding behind the Xiangyun Store at 129 Antai Road, with a foreign brand hung inside); one is hoarding in the Kui Ji Chen Luduan warehouse in Jibixiang Lane, which hangs a Portuguese license plate and is forwarded by Zheng Dekang, Liu Youping, and Chen Da Di. It is found that the total sales of smuggled silk and cloth in the city can reach about 100,000 yuan per month. The sales of Jiu Sheng, Tian Zhang, Wu Guang, Xie Tai, Xiang Sheng, Fen Fan, Gu Chang, Mei Lun, and Xin Long are the most popular. They are currently sourcing from the above-mentioned brokers. Although they have been advised by the silk and cloth trade association, they still do not accept it. As for the smuggled goods shipped to northern Fujian, they are procured in the province by the creek transport guild and the Jiangxi transport guild and transported into the interior. The monthly sales volume is also more than 100,000 yuan. Of these smuggled goods, dyed goods account for 30-40%, and white坯 goods account for 60-70%. The colors are selected and dyed in this city to cater to the psychology of buyers. The dyeing labor is very cheap, only four cents per yard. The dyers who undertake this batch of smuggled goods are mostly Cai Zhang in Damingli, Zhengxin Yantoukou in Xuanzheng Road, and Zhengxing in Taiping Mountain. The next most numerous are You Yi Xin in Nanhou Street, Daoyou Lu Huachun and other stores. Recently, because the prices of domestic silk and satin fabrics have been affected by the rising price of silk, they have increased by another 10%. The sales of domestic silk and cloth have been further impacted, giving smuggled goods a chance to promote themselves. For this reason, the silk and cloth industry trade association specially convened all members at the Huaxin Building on Taijiang Road at 6:00 PM on the 11th to discuss for three hours. As a result, they only decided that if each store agreed not to sell or buy smuggled goods, they could pay a fee of three yuan and receive a plaque from the trade association saying "No Selling or Buying Smuggled Goods" to hang in the store to show their determination. There are no other sanctions, so there is no shame in eradicating smuggled goods in Fuzhou. (June 12)

### Songjiang

Conference of County Magistrates of Four Counties

The Security Command of this area recently convened a joint meeting of the magistrates and police chiefs of Songjiang, Fengxian, Jinshan, and Qingpu counties at the district headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 16th to discuss joint defense and bandit suppression measures, as the bandit atmosphere in the Songjiang county area is very rampant.

### Taicang

Zhittang Township Plans to Establish a Cloth Factory

Since the establishment of the station and the opening of the Bai-Xi-Hu Road in Zhittang Township in the fifth district, the town's market conditions have gradually become prosperous. Di Ying (currently a member of the Central Supervisory Committee), a native of Huangjing Township in the county, considering the bankruptcy of the hometown countryside and the decline of people's livelihood, plans to open a large-scale weaving factory in the town to promote domestic products and maintain people's livelihood. On the 14th of this month, Di arrived in Zhittang from Beijing and went to his hometown, looking for land and raising shares to start work. He has already hired a skilled Changshu cloth industry expert to design the factory.

Tidal Surge Collapses Seawall

In recent days, the air pressure has been low, causing a surge in sea tides. A section of the newly built pile stone seawall, about dozens of feet long, at the south end of Beidaotang Temple at the mouth of the Liu River in this county, was completely collapsed by the raging waves and violent winds on the 13th night. The patrolman Zhu Huanong telegraphed the county government, and the county government immediately telegraphed the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office to send personnel to survey and repair it. On the morning of the 15th, the county magistrate and the head of the construction section personally surveyed the site.

### Suzhou

Bidders Unwilling to Reduce Labor Costs

The Construction Bureau is widening the ten major roads in the city. Due to the bidding price issue, it convened various contractors at the Construction Bureau at 3:00 PM on the 17th to discuss reducing the bidding price so that it could be reported to the department for approval. However, the bidding merchants believed that the bidding price they submitted was the lowest price and it was really difficult to reduce it further. If the price was forcibly reduced, the project would inevitably be sloppy. Therefore, they insisted that it could not be reduced. On the same day, the Construction Bureau submitted the above-mentioned opinions to the Construction Department for instructions. If necessary, Director Cao will personally go to the province to state everything in order to start construction as soon as possible.

### Wuxi

Flour Mills Have Resumed Production

Small wheat in the four townships was affected by cloudy and rainy weather in early June, so it was not harvested in time. The Jiu Feng and Mao Xin flour mills in this county stopped operations one after another on the 3rd and 4th of this month because they did not have much old wheat in stock and new wheat had not yet arrived on the market. When the users heard the news that the flour mills had stopped operations, they rushed to buy a large amount, resulting in the sale of over a hundred flour shops in the county by the 10th of this month. The price rose to more than four yuan and one corner per bag, causing panic. Recently, the weather has cleared, and the wheat in the four townships has been harvested and sold. The flour mills have purchased new wheat in large quantities and have resumed production and sales on the 16th. However, because the new wheat this year is damp, each factory must mix it with old wheat to benefit the users. The price of flour yesterday has seen a return to low prices, with the market price at three yuan seven or eight corners per bag. The panic has subsided.

Yarn Market Affected by Price Drops

The yarn market in this county previously experienced a surge in Shanghai standard yarn, causing labor costs to rise sharply, with each bale increasing by more than three yuan. When the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange turmoil subsided and bidding resumed, the market price fell across the board. Factories in Wuxi were affected by this, and prices also saw a drop. On the 17th, the opening price of the Wuxi yarn market was 292 yuan and one corner for the 16-count Shuangyu from Qingfeng Yarn Factory, 284 yuan for the 17.5-count Haozuo brand from Shenxin, and the 17.5-count Qiuhe from Zhenxin, 289 yuan and one corner for the 16-count Yuee from Yu Kang, and the 16-count Zhinv from Guangqin. The market prices of the above factories have fallen by three yuan per bale compared to the time of the surge. However, yesterday's (17th) market price was firmer than the previous day.

### Changshu

Chamber of Commerce Asks for Improvement of Buses

After the accident of the Xi-Hu bus in Anzhen a few days ago, more than a dozen people were injured. Except for the Zhuangxun team leader Zhu Kun and a woman, the others were generally unharmed. The business community here believes that the Xihu Bus Company is developing its business but not improving passenger safety. Therefore, on the 17th, it convened a meeting of representatives from various trade associations to discuss the matter. It was decided to use the name of the Chamber of Commerce to send a letter to the Shanghai headquarters, requesting improvement, adding local trains, increasing the number of trips, and limiting the number of passengers per car to ensure passenger safety.

Silkworm Farmers Feel Excited

Due to the strong silk market, the market price of this year's spring cocoons has made silkworm farmers very excited, which has not been seen in five years. This year, there are a total of fourteen cocoon collection stations in this county, which collected a total of 168.65 dan of dry cocoons. The highest price was 53 yuan and six jiao and seven fen per dan (fresh cocoons), and the lowest price was 47 yuan and six jiao and five fen, which is four-tenths higher than the price in previous years. Currently, the dry cocoons collected by each cocoon firm are mostly stored in warehouses in Wuxi. Now, silkworm farmers in this county have made a lot of profit due to the high price of spring cocoons, and they will double the breeding of autumn cocoons and are rushing to order seeds from the improved areas. More than 3,000 sheets have been ordered.

### Xiaoshan

Flood Disaster, Rice Prices Rise

Since before the Dragon Boat Festival, Xiaoshan has had continuous rain. The water in the inner rivers and outer rivers has risen more than ten feet, and the water on the plains is also inches deep, causing the early rice and cotton in the four townships to be submerged. The ten thousand acres of rice in Zhuji, a neighboring county, were also flooded, and there was no harvest at all. Therefore, the price of rice at the Linpu and Keqiao rice shops in neighboring counties has risen by one yuan. Because the source of the Shangjiang River in Zhuji has disappeared, and it is now the time of year where the old harvest has run out and new crop not in. The rice reserves of the rice storehouses have also run out, and they rely solely on the early rice of Zhuji in the early sixth lunar month. After this flood, there was no harvest at all, so the price of rice had to rise.

### The Party, Government, and Police Jointly Issue a Notice Limiting Silk Weavers to Resume Work

The Mei Ya Factories Will Start Work Tomorrow Morning; Continued Detention of Those Instigating the Labor Unrest

The silk weaving industry labor unrest in this city has risen and fallen, lasting for several months, and has not been completely resolved. In order to speed up the effective handling of the issue, the party and government agencies, after consultations a few days ago, decided to continue to arrest the main instigators of the labor unrest, and jointly issued a notice ordering all workers to resume work on schedule. The trade association will inform all manufacturers of the labor-management conditions that have been stipulated. The details are as follows:

Continued Arrest of Instigating Elements

The party and government agencies in this city believe that the silk weaving industry labor unrest has risen and fallen, which is of great importance to social people's livelihood. In order to eliminate disputes, they decided on two measures after consultations on the 16th of this month: ㊀ continue to arrest the workers who have been ordered to be arrested and punish them according to law; ㊁ jointly issue a notice ordering the workers who have not resumed work to resume work immediately, and order the factories to earnestly implement the labor-management conditions stipulated. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Zhou Funong and Zhang Sheng from the municipal party and government, Wang Xianqing and Zhu Shulin from the Social Affairs Bureau, together with Yao Guangnai, director of the Ximen Branch of the Police Bureau, Gong Zhijian of the Detective Brigade, and Wu Yihong of the Investigation Section, led a large number of soldiers and went to the dormitory of the Mei Ya General Factory on Rihui Port Road and arrested 17 workers, including Shen Jiancan and Tu Fasheng, who had been ordered to be arrested, and escorted them to the Police Headquarters for punishment. Another large number of detectives, together with Jia Enchao, director of the Caojiadu Police Branch, went to the Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union in District 3, 20 Hongxingli, Gessfield Road, and arrested the wanted elements. At that time, 19 main members of the union, including Wang Hao (i.e., Wang Shixiong), Jing Yueyun, and Hu Fuyuan, were holding a meeting, and they were all arrested and sent to the headquarters for verification.

Party and Government Agencies Jointly Issue a Notice

The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau issued a joint notice No. 176.62 yesterday, stating: "According to a report submitted by Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory Co., Ltd., after starting work at 6:00 AM on the 13th in accordance with the order, more than a hundred workers arrived at the general factory, and two hundred workers arrived at the warp and weft factory, and the order was very good. However, Shen Jiancan and other illegal workers who were wanted issued orders in the workshop to instruct their party members, such as Song Xiande, to mix into the factory under the pretext of entering the factory to work, forcing the workers who had already started work to strike immediately at 10:00 AM on the 13th and occupy the factory and declare a hunger strike. Yao Guangnai, director of the Ximen Branch, personally went to persuade them, but it was ineffective. Until 9:00 AM on the 14th, they persisted as before. Other striking workers shouted slogans at the gates of the two factories, and the situation became increasingly serious. Please verify, etc. Based on this, it is found that the actions of the workers of the factory, Shen Jiancan and others, are excessive, and they have been wanted before. The workers do not know how to rein in their actions and still dare to instigate the labor unrest, which is extremely illegal. According to the report, in addition to immediately arresting all illegal workers and bringing them to justice, we will also order the factory to earnestly implement the measures stipulated in the Social Affairs Bureau's Order No. 8476. We will jointly issue a notice to all workers of the Mei Ya General Factory and the Warp and Weft Factory, urging them to comply and must enter the factory to resume work before 6:00 PM on the 19th of this month. Those who fail to do so will be considered automatically dismissed and will not be treated with leniency. Please all respect this and do not hesitate or delay. This is the notice." Pan Gongzhan, Tao Baichuan, and Tong Hangbai, Standing Committee Members of the Republic of China, June 17, 1937, Director Pan Gongzhan, Director Cai Jingjun

Mei Ya Warp and Weft Factories Will Start Work Tomorrow Morning

### The Municipal Joint Association Urges the Municipal Council to Tighten

Hope to Increase Donations Next Year; Unnecessary Expenses Must Be Avoided

The Municipal Joint Association of Citizens of the First Special District sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, due to financial waste, has resulted in a budget imbalance and plans to increase taxes by 14.25% to make up for it. Ratepayers in the concession are unable to bear the burden and have expressed their firm opposition. Your association held a representative conference on April 12 of this year and resolved that "the case of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council's proposal to increase donations from July 1, 1937, should be postponed until next year for review, and the Municipal Council should be ordered to effectively reduce unnecessary expenses and collect outstanding donations this year to seek reasonableness." However, the foreign annual meeting on the 14th of the same month, regardless of the difficult times, mistakenly passed a resolution "the case will be postponed until January next year." In the blink of an eye, the year is coming to an end, and the illegal increase in donations will soon be implemented. This association, on behalf of millions of citizens in the concession, continues to express its firm opposition to this bone-scraping policy and prays that your association will earnestly urge the Municipal Council to implement the two matters of tightening expenses and collecting outstanding donations in accordance with the resolution of the representative conference so that the increase in donations next year will become an unnecessary expectation and can be realized. We look forward to it very much."

### Captain Teng Shibiao of the Ship Teng Shibiao Recounts the Hai Li's Encounter with Danger

Arrived in Shanghai at 7 AM Yesterday to Unload Cargo; Captains Association Congratulates the Crew

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ship Hai Li returned to Shanghai safely yesterday morning. It docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf to unload fruits in the morning and at the Yitaixing Wharf to unload cargo in the afternoon. After emptying its cargo hold this morning, it will enter the factory for repairs. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Teng Shiyou, the captain of the ship, to inquire about the truth of the Hai Li's encounter with danger. His detailed account is recorded below. According to him, the Hai Li left Xiamen at 4 PM on the 11th, with the weather alternating between good and bad. When the ship passed the Niushan Sea area, in order to ensure the safety of navigation, the ship sailed on a more seaward route. By 12 PM, the weather gradually improved, and the ship gradually moved closer to the inner channel. In the three hours from 5 PM to 7 PM, the crew reported every hour that the ship's position was very good and accurate. By 8 PM, the weather suddenly changed, and for safety, the ship moved slightly outward again. According to the course at this time, it was nine nautical miles away from the Nan Yushan, where the accident occurred. Because the current was turbulent, with an estimated three or four nautical miles of drift, the ship sailed further out. At this time, extremely large, long waves rushed in from the east, surging violently one after another. At this time, the wind was not strong, but the rain and fog filled the air, almost locking the sea surface, and the visibility was extremely short. The captain went to the bridge to observe, and at the same time, the engine was gradually slowed down (to avoid damaging the propeller). The officer on duty was the third mate. At 10:30 PM, the captain and the third mate on the bridge simultaneously caught sight of something black coming from the front to the right of the ship. At this time, the captain knew that what they saw was a dangerous reef and quickly ordered the ship to turn to the left. The front half of the ship avoided the reef, but the stern of the ship, the fourth hold, was damaged by the reef. The engine room reported that the axle was leaking, and the rear cargo hold was also taking on water. At this time, if there had been any panic, it would have been difficult to avoid the disaster of sinking. After the accident, the captain first decided to save the lives of everyone on board and decided to run the ship aground in Sanmen Bay. First, a telegram was sent to Shanghai to report the situation, and then the crew was ordered to work hard to rescue the ship. Half an hour later, it was reported that the water was not coming in very quickly and that the ship's pumps were sufficient to handle the situation for five or six hours. The captain was even more determined to save the ship. So, the ship was steered to Shipu and anchored safely at the destination of Tantoushan at dawn on the 13th. The ship was anchored and grounded there, and at this point, the ship was out of danger and there was no danger of sinking. The rescue work was carried out separately. Some said that this place was a den of bandits, and the passengers were uneasy. The crew comforted and explained to them and made defensive preparations at the same time. In the evening, the Xin Ruian ship passed by and was asked to stop temporarily for assistance. They were allowed to do so. Before long, the Ganlu warship of the Navy arrived, and the people's hearts were settled. By 8 PM that night, the Haiyan and Yong Sheng also arrived one after another. Haiyan wanted to approach Haili, but it failed due to the huge wind and waves. Fortunately, the captain of the Ganlu warship, Qian, was well-acquainted with the captain and sent two small tugboats to serve as lighters. In the afternoon of the 14th, the Haizhen also came and transferred all 250 passengers to the two ships before 3 PM and sent them back to Shanghai. The cargo in the fourth hold, including over a hundred bags of textbooks, was thrown into the sea for the convenience of the rescue work. The remaining flooded cargo was unloaded onto the upper deck. At 8 PM that night, the Jardine Matheson tugboat arrived. On the morning of the 15th, the tugboat began to work, sending divers into the sea to detect several holes, which were then plugged with objects. At the same time, pumping was intensified. At 8:30 AM on the morning of the 16th, the Haili left the shoal and returned to Shanghai. On the morning of the 17th, it arrived at Wusong and anchored. It arrived at Jinliyuan Wharf at 7 AM to unload fruits and passenger luggage, and went to Yitaixing Wharf in the afternoon to unload goods. Teng also said that the crew had worked very hard in the rescue work, working for two days and nights. The attendants and escort police comforted the passengers, keeping order on board, so the crew could concentrate on their work. Therefore, when the ship arrived at the wharf, the Chinese Marine Engineers' Association sent representatives to congratulate the crew.

### After the Resumption of Trading in Cotton Yarn, the Market Returns to Normal

Prices of Cotton Yarn for Each Month Rebound; Reduced Trading Due to Large Margin Deposits

The cotton yarn market at the Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange experienced significant fluctuations after the afternoon session on June 8th, causing widespread panic. Both bulls and bears were unwilling to concede, resulting in intermittent trading halts. On June 16th, trading resumed after both buyers and sellers followed the earnest advice of Director Du and others, and the exchange agreed on strict handling measures. Trading continued as of yesterday morning. With the difficulties overcome and the situation stabilized, the market has returned to normal. Yesterday was the second day of trading after the resumption. Due to the stability of the situation, prices of cotton yarn for each month rose slightly compared to the closing prices of the afternoon session on June 6th. Specifically, standard yarn for June rose by 2 yuan, for July and August by 4 yuan each, and for September by 2.5 yuan. Standard cotton for June rose by 0.1 yuan, for July by 0.4 yuan, for August by 0.1 yuan (no goods for September), and for October by 0.3 yuan. The closing prices for the afternoon session (June) were 280.06 yuan, (July) 281 yuan, (August) 279.9 yuan, and (September) 278 yuan. To prevent the bulls from pulling back and causing another turmoil, the exchange authorities, in addition to the standard margin and special margin, also pre-collected a margin of 50 yuan in cash per bale (ordinarily, the margin is 42 yuan per bale for near-term contracts and 34 yuan per bale for far-term contracts. The current pre-collected margin of 50 yuan increases the total margin to 92 yuan per bale for near-term contracts and 84 yuan per bale for far-term contracts). The increased burden and tight credit conditions limited new trading volume due to the large margin deposit, so new customers accounted for 3/5 fewer transactions than usual.

### Tenth Anniversary Approaching, City Government Actively Preparing for Celebrations

Various Exhibitions to Open Simultaneously; Over Five Thousand Items on Display

With the tenth anniversary of the city government approaching, in addition to actively preparing for grand celebrations, the municipal authorities are currently stepping up preparations for various exhibitions. It is understood that the municipal authorities are holding these exhibitions to promote the prosperity of the city center and the development of Greater Shanghai. Therefore, they are collecting materials, striving for richness and accuracy, so that citizens, after viewing, can gain a systematic understanding of the city government's facilities over the years, the development of Shanghai's industry and commerce, and the necessary air defense, health, and general knowledge. The preparations are outlined below:

Grand Celebrations

The Shanghai Municipal Government was established on July 7, 1927. This year, July 7, marks its tenth anniversary. The municipal authorities will hold a grand celebration ceremony at 9:00 AM on that day. After the chairman announces the opening of the tenth anniversary assembly, the mayor's representative will cut the ribbon at various exhibition venues. In addition to requesting the central National Government and various ministries of the Executive Yuan to send representatives to attend and deliver speeches, former mayors of the city and leaders from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, will be invited to participate in the celebrations. At that time, the square in front of the city government and the rooftops around the city government building will be decorated with lights. Arches with electric lights will be erected on both sides of the city government entrance on Sanmin Road and Wulu Road, in front of the city center police station, and in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and other places. On the evening of the 6th, a lantern parade will be held, starting from the city center area and parading throughout the city.

From the 7th to the 18th, in the afternoon of each day, stages will be set up in the square in front of the city government and the Nanshi public sports field to perform operas and various recreational programs for celebration.

Municipal Administration Exhibition

In addition to preparing for the celebration ceremony, the municipal authorities will also present the municipal facilities of the past decade and the various constructions of Greater Shanghai, either as models and photos or as compiled statistical charts, categorized and publicly displayed.

It is estimated that there will be more than 800 charts and photos, occupying an area of about 7,000 square feet, and 40 to 50 models, occupying an area of about 1,500 square feet.

If there are a large number of products, or if it is necessary to hold exhibitions of manufacturing processes and demonstrations of work, special departments can be set up to handle them. Each exhibit should be accompanied by a description, explaining the product's characteristics, the cost of manufacturing materials, and the production and sales situation, so that visitors can have a deep understanding of such items. As for the 260 boxes of products from this city that participated in the National Arts and Crafts Exhibition, the Industrial Exhibition Association has sent personnel to retrieve and display them. Products from other provinces and cities will also be automatically transported to Shanghai to participate in the exhibition, and products that were unable to be transported to Paris to participate in the International Exposition due to postponement will also be collected for the exhibition. It is said that there are many treasures among them, which will greatly enhance the handicrafts exhibition department. In addition, jade merchants will also participate with valuable products, and the organizing committee will set up a special room for display.

Health Exhibition

The Health Exhibition will be located in the Health Testing Institute, exhibiting charts, photos, models, specimens, publications, and health supplies. The sources of exhibits are: first, from the city, collected by the units participating in the organizing committee; second, from other places, contacted by the Health Bureau. The exhibits will be displayed according to the participating groups, with each group opening a room. Generally, it can be divided into three parts: physiology and anatomy, pathology and medicine, and public health.

### Reduced Fees for Foreigner Transit Visas

Effective from July 1st

The Municipal Police Bureau previously charged a uniform fee of ten national currency units for visas for foreigners coming to China, regardless of entry or transit, which caused considerable difficulties in enforcement. After the bureau submitted the difficulties in handling the matter to the municipal government for referral to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review, it has been learned that the municipal government received a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. Except for people from non-treaty countries and stateless persons, a visa fee of ten national currency units will be charged for both transit and entry. Regarding the transit visa fee for people from treaty countries, it has been decided to charge three currency units, effective from July 1st of this year. In order to facilitate the handling of this visa matter, five measures for transit visas for people from treaty countries have been formulated: ㊀ Foreigners from treaty countries who intend to pass through China to go to other countries should first send their passports to the consulate of the country of destination for entry visas, and then request the Chinese embassy or consulate abroad to issue transit visas. However, if the destination does not require an entry visa because it is the foreigner's home country or for other reasons, the foreigner may prove that they are indeed passing through China to go elsewhere by one of the following two methods: (A) submit the boat ticket or train ticket to the place of transfer for verification, (B) obtain written proof from the foreigner's local authorities or foreign consulate that they are indeed in transit. ㊁ The maximum stay in China for foreigners in transit waiting for a ship or train shall not exceed twenty days. ㊂ This transit visa can still be stamped with a Type B visa stamp, but the wording must be changed according to the attached figure. ㊃ These transit visa measures do not apply to people from non-treaty countries or stateless persons. The application for transit by these foreigners shall still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Chapters 3 and 4 of the Measures for Passport Visas for Foreigners Coming to China, and a visa fee of ten national currency units shall be charged. ㊄ The measures stipulated for transit visas shall be implemented from July 1, 1937. It is reported that the municipal government has ordered the police bureau to comply.

### Ministry of Industry to Unify National Cotton Inspection

The National Cotton Adulteration and Weight Cheating Eradication Office will handle the National Cotton Inspection starting next month. Sales for export will be handled by the Commodity Inspection Bureau, while sales for domestic consumption will be handled by the National Cotton Adulteration and Weight Cheating Eradication Office. However, in the past, domestic sales of cotton transshipped at various ports were also reported to the local Commodity Inspection Bureau for inspection, which was not strictly divided. Now, in order to unify the authority, the Ministry of Industry has ordered the Eradication Office to liaise with the Inspection Bureau to exclusively handle the matter. It is reported that it will start handling the matter from July. The general office of the Eradication Office is located in Shanghai, and there are branch offices in major provinces such as Shaanxi, Henan, and Shandong. However, the Ministry of Industry also plans to reorganize the Eradication Office into a supervisory office, and is currently submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval.

### City Federation Re-Requests City Government to Recover Extraterritorial Roads

Regarding the issue of extraterritorial roads, Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, recently discussed the matter with our acting Mayor Yu. The city government believes that the solution to this issue should focus on the extraterritorial roads themselves. Therefore, the demands of the Japanese side to exceed the scope and harm our national sovereignty are difficult to accept. It is learned that the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city submitted a request to the city government again yesterday regarding this case, stating that the request is to continue negotiations to recover the extraterritorial roads and restore national sovereignty. It is illegal for the Public Concession to build roads outside the boundary, which is entirely an act of infringing upon our national sovereignty. In recent years, the bureau has insisted on collecting various donations and taxes in the extraterritorial sections, which has caused dissatisfaction among residents and frequent disputes. It has been found that this case has been negotiated for recovery by the government many times, but it has not been resolved due to Japanese obstruction, which is very sad. It is believed that the recovery of extraterritorial roads is not only desired by the citizens of Shanghai, but also the unanimous request of the people of the whole country. We hereby re-request the government to set a policy and continue negotiations to recover the roads in order to achieve the goal of restoring sovereignty, which would be greatly appreciated.

### Yin Guang Opposes Changing the Buddha's Birthday

The 77-Year-Old Is Willing to Risk His Life to Fight; Changing It Will Lead to Death in the East Sea

The Chinese Buddhist Association sent letters to high monks and lay Buddhists across the country, requesting them to express their opinions on the Buddha's birthday. However, there are disputes across the country, and the arguments are inconsistent. Now, the association has received a letter from Master Yin Guang, which is quite determined to defend the Dharma. Excerpts from his letter are as follows: "All gentlemen of the Chinese Buddhist Association, I have received the mimeographed official letter you sent. On the order of the Panchen Lama, you want to change the date of the Buddha's birthday that has been followed for generations. I, Yin Guang, a bald-headed layman, do not think so. Since ancient times, many living Buddhas and high monks from Tibet have come to China with high morals and profound virtues, but none of them have ever ordered a change (omitted). This matter is absolutely impossible, and you still want to disturb yourselves and others and solicit consent. I am already seventy-seven years old and willing to resist with this old life. Even if the people of the whole country agree, I will never agree. If you say that since I do not agree, I should be driven out of the country as a stubborn and foolish man, I will jump into the East Sea nearby to swim to the lotus pond of the Western Paradise. If you say that as an ignorant rice monk, I dare to obstruct the new Buddhism, I should be executed with extreme punishment. I, an unknown little monk, can die from this, then my death is a famous death, what could be happier? Lest future generations say that there is no one in the country. This matter is not negotiable (omitted)."

### Director of Rockefeller Foundation in China, Gannar, Returns to Shanghai from the United States

Various Undertakings in China Still Actively Proceeding; Currently Planning to Assist Rural China

Since the death of the American oil magnate Rockefeller, whether there will be any changes in his charitable undertakings in China has been a matter of great concern to all parties. Gannar, the director of the Rockefeller Foundation in China, who was previously ordered to return to the United States, returned to Shanghai by boat the other day. According to reports, the foundation's future work plan in China is quite detailed. A brief account is given below. According to Mr. Gannar, "Two years ago, the foundation implemented a three-year plan to prosper rural China with one million US dollars, which will be completed in July next year. After that, we will continue our efforts and will not affect the work plan due to Rockefeller's death. Recently, the second year's implementation plan fund of 350,000 US dollars has been allocated. The literacy movement, public health, and training of rural talents that the foundation previously planned will also continue to be developed, and a large amount of funds will be used to complete this plan. Currently, this plan is being drafted by me (Gannar). At the same time, in order to strengthen our forces, we also plan to provide financial assistance to various rural Chinese organizations so that we can work together to quickly complete this plan, because Chinese people must have a deeper understanding of the situation in rural China than foreigners. As for the allocation of funds, we plan to concentrate on one basic undertaking in the future. For example, in the rural construction of North China last year, the foundation provided a large amount of financial assistance. In addition, the foundation also provides financial assistance to Yenching University, Nankai University, Jinling Agricultural College, the Central Health Department, and the Ministry of Education. In the past twenty years, the foundation has spent a total of 40 million US dollars in China. The policy will not only not change in the future, but will also strengthen its forces and move forward."

### Cotton Yarn Broker Accused of Embezzlement, Woman Writes to Judge

Because she was once abandoned by the defendant, she requests strict punishment. The case has concluded its debate and is scheduled for sentencing on the 24th.

Jiang Bingsheng, a native of this county, has been working as a cotton yarn broker at the Japanese-owned Hailu Transportation Company at 18 Miller Road. On the 3rd of this month, Jiang, on behalf of Guangzengxiang Yarn Shop at 7 Lane 4, Tianjin Road, ordered 22 bales of cotton yarn from the company, valued at $9,352.42. However, he embezzled the funds and went into hiding. The company reported this to the General Police Station, and subsequently, Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Geng Debiao arrested Jiang at Room 96 of the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. They recovered some of the embezzled funds, totaling $1,078, and handed him over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. During the adjourned hearing period, Judge Feng Shide, who was handling the case, received a letter from a woman named Wang Anyu, residing at 5 Liao Chengqing Lane, Taosha. The letter detailed how she had lived next to Jiang's relatives on Fumin Road last year. Jiang repeatedly seduced her, and she lost her virginity. At the time, Jiang claimed he had no wife and wished to spend his life with her. However, when she urged him to marry, he repeatedly postponed it. Later, as Jiang's yarn and cotton business prospered and his income increased, he abandoned her. Now, she stated, he has fallen into the clutches of the law, and she requested strict punishment to penalize this villain. However, according to the police investigation, Jiang is currently living with a woman surnamed Hou at 25 Lane 100, Shanjia Garden, Baker Road. This woman is a prostitute from a brothel in Yu Huile Lane. Since Jiang's arrest, this woman surnamed Hou has not been seen at the aforementioned location. The court questioned Jiang about Wang's letter, and Jiang stated that she was a former mistress with whom he no longer had any cohabitation relationship. The police also discovered that Jiang had purchased a car, costing over $2,000, but had only paid $552, later abandoning the car on Difeng Road. This case was continued yesterday morning by Judge Feng in a criminal court. After Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng gave a detailed report of the defendant's transactions with the Hailu Company, the court interrogated Jiang once more and then ordered the commencement of arguments. The police lawyer, Ru Yiyi, argued that the defendant's actions had severely damaged commercial credit. He pointed out that the defendant had previously been convicted of forgery and sentenced to three months imprisonment with a suspended sentence. Now, still within the probationary period, he has committed another crime, leaving no grounds for leniency. He requested the court to impose the deserved punishment. After Judge Feng reviewed the report, he announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for next Thursday (the 24th).

### Prophylactic Injections in Zhabei Slums

The city's epidemic prevention work is actively being promoted, and injections in the Zhabei slums have also begun. Details are recorded below:

The Zhabei Health Office began prophylactic injections in the slums on the 15th of last month. Currently, 60,000 people have been injected. Injections in the slums began yesterday, with the office dispatching doctors and nurses to go door-to-door in areas like the Sun Temple and Tanzi Bay to administer injections and demonstrate simple hygiene knowledge, so that poor laborers can understand cautious methods of eating and living to avoid being harmed by diseases. The distribution of free water will also be greatly expanded this year. The number of free tap water faucets will increase from 12 last year to 27. However, last year these free faucets were often occupied by small factories. This year, the Municipal Health Bureau has consulted with the Municipal Police Bureau to have local branch police officers supervise at all times to ensure that the poor can universally access the water. It is also learned that starting July 1st, more epidemic prevention personnel will need to be added to meet deployment needs.

### Taking in Abducted Poor Girls to Profit from Prostitution

Tang Youxiang is arrested and interrogated, sentencing scheduled for the 23rd.

Tang Youxiang, a 42-year-old from Yangzhou, runs a private brothel in Yuancheng Lane, Dadongmen, recruiting poor girls to satisfy people's lust and reaping huge profits. In June of last year, he allowed Zhong Yibao's daughter, Zhong Aihong, from Liyang, to be raped. On May 19th of this year, he was introduced by Cui Shubao to Wang Fengying, a woman who had just come to Shanghai from Qingjiang, to work as a prostitute, splitting the nightly fee in half. The case was solved by the Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team, which transferred the case to District Attorney Wang, who prosecuted Tang Youxiang under Article 231, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, and Cui Shubao as an accomplice. Yesterday, Judge Wang conducted a court hearing. Wang Fengying testified that she had been abducted into prostitution for only six days, while Zhong Aihong even protected Tang, claiming that nothing of the sort had happened. When the court questioned why she had requested a medical examination and had been found to have contracted gonorrhea, Zhong Aihong stammered and could not answer. At this point, attorney Yan Ziqing gave a defense, and the court adjourned the debate, with sentencing scheduled for the 23rd.

### Fighting Over Loading Steel Wire Leads to Death

Wang Zigao is detained pending sentencing.

Wang Zigao, a native of Tongzhou, was a worker at Yangxingji Barge Company in Yangshupu. At 2 PM on May 25th, he was at the Osaka Wharf and got into a dispute with Ji Shenghua, a worker from the same company (46 years old, also from Tongzhou), over loading steel wire. They fought, and Wang punched Ji in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground. Chinese police arrived and after hearing the story, transported the injured man to Tongren Hospital, where he died. The suspect Wang was sent to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over a continued hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that during the adjournment, the coroner and forensic doctor of the court examined Ji Shenghua's body and found an injury to the deceased's lower abdomen, causing intestinal rupture, and requested an investigation. When questioned, the defendant insisted that he did not punch him and that he had a history of illness, asking for leniency. Judge Xiao ordered that he remain in custody pending sentencing.

### Floating Stalls Not Allowed Near Municipal Council Vegetable Markets

### Female Doctor Wanted for Eight Years Arrested

Causing death through abortion; sued by the deceased's family.

Cheng Liqing, a 40-year-old woman from Guangdong, opened a hospital at 235 Bazilu in 1926. On June 9th of that year, Mrs. Tang Wang (also known as Wang Yeqing), a resident of North Sichuan Road, went to the hospital for an abortion. Cheng Liqing's surgery was unsuccessful, and three days later, she suffered severe abdominal pain and continuous bleeding. She consulted Dr. Luo Baifu and German doctor Baimenfei, but they were unwilling to treat her, as Cheng Liqing had damaged her internal organs during the abortion. Helpless, she sought treatment at the French Concession Dahua Hospital, where she died at 6 AM on the 25th of that month. Her family then filed a lawsuit against Cheng Liqing in the First Special Court, but she had fled without a trace. The police were ordered to issue a warrant for her arrest, but no clues were found for eight years. At approximately 1 PM on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Zhang Faxiang of the Hongkou Police Station received information that Cheng Liqing had recently returned to Shanghai and was hiding in Room 261 of the Datong Hotel on Nanjing Road. He reported this to his superior and, accompanied by Western detectives, went to the address with a photograph of her that had been issued by the police station with a reward for her arrest. They arrested her. When shown the photograph, she was wearing glasses and looked different. She absolutely denied being Cheng Liqing, claiming to be named Li Suzhen, recently arrived from Nanjing, and not a doctor. However, after questioning Mr. Cheng Junpu, a Cantonese traveler in Room 260 next door, it was confirmed that her real name was Cheng Liqing and that she had been a doctor on Bazilu. They took her to the police station and sent her to the women's detention center. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu detailed the events and stated that on June 26th of that year, Prosecutor Gao from the court had inspected the body at the Feilun Road morgue and confirmed that Mrs. Tang Wang had died from an abortion. She is now being prosecuted under Article 291, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code for abortion. As Mrs. Tang Wang's family could not be found and summoned, he requested a postponement. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Mrs. Tang Wang had sought treatment from others after receiving treatment from her, and that she was not responsible. Lawyers Zuo Detao and Xu Shihao defended her. Judge Dai Rongduo ordered that she remain in custody and that the case be reviewed at a later date.

### Resentful of Illness, He Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building

Jumps from the fourth floor of the Great World, falls into the courtyard, and dies in the evening.

Zhu Yongcai, a local young Catholic residing at 454 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, was eighteen years old. His father died early, leaving Yongcai and his sister, who were raised by their mother, Mrs. Gu (47 years old this year), who worked hard to support them. His sister has married in Pudong, and now only the mother and son are left, relying on each other for life. However, Yongcai has always been physically weak. Three years ago, he suddenly suffered from hemoptysis, so he did not go out to study. For the past three years, he has lived with medicine. After all kinds of treatments, he slightly recovered this spring, but because the family has no wealth, he could not permanently rely on his old mother for support and needed a skill to make a living in the future. He was introduced by a friend to a certain electrical shop on Lafayette Road to learn the craft of installing electric lights. Unexpectedly, after only a month on the job, his old illness recurred. He was treated at Guangci Hospital for three weeks. Since returning home, only ten days have passed. Feeling that his body is constantly plagued by illness and that he cannot work in peace, he became extremely distressed and suddenly had suicidal thoughts. On the 12th of this month, he left home without saying goodbye. He did not return for four days and nights. His mother, Mrs. Gu, assumed that he had gone to his sister's house in Pudong to stay for a while, but did not expect an accident. On the afternoon of the 16th, Yongcai went to the Great World amusement park in the French Concession. Under the pretext of buying a ticket to enter the park to play, at 3:30, he jumped from the platform on the new west floor and fell into the courtyard on Shuimenjiang Street, his head bleeding profusely. A tourist from Suzhou named Wang Gengsheng (16 years old, residing at 7 Ning'anfang, Haining Road) discovered him and ran to report to the park's accounting office, who telephoned the French police. An ambulance was immediately called. He had already fainted from his injuries and was sent to Guangci Hospital, but he died without effect at 7 PM that day. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue for an autopsy. A note was found in the deceased's pocket, revealing his address, and his mother, Zhu Gu, was notified. Yesterday, Judge Wang Ren from the Special Court came to the morgue and confirmed that the deceased, Zhu Yongcai, had died from injuries sustained from a fall. The body was released to his mother for burial.

### Electric Company Decides to Build a Tall Chimney

The Shanghai Electric Power Company's power plant (located by the Yangshupu River) often releases coal smoke and sulfurous odors from its chimney, which is quite unpleasant. The public has been vocal about their complaints. The Public Works Bureau's Police Committee discussed this matter at a previous meeting. According to the Electric Power Company, after various experiments, they have decided to invest approximately 350,000 yuan to build a 345-foot-tall chimney to prevent sulfurous gases from spreading again. It is expected to be completed by the spring of next year. According to the company's investigation, several factories in England have adopted this method for similar issues and have achieved significant success. If the company's chimney can indeed prevent foul odors, they will gradually add more, with the number depending on needs. Before this plan is implemented, the Public Works Bureau will urge the company to do everything possible to reduce the foul smoke from the chimney within a reasonable scope.

### Chamber of Commerce Letter: Tobacco Exchange Industry to Clearly Indicate Legal Exchange Rate

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Tobacco Exchange Association yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that we have received a letter from the local Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Trade Association, stating that since the government re-minted new currency and stipulated exchange rates, the public has found it convenient. Even foreign-operated public utilities such as trams and bus companies have strictly followed the regulations. However, tobacco exchange shops display signs with inflated exchange rates, such as 290 copper coins per dime of legal tender, and use this rate for all transactions. As a result, vendors and rickshaw pullers are following suit, leading to frequent disputes. Shanghai is a major commercial port and a place of significant influence. These behaviors are often viewed with disdain by foreigners, and it is necessary to provide guidance and correction promptly, rather than neglecting them as minor matters. Therefore, we request that you notify the Tobacco Exchange Association to inform its members that the signs should clearly indicate the exchange rate of 3,000 copper coins per yuan of national currency (or 300 nickel subsidiary coins), with a handling fee of one percent. For nickel subsidiary coins, the exchange rate should be 300 copper coins per coin, with a handling fee of two li. Charging a handling fee for exchanging coins is common in cities around the world. The Association should standardize the format to avoid inconsistencies, which would not harm the interests of the merchants and would not violate the law. After reviewing the information, the Chamber finds the association’s proposition that tobacco exchange shops should clearly indicate the legal exchange rate and handling fees for exchanging copper coins aligns with legal regulations and takes into account the interests of the tobacco exchange industry. This method is simple, easy to implement, and beneficial to society. Therefore, we request that your association investigate and implement this matter diligently.

### Public Works Bureau Health Department Does Not Discriminate Against Flower Vendors

The local Flower and Tree Trade Association sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, stating that the Public Works Bureau's Health Department discriminates against Chinese flower vendors in the Hongkou vegetable market, ordering them to close by 4:00 PM, while Japanese flower stalls are allowed to operate all day. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association has already sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting prompt action. After investigating the facts, the Public Works Bureau replied to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, stating that the flower vendors' claim of discrimination based on nationality is entirely unfounded. There are no Japanese flower vendors in the Hongkou vegetable market. As for the six flower vendors who reported the issue to the association, they had requested to extend their hours but were not approved and continued to operate beyond the allowed time without authorization. The Health Department warned them five or six times but they still failed to comply with the closing regulations. The Health Department then filed a lawsuit in court, which resulted in the imposition of fines.

### Student Circles Respond to the Boycott of Smuggled Goods Movement

Related to the Issue of Wharf Police Authority

Nanjing telephone message: Cai Zengji, the manager of the National Resources Commission-affiliated China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's warehouse at Jinliyuan Wharf, dismissed all the wharf patrolmen and requested that the French Concession send police to take over.

They have commissioned lawyer Xue Dubi to file an administrative lawsuit with the Ministry of Communications and requested the Control Yuan to investigate and impeach him. Regarding this case, the Ministry of Communications attaches great importance to the issue of police authority and has sent officials from the Navigation Administration Department to Shanghai to conduct a detailed investigation. As for the Control Yuan, the supervisory envoy of the Jiangsu region has investigated the matter, and the wharf police authority will still be maintained by police hired by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.

### Liwa Lisi Garden Opens Tomorrow

Liwa Lisi Garden, located on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek on Jessfield Road, is surrounded by rivers, isolating it from the hustle and bustle. In recent years, people from the financial and jewelry industries residing in western Shanghai have jointly managed it as a private recreational retreat during their spare time. It was named Liyuan by a respected elder, especially delightful in the summer. When the afternoon sun begins to decline, the thick shade is already covering the ground, and the green lawn is spread out, full of vitality. Therefore, it is not only a summer resort but also sufficient to regulate the spirit. This summer, for the benefit of the public, the facilities have been expanded and are being opened on a trial basis. The garden features tennis courts, golf courses, open-air dance floors, and ping pong tables. In addition, you can fish by the river, rent a boat to sail, and the dance floor orchestra and master chefs have been hired with heavy money. It can be called Shanghai's most upscale entertainment venue. The garden is scheduled to open tomorrow (the 19th).

All departments in the garden accept them at their full value.

### Mei Garden Voluntarily Closes

Mei Restaurant has been open for ten years and has generally been doing well. It suddenly closed voluntarily on the 15th of this month. The owner of the restaurant, Mr. Mao Heyuan, announced the inside story of the closure. According to him, when the restaurant was opened, it was a trial business of playful nature of twenty-four friends, and the results were very good. However, because Mr. Mao was busy and had no time to manage it, and the appointed manager Zhou Linfu was not an expert, the results were mediocre. They had intended to close in April last year, but they extended it for another year at the request of the employees. Now, because of ① excessive killing of living creatures and ② customers being demanding and unappreciative, they decided to close. The employees are trying to recommend someone to take over. All outstanding debts will be settled completely, and amounts owed to others will be repaid in a short period of time. Gift certificates will be redeemed within one month. The restaurant's location and property are currently being offered for sale at the lowest possible price.

Talking Points

### A Con Within a Con

— Zhao Menglan

Yesterday, there was a news story in various newspapers titled "A Con Within a Con." One newspaper's headline read: "Embezzled Huge Sums from Huimei, Wandering," "Righteous Rescue of Daughter Meets with Swindle." This title piqued my interest, so I read on:

"During the hearing, Liu confessed to the police the details of his embezzlement, stating: After stealing the funds, he first spent over a thousand yuan playing in various dance halls in Shanghai. Then, he took the Shanghai-Beiping train to Beiping, and then to Tianjin, staying at the Huizhong Hotel. One night, he suddenly heard a woman crying sorrowfully from the next room. He asked the bellboy what was happening, and was told that the woman in the next room was a Cantonese woman named Chen Xiuzhen, who had come to Tianjin to find relatives but was unsuccessful and lacked funds to return home. I was moved by our shared hometown and offered to escort her back to Guangdong. That night, we took a train to Shanghai and stayed at the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road, awaiting a ship to Guangdong. However, when I woke up the next morning, the woman was gone, and the thousand US dollars in my pocket had also been stolen. Liu realized he had been conned, but dared not report it, so he went to play in Tanggu..."

Embezzling funds for wandering is hard for most people to understand. And having taken ill-gotten gains and committed embezzlement, one would assume that this person would be heartless, but that is not the case. He can be "moved by our shared hometown" and even "offer to escort her back to Guangdong." Although there may be ulterior motives, such as being attracted to her, it would not be necessary to return to Guangdong. So it is even more incomprehensible. A possible explanation is that people are always people, not perfect saints, nor complete beasts.

As for embezzlement, that is naturally a criminal act. But in my opinion, it is also caused by the environment, or at least there are some reasons that stem from the environment.

"The environment" here is not limited to the current circle of life, but also includes past education, etc. In today's world, especially in a bustling metropolis like Shanghai, what one sees and hears is the temptation of extravagant pleasure. Who doesn't want to live comfortably? Especially someone from a bourgeois institution like the Sacred Heart College, and especially a vigorous youth. Seeing others pursuing pleasure, it is natural to feel envious. And because one's heart is willing but strength is insufficient, it is even more possible to become confused and commit embezzlement. We certainly dare not say that the environment makes it "inevitable," but we have not forgotten that "no one is perfect," and that even the ancient "saints had some flaws." Saints are almost impossible to find nowadays.

We do not deny that embezzlement "is an immoral act to society and to individuals. It is only right to hold him accountable in the law. But there is also concern for the future of the law, which is that the ultimate goal of human beings, in addition to work, should also be to enjoy life. When we speak of enjoyment, it does not just refer to three meals a day and a place to sleep," but should also include other things, such as a certain number of vacation days each year, and extra money for travel, etc. Otherwise, tempted by the environment, and seeing that some idlers can still enjoy their days, how can the youth under the temptation of pleasure not have thoughts of embezzlement?

This is a social problem. Some righteous people may come out and say that it is already fortunate enough to have food to eat every year, let alone think about recreation! If that is indeed the case, then of course that is very true. But if some people are still eating meat porridge, then I think it is not wrong for non-disaster victims to want to eat meat porridge. Even if they are disaster victims, it is not wrong to make such a request.

### Song of Life

— Shuimo

The Laugh

Like an unimportant part in a large machine, he is a small clerk in a large company. Every day he has to deal with different customers, he has to flatter high-ranking officials. He is born with a stubborn character, and his job requires him to laugh. He feels pain in his heart, but he has to force a cheerful smile on his face, like rouge and powder painted on the face of a corpse. Smile at customers, smile at superiors, smile at colleagues who mock him. When red envelopes take away his living expenses, he still has to bow and smile...

At night, he feels the sadness of the ugly laugh. He remembers the hypocrisy, deceit, fraud, loneliness and distress of the day - his head drooping towards the sky. The silvery moonlight gently caresses his face like a kind mother. He smiles, but the muscles on his face are already accustomed to smiling, smiling so hideously, like the miserable cry of an owl in a gloomy forest....

The Narrow Cage

The firelight illuminates his red face. Veins bulge on his forehead, his hair is disheveled, and sweat rolls down like shiny raindrops. His arms are tense, and his open chest reveals thick black hair....

He is a bread baker, carefully baking bread produced from the same mold, as if an artist treating the crystallization of his heart, carefully squeezing the milky white cream around the bread. He sings a cheerful song, happily praising while producing beautiful and delicious food for humanity.

## Page 16

His world is so narrow, a small building is his world. He sings songs as soon as he gets up in the morning. When distant chimes drift over, he knows that the Sabbath has arrived. Every day is spent baking bread, but he does not feel lonely or monotonous, painful or tired. When he thinks that he is making good food for mankind, all the cells in his body are encouraged and excited. In his narrow world, he is like a clam at the bottom of a well, imagining the roaring stove as the sun, and the night light as the gentle moon.........

One day, his eyes see the street. A wealthy young man is playing with the bread he made himself, while a ragged child of the same age is watching greedily. The chubby young man seems to be too full and playfully crumbles the bread into crumbs. When the poor child bends down to pick up the bread crumbs with his fingers, he is kicked by the young master....

From then on, he no longer has happiness or laughter, his mouth closes and he no longer sings. He resents his product—the beautiful bread—which is only for the wealthy to enjoy, attracting the envy and resentment of the poor. What he makes is not food, but only beautiful toys for the rich. He feels the heavy pressure of life, hates his work, and hates the dough in the mold. He feels tired and old.........

The Dregs of Humanity

He doesn't know who impregnated him, and he has no relatives or friends. When he realizes that he is also an organic body, he is wandering in a dirty alley.

He is like a clump of weeds growing in barren soil, without hope or dreams. As if destined by fate, he was born to suffer. He is always despised and driven away. He lies in the corner of a narrow alley and makes it his home. The earth is his bed, and the sky is his quilt. Only the stars still seem to be twinkling their eyes in concern.

Every day he has painful encounters. When he smells the aroma of vegetables and rice, his stomach cramps and his belly rattles. His head is dizzy, and his body sways with hunger. He thinks deliriously that it would be nice if he could turn into a stone, so that he would not have to endure the painful desire every day.

He scavenges, he steals, he is whipped, he is taken to the police station. His life is like a moth throwing itself into a flame, only wanting to fill his stomach, but he is never full in his life.

On a very cold day, his body is frozen stiff. His body is buried in the ground, but it is used as food by the microorganisms in the soil. That is his fate!

### Wheel

— Luo Yu

In the low-lying countryside, in the days of the early rainy season, puddles of marshes have accumulated, and reeds are submerged in the wet mud. The bulging earth has been bleached white by the sun, forming scattered, weedy earth mounds and incomplete paths. Above, on a cerulean blue canvas, float blocks of blueish, humid clouds.

In the middle of the avenue, their cries sound far away and weak. They’re struggling, their heads digging into the muddy water, their elbows taut as wooden rods, all for their own benefit. The mule cart laden with large bundles of cotton squats motionless on the road; it refuses to budge. Both wheels sink into the mud, deeper and deeper.

Sweat the color of tallow streamed down Tanglin’s shoulders. His large straw hat rubs against the cotton bundles in front of the cart, which reminds him immediately of the extra-heavy load of those over-packed bundles. He curses Zhang Jiu, the head of the coolie gang; his face is like a mare’s.

The backs of the four pullers straighten as they rotate backwards. One of them is a short, old man; the other three are all under twenty. There’s no passion in their eyes. As they blankly stare at Tanglin through the sweat on their faces, they seem to be waiting for him to shout, “Pull!” so they can strain again with their heads. That kind of expression is enough to drive an impatient man crazy.

Tanglin frees one hand from the harness to wipe his face, and looks west towards the train track downhill. He sees some smokestacks rising into the sky. The sun still blazes down, and you can’t see a soul at either end of the road. So he shouts again:

“Pull! You only have to get past this part, then you’re home! Pull!”

The four pullers suddenly fall forward as one, and their sweat springs off the ropes. Tanglin’s arms are squeezed painfully, so he grits his teeth and strains with his shoulders.

“Pull! Xiao Ke, pull!”

“Old Hu, dammit, put your back into it!”

The mule cart laden with tall cotton bundles still shows no intention of moving, and its wheels have sunk even deeper into the mud, all the way up to the axles.

“We’ll have to unload them, right, Tanglin?” Old Hu pants, his eyes already covered in bloodshot like a toad’s.

So they move their black feet, raising them from the mud and setting them back down, carrying the cotton bundles one by one to the dry mud ahead. They do this with their mouths drawn in a line and their nostrils eating and humming, trying to walk through the mud step by step.

The sun lowers in the west, as if having played a trick on them.

The hunger in their bellies spurs them into frenzied running. Clods of black mud radiate out from the heavy wheels. Tanglin speaks to himself, his steps staggered by the swaying of the cart shaft.

The cart pullers don’t know how to be ingratiating. Their faces are the faces of various wild beasts, their mouths drawn in a line and forever wearing enmity. That is how other humans imagine their appearance, even though their hearts are as docile as slaves.

Clods of black mud radiate out from the wheels as they rumble past. Tanglin’s voice strikes again and again at his companions’ eardrums.

He talks about how the well-fed people who don’t work steal, and how even little Zhang Jiu once did the same. And how men cannot be destroyed by hunger. The green corn stalks will soon rise up. In that season, you won’t find Tanglin in the city, unless the northwest winds return and he comes back again to endure others’ devouring.

The wheels covered in black mud rumble, dragging over the high slope by the railroad.

Clods of black mud radiate out from the wheels as they rumble downhill, plunging straight ahead towards the setting sun in the misty haze of the cotton mill’s thick smoke.

### Sunset Over Lychee City

— Tian Qing

—Floating clouds, a traveler's thoughts; setting sun, an old friend's feelings—

In the midsummer twilight, I often linger on this stretch of city wall. Beside the wall stands an ancient pine, its age unknown, yet unable to conceal its heroic spirit of resistance. Its strong branches stretch over the wall, extending boldly beyond the ramparts, displaying the valiant posture of an ancient knight. The slanting crimson sun casts a vast and lengthy shadow, resembling the wings of a roc covering the human world; and I am drawn into a series of dreams, dreaming of becoming a hero galloping on the battlefield.

However, the squirrel's cunning eyes have long discerned the secret within my heart, mocking me with derisive smiles; and I, too, come to realize the futility of my dreams, turning them into shame. But a person with excessive self-esteem cannot tolerate the mockery of others; moreover, this is a pitiful, ugly creature. My shame instantly turns into anger, and I hurl a rock at it fiercely. It deftly dodges, escaping to another branch, leisurely searching for pine nuts. I can no longer contain this unspeakable shame and anger, wishing I could immediately strip the skin off this little clown. – If Liang-ge were still by my side, I would likely receive another lecture.

Although Liang-ge was only two years older than me, he possessed a melancholy and precocious heart. Since childhood, he had wandered many places, enduring much suffering in the world; his understanding of life was as clear as a mirror. He often discoursed to me, pointing out the injustices of human affairs. My heart at that time was too naive to comprehend his words – no, it should be said that my living environment was too beautiful; anything beyond happiness had never occurred to me in my dreams!

Although we were close friends, we had two very different hearts. Sometimes he would stubbornly pull me, insisting that I listen to him, asking if I understood his meaning, insisting that I express my opinion on his views; I would always nod with a smile, while harboring a sense of disdain in my heart.

During our two years as classmates, Liang-ge always considered himself my protector. In the twilight of the setting sun, we often strolled along this stretch of city wall; every brick and stone here, every blade of grass, had almost been touched by our hands, even the chirping insects among the grass had become very familiar sounds. Liang-ge's steadfast heart loved the pine's strength, the clouds' roaming, and even more, the sun's heat. Facing the dimming sunset, he would often earnestly and wistfully tell me: "The sky is getting dark; let's pursue the light of tomorrow!" But I failed to understand his meaning. I was captivated by the sound of the oars rowing across the moat and the creaking of the waterwheels on the riverbank. The sunset's red glow painted the calm river surface into a golden mirror, while the waterwheels and oars seemed like mischievous children, constantly stirring up ripples, making me think of Caucasian girls, constantly shaking their golden hair in charming affection.

The moat's edge was lined with longan trees, while the other side was covered with lush lychee trees. The ripe lychees, illuminated by the evening glow, revealed even brighter red faces, shyly lowering their heads frequently; also, the afternoon breeze scattered their sweet fragrance, wave after wave, permeating the heart; coupled with the leisurely gray geese and white ducks swimming under the waterside trees, it was truly a portrayal of my entire beautiful life. Further ahead were fields, rolling villages, and hills. Beyond the hills stretched the boundless sea – the tides of Xinghua Bay reaching to the unknowable horizon. All of this was reflected in the afterglow of the setting sun, like a farewell glance, a charming look back that made the verses in my heart even more beautiful.

Three years later, when I stepped on this stretch of city wall again, my mood had completely changed: those beautiful scenes had completely transformed into dim, sorrowful ones! Liang-ge's battle to pursue truth had already spilled his blood beneath the pine tree he often leaned on; in the afterglow of the setting sun, the blood-red glow, indistinguishable from blood, also wrote down boundless anger!

Today, the blood he shed has long been blown away by the wind and washed away by the rain. However, in the heart of an old friend, it shines even more brightly, like a flame!

### Umbrella Flower Competition

— Chen He made

Thirty

Through Sai Jinhua's efforts, the peace negotiations finally succeeded. The Qing court's peace envoys, as long as the dignity of the imperial family was not damaged, could agree to all humiliating and power-losing conditions. Therefore, after completing this great accomplishment, Li Hongzhang continued to enjoy his high official position and generous salary, and the Qing Emperor and Empress Dowager continued to dream their imperial dreams. The Allied Forces also satisfied their desires and returned to their respective countries one after another. The Boxer Rebellion came to an end at this point.
