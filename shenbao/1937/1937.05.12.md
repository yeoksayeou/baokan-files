### The Aim of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations is to Adjust Relations Between the Two Countries

Japanese Foreign Minister's Statement: Claims No Disadvantage to China, Attempting to Alleviate Our Country's Concerns

[Tokyo] Official circles today firmly denied rumors that the United States and Japan would hold negotiations at the expense of a certain friendly nation, saying that the Anglo-Japanese talks in London will aim to adjust relations between the two countries and are not directed at a third party. (Eleventh Central News Agency Reuters dispatch)

[Tokyo] Yesterday (the 10th), Japanese Foreign Minister Sato met with Japanese reporters and gave a speech, attempting to dispel concerns expressed by China regarding Anglo-Japanese compromises. He stated that Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Yoshida, had held talks with Sir Robert Craigie, Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in London several months ago. The outcome of these talks, namely the content of the Anglo-Japanese understanding, will be announced soon. The British Under-Secretary of State had already announced the preliminary contacts regarding Anglo-Japanese compromise in London in the House of Lords. The Chinese side seems to believe that the Anglo-Japanese talks are detrimental to them, and therefore express serious concern. However, the fact is that the Anglo-Japanese compromise is not being conducted under conditions that sacrifice China or place China at a disadvantage. Therefore, China's concerns are unnecessary. On the Japanese side, negotiations with the British government are only to adjust the conflicts of Anglo-Japanese interests in China. The results of these talks will be announced as an Anglo-Japanese understanding when the time is ripe. (Eleventh Central News Agency dispatch)

### The Nine-Power Treaty Has Not Yet Become a Dead Letter

Official Japanese Opinion

[Tokyo] According to the Foreign Ministry spokesman's personal opinion expressed today, the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees the land and administrative integrity of China, must remain the solid foundation for cooperation among the powers related to the Pacific region. Although the treaty may one day become a scrap of paper, as no treaty can exist for one or two hundred years, the treaty is not yet a dead letter today. The spokesman also mentioned the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, stating that no formal proposal to abolish the agreement has been received from any party. Although China and Japan are the main signatory countries to the agreement, representatives from other countries also helped negotiate it to a successful conclusion at the time. Given the special nature of the Far Eastern political situation, the agreement should remain in effect until China and Japan agree to cancel it or replace it with another agreement. According to reports, the spokesman made this statement because foreign reporters had asked about Shanghai news published in Japanese newspapers, stating that the Chinese government intends to revive the Nine-Power Treaty and cancel the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement in order to delay negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations as much as possible, pending the development of an international situation favorable to China. Therefore, he responded with this statement. (Tenth Central News Agency Reuters dispatch)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Celebrating the Coronation of the British King

—Fu

King George VI of Great Britain is holding his coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey today. The grandeur of this ceremony far surpasses that of previous occasions. The cost of the coronation alone amounts to as much as 524,000 pounds (equivalent to over 8 million Chinese dollars). On this grand occasion, not only are the 450 million people under the rule of the British Empire rejoicing, but people from other countries are also expressing their congratulations.

The diplomatic relations between China and Britain have always been very friendly. Especially in the last two or three years, the relationship between the two countries has become even closer. Therefore, on the occasion of this coronation ceremony, the Chinese government has specially appointed Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, and Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi as special envoys to participate in the ceremony, leading many diplomatic, financial, and military experts to London to offer congratulations. Ambassador Guo further stated the Chinese people's congratulations at a banquet hosted on the 5th to entertain Special Envoy Kong and British government dignitaries. Ambassador Guo said, "When the Chinese Art Exhibition was held in London last year, all Chinese people felt proud and elated to be Chinese. But today, it is the opposite. Because the Chinese people in London today almost doubt that they are Chinese and think they are British. This is because they deeply feel the love and respect for the new King and Queen of England and unconsciously rejoice with the British people and the people of the world."

The fact that the Chinese people express such joy for the coronation of the British King is not just because of the "love and respect for the new King and Queen." The main reason is the friendly relations between China and Britain. In the past few years, the relationship between China and Britain has indeed improved compared to before. Especially in terms of currency reform and economic construction, the British government's help has been great. This time, the Chinese delegation in London has received a warm welcome from British officials and civilians. We sincerely hope that in addition to these celebrations, there will be political gains, so that cooperation between the two countries in the Pacific can develop further.

Recently, the situation in the Pacific, in short, is that Japan is implementing its continental policy and constantly attacking China. Not content with occupying the Northeast, Japan is also developing towards North China and central and southern China. Following political and military aggression, it is followed by economic aggression. The result of this aggression not only greatly damages China's territorial sovereignty but also causes great damage to British interests in the Far East. Although Britain tried to find a way to compromise with Japan several years ago to protect its interests in China, Britain no longer seeks a way out in Tokyo after hitting a few snags. As a result, the relationship between China and Britain has gradually become closer. However, in the past month, Japan, in order to break the international isolation, has proposed a method of cooperation with Britain on China. It is said that the British side is already preparing for concrete discussions. This method of cooperation with China will mostly contain the significance of dividing spheres of influence. If Britain disregards the actual situation in the Far East and has a "division of spheres of influence" discussion with Japan, the result will not only greatly deceive Japan, but it will also inevitably encounter the opposition of all the Chinese people. Smart British people would not do such a stupid thing. We are of course deeply convinced of Foreign Minister Eden's statement in the House of Commons on the 5th that "the British government does not want to propose the revival of spheres of influence in China." However, because the issue of "British-Japanese cooperation on China" has too much impact on our country's interests, we take this opportunity to celebrate the coronation of the British King to express the Chinese people's position and attitude.

### Coronation Ceremony Procedures for the British Monarch

[London] Tomorrow morning at half-past ten, eight gray steeds will emerge from the gates of Buckingham Palace, pulling a four-ton golden royal carriage towards The Mall, through the Admiralty Arch, past the Whitehall government offices, and finally to Westminster Abbey for the coronation ceremony of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The saddles are adorned with red Moroccan leather and gilded embellishments. Four coachmen, each controlling two horses, will be dressed in short purplish-brown attire with gold and black accents, black stockings, white wigs, black riding hats, badges on their chests, and long whips in hand. The carriage is made of elm and was specially crafted for the coronation of King George III. It is twenty-four feet long, painted in gold, and exquisitely made. On the front and rear axles, there stand two mermen figures, supporting and guarding the carriage body. The one in front holds a seashell, symbolizing the arrival of a monarch of the seas, while the one in the rear holds the trident of the sea god. At the center of the carriage roof stand three boys, representing England, Scotland, and Ireland, supporting the British crown. Inside the carriage, the King and Queen will recline on red satin cushions. Walking guards in gold and purple attire will walk alongside the eight horses, tasked with guarding them. Three walking guards, also in purple attire, will stand beside the carriage, responsible for guarding it and opening its doors. In addition to these guards, four more guards will carry halberds as they follow. On either side of the carriage, there will be an officer of the Royal Guard on horseback, sword drawn, closely following the King and Queen. Behind the carriage, there will be eight guards, arranged in two rows. A total of one hundred and sixteen Royal Guards, all mounted and wielding swords, will proceed before and after the royal carriage, each group taking half. Ahead of the Royal Guard, there will be two knights in splendid attire, serving as the vanguard for the procession. The swords of the Royal Guard will gleam, their helmet plumes drooping, with red tunics, white sleeves, and black boots. The colors red, white, and gold will be most prominent among the Royal Guard. However, the soldiers accompanying the procession will wear blue military uniforms. This is the first time the British people have seen blue-uniformed soldiers parading. The blue-clad soldiers will form two long lines along the six-and-a-half-mile route, standing on either side of the road. As the royal carriage of the King and Queen passes, they will present arms in salute. Today, both regular and territorial forces are wearing blue military uniforms, which is unprecedented. The blue trousers, adorned with red stripes, appear even more spirited than the yellow uniforms. Only the London Scottish Regiment will continue to wear brown uniforms, and the rifle brigade will still wear green uniforms. Only soldiers from overseas will wear yellow uniforms. As the royal carriage passes Victoria Memorial outside the palace gates, the crowd will erupt in cheers. From The Mall to Westminster Abbey, the entire route will be filled with joyous shouts, like thunder in the ears. Everywhere the royal carriage passes will be adorned with flags and colorful decorations, shimmering with gold and jade. Along the way, grandstands will be packed with spectators. When the royal carriage arrives at the west entrance of the Abbey, the sound of gongs and drums will resonate loudly. Upon entering, the Archbishop of Canterbury, along with four deans, will come forth to greet them. The King and Queen will then slowly proceed into the Abbey, along a seventeen-foot-wide aisle, past the music stand, and to the coronation altar. The aisle is covered with a blue carpet, one hundred and seventy-three feet long. Eight thousand attendees, upon seeing the royal arrival, will all rise to their feet. From members of the royal family to foreign dignitaries, all will pay their respects to the King. As the King advances, a choir of four hundred will sing "I was glad," a hymn originally composed for the coronation of Edward VII and later augmented for the coronation of George V. The coronation platform is covered with a specially woven tapestry of pale gold. The King and Queen will first kneel down for private prayers and then sit on their thrones, allowing the nation to acknowledge them as their sovereign. This will be followed by the recognition ceremony. The Archbishop, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, and the Lord Great Chamberlain will stand on the platform, first facing east, then turning south, then west, and finally north. At each direction, the Archbishop will loudly proclaim, asking, “Here is your undoubted King. Wherefore all of you are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?” The crowd must shout, "God Save King George." Then the trumpets will sound in unison.

Next is the oath-taking. The Archbishop will ask the new king, "Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australasia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, of all your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, and the Empire of India, according to their respective laws and customs?" The King will answer, "I solemnly promise so to do." The Archbishop will then ask, "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?" The King will answer, "I will." The Archbishop will ask, "Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel and the Protestant Reformed Religion established by Law? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of this Realm, and to the Churches committed to their Charge, all such rights and privileges, as by Law do or shall appertain unto them or any of them?" The King will answer, "All this I promise to do." The new King will then go to the altar, remove his crown, and kneel. With his right hand on the Bible, he will swear, "The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. So help me God." Having spoken, he will kiss the Bible, thus completing the oath.

Then the Holy Communion begins. The program commences with prayers, followed by readings from the Epistle and Gospel, and then the singing of the hymn "Come Holy Ghost," and the recitation of the Creed. At this time, the choir sings the anthem from the first chapter of "Kings." By this time, the King has removed his red robe and crown and slowly proceeds to the altar, sitting in King Edward's chair. Four noble lords will spread a golden cloth canopy over him. The Archbishop then anoints the King in the form of a cross with holy oil on both palms, his chest, and the crown of his head. Next, the Bishop of Westminster, after completing a prayer, takes a pair of spurs from the altar and presents them to the Lord Great Chamberlain. The Lord Great Chamberlain then touches the King's heels with them and returns them to the altar.

At this time, the King is presented with the "Sword of State." The Archbishop proclaims, "Use this sword to do justice, stop injustice, protect God's holy Church, support the orphaned and widowed, restore what is decayed, maintain what is restored, punish and reform what is amiss, confirm what is good…"

The King then places the sword on the altar and sits again in King Edward's chair. The nobleman who first received the sword pays one hundred shillings in gold to redeem it and draws it from its scabbard, standing before the new King until the end of the ceremony. The King then puts on an embroidered ceremonial robe. The attendants present the King with a golden orb, which is placed on the altar. Next, the Archbishop places a ring on the King's right hand, on the fourth finger. The King then receives the scepter. The Archbishop descends from the altar, takes the crown from the Bishop of Westminster, and places it on the King's head.

As the aforementioned ceremonies proceed, the attendees in the Abbey remain silent and still. When the King is crowned, the crowd shouts, "God Save the King," and the trumpets sound in unison. The nobles also place their coronets on their heads amidst the singing of hymns. After the crowning, the King ascends the throne. The Archbishop, the Duke of Gloucester, other members of the royal family, dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, barons, and leaders, each in turn, approach the new King, touch his crown, and kiss his left cheek to show their allegiance. This ceremony takes about fifteen minutes. At the same time, six verses of an oath of allegiance are sung. Next, the bishops and other nobles each perform the allegiance ceremony in their respective ranks. After the ceremony, drums sound loudly, trumpets blare in unison, and the crowd in the Abbey shouts, "God Save King George," "Long Live King George," and "May our King Reign Forever."

Next, the Queen undergoes the anointing and coronation ceremony. The ceremony is similar to the King's, but much less elaborate. As the Queen slowly walks past the King, who is seated on his throne, she bows to him and takes her place on her own throne. Then the organ plays loudly, and the orchestra sings hymns to specially composed music. The King and Queen together rise from their thrones and walk to the steps of the altar, remove their crowns, kneel, perform the offertory, and participate in the second part of the Holy Communion. The King and Queen both receive Holy Communion, which is blessed by the Archbishop. Then, to specially composed music, they sing hymns. The new King then puts down all the royal regalia and enters St. Edward's Chapel, removes the crown jewels, and changes into a purple velvet robe. The King and Queen then walk along the route they entered, led by the choir, to the west gate. The King holds the scepter with the cross on his right hand and the golden orb on his left. The Queen also holds a scepter in her right hand, while her left hand holds an ivory staff topped with a dove. Both the King and Queen wear crowns. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters)

### A Short History of the British King and His Family (Continued from Yesterday)

-- Special

The King's concern for the happiness of children stems from his natural disposition. One day, two mischievous boys in London knocked on the door requesting to see him, saying, "We used to play in a corner of a wasteland, but now construction is starting there, so where will we play in the future?" The King said, "Be patient, and I will find a solution for you." So the King made a phone call, asking the London Municipal Authorities to create another playground for the children. Before sunrise the next day, the King told the children, "A certain place can be used for your future games." This matter was often praised by Londoners and became a popular anecdote. Therefore, when King George V held the 25th anniversary of his reign, the King was particularly interested in matters concerning the promotion of the happiness of young men and women in the celebration program, and spared no effort in sponsoring them. One day, the King presided over a conference at the Albert Hall and received the blessings of the Boy Scouts. In the Boy Scouts' relay of the silver staff, about 2,000 children passed it on day and night, covering 2,300 miles before reaching the London venue. The King solemnly preserved this staff and the naval ensign presented by the officers and crew of the HMS Collingwood on the day the ship fought, regarding them as a special honor.

In the summer of 1920, the King was promoted to Duke of York. Three years later, with the permission of his parents, he became engaged to Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the daughter of the Earl of Strathmore. It is said that initially the lady and both sets of parents hesitated for quite some time about this matter, but this was merely to test the sincerity of the young couple's affection. Therefore, in April 1923, the King married the current Queen in Westminster Abbey, to national jubilation, and they were regarded as a perfect match. When the bride walked up the nave, she stopped at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior and respectfully placed a bouquet of white roses on the tomb, intending to represent her elder brother, who died in France during the war. After the ceremony, as the newlyweds drove past the cheering crowd outside Buckingham Palace, they paused for a moment in front of the Cenotaph. These two incidents were merely occasional actions of the Duke and Duchess of York, but they deeply moved the people. It is said that when the newlyweds left Buckingham Palace for their honeymoon that day, the Prince of Wales (the Crown Prince) reached into the car and bid farewell to his sister-in-law, saying, "Take good care of yourself, Madame is the future Queen of England." Unexpectedly, these words have now come true.

Lady Elizabeth was born in Hertfordshire on August 4, 1900, and is the only daughter of the Earl of Strathmore. There are a total of ten siblings, and when the European War broke out, all the brothers except for the one who was still too young joined the army. One of them, Fergus, died in France. Not long after the war started, the Earl's Glamis Castle was converted into a military hospital to accommodate and care for soldiers. The lady, only fourteen years old, was already able to assist her mother in managing the hospital affairs. In her spare time, she took care of the wives and children of the soldiers serving in the army and knitted socks for the soldiers on the front lines, in no way resembling a pampered aristocratic daughter. The lady was supervised by her loving mother from a young age, studying at home, and the impact of the war was sufficient to aid her education, for at that time, everyone had a spirit of loving their compatriots and serving the country. The lady had a pure and honest nature, and under the influence of this ethos, she fulfilled her responsibilities like an adult. When the lady's marriage was approaching, the residents of her hometown of Angus planned to collect money to purchase a dowry gift, but the lady, knowing that everyone was suffering from the impact of the economic downturn at the time, did not want to burden her fellow villagers and strongly refused. On one occasion, the Sheffield cutlery workers held an annual banquet and invited the Duke of York to participate, but the new King, seeing that the people were struggling and that many were unemployed, felt that the money should be used to help the poor and resolutely declined. This fully demonstrates that the new King and Queen both have a compassionate heart for their fellow human beings.

The lady was one of the bridesmaids at the wedding of Princess Mary, and she sat side by side with Prince Albert (the name of the new King) at the morning wedding banquet. At that time, the lady was only six years old, and the new King was eleven. As children, they often played together. After a short while, they parted and were separated for fifteen years. They only reunited the year after the end of the European War. At that time, the lady had grown into a graceful and beautiful young woman, and her radiant smile was particularly moving. Years ago, the Archbishop of Canterbury praised the Duchess of York's smile, saying, "The smile of the Duchess of York is a good omen for the British Empire." Her smile is genuine, full of sincerity, and without any pretense. Those who see it can dispel worry and sorrow and feel cheerful. In addition, the lady inherited her mother's literary interests, and is skilled in dancing, tennis, riding, and hunting. The new King, finding that the lady shared his interests, loved her very much and proposed to her twice but was refused. One day, while riding together in the countryside, the new King repeated his request, and the lady finally agreed. Thus, the two lovers finally became husband and wife. After the new King's marriage, the couple traveled together in Northern Ireland and then went hunting in East Africa, returning with great memories. In 1927, the new Parliament Building in Australia was completed, and the new King, on the order of his father, went to perform the opening ceremony. The new King suffered from a stutter, which had been treated repeatedly without success, so he was very worried that he would reveal his shortcomings when he gave a speech in public during the ceremony. But the new King was determined, practicing pronunciation beforehand, working hard for months day and night. His chronic problem was as if lost. On the appointed day, in front of the crowd at the new Parliament Building in Canberra, he spoke eloquently without any hesitation. Where there's a will, there's a way. On this trip, he first arrived in Jamaica on the cruiser HMS Renown, then passed through the Panama Canal and crossed the Pacific Ocean, visited the Marquesas Islands and Fiji, and arrived in New Zealand on February 22nd. He performed the ceremony in Canberra on May 9th, and returned to Beijing in July. The new Queen also accompanied him.

When the new King lived in the country, the various duties he performed cannot be fully listed, but many of them were the responsibilities that the heir to the throne should fulfill, such as going to Belgium twice, once to attend the opening ceremony of the International Exhibition, and once to represent the royal family at the funeral of the Queen of Belgium, all of which were appropriate for the Crown Prince to do. After the death of George V, the royal family stopped social activities for several months. The new King took advantage of this time to inspect various industrial areas. Last winter, his elder brother Edward VIII, wanting to marry Mrs. Simpson, was prevented by the constitution and opposed by the ministers, so he abdicated by edict. Subsequently, the royal family and the ministers jointly decided that the Duke of York should succeed to the throne. May 12th, originally the date for Edward's coronation, the new King, in order to satisfy the wishes of the people, still chose this day to perform the coronation ceremony with his Queen in Westminster Abbey. From the grand celebration throughout the country, one can see the fervor of the people's love and support.

Since the end of the European War, the new King has often had to participate in ceremonial affairs, which he disliked very much. The new King always liked to enjoy family happiness with his parents. His happiest time was when he spent time with his Queen and two daughters, or when he took the dogs, carried a film camera, and walked in the garden. One day, a film company asked the new King to allow them to film his family, and the new King replied, "There is no need for that, I have already done it myself." The new King does not seek quick solutions to problems. Whenever a problem arises, he studies it thoroughly and does not spare himself the labor. He must wait until he has fully understood it before he stops. The new King avoids superficial actions in his work. He is especially dissatisfied with explanations that are perfunctory and do not get to the heart of the matter. Every time he does something, like his father, he must seek his own peace of mind. No matter how big or small the matter, once he has agreed to it, he will do his best to accomplish it. This is also in keeping with his father's style. The new King has a strong will, which is also a hereditary trait. However, he is receptive to advice and trusts those he deems trustworthy without reservation. After the new King ascended the throne, he did not change his usual habits. It is still remembered that the new King spent his first Christmas with his family quietly at Sandringham, went to church in the morning, and distributed gifts to the children in the afternoon. For the remaining days of the holiday, he went hunting with close friends, maintaining the ancient customs of England. Some say that this is a good omen for the new dynasty in England. Sir Gregg, an old friend of the new King, said a few years ago, "The Duke of York is not a fickle person. The people may not yet understand the strength of his character, but one day he will be as loved by the people as his father." These few words can serve as an outline of the new King's character.

The new Queen has been enthusiastic about public welfare since she was a child. After becoming the Duchess of York, she worked even harder. The social responsibilities she takes on are very numerous. In her family life, she prepares meals for her two daughters in the morning, plays with them in the afternoon, and sits by the fireplace with the new King in the evening, reading books and newspapers or playing the piano, deserving the title of a virtuous mother and wife. But as Queen, as the mother of the nation, the weight of her responsibilities is naturally different from what it was before. Her two daughters, one named Elizabeth, who is just eleven years old, and the other named Rose, who is not yet seven, Elizabeth resembles her father in appearance. From a young age, she has been trained to one day rule the empire. Now, she is indeed the heir to the throne. For this reason, she has hired tutors to teach her at home, rather than sending her to school. She takes classes every morning from 9:30 AM to noon. In the afternoon, she often drives out for excursions. She is intelligent and lively, and is loved by the people. Her younger sister is just starting her studies, and according to her teachers, she is making good progress.

The new King's mother, Queen Mary, is still alive and well. She is kind and compassionate, and has a strong sense of responsibility. She usually collects art and enjoys gardening as a pastime. In the New Year's edict issued by the new King, he stated his inherited responsibilities, saying, "I undertake these responsibilities with a trusting heart, knowing that the Queen and the Queen Mother are by my side to help me." This fully demonstrates the new King's respect and filial piety towards his elderly mother. The new King has two younger brothers, one is the Duke of Gloucester, and the other is the Duke of Kent, both of whom are talented and capable of assisting the monarch. His elder brother, the abdicated King Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor, has already scheduled a wedding with Mrs. Simpson in France to fulfill his long-cherished wish. (End)

### London Diplomatic Contacts

Eden Meets with Representatives of Various Countries Busily Conferring with Czechoslovakia and Austria on Central European Issues

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov this morning for a lengthy discussion. He also met with Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Lozoraitis. As for German Defense Minister General von Blomberg, he will visit Foreign Secretary Eden this afternoon. (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas)

[London] Czech Prime Minister Hodza and Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, representing their respective governments, came here to attend the King's coronation ceremony. Today, they jointly visited Foreign Secretary Eden to discuss Central European issues. It is reported that the two men strongly asserted to Eden that Britain and France must take concrete actions in Central Europe, otherwise the small countries of Central Europe will be enticed by the Rome-Berlin political axis and will be under Berlin's protection. As a result, Germany may achieve its initial plan to dominate Central Europe. In particular, Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt insisted that Austria is determined to be independent and unwilling to join any international group. At the same time, he also expressed his deep desire to cooperate with neighboring countries in the Danube River basin. In addition, it is reported that Czech Prime Minister Hodza proposed a concrete plan for economic cooperation among the countries of the Danube River basin. This plan should start with economic cooperation between the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria, and Hungary. Secondly, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia can also participate. Finally, Germany and Italy can also join the economic cooperation. It is generally believed that Yugoslavia recently signed a political and economic agreement with Italy, so it is more difficult to join this type of cooperation. However, Hodza will attend a banquet at Buckingham Palace tonight and take the opportunity to hold talks with Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the first regent, which may serve as a preparation for Yugoslavia's joining the Danube River cooperation plan. It is also generally believed that the purpose of Hodza's proposal is only economic cooperation among the countries of the Danube River basin. This cooperation can serve as a preparation for the future conclusion of political agreements. Given the current environment, it is difficult to achieve an agreement among the Danube River countries to not interfere in internal affairs, so it is necessary to postpone it.

### The King of England's Coronation Ceremony Captivates the World

Behind-the-Scenes Political Activities Relate to International Peace

United States

[New York] The attention of Americans to the news of the King of England's coronation is so great that neither the "Hindenburg" disaster nor the arrival of the American aviator Mr. Mowry in England today can distract them. American newspapers are most focused on this news item. For example, the Sunday edition of the New York Times has as many as nineteen columns on coronation news. Most newspapers carry various images of the coronation transmitted by wireless telegraph. Americans living in the country can hear the sounds and actions of the coronation ceremony as if they were witnessing it in person. Major radio stations will be dedicated to broadcasting everything transmitted from London, without interruption from beginning to end. The King's speech will be heard in every town and village in America. (Central News Agency, 10th, Reuters)

Germany

[Berlin] Today, German newspapers all feature on their front pages the situation of London preparing for and celebrating the King of England's coronation ceremony. The public here clearly feels a strong interest in this grand ceremony. According to the London correspondent of the Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, the entire British Empire is celebrating the King's coronation as if celebrating a "family feast, and this family is so large that its fate not only concerns itself, but even affects everything. Therefore, we (referring to the Germans) express our sincere congratulations on this grand ceremony." It continued, "Today, the reason why the world is focused on London is to discover the important events and activities related to world peace behind this ceremony." It concluded, "The German people sincerely wish the King and Queen to consolidate the unity of the Empire internally and contribute to world peace externally." (11th, National Maritime Telegraph)

### Duke of Windsor's Wedding Date

### Labor Unrest Intensifies Amidst the King's Coronation

London Transport Industry Decides to Continue Strike Coal Mine Labor-Management Dispute Negotiations Break Down

[London] The results of the bus workers' meeting and the miners' meeting tonight have darkened the atmosphere in the British labor world. After the bus workers' meeting, Bevin, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, announced that the majority of workers rejected the London Transport Board's proposal and decided to continue the strike. Their second step will be to submit the issue of extending the strike to other industries to the executive council for review. Judging from the situation, the labor unrest cannot be quelled in a short time. 12,000 tram and streetcar workers are also at risk of joining the strike. The bus workers are demanding a 7.5-hour workday, which the interim report of the court of inquiry did not approve.

At the same time, Minister of Mines Crosland's mediation of the Harvey coal mine dispute has failed. The Nottingham coal mine owners and the so-called Spencer Union have refused to have unconditional meetings with the Miners' Federation. Therefore, the Miners' Federation has decided to issue a notice on Saturday and Sunday, setting the start of the strike for May 29. However, the Ministry of Mines will make further efforts to achieve an unconditional meeting of the three parties before this date. (Central News Agency, 10th, Reuters)

[London] Although officials have made every effort to mediate the London bus strike and the Nottingham mining dispute, hoping to resolve them before Coronation Day, there is still no hope of resolution. The London Transport Board's recent proposal, namely that the Board is willing to discuss all the points raised by the bus workers, except for the 7.5-hour workday, and is willing to submit all points to a court of inquiry if a direct compromise cannot be reached, has been rejected by the majority of bus drivers. The efforts of Minister of Mines Crosland to mediate the Harvey coal mine dispute have also been unsuccessful. However, the expansion of the bus strike will not materialize for the time being, although 12,000 tram and streetcar workers are now hoping that the Transport and General Workers' Union will allow them to join the strike, the union executive is unlikely to approve such a movement. It is expected that the executive will advise tram workers to continue working as usual. As for the underground railway employees, they belong to the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and are not members of the Transport and General Workers' Union. The secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen stated today that there is currently no issue involving underground railway employees. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters)

[London] The London bus strike is likely to be protracted, and will inevitably become a stalemate during the King's coronation ceremony, and cannot be resolved. Officials are extremely worried about this, and are making special efforts to conceal it from exposure. General observers now feel that the bus strike and the coal mine strike, both occurring within a week of the coronation ceremony, are not accidental, but seem to be instigated and directed by extremist elements. Although the extremists have made the workers believe that this strike is purely motivated by professional reasons, in reality it still has political implications in secret. Recognizing this, the authorities have adopted an extremely mild attitude, so as not to provoke the strikers. For example, during the British general strike in 1926, private companies used trucks to provide public transportation services. The current bus strikers have announced that if such a situation occurs, they will not tolerate it. Therefore, although some private companies attempted to take action last week, they were all dissuaded by the authorities and did not materialize. This is clear evidence of the authorities' mild attitude. In general, the authorities will maintain this attitude during the coronation celebration period, but if the strike movement spreads, the authorities may intervene actively.

### Tianjin Haihe River Floating Corpse Case

Someone Exploiting Strong Men to Dispose of Bodies Two Arrested by Police Bureau Full Investigation Underway

Tianjin Correspondence, Floating corpses have continuously appeared in the Dazhigu area of the Haihe River in Tianjin. From early April to October 7th, a total of eighty-seven corpses have been recovered, gray-purple and swollen, in a state of extreme misery. The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, the Tianjin Municipal Police Bureau, the Five River Water Police Bureau, the Maritime Police Bureau, the Gendarmerie, and the Tianjin County Government, and other land and water security agencies, sent out detectives in all directions, forming a dense net along the river. Reporting that the concessions on the west bank of the Haihe River, we have no right to enter, looking across the river, affects the speed of solving the case to some extent. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, who is currently in Tianjin, considers the floating corpses in the Haihe River to be coming continuously, three or five or seven or eight bodies per day, the number is alarming, and it concerns the lives of the people, and specifically ordered the municipal authorities that anyone who knows the source of the floating corpses and informs the officials, leading to the cracking of the case, will be rewarded with 5,000 yuan. Public officials who report and lead to the cracking of the case will be promoted three ranks. At 3:00 PM on the 8th, several detectives from the Municipal Police Bureau were on guard on the Jintang Bridge on the Haihe River, along the river's vegetable market, south and adjacent to the Japanese concession, and discovered four workers-like strong men, carrying a corpse on their shoulders from north to south, (According to the south side, namely the Japanese concession, where the Chinese and Japanese border is located, the place name is Zhakou, from Zhakou to the Jintang Bridge, the riverbank is the vegetable market) intending to abandon the corpse into the river and then escape. The detectives on guard quickly moved forward to arrest them, two of whom were captured on the spot, and the other two, due to their agility, turned around and fled south, and were not caught after being chased to the concession. The two strong men who were caught and the corpse were taken to the headquarters of the detective team of the police bureau. It was then learned that the corpse had not yet died and could still speak. According to one of the strong men, Yang Xiang, he makes a living by pulling carts, and sometimes carries burdens along the river. He was exploited by someone to carry a corpse from the roadside to the river market, and was about to run back south when he was arrested. Another strong man, named Kong Zhaoyuan, gave a similar statement to Yang Xiang, stating that he also makes a living by carrying burdens due to financial difficulties. The person who moved the corpse removed the clothes worn by the corpse before throwing it into the river to sell for money. The detective team re-examined the corpse, which had not yet died. According to the corpse, his name is Jia Rongqi, aged ten years, from Cang County, Hebei Province. He used to make paper cards for a living. A few months ago, he came to Tianjin from his hometown. He stated that due to difficulty in speaking, he needs to be rescued and recuperated before a detailed inquiry. The detective team believes that this case is important and needs to be thoroughly investigated before being transferred to the Third Section of the Police Bureau on the night of the 8th. (Night of the 8th)

### Japanese Concession in Tianjin Actively Expands

Buying Land on Behalf of the Japanese Through Traitorous Citizens Authorities Attempt Passive Crackdown

Tianjin Correspondence, The Japanese concession authorities are planning to purchase land in the Haojiatai area outside Nanmenying, attempting to expand. The Japanese concession authorities have already purchased it through the hands of the traitorous citizen He, and have evicted the old shops and are carrying out construction very quickly. In the current situation, it is feared that it can be completed before the scheduled time. The land from west of Haojia to the Great Assembly Farm, the Great Qing Chemical Society, and Liulitai is still being purchased in large quantities. However, after the official discovered this matter, the Municipal Government specially ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to investigate and prohibit it. Because of the constraints of the situation, they cannot directly restrict the Japanese from buying. Therefore, they only have passive measures, ordering each detective to pay attention to the activities of the traitorous citizens and crack down on them. At the same time, in order to prevent the Japanese concession from expanding without end, they ordered the Municipal Works Bureau to build a road from outside Nanmenying to Donglou Village as a restriction. However, our road has not yet started construction, and the Japanese are actively purchasing land. Recently, they have not hesitated to offer high prices, so many deals were still made last week. As for the land purchased by Japanese private enterprises for the construction of factories, it is mostly in the Tianjin County boundary. The Municipal Government, on the orders of the Central Government, ordered the Tianjin County Government to thoroughly investigate and prohibit it. However, the buyers buy and the sellers sell, regarding the government's ban as worthless. Therefore, the County Government, in order to punish one as a warning to a hundred, recently arrested a certain official Zhang from a certain agency, intending to send him to the Municipal Government for transfer to the court for severe punishment, because Zhang colluded with traitorous citizens to steal and sell national land or official property to the Japanese from the spring onwards, and the ill-gotten gains have already exceeded 100,000 yuan. The land sold by him to foreigners amounts to several thousand acres. The places where the land was stolen and sold are mostly Louzhuangzi, Balitai, and Xiguangkai. Zhang has many accomplices, and many people have been running around to rescue him after his arrest. The authorities advocate strict investigation and punishment, and may even send him to the Hebei Provincial Government in Baoding for disposal.

Since the expansion of the Japanese concession has now become a reality, for all the ten pieces of land purchased by the traitorous citizen He in the Haojiatai area, the authorities, in view of the fact that it is impossible to return them even after negotiations, have decided not to investigate the ones that have been purchased, and strictly prevent all the ones that have not been purchased or are being discussed. The detective team of the Municipal Police Bureau is now deploying secret posts and engaging in reconnaissance of this matter. Although ordinary traitorous citizens do not dare to purchase openly, they still negotiate constantly while hiding in a certain concession. Therefore, sometimes the original landowners do not even know that a piece of land has been sold. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, who came to Tianjin, is very concerned about this, and secretly ordered the competent authorities to investigate and arrest the traitorous citizens who stole and sold national land, and to prevent the free expansion of the Japanese concession. The Sheng Nongyuan agricultural experimental field that the Japanese are planning to establish in Louzhuangzi has also been ordered by the responsible authorities to politely persuade them not to realize it. Therefore, this matter is probably a newly emerging diplomatic problem in North China recently. (10th)

### Gansu Hexi Counties Appeal for Disaster Relief Group Arrives in Beijing

Requesting Assistance from the Central Government and Various Charitable Organizations And Petitioning the Government to Exempt Regular and Miscellaneous Taxes

Nanjing Correspondence, Since the earthquake disaster in Gansu Hexi counties in the 16th year of the Republic of China, followed by floods, the 17th and 18th years were ravaged by warfare, and the people were exhausted. Afterwards, they suffered from drought, hail, frost, rat, wind, sand, and continuous rain disasters, the local vitality was greatly damaged, and the people's wounds were not healed. Moreover, last winter, 40,000 to 50,000 communist bandits crossed the Hexi River and fled, capturing the county towns of Gulang, Yongchang, Shandan, Linze, and Gaotai, and harassing the counties of Jingtai, Yongdeng, Wuwei, Minqin, Minle, and Zhangye. According to statistics, the losses of the people in various counties are no less than 20 million yuan. The disaster-stricken people are about 60,000 households and more than 370,000 people. Recently, they have no ability to sow in the spring, and it is difficult to expect a harvest in the autumn, and it will inevitably evolve into a tragic situation of exchanging skeletons and selling children. Although the Central Government has allocated funds for emergency relief, the disaster situation in Hexi counties is extremely severe, and it is difficult to solve the problem with a drop in the bucket. In order to seek fundamental relief, local people have publicly elected representatives Tang Fake, Zan Jianxing, Quan Guoyi, Chen Shengfan, Zhang Yuanchun, Zhu Mingde, Zhang Jianhou, Liu Kenian, Tang Jinwen, Zhang Shanggong, Wan Rongchun, Zhang Zhensheng, and other twelve people to form an appeal group, and come to Beijing to appeal to the Central Government and various charitable organizations to continue to allocate funds for disaster relief, and to petition the government to exempt regular and miscellaneous taxes. The group has now arrived in Beijing and is appealing for disaster relief separately.

### The 8th Standing Committee Meeting of the China International Famine Relief Commission Held in Jiangxi

Discussing and Deciding on Work Plans Electing the President and Vice President

Nanchang Correspondence, The China International Famine Relief Commission holds a regular meeting once every two years to report on its work, discuss its affairs, and amend its constitution, in order to discuss progress together. Its 8th regular meeting should be convened this year. After discussion by the Executive Committee, it was decided to follow the previous Xi'an meeting and hold it at the Lizhi Society in Nanchang on the 7th and 8th of this month. Prior to the meeting, letters were sent to all branches across the country, recommending one Chinese and one foreign representative to attend and participate, and requesting the Ministry of Interior and the Relief Commission to send personnel to guide the meeting.

### Frequent Fires in Guangzhou in Recent Days

More Than Forty Shops Destroyed One Fatality More Than 100,000 Yuan in Losses

Guangzhou Correspondence, Fires have been frequent in Guangzhou in recent days. It is estimated that in the past three days, there have been two major fires and one minor fire, with losses of more than 100,000 yuan, and there have been casualties. In the past, fires usually occurred in the dry winter season, but now it is late spring and early summer, and it rains frequently, but fires have occurred repeatedly. It is really an abnormal event. It was found that around dusk on April 29, at No. 543 Xihua Road in the city, the owner of the Heli Cotton Factory, Lu Tan, had a partner of four or five people who recently sold old cotton made by electric machines. The business was relatively stable. However, when the machine was turned on that night, the electric machine suddenly released an electric current, and the flames shot out in the shop, and they were at a loss and fled in a panic alone. All the factory equipment was not moved in time. In a blink of an eye, the fire spread, and after the fire brigades from all roads rushed to rescue, it was extinguished after about three hours. It is estimated that the Heli Factory, Dahua Hotel, Yili Grocery Store, Beauty Salon, Renshengtang Medicinal Material Store, Ertai Coal Store, Xia Quan'an Shed Factory, Yuanshenghao, No. 549 vacant house, No. 551 Li Residence, No. 599 vacant house, Quanxing Shed Factory, and four wooden houses in Liancai New Lane were burned down. According to statistics, a total of seventeen shops were burned down, with a loss of about 50,000 yuan. During the fire, five people were injured and burned. Also, at 0:35 on the 30th, a fire broke out on the main street of Longwei Daonan in Henan, suddenly turning into a prairie fire. Previously, in the Longshengxiang Paper Shop on the street, before each partner went to bed, somehow, a fire was left in the paper basket. The partners went into deep sleep and did not notice it. When the flames were approaching, the shop assistants were awakened and called for help, but it was impossible to put out the fire. One of the shop assistants rushed out of the thick smoke and telegraphed the fire brigades to drive over to put out the fire. At this time, six nearby shops had caught fire. There were no tap water facilities in the area, and the spring water was not enough to supply. Therefore, the fire trucks were almost helpless. Finally, it burned for more than an hour before the fire was extinguished. The shops destroyed were: Longshengxiang Paper Shop, Hengchang Paper Firecracker Shop, Fushoutang Medicinal Material Shop, Gongyuan Inn Preserved Meat Shop, Renshouxuan Medicinal Material Shop, Changji Preserved Meat Shop, Linan Cake Shop, Longshengchang Grocery Store, Chengji Fish Shop, Rongtailong Beijing Confectionery Shop, An Pig Meat Shop, Yuexing Tofu Shop, Yaolai Pig Meat Shop, Qingshoutang Medicinal Material Shop, Heji Fish Stall, Shangji Vegetable Stall, Liangji Pig Meat Shop, in addition, there are Huangzhai, etc. The above two fires resulted in losses of 130,000 yuan. On the evening of the 30th, the God of Fire again visited Weixin South Road, and the Chenganchang Fruit Shop at No. 5 on the road suddenly burned down. At 11:00 PM, the five shop assistants escaped from the back of the neighboring houses. Only Li Fa, a colleague who lodged in the shop, died in the fire pit due to his old age and infirmity. As a result, the entire shop was burned down.

### Minister He Holds Reception for All Sectors Regarding Relief for Drought in Guizhou Province

Decision to Establish Guizhou Drought Relief Association; He Appointed as President, Yu and Yang as Vice Presidents

The drought in Guizhou Province is severe. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, concerned about his hometown, held a tea party at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon to invite leaders from all sectors of Shanghai to discuss relief measures. Those in attendance included Yu Hongjun, Qian Dajun, Yang Hu, Jiang Dingwen, Cai Jingjun, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Chengying, He Jiwu, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Wen Lanting, Mu Ouchu, Gu Xinyi, Cheng Jingsheng, Lin Kanghou, Tang Shoumin, Song Hanzhang, Wu Yunqi, Lu Bohong, Chen Xing, Huang Hanzhi, and over a hundred others. At the meeting, the Shanghai Guizhou Drought Relief Association was established, with He Yingqin appointed as the president. Details are as follows:

Chairman's Report

Chairman He Yingqin reported, "Today, I have arranged this gathering and provided tea and refreshments to invite representatives from charitable organizations in Shanghai to discuss relief for the drought in Guizhou Province. I am grateful to all of you for attending. First, on behalf of the millions of disaster victims in Guizhou Province, I express my gratitude. I would also like to take this opportunity to report on the disaster situation in Guizhou. Guizhou has many mountains and little farmland, and as a remote and impoverished province in the southwest, its local produce has always been insufficient to meet its own needs. Over the years, it has suffered from either drought or floods, and disasters have occurred repeatedly. In the past, due to political instability, preparations for disaster prevention and relief were extremely inadequate. In the past two years, banditry has further intensified the situation, with looting, arson, and killing. The homes of many families are empty, and any public or private reserves have been used to supply the local area. In particular, in many counties that have been disturbed by bandits, forests have been almost completely cut down, turning into bare mountains. Cattle have also been slaughtered, destroying the tools for agricultural work. Therefore, in the past, disasters in Guizhou Province were mainly floods, but this year, due to climate change and scarce rainfall, there has been an unprecedented drought. I have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from Chairman Gu of the Guizhou Provincial Government and local elders. Furthermore, Commissioner Cheng Jingsheng of the Central Relief Commission, who recently returned to Beijing from Guizhou, spoke in great detail about the disaster situation in Guizhou. Since autumn, there has been no rain for several months. Rivers have dried up, wells have run dry, and the soil is cracked. Not only is irrigation difficult, but people cannot even obtain daily drinking water. The spring harvest is already hopeless, and the main crop cannot be planted. According to reports, the affected counties include Zunyi, Tongzi, Renhuai, Chishui, Guiyang, Anshun, Pingyue, Xifeng, Anlong, Meitan, Xingren, Xingyi, Guanling, Puan, Majiang, Annan, Bijie, Weining, Pingba, Puding, Guodai, Qingzhen, Zhenfeng, Guangshun, Suiyang, Kaiyang, Zhengan, Shui, Zhenning, Zhixin, Xiuwen, Shiqian, Zhouheng, Zhaohai, Zhenyuan, Guiding, Dingfan, Huangping, Lushan, Dading, Dushan, Bazhai, Qianxi, Sanhe, Datang, Yinjiang, Longli, Dejiang, Wengan, Cenggong, Pingzhou, Shibing, Shangqing, Wangsui, Luodian, Jiangkou, Songtao, and other counties. Among them, the disaster is most severe in Zunyi, Tongzi, Renhuai, Chishui, and over ten other counties, which urgently need emergency relief. The details of the disaster situation are provided in the survey report recently sent by the Guizhou Provincial Government, which has been printed in multiple copies for your reference. According to a telegram from Chairman Gu, the proposed relief measures are divided into three points: (1) Provide emergency relief, that is, provide 30,000 to 8,000 yuan to each of the counties most severely affected, such as Zunyi and Tongzi, based on the severity of the disaster, and send personnel to investigate and distribute the funds; (2) Provide agricultural relief, distribute seeds to save the autumn harvest; (3) Provide industrial relief, open branches and dredge ditches in the affected counties in the Wujiang, Panjiang, and Qingshui River basins, and dig wells and ponds in areas lacking water sources to supplement irrigation. The emergency relief requires approximately 400,000 yuan in cash. The industrial relief can not only alleviate the current disaster but also prevent future droughts. However, the project is vast, and no matter how tightly it is budgeted, it requires over 1 million yuan in cash. In total, only 300,000 yuan has been approved for relief. This is far from enough for emergency relief, and there is no funding for agricultural and industrial relief. Although people from Guizhou Province in Beijing have made repeated appeals, the central government's finances are also strained, and uneven distribution is unavoidable. Gentlemen, I admire your concern for the disaster victims in the remote provinces and your enthusiasm for helping others. I hope that you will use your influence to quickly seek relief for the millions of disaster victims. If you raise your voices, philanthropists from all walks of life will surely respond and gather a large amount of aid, so that the disaster victims who are waiting to be fed can receive real benefits. Regarding the disaster situation in Guizhou Province, what I have reported just now is only a general overview. As for the detailed situation, Mr. Cheng Jingsheng, who has just returned from inspecting Guizhou Province, will give a detailed report later. Regarding the fundraising and relief measures, Mr. He Jiwu, a member of the Guizhou Provincial Government, and Mr. Wang Chengying, Director of the Finance Department, have already come to Shanghai and have discussed the matter with you. I hope that you will not hesitate to provide guidance and come up with more ideas. As the saying goes, 'Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda.' The millions of disaster victims in Guizhou Province are in urgent need of rescue. I sincerely ask you to fulfill this great wish, to relieve the suffering and avert the disaster. I cannot stay in Shanghai for long due to busy affairs in Beijing. Please provide instructions on how to raise funds and provide relief, so that the process can proceed smoothly. I raise this glass to plead for the disaster victims in Guizhou Province and wish you all good health." After the establishment of the relief association, Commissioner Cheng Jingsheng of the Relief Commission reported on his disaster survey, briefly stating that he was assigned to survey the disaster in Guizhou Province. Since March of last year, there has been no rain in Guizhou Province. Among the 81 counties, 62 have been affected by the disaster, and the number of disaster victims has reached 2,762,276. The disaster is severe, and he hopes that philanthropists from all walks of life will actively donate so that industrial and agricultural relief in Guizhou Province can be realized as soon as possible. Then, Wang Chengying, Director of the Guizhou Finance Department, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Qu Wenliu, and others expressed their opinions. It was decided to establish the Shanghai Guizhou Drought Relief Association, with He Yingqin as the president and Yu Hongjun and Yang Xiaotian as the vice presidents. Qu Wenliu, Cheng Jingsheng, Wang Chengying, and He Jiwu were appointed to draft the charter and donation appeal. It was also decided to hold a committee meeting on the afternoon of the 14th of this month (Friday) at 4:00 PM to discuss the charter and elect honorary presidents and executive directors in order to carry out fundraising. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

### Japanese Consul General's Intelligence Chief Tajiri Visits Gan Jiehou Yesterday

Both Sides Inquire About Sino-Japanese Issues

Shen Shi News reports that Mr. Tajiri Aiyi, the intelligence chief of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, visited Mr. Gan Jiehou, the representative of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, at the Huayi Hotel yesterday morning for about an hour. A reporter from Shen Shi News happened to be visiting Mr. Gan and asked him about the content of the conversation. Mr. Gan replied that it was a private social gathering. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe was the Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou when he (Gan) was the special diplomatic envoy to Guangdong and Guangxi. Tajiri was the Deputy Consul in Hankou nine years ago when he (Gan) was the special diplomatic envoy to Hubei. Therefore, they all knew each other. Knowing that he (Gan) was in Shanghai, Tajiri came to reminisce about old times. The reporter insisted on asking about the content of the conversation. Mr. Gan then readily agreed, saying that there was nothing that could not be made public in his conversation with Tajiri. He told the reporter the content, thinking that Tajiri would not object. He (Gan) asked Tajiri what concrete measures would be taken after Foreign Minister Sato announced his diplomatic policy. Tajiri replied that Ambassador Kawagoe had only met with Minister Wang once or twice since Minister Wang took office, and Ambassador Kawagoe would not be able to return here for another month. Therefore, no concrete discussions had yet been held. Foreign Minister Sato's declaration was an indirect expression to China, and China should now have a response. He (Gan) asked whether Sato's policy was feasible. That was another question, but the Japanese military and political parties could not agree. He asked whether Sato's policy could ultimately be realized. Tajiri replied that the Japanese military and political parties did not agree, but there was no difference in diplomacy. He (Gan) asked whose initiative it was to hold talks in London to resolve the Far East problem. Tajiri replied that he was not very clear, but Britain was paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese issue and was trying to find a solution, but he had heard that there were no concrete discussions yet. At this point, Tajiri asked why the anti-Japanese sentiment in Guangxi had become more tense since last year. He (Gan) replied that this anti-Japanese upsurge was entirely the direct result of the North China and Suiyuan incidents. Tajiri also said that there was no reason why Japanese people were not allowed to live in Guangxi. Even the Japanese who had been running the Yueyangtang Pharmacy in Wuzhou for many years were ordered to leave the country by the Guangxi Provincial Government. Since last year, even Japanese tourists have not been allowed to enter, which is even more unreasonable. He (Gan) replied that the military and political authorities in Guangxi have a responsibility to protect foreigners. At present, the anti-Japanese sentiment among the people of Guangxi is very strong. They are afraid that it will be difficult to protect Japanese people after they enter the country. Therefore, there are these special measures. Tajiri asked whether Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren, whom he had met in Guangdong, advocated the recovery of the three northeastern provinces, and whether he still held this view now. He (Gan) replied that his position was the same as before and had not changed. Tajiri asked how the anti-Japanese movement in Guangxi could be calmed down. He (Gan) replied that this all depended on Japan's future policies.

### Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Asks Liu Xiang to Implement Disaster Relief Measures

Shanghai Circles Believe that Six Measures Are Fundamental Policies for Treatment and Aid

The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram to Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, yesterday, which read: "Chairman Liu of Chengdu, Fucheng Jianjian, this association, in order to allow all circles in Shanghai to thoroughly understand the true situation of the Sichuan disaster, held a tea party on the Zheng day to invite leaders from all walks of life. More than one hundred people attended, and Vice President Zhang Qun chaired the meeting to report on the detailed situation of the disaster-stricken counties in Sichuan Province and the six disaster relief measures advocated by the Nanjing Association. The whole audience spoke enthusiastically and expressed great sympathy, especially promoting the six measures, which are fundamental political policies. It was decided to expand the organization into the Shanghai All Circles Sichuan Disaster Relief Association. In addition to the president and vice president of this association as ex-officio members, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Song Hanzhang, Yu Zuoting, Qian Xinzhi, Qu Wenliu, Mu Ouchu, Wang Boqi, Yu Zhiqing, Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, and others were publicly elected as members, and preparations were made to establish it immediately in order to promote all disaster relief work. We believe that since people from the outside world are enthusiastically supporting us, all of us Sichuan people should be more actively involved, so that internal and external cooperation can achieve twice the result with half the effort. As the person in charge of Sichuan's political affairs, you have a heavy responsibility. The Nanjing Association has already sent the six measures to you by telegram. We hope that you will make separate donations and business conditions. Not only will more than 30 million disaster victims be taken care of, but also a great contribution will be made to the future of national rejuvenation. This telegram is specially sent to you, and your mother is not allowed to be in the camp. The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association is true."

### Lu Bohong and Others Telegraph That the Henan Disaster is Extremely Severe

Dozens of Miles of Red Land Resemble a Desert; All Tree Bark and Grass Roots Have Been Stripped and Eaten, and Stone Powder is Being Chewed

The Shanghai Charity Federation for Joint Disaster Relief received a telegram yesterday from Lu Bohong and others, directors of the Henan Investigation and Relief (titles omitted): "The disaster situation in Henan has recently become more serious. Because there are few people who have gone deep into the disaster area to inspect, the newspapers have not been able to fully disclose the situation. The people of the country pay little attention to it, so the donations are few. Alas, how can the people of Henan be saved? According to the original letter from Feng Denan, a member of the relief committee in Yichuan County, 'Directors Lu and Li, I went to the western highland area of the county on May 2 to investigate the disaster. For dozens of miles, the land was red, just like a desert. Among the low-lying canals, there were seedlings, but they were less than a foot tall, withered and thin, as if frosted. All the leaves and roots of trees, except those containing toxic juices, have been stripped and eaten. Along the way, the old and weak flocked to the Jin Peixia Hao Village area, digging for stones to eat. The stone grinders that have been made are carried with them and eaten. I went with the hungry people to inspect the stone production area. The area is an alluvial layer, and the stone is like soft whetstone, easy to chew. However, most of the disaster victims who chew stone powder have swollen abdomens and red and swollen faces. Those who have been eating stone powder for a long time have constipation and die one after another. On that day, there were more than 40 people mining stone powder here. They would rather die of suffocation than starve to death. I have traveled all over Europe and Asia and have never seen such a great disaster. I cried to the sky in pain, but there was no help. Shanghai is a place where the rich gather, and there have always been many people who are good at doing good. I respectfully ask you to forward this to the Shanghai General Assembly and urge them to do everything possible to appeal. Alas, the disaster victims are all our compatriots. Everyone is as good as I am. The disaster situation in Zhongzhou is probably not fully known to the other provinces, otherwise there will certainly be good people who will donate large amounts of money. Yichuan County is a county merged from Pingdeng and Ziyou counties. The transportation is inconvenient, and the investigation and relief are difficult. However, all investigation and relief negotiations have appropriate plans and should not have any omissions. However, there is too little porridge and too many monks, so we can only take care of one thing and lose sight of another. Witnessing the tragic situation, we have no choice but to report to the two sides, hoping that you will make a decision and copy the original letter and send it to the newspapers to fully disclose the situation and do everything possible to appeal, so that the disaster victims in the Henan province, which is a hell on earth, can have a glimmer of hope. We are extremely urgent and anxious.' Lu Bohong, Director of Henan Investigation and Relief, Li Shaoduo, Deputy Director."

A Large Bundle Is Confiscated by the Bureau

Shenzhou News reports that since a certain Ronin began smuggling, our country's anti-smuggling measures have been implemented through wharf management by the Customs, which is conducting strict inspections.

### Returning Refugees from Spain Petition the Social Bureau

Request Funding for Travel Expenses to Return to Their Hometowns; The Bureau Sends a Special Commissioner to Express Sympathy

Twenty-three Chinese refugees who fled the war in Spain and returned to China arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month, as reported in the newspapers. The refugees, in a difficult situation after fleeing the war and running out of funds, had previously gone to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to request relief but had not received any results. The refugees sent Xu Cuimei, Jiang Songlin, and Qiu Tingxun as representatives to continue to request relief from the Municipal Planning Committee yesterday morning with a petition. The bureau sent someone to receive them, accepted the petition, and agreed to discuss the matter with the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to send them back to their hometowns. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau subsequently sent Wang Fukun to discuss the repatriation method with the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau yesterday morning and then went to the Yuelai Inn on Dagu Road in the Sixteenth Pudong to express sympathy to the refugees. The refugees' petition stated, "Regarding the request for assistance, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, we lost all business and were short of food, almost becoming ghosts in a foreign land and never seeing our motherland and hometown again. We were sent back to our country, which is our rebirth. However, we have no money left after arriving in Shanghai from Spain and cannot return to our original Zhejiang Qing (Tian) hometown. If this continues, we will sit and wait for death. Therefore, we respectfully ask your bureau to forward our request to the government to show great compassion to save us from danger and to send us back to our hometowns to relieve us from our predicament. This is a great virtue. Presented to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau."

### Japanese-Dutch Trade Agreement to Be Established at the Expense of Our Country

Japan Purchases Dutch Sugar and Compromises by Dumping Taiwan Sugar in China; Restricting Chinese Goods Exported to Dutch India Is the Only Purpose of the Japanese Side

Shenzhou News reports that since Mr. Kuwashima, representing the Japanese government, went south to Dutch India, the rumor of the establishment of a trade agreement between Japan and the Netherlands has spread to various countries, and there is a trend to sign and announce it within days. According to rumors from various sources, the only focus of the agreement is the issue of excluding Chinese goods. The Shenzhou News reporter, believing that this matter is of great importance, has inquired from various sources about the situation as follows:

Dutch India Has Always Had a Trade Surplus with Us

According to the investigation, Dutch India's trade with us has always had a trade surplus, and the difference between the two figures is often between ten and fifteen times. Dutch India's imports into our country are often around 10 million guilders per year, and sometimes more than 30 million guilders, while our country's exports to Dutch India are only about 2 million guilders per year. Although last year broke the record, it was only 5,991,000 guilders, which is still four times less than Dutch India's 23,196,000 guilders. Therefore, China is undoubtedly the best market for Dutch India. Our imports into Dutch India include cloth, food, groceries, porcelain, wool fabrics, stationery, books, canned food, paint, etc., while Dutch India's imports into our country are almost all sugar and oil.

Dutch India Has a Trade Deficit with Japan

However, Dutch India's trade with Japan is the opposite, with a trade deficit. In the past four years, Japanese goods have made rapid progress in the Dutch India market. In 1931, the total value was only 63,450 yuan, but it rose to 158,450 yuan last year. However, Dutch India's imports to Japan have been declining year by year since 1929. The only reason is that Dutch India's exports rely entirely on sugar, but after Japan successfully cultivated Taiwan sugar, it not only does not need to purchase Dutch sugar, but also uses smuggling and other methods to overwhelm the power of Dutch sugar in China. In the past, Dutch India adopted a quota system to resist Japan, but it had little effect. In the past two years, because Japan prepared for war and purchased and stored as much oil as possible, Dutch oil was able to be imported into Japan in large quantities, and the table gradually improved.

Planning an Agreement to Exclude Our Country

Dutch India's sugar production has been rejected by Taiwan. Now, the most important goods imported into Japan are sugar, oil, gasoline, iron, and rubber related to military use. Japan's imports into Dutch India are mainly cotton fabrics and rayon, followed by five-piece manufactured goods, ceramics, and glassware. However, Japan always believes that the measures promulgated by Dutch India hinder the sales of Japanese goods and strives to achieve the purpose of not hindering Japanese goods in the Nanyang market. After a long period of planning, it was decided to establish a trade agreement with Dutch India. The method it adopted was to purchase sugar produced in Dutch India and dump all of Taiwan's sugar in China, and to expand the Japanese goods market in Dutch India and restrict the import of Chinese goods. The compromise conditions held by Kuwashima on his trip south were to sacrifice China in order to obtain the conditions for cooperation between Japan and the Netherlands. In fact, the Dutch sugar market in China is huge. If Taiwan sugar is dumped, although it will gain a market in Japan, its original market in China will undoubtedly be rejected. Therefore, after the establishment of the Japanese-Dutch trade agreement, we will suffer losses, and Dutch India will also gain nothing, while Japan will benefit from it. Now, more than one million overseas Chinese in Dutch India believe that this agreement will destroy overseas Chinese merchants and domestic industry and commerce and have suggested to the country to re-negotiate a trade agreement with Dutch India in order to remedy the situation.

### First Batch of New Tea from Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi Transported to Shanghai

The first batch of boxed tea is produced in Huizhou Tunxi Suian and other places, totaling more than 560 boxes, which were declared and packed by Maoshun Tai at Zhakou Station on behalf of customers and transported to Shanghai by freight car last night. The tea was unloaded at the Shanghai South Station and transferred to the Suzhou River Yuanji Foreign Bank by the Huayun collapsed car company for storage and will be successively shipped abroad for sale.

### Tan Erfu's Home Leave to Belgium Scheduled

Mr. Tan Erfu, the Belgian Consul-General in Shanghai, who also serves as Chargé d'affaires, has been in China for three and a half years. According to Belgian diplomatic custom for overseas officials, he is entitled to six months of home leave. Therefore, Mr. Tan is scheduled to return to Belgium by ship in early July from Shanghai.

### Labor Dispute at the Anglo-Chinese Cotton Mill Resolved Through Mediation

Six Settlement Measures Signed – Workers to Return to Work on the 14th

The labor dispute at the Anglo-Chinese Cotton Mill on Robison Road in Western Shanghai, owned by British interests, which arose from the dismissal of a foreman by the factory management, has been protracted. To resolve the situation, the municipal Party and government authorities dispatched Wu Wenbang from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang Xianqing from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Jia Enchao, Chief of the Caojiadu Police Sub-station, to convene representatives from the labor side (Chen Xinghai, Pan Kexing, Wang A'er) and representatives from the capital side (Mr. Gordon of Jardine Matheson). As a result, a six-point agreement was signed, declaring a resolution. The terms are as follows: ㊀ Sixty workers will be permitted to terminate their employment relationship with the factory (a list is attached separately). ㊁ Dismissed workers who are entitled to a pension will receive it (one month for each year of service); those without a pension will receive three months' severance pay (if the pension is less than three months, the factory will make up the difference). ㊂ The factory shall not dismiss workers without just cause. However, if a worker commits a serious offense or theft, the factory is entitled to dismiss the worker unconditionally, in accordance with the law; otherwise, the factory shall pay severance and pension benefits according to the procedures for dismissing workers. ㊃ The factory shall begin preparations for worker registration immediately and complete it within four days. Workers must also complete registration within the prescribed period. Workers who fail to register within three days of the resumption of work will be considered as having voluntarily resigned and will not be entitled to severance or pension. ㊄ The workers are permitted to return to work at the factory at 6:00 AM on the 14th of this month. ㊅ The pension payments for the dismissed workers are scheduled to be paid at the factory on the 18th of this month.

Yesterday, Director Liu stated that he serves the country and obeys the will of the central government, so he will await the central government's orders regarding his future advancement or retreat, and he has no preconceived notions.

### Italian Shipping Company Increases Far East Cruise Liners

The Conte Biancamano Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday

Since the Dutch Shipping Company built large ships to compete on the Pacific Shanghai route last year, other companies, such as the Japanese Osaka Shipping Company and the British Steamship Company, have followed suit in building ships, leading to intense competition. The Italian Shipping Company, which already had two ships on the Pacific route, the Conte Grande and the Conte Rosso, recently decided to add two more ships to the Pacific route. The first ship, the Conte Biancamano, arrived in Shanghai for the first time on the afternoon of the 10th and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Pier. The ship, which originally sailed on the Atlantic, is participating in the Far East route for the first time and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 10:30 AM on the 14th for Italy, via Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Bombay, Massawa, and Marseilles, arriving in Italy in 23 days.

### First Standing Committee Meeting of the Fisheries Banking Syndicate of the Ministry of Industry

Loans Established and Under Review Will Reach 300,000 Yuan

The Fisheries Banking Syndicate of the Ministry of Industry held its first meeting of the Standing Committee recently. The directors in attendance were Yu Zhenyong, Cheng Muhao, Qian Xinzi, Wang Zhihua, and Cao Jiru. Those present as observers were Qu Junyuan and Hua Wenyu.

### Ningbo Native Association Appeals on Behalf of Fishermen Yesterday

Discolored Salt Harms the Fishing Industry - Telegram to the Executive Yuan and Ministry to Order a Halt

The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance: We respectfully report that the people of the coastal counties of Zhejiang Province mostly rely on fishing for their livelihood, and those from Ningbo constitute a significant portion. In recent years, due to the impact of the rural economic downturn, fishing villages are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the plight of fishermen struggling to survive is beyond words. Since the government implemented the use of discolored salt for fishing last year, their hardship has intensified. Our association has repeatedly reported the situation. Zhejiang Province now has detailed measures for managing fishing salt, and the system of discoloring salt for impoverished fishermen should be halted immediately. Furthermore, Clause 1 of the measures for flavoring and discoloring fishing salt stipulates that the flavoring and discoloring should not contain toxicity, should not be detrimental to hygiene, and should not interfere with the preservation of goods. The impurities currently used for discoloring are nothing more than mixing in red soil, rice bran, or charcoal powder. After trial use, the following significant drawbacks have been discovered: ㊀ The product quality is poor, and the inherent flavor of the product is changed. ㊁ It is prone to spoilage. ㊂ It is unhygienic. As a result, the price of the product has decreased, and it is difficult to sell. Moreover, in order to improve aquatic products and compete in the fish sales market, countries around the world are striving for refined fishing salt, and none have used discolored fishing salt to degrade the product. Why is Zhejiang Province implementing this discolored fishing salt, which reduces the flavor of fish products, causes fish prices to plummet, and severely damages fish sales, while opening the door to the dumping of foreign fish? Furthermore, the regulations on fishing salt in the Songjiang and Huainan areas approved by the Ministry of Finance stipulate that the salt remaining on fishing boats that is suitable for edible purposes may be purchased by official salt depots. This shows that fishing salt in various areas is not discolored in reality. Only Zhejiang Province is the first to implement this, increasing the burden on fishermen and hindering fish sales. At a time when fishing villages are declining, the government is striving to protect and develop them. The discoloring system for impoverished fishermen should be halted immediately. If there are concerns about fishing salt being diverted for edible purposes, the focus should be on managing fishing salt, implementing official transportation and sales, and conducting a strict investigation of the amount of fish caught and the amount of salt used. The problem of diversion can be prevented. Witnessing the suffering of our fellow fishermen, our association is submitting this report once again, hoping that you will investigate and order the salt administration agencies of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to immediately halt the discoloring system in order to alleviate the suffering of the people and benefit development. We await your urgent orders." The Committee Chairman of the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, Yu Hede, etc., respectfully bow.

The Shanghai Lawyers Association, in order to inform the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, regarding the Association's recommendation that creditors requesting the seizure of land, if able to identify the plot and be responsible for the seizure, even if the map, insurance, and number of plots are unclear, should be investigated by their authority or ordered the local land protector to report before the land registration book is organized and published, and that a reply was received approving the seizure. This has been notified to all members yesterday, the notification begins, "Based on the proposal by member Xu Zuoliang (omitted)..." After the Association sent a letter, the Land Bureau replied, stating that "Regarding the great letter from your Association, asking for assistance from the court in searching for and reporting map, insurance, and plot numbers when the court requests measurement and seizure of land owned by debtors by creditors, before the organization of land is completed and the land registration book is published, or ordering the local land protector to truthfully and thoroughly report, and not to refuse execution simply because the creditor does not know the map, insurance, and plot numbers. The Bureau measured and seized land according to the ten articles of the measures agreed upon with the Shanghai Local Court in July of the 23rd year, for all land within the scope of the city. As for land seizure certificates not approved by the court, because it is necessary to order the local land protector to investigate and report, or to send a letter to the court to announce the cancellation, there is no delay because of this. However, regarding the measurement section, if the creditor can accurately point out the location of the debtor's property and not be rejected because the creditor does not know the map, insurance, and plot numbers, a copy of the measures is attached for reference. "The joint meeting of the 243rd Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Association decided to report to the courts and forward these kinds of land seizure events to the Municipal Land Administration Bureau for investigation and processing, and notify all members to be aware of it. The corresponding letter is hereby sent, hoping that you will take note."

### Chinese Constable Induces a Minor Girl

The Case Has Been Concluded and is Awaiting Judgment

Li Juduo, a Chinese constable number 686 from the Songshan Road Police Station in the French Concession, is 21 years old and unmarried. Because he often worked near the Killing Company on Route des Soeurs, he became acquainted with Dai Genlin, also known as Gen Di, the 16-year-old daughter of Dai Xiaodi, a Suzhou native living at 49 Tongkang Lane, across from the Killing Company. Later, he enticed the girl into an illicit relationship. On the 30th of last month, he even induced the girl to run away privately and hide at 5 Manufacturing Bureau Road in Southern Shanghai, hoping to live together as permanent companions. After the girl's escape, her father searched everywhere for her without success. Later, he found a photograph of Li, wearing his uniform, given to the girl in her wardrobe, which provided a clue. He reported it to the French Police Station, which dismissed and arrested Li, and recovered Dai Genlin, who was taken back by her family. Li was sent to the Special No. 3 Court, where the Police Department's lawyer filed a public prosecution for the crime of disrupting a family under Article 240, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After the trial by Judge Chen Shuoying, the debate had already concluded and was scheduled for sentencing yesterday morning. The girl was sent for a forensic examination, pending review. Because the forensic examination of Dai showed that her hymen had been ruptured long ago, and she had engaged in adultery more than once, and both the girl and the defendant denied having committed adultery during the court hearing, the presiding judge, believing that the case was not clear, summoned the enticed Dai Genlin and her father, Dai Xiaodi, to the court yesterday morning, and brought the defendant to reopen the debate in Criminal Court No. 1. Dai then confessed to having had a relationship with the defendant at the Chunjiang Hotel once. The defendant still denied it. The judge asked the girl's father if he was filing a statement with the court to withdraw the charges, and he replied, "Yes." The judge then instructed that the case was not a case that could be withdrawn, and ordered the start of the debate. After the court announced the conclusion, the defendant was ordered to be remanded in custody pending instruction, and the defendant requested bail, which the court denied. The bailiffs took him away to be detained.

### Murderer Found to Be Suffering From Mental Illness

Police Lawyer Requests Commuted Sentence - Case Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing on the 14th

On the morning of the 14th of last month, around 6:00 AM, an unknown man of about 16 or 17 years old, a dock coolie, was struck in the back of the head with a hard wooden stick in front of Warehouse No. 2 of the China Merchants Bureau Wharf on the French Concession Bund. His brain matter splattered out, and he died instantly. The French police arrested the assailant, Jiang Xianzhou (53 years old, from Hebei), and sent him to the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution. The assailant, who suffers from mental illness, had an episode during the court hearing, holding the hard wooden stick presented by the police as evidence and attempting to strike the bystanders. The bailiffs stopped him, and the court ordered a review of the autopsy report before further questioning. This was reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the defendant, Jiang Xianzhou, was confirmed to be suffering from mental illness after a forensic examination. The police also found that Jiang had worked in Russia and returned to China due to mental illness. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he was sent to a mental hospital by the Public Security Bureau for treatment and then sent back to his hometown. Later, he came to Shanghai again, which led to his vagrancy. Yesterday afternoon, when Judge Chen Shuoying continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1, fearing that Jiang would have another episode, the forensic doctor shackled both of his hands to the wooden railing of the defendant's stand. First, Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer from the Police Department, explained the police investigation. When questioned, Jiang confessed that he was from Fucheng County, Hebei, and had an old father, Jiang Zhenhuan. He suffered from illness due to family disputes. When asked why he killed someone and when he returned from Russia and was sent to the hospital by the Public Security Bureau, he said he did not know. Then, Chen Xuegui, who ran a food stall at the wharf, testified about the defendant's crime of killing someone, and said that the deceased was indeed a coolie, and no one had come looking for him so far. At this point, the court considered the facts of the case to be clear and ordered the start of the debate. The Police Department lawyer stated that according to the defendant's crime, he should be charged with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. However, it has been determined that the defendant suffers from mental illness and should be exempt from punishment or have his sentence reduced in accordance with the law. Subsequently, Zhao Yifan, a student judge designated by the court to defend the defendant, made a statement. The court announced the conclusion and ordered that the defendant be remanded in custody pending sentencing on the 14th.

### Central Trust Bureau to Move to New Location

Old Site to Be Converted into a Savings Association

The Central Trust Bureau, established by the Central Bank with an investment of ten million yuan, handles businesses such as material procurement trust, insurance, and safekeeping. It also has an affiliated Central Savings Association to promote public thrift. Over the past year and a half, its various businesses have been thriving. Previously, the premises at 13 Han口Road were insufficient, and additional premises at 115 Han口Road and 7 Bund were leased as offices. However, this caused inconvenience, so the building at 6 Bund, which the bank had leased to a large bank, was taken back upon the expiration of the lease, renovated, and used as the new headquarters of the Bureau. The project has now been completed, and the Bureau is preparing to arrange its furniture and equipment. Once the newly appointed director, Li Guochin, takes office, the Bureau will move in. The old site at 31 Hankou Road will be used as the headquarters of the Central Savings Association. The Central Bank is being reorganized into the Central Reserve Bank, and its organizational law has not yet been promulgated. It is rumored that the Trust Bureau will be directly under the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the Qujiang Wharf operated by the Bureau has been completed and will be put into operation at the beginning of next month, and an opening ceremony is scheduled.

### Bank Employee Commits Suicide by Drowning

Drowned in the Yangtze River at Huangshi Port Aboard the Longxing

The Three North Company's Yangtze River express boat Longxing departed from Shanghai for Wuhan on Saturday night of last week with many passengers. In the second-class cabin, Room 10, there was a passenger who carried many pieces of luggage. At first, there was nothing unusual about him. However, at 3:00 PM on the 10th, when the boat passed Jiujiang and arrived on the Yangtze River at Huangshi Port, the passenger suddenly took advantage of the inattention of others and jumped into the river. This happened during the day, and the crew members immediately reported it to the shipowner, who stopped the boat and turned back to the Yangtze River. A sampan was quickly dispatched, and sailors and tea boys were sent to conduct the search. At 3:10 PM, the passenger was found, but he had already died. At that time, the crew members examined his luggage and found no suicide note. Only a letter of guarantee was found, which revealed that his name was Xu Yunqiao, and he was an employee of the Sichuan Jiangfeng Bank who was going to Hankou from Shanghai. The letter of guarantee was issued by Geng Guanghua of the Guangweixin Store in Beigaoyang Lane on Nanjing Road in Shanghai and was given to Xu to carry to Hankou. The Longxing then handed over the deceased's luggage and other items to the Jiujiang branch of the Three North Company. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Shanghai yesterday morning, reporting to the Shanghai headquarters and requesting that Geng Guanghua of Beigaoyang Lane be notified as soon as possible to go to Xun to handle the transfer of the deceased's coffin and receive the luggage. Yesterday, the Three North Company copied the Longxing's telegram and showed it to Geng Guanghua.

### Municipal Council Health Department Bans the Sale of Pufferfish

The Municipal Council Health Department, aware that the public often buys and eats pufferfish because of its delicious taste, warns residents not to be greedy for food, which may lead to death. It has always been forbidden to sell pufferfish in the market, but it is inevitable that some are sold in secret. If someone insists on eating it, they must throw the roe and other inedible parts into the fire, as scientists consider the roe to be the most toxic part.

### Abbot of Longhua Temple Sued for Debt

Fourteen Plaintiffs, Debt of One Thousand Gold

Longhua Temple is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai, the Bao'en Temple built by Sun Quan of the Eastern Wu, so it has a seven-story pagoda, a pure dojo, and a solemn forest, which can be called a scenic spot in Jiangnan. However, it has become a source of lawsuits over the years. Every abbot has been subject to litigation. Like Yuanzhao, Xingkong, Yuanming, and the current Shengqin (Yuanming), they fought each other, and the case has not yet been closed. The current abbot, Shengqin, and the supervisor (the steward), Xinghui, and the deputy abbot (the accountant), Zhengqing, and Yuanming, etc., were sued by fourteen merchants for owing more than 3,000 yuan, including the plaintiff for the Xinjile Qiyin Stationery Store owner Jin Zhigang, Yishengtang Medicine Store Yu Sizhong, Hu Santai Brick and Tile Shop Hu Jintao, Wu Yihe Tofu Store Wu Jisheng, Ruikang Sauce Garden Zhang Ruinian, Yang Hengmao Rice Store Yang Haigen, Wu Shunxing Tofu Store Wu Jianchun, Shuntai Timber Shop Chuan Chubao, Zhangchang Dry Goods Store Shen Daquan, Yeshunji Wood Shop Yang Liansheng, Wang Xiejil Lacquer Shop owner Wang Maoyi, Yongmaode Porcelain Shop Xu Jiquan, Huang Yongshun Iron Shop Huang Debao, and Jiangbei resident Hua Laowu's additional loan of 150 yuan, totaling fourteen households, have jointly hired lawyer Fang Gang to sue in the local court. The main points are that they have gradually purchased on credit, relying on the income from the March pilgrimage to repay, but the pilgrimage has passed, and the income is considerable, but they have not paid a penny. They request the court to order joint and several repayment. Yesterday, Judge Chuan Lan opened the court. The plaintiff testified about the previous situation, and lawyer Fang detailed the amount of each household. The defendants who arrived were the monks Zhengqing and Yuanming. Zhengqing admitted to owing debt but did not borrow, but was not detailed. Yuanming said that he was the abbot before, and now Shengqin is the abbot, so the person responsible should be Shengqin and Xinghui. The court then rescheduled the hearing for further questioning.

### Accusation of Abandonment After Seduction and Endangerment of Public Morality

Zhang Huisun Already Has a Wife; Li Huijun Sues Him in Court

Li Huijun, a woman from Ningbo, 21 years old, was introduced by a female acquaintance to Zhang Huisun, the newly appointed comprador of a certain shipping company (resident at 5 Shangmei New Lane, Longmen Road), around March of last year. At the time, Zhang claimed to be unmarried and willing to spend his life with Li. They then rented a house and lived together, initially at No. 1 Junle Lane, Weihaiwei Road, for about three months, and then moved to No. 398 New Dagu Road. During their cohabitation, Li repeatedly urged Zhang to marry her, but Zhang always made vague promises. However, to reassure Li, he wrote her a note in September of last year. But in December of last year, Zhang made an excuse to leave and never returned, abandoning Li as if she were worn-out shoes and cutting off her financial support, leaving her deeply in debt. Recently, through a female detective's investigation, it was revealed that Zhang already had a wife and that all his previous actions were merely his skills in toying with women. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Zhang for endangering public morals, and also filed a civil suit, demanding a payment of 10,000 yuan. This case was heard yesterday afternoon in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Xiao Xiefen of the First Special District Court. The subpoena to the defendant Zhang Huisun was not received because his family refused to accept it, so he did not appear in court. Li then submitted a statement of the circumstances and requested that he be punished according to the law. Judge Xiao, after reviewing the evidence, adjourned the case for further hearing.

### Major Fire on Tianbao Road, Zhabei, Yesterday Afternoon

Over Seventy Thatched Houses Burned Down; 337 Households Affected

A fire suddenly broke out at around 1:45 p.m. yesterday in the thatched houses behind Jun'an Lane on Tianbao Road, Derun Road, Zhabei, in the home of Liu Xiaodong, a native of Yancheng who worked as a servant for a Westerner in the Tilanqiao area of the Public Concession. Dense smoke immediately filled the air, quickly turning into a conflagration, with the fire spreading rapidly. It immediately spread to the homes of Bi, Zou, Wu, and Zhu, and the fire became intense, quickly spreading to the nearby thatched houses, making it difficult to control. Upon receiving the alarm, the various firefighting brigades of Zhabei rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. However, because the thatched houses were densely packed together and the roads were winding and narrow, firefighting efforts were difficult. The thatched house area was bounded by Shahong Road to the east, Tianbao Road to the south, Tiande Road to the west, and Derun Road to the north, with neighborhoods blocking access on all sides. Therefore, they focused their efforts on the Derun Road entrance, and the fire was brought under control after continuous efforts until about 2:30 p.m. Before long it was totally extinguished, but all the thatched houses there were completely burned down, totaling over seventy. The affected households numbered 337. The surrounding neighborhoods were spared from the fire due to the effective firefighting efforts. When the fire was raging, Zhao Xiaolin, a native of Changzhou, was fast asleep in a thatched house after drinking too much alcohol at lunch. A firefighter spotted him and bravely rushed into the fire to rescue him, preventing him from being burned. However, two firefighters, Zhu Xueming and Wang Shanhe, were injured when they fell from a ladder while fighting the fire, suffering severe injuries to their arms, legs, and heads. They were taken to Tongren and Renji Hospitals for treatment. The cause of the fire was that Liu Xiaodong, the initial source, had cooked lunch at home and then left without extinguishing the fire, causing the tragedy. The police have detained Liu Xiaodong and Wu Zhu, the originators of the fire, at the Linping Road Police Station for interrogation. When the fire broke out, the residents in the area immediately moved their belongings and tried to escape. The scene was filled with the cries of mothers and children, a tragic scene. This disaster has caused a great loss, but the affected residents are all poor laborers with nowhere to go, lingering on the streets, waiting for assistance from the city's charitable organizations.

### Mistaken Identity: Homecomer Assaulted in the Dead of Night

Cries for Help; Father Also Injured

At Xingshantang of Zongshan Road, Xietu Road, in western Shanghai, an incident of mistaken identity leading to an assault on innocent people occurred at around 10 p.m. the night before last. Only after the fact did the attackers realize their mistake, but both father and son had already suffered injuries all over their bodies. Here is a record of what happened: Wang Cailang, a rickshaw puller from Chongming, 22 years old, and his father, Wang Xiaosi, 56 years old, rent a place at Xingshantang on Zongshan Road. The father is a peddler, and the son makes a living pulling rickshaws. They have always been law-abiding and do not get involved in outside affairs. At 10 p.m. the night before last, Cailang was returning home from work when, just as he was approaching his home, more than a dozen strong men suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and began beating him without reason. Cailang was caught off guard and unable to escape, so he cried out for help. His father, who was waiting for his son's return, rushed out upon hearing the cries, only to be surrounded and punched and kicked by the men before he could even get close. They beat them both until they were lying on the ground, and then fled in all directions. The residence is located in a quiet area, and it was late at night, so there was no way to call the police. The father and son had no choice but to crawl back home in pain. At dawn, they reported the incident to the local police station and requested an investigation. However, the truth gradually became clear, and it was revealed to be a case of mistaken identity. Wang Cailang has suffered serious injuries and is unable to work. His elderly father is even more frail, and in addition to internal injuries, his entire body is covered in cuts and bruises, and he is barely breathing. It is now heard that the perpetrators, realizing the severity of the injuries, feel deeply sorry and have secretly asked someone to intercede with the victims, offering to pay for medical expenses and treatment. However, Xiao Wang is old and seriously injured, and his life is in danger.

### Yang Binggen Shot and Killed in Robbery; Corpse Examined

Yang Binggen, a 25-year-old native of Liyang who ran a small restaurant at No. 10 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, was walking with his wife, Yang Xu, around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday to the Chenghuang Temple, when suddenly, on Yuyuan Road in the Nanshi area, a bandit attempted to steal a gold bracelet from a woman walking on the street. Yang, upon seeing this, immediately stepped forward and grabbed the robber. Unexpectedly, the robber had a pistol, which accidentally fell to the ground and was picked up by his accomplice, who fired three shots at Yang, one hitting him in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground. The robbers, realizing they had committed a crime, fled in different directions. When the police on patrol arrived, they immediately took Yang to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died at 5:15 p.m. The hospital reported this to the Laozha Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the autopsy center on Peilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang of the First Special District Court also confirmed that the deceased died from a gunshot wound.

Now, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram on April 14th, stating that Article 2, Section 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that 'the introduction and guidance of international trade matters' is one of the statutory functions of the Chamber of Commerce. It is requested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be requested to instruct the Swedish Embassy that requests for introduction submitted by the Chamber of Commerce should be treated the same as those submitted by the International Trade Bureau in order to comply with the law. After review, the request in the original telegram is feasible.

### Chinese Buddhist Association Ordered to Restrict Monks from Traveling Abroad

Those Who Wish to Go Must Have Round-Trip Travel Expenses to Avoid Begging Along the Way and Being Despised

The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs issued an instruction to the Chinese Buddhist Association yesterday, stating that it was to comply with the order of the municipal government to restrict monks from traveling abroad. The order stated: "Based on Letter No. 188 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 13, 1937, the Consulate in Rangoon reported that Burma and Myanmar are Buddhist holy lands, and pilgrims from all over the world come to worship throughout the year. Abbots of temples in various provinces of China have also heard of the holy lands and come to visit. With the exception of a small number who come purely for pilgrimage and to study Buddhist doctrines, the majority take the opportunity to beg everywhere. Not only are they unable to achieve good results, but they are also despised. Recently, many Chinese monks have begged their way from China to Rangoon, and due to differences in customs and the decline of the Chinese community's prosperity, they have been unable to raise funds. Unable to move forward or backward, they are in dire straits, which is very pitiful. In view of this, the Consulate suggests that the Ministry should instruct passport issuing agencies to ensure that monks traveling to Burma or India in the future have sufficient round-trip travel expenses and that their credentials are verified before they are allowed to leave the country. This will not only prevent monks from experiencing difficulties but also reduce the contempt and aversion of Chinese and foreigners towards Chinese monks. All reasons for the difficulties encountered by Chinese monks begging in Rangoon and the intention to restrict them in the future are hereby submitted for your review and approval. After review, the suggestions of the Consulate regarding restrictions on monks traveling to Burma or India seem feasible in order to prevent various difficulties and wandering abroad. In addition to issuing separate instructions, we hereby request that you take note and instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly." The same was instructed to the Bureau of Police. The same instruction is given to the Buddhist Association, and all temples and monks are instructed to comply.

The Shanghai Tobacco and Coin Exchange Industry Association issued a notice yesterday stating: "In regards to the exchange of one-cent copper coins, the demand from various merchants has suddenly increased recently, while the supply is limited, resulting in insufficient supply. The Central Bank has notified that the number of coins produced by the mint is limited, and the demand from various places has suddenly increased, resulting in insufficient distribution. Therefore, the original amount (50 boxes) has been reduced by 10 boxes, and only 40 boxes will be issued each period. The amount registered by each merchant is far from sufficient, leading to disputes at each exchange period, and making it difficult for the Association to handle matters. Therefore, the previous decision is reiterated: from today onwards, coin exchanges for small shops will be temporarily suspended, and only member merchants will be limited to exchange based on the amount received each period, to ensure fairness and avoid disputes. This notice is hereby issued so that all merchants are informed."

### German University Praises Chen Zhuzun's Works

Last year, Dr. Luo Yimin of Austria sent Professor Chen Zhuzun's "Twenty-Six Discourses" and "Collected Poems" to the University of Vienna. The school's president, Dr. Mengyin, responded with a letter of high praise. This year, Dr. Luo sent Chen's "Twenty-Six Discourses" and other works to Rousselle, director and professor of the German Frankfurt Chinese Academy. He recently received a reply stating, "Our colleagues at the academy have read through these major works and find them extremely interesting and enlightening. We have placed the books in the library for safekeeping. Our colleagues are very willing to exchange publications with the Literature Department of Jiaotong University, and we will send you the Chinese Literature and Art Monthly for exchange. The monthly focuses on Chinese painting and calligraphy. It is heard that Chen will provide a detailed critique of Huang Binhong, which will be sent to the academy for discussion." Professor Chen has recently completed the "Collected Annotations on Gongsun Longzi," "History of Chinese Prose," and "Corrections and Supplements to Mozi." All are soon to be published.

### Zhali, Engineer of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, Returns to His Home Country

Zhali (English name), the chief engineer of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, has served in the Bureau for 20 years. Due to family reasons, he has tendered his resignation to the Director of the Bureau and returned to his home country, which was approved. He handed over his duties on the 1st of this month. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., Mr. Zhali boarded the British ship "Laumpra" (transliteration) to return to his home country. The Chinese and foreign staff of the Bureau, who had worked with Mr. Zhali for many years, went to the pier to see him off. Mr. Zhali was extremely grateful. According to the Chinese secretary of the Bureau, Mr. Zhali has a 70-year-old mother at home who lacks care. He sent his wife back to his home country two years ago to care for her. However, Mr. Zhali constantly missed his mother as she grew older and felt it was unfilial for a son not to be able to serve her personally. He resolutely resigned this time, and attempts to persuade him to stay were unsuccessful. His filial piety is admirable and truly rare.

### A Large Number of Koreans Deported on the Busan Maru the Day Before Yesterday

According to the Japanese Daily News, the Korean routes operated by the Pusan Maru and other ships recently carried a large number of heroin smugglers and prostitutes.

### The Case of the Robbery of the Li Shun Steamboat Solved; Robbers and Stolen Goods Recovered

Reported by the Zhejiang Provincial Inland River Water Police Bureau to the Lake Society

Previously, the Lake Society received a letter from the Inland River Steamboat Industry Association reporting that the Li Shun merchant steamboat, owned by the Lake Company, was robbed in Fengxiangfudang, Jiashan County, on April 21. It immediately appointed personnel to contact the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to investigate and arrest the robbers. It is now heard that the company has received a letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Inland River Water Police Bureau reporting that on the 1st of this month, the 4th squad, led by Captain Bao Yuxing, arrested notorious bandits Pan Wanshun, Guo Wanming, and Sun Wengui in Shanghai, along with eleven guns, over four hundred rounds of ammunition, and stolen goods. Under interrogation, they confessed to robbing four households and shops in Shanlianzhen, Mantoubang, Wuyidou, and Hengjiexiang in Wuxing County, as well as Baitang and Xiangfudang in Jiashan County, and the Shenhu Class He'an, Lixin, and Lishun steamboats, spending the stolen goods without denial. They have been sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Security Headquarters for legal action. It was found that the stolen goods included sixteen bolts of silk, each with a Zhejiang Lake Jinji Zhuang cloth strip, which was confirmed to be the items stolen from the Lishun merchant steamboat. The swift resolution of this case has deterred bandits. Inland river navigation should now be safer.

### The Lianqing Society Will Hold Another Charity Social Gathering

Nine Hundred Valuable Prizes Prepared for Raffle; Many Song and Dance Experts to Add to the Fun

Nine years ago, the Shanghai Lianqing Society founded the Lianqing Children's Clinic in Wuzhen Road, Zhabei. Last year, the number of patients reached more than 12,000, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. The annual operating expenses of 3-4,000 yuan are mostly borne by the members of the society. In mid-June of last year, the society held a charity social gathering to raise funds to establish children's sports fields in Zhongshan Road and its civilian village in America. Two sports instructors were hired to teach everything, so that poor children and adults could get regular entertainment with excellent results. This year, another charity social gathering will be held at the Paramount Hotel on the evening of May 19 at 8 o'clock to raise funds. In addition to these two good deeds, it is also planned to set up a vocational school scholarship for the youth club and donate to the Hudong School to promote vocational education so that young people can receive practical vocational training and become self-reliant after graduation. A 1937 Northern Electric refrigerator, a wireless Hammes portable typewriter, a Anmins Sanyong bed, a Dahua Chloros sofa, a Dunlop Biller mat, and 900 other prizes will be available for raffle. One purchase ticket is also a raffle ticket, so there is hope of winning a prize. In addition, music and dance experts will be hired to provide excellent entertainment. People who participate can have fun and win prizes, as well as help poor people. It is truly a win-win situation. All the tickets are sold by the members of the society, and there is a great deal of enthusiasm for reserving seats. Those who wish to participate and assist in good deeds are kindly requested to reserve seats at the Shandong Road United Advertising Company, the Jing'an Temple Road Northern Electric Company, and the Guangdong Road Palm Company to avoid disappointment.

### Woman Liu Cuibao Sues Lover for Abortion

Mrs. Liu, a woman from Taicang residing at No. 9 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road, French Concession, has a daughter named Liu Cuibao, who is 20 years old. She is betrothed but not yet married. With her heart opening to love, she found it difficult to live without a companion in her unmarried state. Wang Junfu, the son of her landlady, Wang Fei, was also a young man. They spent their days together, fostering seeds of love. Taking advantage of their proximity, they engaged in secret affairs. Unexpectedly, an unwanted pregnancy resulted. By last month, she was already two months along, experiencing morning sickness. Realizing the trouble, the woman consulted with Wang Fei, and together they went to midwife Ye Yu (age 70) at No. 197 Guangqi Road in the city to have an abortion. They paid twelve yuan. With a herbal medicine inserted into her lower body, a blood clot was expelled. She returned home immediately, but the bloodstains were discovered by her mother, leading to a major dispute. Negotiations failed, and the police were called, detaining Wang Fei, Ye Yu, and Liu Cuibao, and handing them over to the District Court for prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Lu opened the court. Liu Cuibao confessed the crime of Wang Fei and Ye Yu, taking the blame upon herself, claiming she had sought help on her own, without others' involvement. Wang Fei claimed that the woman's mother was trying to use her daughter as a money-making tool, having already paid sixty yuan, but she demanded a thousand yuan, hence the accusation. Ye Yu claimed she did not receive any money and performed the abortion out of moral kindness, preserving the woman's marriage prospects. Attorney Pan Zhensheng defended them, requesting leniency. After the court's debate concluded, the verdict will be announced on the 15th. All defendants were ordered to be released on bail.

### Gu Maoxing Factory Manager Sues Workers Again

Workers Gu Jinan, Lu Hongsheng, Zhu Afu, Chen Guoliang, Sun Quanshan, etc. of Gu Maoxing Silk Weaving Factory at No. 644 Xiexu Road were previously sued by the factory manager Lu Bingsheng in the District Court for locking the factory and going on strike, obstructing freedom. Judge Yu Lude found insufficient evidence in court and declared them innocent, but warned them to be law-abiding. Now, one wave has subsided, and another rises. Lu Bingsheng again sued Gu Jinan, Lu Hongsheng, Zhu Afu, Chen Guoliang, Sun Quanshan, etc. in the District Court for obstructing freedom and intimidation. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court to hear the case. Lu Bingsheng did not attend, entrusting the accountant Jin Yufu to present the case. The manager was called to the General Labor Union today to mediate the matter. A motion to withdraw the case was made, but the court ruled that it could not be withdrawn and proceeded according to law. It was stated that on April 30, after they came out of your court, at 8:30 PM, they questioned Lu why he did not attend court, accusing him of wanting to put them in jail. Gu Jinan immediately called all the workers to beat Lu, injuring his back, etc. The police were called to take Gu Jinan to the Ximen Branch Bureau. The next day, it was reported in the newspaper that the defendant was acquitted due to Lu's absence. Therefore, this lawsuit was filed. Gu Jinan testified that Lu Bingsheng was talking to the accountant that night and was about to leave the factory, so he went to him to ask for wages and to check the goods to avoid shortages, which they could not afford. Lu then pretended to sleep in the storeroom and claimed that he was beaten. Therefore, he was taken to the Ximen Branch Bureau to persuade him to reconcile, but he did not hit him at all. All the defendants testified that they were at the labor union that day and not at the factory, so they did not know about the dispute. They are all representatives, and Gu is the chief representative, so he is deliberately making false accusations. The court ordered the plaintiff to appear in court for questioning next time, and the defendants were released on bail.

### Japanese Marine Corps Transport Vehicles Collide, Causing Damage

Yesterday, at approximately 2:10 PM, eight transport vehicles of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai were speeding from the Bund on Nanjing Road from east to west. The leading vehicle, No. 11, was passing the Rising Sun Building when it was stopped by a red traffic light. The fifth vehicle, No. 21, due to the driver's failure to brake in time, crashed into the rear of the 16th transport vehicle. As a result, two headlights, the engine cylinder, water tank, and fenders of Vehicle No. 21 were completely damaged and rendered inoperable. Traffic was immediately disrupted for half an hour. Indian police officer No. 577, upon hearing the news, arrived to maintain order and, together with the driver, Tsugawa, managed to push the damaged vehicle from the entrance of the San You Industrial Company to the entrance of the Wing On Company on Zhejiang Road, recording the vehicle number as S.D.F. 86. At approximately 3:00 PM, the Japanese Marine Corps was informed and dispatched a locomotive to tow the damaged vehicle back for repairs.

### Strange Japanese People Discovered on Japanese Ships for Several Consecutive Days

According to the Japanese-language "Nichi-Nichi Shimbun," a Japanese boy named Ogura Kazuhiro, who arrived on the Rokko Maru on the 8th, behaved very strangely. After being questioned by the police of the Consulate General, he replied, "I want to meet Chiang Kai-shek," with high spirits. He was immediately taken to the Consulate and detained. The boy is originally from Shiga Prefecture and is a printing worker. He usually likes to read "Kodansha Magazine." Because the magazine recorded the inside story of the international city of Shanghai, he rashly came to Shanghai. The local Japanese authorities decided to send him back to his country on the Shanghai Maru today (the 12th). Also, when the Ikoma Maru arrived on the 9th, Ohara Etsuro, a man from Hokkaido, was also detected by the Japanese police. When asked why he came to Shanghai, he replied that in addition to studying Chinese economic issues, he also needed to investigate the current situation of the Japanese Embassy and Consulate. His wording was particularly peculiar, and he is currently being held at the Consulate.

### "Taking Confessions with a Gramophone"

— Hong Fa

The invention of many tools probably stems from a real need at first! Over time, when applied, they go beyond that purely beneficial boundary and are used by humans for enjoyment and games. For example, the purpose of manufacturing airplanes is to supply military use, but after a long time, humans will think of using them for sky tours: the invention of radio is a powerful tool for long-distance communication, and humans can also use it to receive sound and have fun... and so on.

As for the gramophone, I don't know what its use is in foreign countries? In our country, since its import, it has been used as a tool for entertainment, to play records after tea and wine. Unexpectedly, some people are now using it for litigation and evidence.

According to reports: "Fan Peien, judge of the civil division of the Third Branch of the High Court, was hearing an appeal case on the return of land prices between Wu Hongda et al. and Wu Hongde et al. at the third court of the court at around 4 pm on the 7th of this month. The appellant used the method of audio recording to turn the situation of the appellee’s oral obscuring of the court outside into a record and present it to the court. Judge Fan opened the gramophone in court, and the truth of the case was broadcast."

This matter seems ordinary, but because of this move, not only can the losing party obtain a final victory due to the establishment of new evidence, but it is especially noteworthy that it has a significant impact on society. From today on, if there is discord or secret hatred between people, no matter who their opponent is, they will be terrified, and they will be very hesitant to speak during conversations, or they may simply remain silent. The reason is that if they are a little careless, they suspect that the opponent they are talking to can secretly record everything they talk about. The result of doing so is that even if it is not necessary for future litigation and evidence collection, if the words and deeds are slightly inconsistent, they will inevitably be blamed for contradicting themselves.

Isn't it? In the past, some famous novelists, because the characterizations in their works were extremely vivid and realistic, many people were afraid of being written into his works and leaving a stain, so they deliberately avoided meeting him. From this example, then my overthinking above may become a real fact.

As for my own private opinion: I still want to apply this invention to a wider range. Not only can civilians use it to take confessions, but some politicians, when they are in opposition, make high-sounding remarks to the people to save the country—because this is also a "confession"—we will record them using audio recording methods, and wait for them to return to the political stage in the future, and then see if their actions and facilities are suitable for the statements made to the sun? Or completely contradictory? And decide our belief in him based on that. Because his "confession" is in fact "heard" by someone. That is countless hundreds of millions of people. Doing so is not only a higher application of "taking confessions with a gramophone," but the effect is even more far-reaching.

### Watching the Fun

— Wu Cun

It is May, the year of Dingchou, and the Shanghai Racecourse is holding the coronation ceremony of King George VI. Because there were too many people attending, advance tickets were sold to show restrictions, and ticket prices were divided into several types, such as five yuan, two yuan, and one yuan. According to the newspaper, all the more than 50,000 seats were sold out in advance: the rooms in the International, New World... and other hotels along the racecourse were also sold out two weeks in advance.

Who is so enthusiastic? The newspaper did not mention it. But we may as well predict that although the coronation is of the British Emperor and the ceremony is far away in Britain, at least two-thirds of those who go to the racecourse to watch the ceremony and reserve hotel rooms to watch the ceremony are our descendants of the Yellow Emperor.

Most of the ants of China are eagerly waiting for governance, hoping that they will no longer be "robbed" and "secured," and eat a mouthful of hard food peacefully. But the idle people of China are worried that there is no fun to watch.

They watch when people hold funerals; they watch when people welcome their relatives. They stand there dumbly on the street for an hour or two, watching and praising, criticizing. When the police on the road beat the rickshaw drivers, a large crowd of onlookers usually surrounds them, lost and dazed, as if they are admiring some work of art. When the beaten man is in a panic, they find it interesting and laugh beside them.

They also watch car accidents that ruin children with the same indifference. When the Western police officer's stick hits them and they hear the shouts of "Go, go, go! Look at nothing!" they suddenly wake up from their dreams, scratching their heads and running away dejectedly to watch the fun elsewhere. They never resist being beaten by sticks, because resistance will inevitably lead to conflict, and they will be trapped in the center, allowing others to watch the fun.

Shooting a kidnapper always attracts tens of thousands of spectators, and the road is blocked. When a fire breaks out in a neighboring village and the cries are earth-shattering, the spectators are delighted.

If they have money, their desire to appreciate the fun is even stronger and broader. Whether they spend money or not, they participate in all the fun, but only if they are not involved in any trouble. If things are a little unstable, they hurry home, close the door tremblingly, and hide. When the danger is over, they come out to watch and have fun.

The drought in western Henan is severe, and tens of thousands of refugees are waiting to die. Apart from those gentlemen who regard "charity" as a "career," who would voluntarily donate a little? The tickets to watch the foreign devils' celebration ceremony have already been sold out, and the hotel rooms have been sold out. But if the disaster areas of western Henan can be moved to Shanghai X World for public exhibition and open for people to visit, then selling tickets will probably not be a problem. People who love to watch the fun do not ask about celebrations and funerals. Watching other people's disasters is also a kind of entertainment for them. As the saying goes, "Watching the fire from across the river."

Sometimes, they simply watch the fire in their own home. It is said that when Shenyang fell and the Japanese army paraded in the streets, there were still idlers (naturally Chinese) standing and watching with their mouths open. The Japanese newspaper the next day said, "The Imperial Army passed by, and the welcomers lined the streets, praising the Empire's military prestige."

But what if the tickets and hotel rooms are all gone? — It's okay to "squeeze into the crowds" on the road. After being crowded and bumped into for most of the night, they returned home inexplicably, sweating profusely, and said to their wives: "When the British Emperor ascended the throne, there were mountains of people, and several children and women were crushed. It was really good to have fun."

### "Hindenburg" Airship Accident

— Shi

The German airship "Hindenburg," which travels over the Atlantic Ocean, suddenly exploded and caught fire on the 6th of this month, with fifty people killed among the one hundred passengers! According to the announcement by the semi-official circles in the United States, the cause of the accident was the use of hydrogen instead of helium (note: hydrogen is flammable, while helium is not). The explosion was caused by the explosion of hydrogen. When the ship first flew across the Atlantic last May, former captain Dr. Eckler advocated purchasing helium to avoid danger. At that time, the United States originally intended to supply it fully, but the German government banned the export of current funds and failed to pay the price of the goods and stopped. (It is found that the only natural helium producing areas in the world are the United States and Canada). Although factories are set up elsewhere to extract helium, the cost is very high. Therefore, the "Hindenburg" used hydrogen instead of helium, which ultimately led to this explosion.

The "Hindenburg" held its maiden voyage in May last year, and completed its 1936 flight schedule by October last year. When she set sail in the spring, the Zeppelin Company claimed to complete ten round trips within the specified time.

### Sai Jinhua

— Chen Hezhi

Eighteen

When Sai Jinhua arrived, Beijing was once again struck in her heart by a major attack. Some of the relatives and friends she wanted to go to were killed by the Qing court for communicating with foreigners; some fled to distant places, leaving her empty-handed. Sai Jinhua was in a dilemma, but fortunately, there were compassionate people everywhere. An old man walked out of the crowd and generously invited her to his home to settle down.

There were different opinions on this point about the transatlantic voyage between Europe and the United States. Some people expressed frank doubts about this, because they dared not casually determine her fate in view of the air accidents of the US Navy's major hydrogen airships and the British airship R-101. Now it is exactly one year to date, although she has flown ten times, she has finally had an accident.

The only characteristic of the "Hindenburg" during her flight schedule was that the date of each flight coincided with what the company had announced in advance. Each flight had top drivers on board to manage everything. Dr. Eckner was the tutor of the "Hindenburg," and he personally took off several times. Secondly, Captain雷门 and Captain波鲁士 (Zeppelin airship commander during the European War) were also old hands at hydrogen airships. This time the captain was浦勒斯, and former captain莱曼 was also on board to take care of things.

From Germany to the United States, the "Hindenburg"'s route was not limited to one, because the Germans changed their route at any time depending on the weather based on their experience in driving hydrogen airships.

In the past voyages, the shortest time required was 52.8 hours and the longest was 78.1 hours: the number of passengers ranged from 21 to 72. There were originally only 50 berths in the ship, but later, because there were too many passengers, the number of berths was increased to 70 in August last year.

The carriage of mail was somewhat disappointing to the operators. On the first voyage of the "Hindenburg" from Europe to the United States, all parties had a lot of curiosity, and the "first voyage" hobby of stamp collectors set a record for the loading of mail—2,260 pounds. On the second flight from the United States to Europe, it was reduced to 1,820 pounds. Since then, the amount has varied, but no one has ever exceeded the above two records. From a maximum of 448 pounds to a minimum of 167 pounds. The fee for each mail weighing no more than half an ounce was four cents in US dollars, so the income was still considerable.

The weight of freight also varied each time. The most was the second eastbound voyage, carrying a total of 2,500 pounds; the last westbound voyage was as little as only 63 pounds. There were many kinds of freight, and it can be said that everything was available, from film to entire cars and entire airplanes, all of which had flown over the Atlantic Ocean. Calculated from the transportation income of passengers, goods, and mail, the operators still considered it profitable.

At present, the Zeppelin Company is also building a sister ship of the "Hindenburg"—LZ-130, which is 400 feet long and whose hull has been built. It is said that it can be completed in mid-September this year, and her sister—the "Hindenburg" travels between the United States and Germany every week, but her sister has died prematurely. I don't know what the fate of my younger sister will be?

### Blood-Flower Streets

— Ge Yi

May, with what attitude should I express your return? Should I welcome you, this thriving season, or say you are the epidemic day that stings our nerves?

Bees sing your praises, because you bring them fruit-filling fragrant flowers, and the leaves also praise you, because you clothe them in lush green new clothes. Roses are gorgeously bloody: rambler roses are also seductively yellow, like a woman's fleeting autumn wave. Everything is growing, robust, full, and smiling.

The blood vessels of people also flow with the enthusiasm of your season. They want to jump, shout, survive, and smile!

The tips of every nerve in people are filled with excitement, and everyone is shouting:
