### Enemy Forces Attacked Wusong in Two Routes Yesterday, Fierce Bloody Battle All Day Long

Our Great Army Advanced Wave Upon Wave, Counterattacking with Painstaking Effort, Enemy Casualties Numbered Seven or Eight Hundred, Unable to Withstand the Onslaught and Collapsed in Retreat, Remnants of the Enemy at Luodian Remained Besieged by Our Forces

According to definite news from the front at 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy troops in the Luodian area, after being surrounded by our army on three sides, still relied on their continuous reinforcements along the river to repeatedly attempt to break through the encirclement, but the result was always repelled by our army, and the encirclement remained as before. Yesterday, all day until the evening, the enemy, under the cover of the firepower of its fleet on the Huangpu River, launched attacks in two routes from Wusong Town and Paotaiwan, fiercely attacking our army's positions, hoping to attack in the east while striking in the west to relieve Luodian. However, our army had obtained intelligence in advance and calmly responded, sending out a surprise force to launch a painful counterattack. From morning to night, there was fierce fighting all day long. The intensity of the artillery fire on both sides was the most intense since the start of the war. Our army advanced bravely, treating danger as if it were nothing, and finally inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Seeing that there was no opportunity to take advantage of the situation in that area, and even suffering heavy losses, the enemy concentrated its forces near dusk and launched an attack on the Xianjing River area south of Baoshan County, north of Yangxing, and east of Luodian. However, our forces had heavily garrisoned along the line, and a second fierce battle began. When the reporter arrived at [censored] , our army was gaining the upper hand and advancing forward. It is expected that the enemy can be cleared today. Enemy planes bombed [censored] yesterday, causing many innocent villagers to suffer. The areas of Yangxing, Yuepu, and Liuhang are absolutely still within our army's defense zone. The enemy troops in Luodian are also heavily besieged as before. The various rumors that spread yesterday were purely spread by traitors, hoping to disturb our rear. At present, our military strength in that area is very stable and sufficient. If the enemy attacks again, they will surely be crushed. As for the Hongkou area and the Yangshupu area, there were skirmishes during the day. After nightfall, the enemy launched a sneak attack on the Bajiao Bridge and Qingyun Bridge in Zhabei with more than 2,000 fresh troops, with more than ten armored vehicles protecting the vanguard. At that time, our army remained hidden and did not move. When they were close, they launched a fierce bombardment with hand grenades and small steel cannons. Our defending soldiers also jumped out of the trenches and bravely counterattacked. The enemy troops were caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. Before long, enemy reinforcements arrived, and the battle became fierce. The sound of machine guns, mortars, and our covering artillery lasted for two hours. The enemy troops suffered heavy losses, and our side also suffered casualties. However, our army's defense line in that area is still as solid as a rock, and the enemy has not crossed the line a single step. When the reporter's car left [censored] , the enemy had gradually collapsed in retreat.

### Enemy Asks Tokyo for Reinforcements Again

According to the Central News Agency, after the enemy reinforced three divisions in Shanghai, they repeatedly attacked our coastal areas, but not only made no progress, but were also repeatedly beaten by our army, suffering heavy losses and losing all morale. The enemy commander Songbing Shigen had no choice but to ask Tokyo for reinforcements again, requesting that two more divisions be sent to Shanghai. It is reported that the enemy's plan is to wait for the arrival of the reinforcements and then land them in the Liuhang and Shizilin areas, and in order to threaten Pudong and contain our army, to order a part of them to land near Fengxian. We are prepared and unafraid, and will give the enemy a major blow when the time comes.

### Enemy Forces Attacking Wusong in Separate Formations Were Counterattacked and Retreating by Our Troops

Enemy Casualties Were Heavy and Eventually They Were Unable to Withstand and Fled in Disarray, Remnants of the Enemy at Luodian Remained Besieged by Our Forces on Three Sides

The enemy troops who landed in the Wusong area again numbered 2,000 men. It is now known that they landed at Zhanghuabang and launched a fierce attack on our troops guarding Wusong Town with dense artillery fire. At the same time, the naval and air forces also concentrated their targets on bombing. Our army fought bravely and fiercely, but because the town was located on the riverbank and there was no defensible terrain, they had no choice but to retreat. The enemy then divided its forces into two routes, one advancing towards Paotaiwan Shizilin, attempting to attack Baoshan, and the other attacking Yuepu Town, presumably with the aim of connecting to the Luodian route, on the one hand, to meet the remnants of the enemy in the Luodian area, and on the other hand, to attack our entire line again. However, both routes of enemy troops were met by our reinforcements and fought bloody battles all night long. By 8:00 or 9:00 AM yesterday, the battle situation became even more intense. The enemy attacking Paotaiwan Shizilin encountered our army, and each side fought with all its strength. Our army advanced wave upon wave, like a surging tide. The enemy casualties were about 700 or 800 men, and they eventually collapsed and fled in disarray, retreating towards Wusong Town. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and at about 10:00 AM yesterday, completely surrounded the enemy troops in that area. The enemy attacking Yuepu Town was also heavily surrounded by our army. Although the enemy bravely launched a breakout, they were ultimately unsuccessful. The time for their annihilation should not be far away. As for the Luodian area, the enemy is still surrounded by our army on three sides. The remnants of the enemy in that area have been fighting hard for ten days, and are exhausted and miserable, with extremely heavy casualties. It is also reported that the enemy set fire to Wusong Town after 2:00 PM on the first day, and the eastern half of the town was completely reduced to ashes. Currently, our army at Sanguantang is connected to Baoshan Yangxing in a line. Yesterday, the enemy still tried to advance, so the battle was particularly fierce. From 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM, the enemy finally collapsed and retreated.

Luodian Enemy Counterattacked and Was Painfully Beaten

It is now known that the enemy trapped in the northwestern corner of Luodian is the 20th, 43rd, 44th, and 47th Regiments of the 6th and 11th Divisions, and the 71st Engineer Regiment. Our troops advanced towards the enemy on the morning of the first day and successively occupied Panzhai, Mengzhai, Shiqiao, Shi Xiangong Temple, and near Changqiao, and continued to advance forward. In a state of desperation, the enemy formed a suicide squad of five columns at 11:00 PM that night to launch a counterattack against us, hoping to break through the encirclement. After our army launched a painful counterattack, the enemy's corpses littered the field and they suffered heavy casualties. The remnants fled backwards.

Zhanghuabang Enemy Stubbornly Resists

Since the enemy's reinforcements successively landed in Wusong Town, under the cover of enemy planes and warships, they launched an attack on our Baoshan County, hoping to break through the encirclement and establish contact with the enemy in Luodian. Our army was prepared, and the enemy's repeated attacks were repelled. Currently, the enemy is entrenched east of the railway line in the Zhanghuabang Yunzaobang Wusong Town area, stubbornly resisting. It is also learned that the enemy has built a floating pier as long as one li in that area in an attempt to land continuously.

### Our Army Bombarded the Enemy's Positions in Hongkou Three Times Yesterday

Intense Artillery Fire Inflicted Heavy Casualties on the Enemy, Enemy's Counterattack in Hongkou, Shanghai East Was Unsuccessful

Our artillery positions on the [censored] side bombarded the enemy's positions in the Hongkou area with heavy artillery at dawn yesterday morning. At the same time, another mortar position on our side also began to bombard Hongkou. The enemy suffered heavy losses due to our intense and accurate artillery fire. A certain enemy concentration point near the Japanese Consulate General was hit many times. Subsequently, our artillery bombarded the Hongkou area twice again at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was in a state of panic.

Arranging Defense Works

It is confirmed that the enemy's defense works in the Yangshupu, Broadway Road, Outer Hongqiao, Wusong Road, Haining Road, Miller Road, Minhang Road, and East Seward Road areas, after being automatically set on fire and destroyed during the retreat some days ago, are now being arranged by their reinforcements. Moreover, due to the lack of yellow sand, they are unable to pile up sandbags, and are instead digging up soil, mud, and stones in the open spaces in that area. The more important streets and alleys are also covered with barbed wire and electric current. All the more solid buildings are equipped with machine guns, etc., to rely on for defense. From this, it seems that the enemy in that area intends to stubbornly resist for a long time.

Establishing Headquarters in Shanghai East

The enemy is setting up another army headquarters inside the Tongxing Cotton Mill, a Japanese company located at 2086 Linqing Road and Yangshupu Road in Shanghai East, specifically to command its army operations. Currently, large quantities of military supplies and food have been transported into the factory for days, and special precautions have been taken in the surrounding area.

Counterattacks Were All Repelled

The Central News Agency reports that the enemy in the Yangshupu Hongkou area, with the assistance of the army, launched another counterattack against us from the night before yesterday until yesterday morning. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River frequently bombarded and provided cover with heavy artillery fire. The artillery fire was concentrated on the northern railway station on our side. Our artillery positions on the ×× side also returned fire with heavy artillery. In the Yangshupu area, we fired densely with rifles and machine guns. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the enemy was unsuccessful. The sound of gunfire gradually subsided at dawn. It is also reported that about 1,000 enemy regular troops landed and reinforced in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas on the day before yesterday. Until last night, the enemy repeatedly launched fierce attacks on us, but were all bravely repelled by our army. Our army's front line has remained unchanged.

At about 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy troops in the Hongkou area again fired artillery shells at our positions in the Zhabei area. The Shanghai-Taicang Motor Company was hit and caught fire, burning fiercely.

Enemy Attack in Yangshupu Was Frustrated

The enemy forces in the Yangshupu area have been repeatedly harassing us for days, but have been unsuccessful. On the morning before yesterday, they again bombarded the Far East Sports Field area with artillery fire, without any target. Our army suffered no losses. The enemy troops near Nanwangjiazhai then attempted to build a bridge across the Qiujiang River and attack us in the Qiujiang Bridge Yangjiazhai area. Our unit took advantage of the enemy's confusion and launched a surprise attack, sweeping them with fierce machine gun fire. The enemy, after suffering casualties, collapsed and retreated backwards.

Western Reporter Visits Commander Wang

Mr. Hoover, a reporter for the English-language Great American Evening Post, met with General [censored] , the commander of the □□□ Division, somewhere on Wednesday night. The General is a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, is 30 years old, and is from Jiangsu. He has gained great fame in this war. According to the General, Japanese troops have landed at the Shizilin Fortress, Chuansha, Liuhang, Zhanghuabang, and Yunzaobang. The Chinese troops in Baoshan and the interior of Baoshan have prevented the Japanese troops landing along the river and the Shanghai-Songhu Railway line from connecting with each other. Japanese troops have launched attacks on Luodian from Shizilin, Liuhang, and Chuanshakou, in an attempt to reach Jiading, but the Chinese troops in Baoshan and Cao Wang Temple have launched a pincer attack from both sides, threatening the rear of the enemy troops. Most of the Japanese troops were forced to retreat from Luodian to avoid being cut off from the coast. Luodian is currently occupied by Chinese and Japanese troops, and the two sides are very close to each other. Japanese warships therefore do not dare to fire artillery shells, for fear of hitting their own troops. Hand-to-hand combat is common in that area, and the Chinese troops have the upper hand. The □□ Division is currently stationed in Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang, and there were fierce battles in both places on Wednesday night. The reporter heard the sound of cannons booming on his way back, and saw the firelight of artillery shells being fired. There was no sound of gunfire in the Luodian area. The fire of Japanese warships was obviously concentrated on the Wusong and areas outside the Huangpu River. The Japanese General Shu Cheng admitted that the Chinese artillery teams were inferior to the Japanese army, but the fire of Japanese warships could not protect their troops. Although the Japanese artillery teams and planes were enough to inflict damage on the Chinese troops, most of the Chinese troops who died were caused by hand-to-hand combat and infantry engagements at short distances. In this kind of battle, the Japanese troops were not as brave and good at fighting as the Chinese troops, so the losses on both sides were equal. The Japanese army was ultimately unable to transport heavy artillery to the positions, and its [censored] air force base was not completed. Chinese planes have repeatedly attacked [censored] , causing heavy damage. General □ did not seem to pay attention to the counterattack of the army in the Yangshupu area, saying that the Japanese troops were attempting to achieve success in that area after failing in other locations. General □ also mentioned that a certain American gentleman had helped with a number of war horses, and he had obtained five of them. In the battlefield in the rice paddy area, their effectiveness was much better than that of cars. He was very grateful. While General □ was talking, he also explained the battle situation to the reporter using a map. The conversation lasted for more than half an hour. Whenever the reporter asked questions, General Wang always answered frankly.

Enemy Troops Forbid Night Travel in Hongkou District

The Zi Lin Daily reports that Captain Walter, the warden of the Western Prison on Ward Road, has taken sick leave and is temporarily managed by Deputy Warden Samson. At around 9:30 PM last night (the first day), Mr. Samson was returning to the prison via the Waibaidu Bridge. When crossing the bridge, he was stopped by a Japanese sentry. Although Mr. Samson showed his credentials and various passes, the team officer of the Japanese sentry ultimately did not allow him to proceed. This is because, except from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, even those who hold passes, even if they are employees of the Public Works Department, police officers, or members of the International Volunteer Corps, are not allowed to cross the Baidu Bridge and enter the Hongkou District.

Enemy Warships Bombarded Pudong Yesterday Morning

At about 4:00 AM yesterday morning, more than ten enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River fired their cannons simultaneously, bombarding the Yangjingbang and Tangqiao areas in Pudong. Although the enemy fired many cannons, because they were aimless, we suffered no losses.

Enemy Attack on Chuanjiang Road Was Repelled

The enemy army launched an attack on our positions on the Chuanjiang Road front on the morning before yesterday under the cover of heavy artillery fire. The artillery fire was exceptionally fierce. Our army fought bravely in bloody battle, disregarding their own safety. At around 10:00 AM, they finally repelled the enemy army. The enemy's casualties were extremely heavy.

Our Plainclothes Team Launched a Fierce Attack on the Enemy's Positions

According to confirmed information, at about 9:00 PM last night, our plainclothes team suddenly appeared in the Beisichuan Road area and launched a fierce attack on the enemy's rear positions. The enemy was caught off guard and immediately mobilized a team of armored vehicles and fired machine guns indiscriminately, firing aimlessly. Our plainclothes team saw that the enemy's situation was chaotic and took the opportunity to advance towards Wusong Road Chongming Road. At this time, hand grenades rained down from the enemy's positions. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and huge losses.

Enemy Ships Transported Ammunition to Shanghai Again

Since the enemy army has repeatedly attacked our coastal ports and been repeatedly thwarted by our army, they are sparing no expense to use the taxes of their entire country to attack our territory again. In addition to the successive reinforcements arriving in Shanghai, whose number has already reached three divisions, they have also transported a large amount of ammunition. In addition to the Jian Fa Maru, Tian Xiang Maru, and Shanghai Maru, three ships that had already completed unloading for export some days ago, another enemy transport ship and merchant ship also set sail yesterday morning after unloading ammunition on the day before yesterday. Yesterday, according to a reporter's investigation, there was also an enemy merchant ship, (name deleted), docked at the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. Thirty or forty enemy soldiers were unloading ammunition, very busy. There were seven trucks parked at the pier, ready to transport the ammunition. In total, the enemy has transported military supplies and ammunition to Shanghai by seven ships in the past five days. Also, at 3:15 PM and 3:30 PM yesterday, the enemy merchant ship Tang Yang and a transport ship successively sailed to Shanghai. The merchant ship docked at the Japanese Yubian Wharf. After unloading a part of the ammunition, it quickly sailed out again at 5:30 PM. The transport ship docked at the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. It was also loaded with military supplies and began to be unloaded last night.

Enemy Planes Bombed the Southwestern City of Shanghai Again

Three enemy planes circled and scouted over the Fanhua Du Railway Station at about 2:00 PM yesterday, flying low for a long time. They still dropped three bombs above the Suzhou River at the Zhongshan Road area. Since that place is neither a military stronghold nor far from the war zone, it is difficult to speculate on the target.

At 7:00 AM yesterday morning (the 2nd), an enemy plane circled and scouted over the Gaochang Temple area in the southern city for about ten minutes before leaving. Then, at about 8:00 AM, another small team of enemy planes scouted over Pudong, the southern city, and other places, flying very low and dropping a bomb in the southern city before leaving.

Enemy planes flew to the Zhenru International Radio Station three times on the night before yesterday, at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and at about 6:00 PM last night. In addition to destroying cultural institutions, the enemy is also deliberately destroying our transportation construction. There is no greater wickedness than their conspiracy.

The Zi Lin Daily reports that on Wednesday, four Japanese planes bombed the area west of the boundary line along the Suzhou River, approaching the surrounding areas of the Public Concession more than at any time before. One bomb landed in front of the Jieshi Feier Road Jue Tian Cotton Mill, blasting a huge hole 15 feet in diameter and 5 feet deep, destroying the main water pipe underground, causing water to shoot out and flow into the river. Two bombs landed in the river, and two more landed in the fields, heavily damaging the houses next to the fields. Fortunately, after the sandbag defense works of the British soldiers guarding the area around the Jieshi Feier Railway Station in the Chinese territory, no lives were lost. The British soldiers' station was very close to the bombed area, and the situation was very dangerous. Japanese planes flew for more than half an hour, dropping about 15 bombs in total. Their purpose was obviously to destroy the railway bridge north of the Jieshi Feier Railway Station or the bridge on Zhongshan Road, but they all missed.

Workers Are Unwilling to Be Used by the Enemy

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the number of unemployed workers in Japanese cotton mills has reached six or seventy thousand or more. These workers are very panicked about their livelihood problems. The workers elected representatives Chen Guangming, Zhu Zhaobin, and others, four people, to appeal to the Western District City Federation, stating that although tens of thousands of workers are suffering from the pain of being oppressed by life, they are unwilling to be used by the enemy and vow to be the government's support and ask the association to appeal to the Social Bureau and various charitable organizations on their behalf to quickly provide a solution to avoid becoming displaced. The Western District Lianyi Association believes that the matter concerns the livelihood of unemployed workers in the future and the peace and tranquility of the country and society, so it quickly convened an emergency meeting to discuss relief measures.

Red Cross Incident Announced to the World

The Chinese Red Cross Society, because Japanese troops have repeatedly bombed and shot and killed many members of the rescue team, telegraphed Ambassador Wang Zhengting, the association's permanent representative to the United States, and asked him to inform the International Federation of Red Cross Societies, etc. Now, a reply telegram has been received, saying, "Received your telegram. Have informed the World and the American Red Cross Society and various organizations, and widely publicized it. Hope that our rescue personnel will continue to work hard and fight bravely to the end."

Twenty Enemy Warships Anchored in the Huangpu River Yesterday

The dispatch and redeployment of enemy warships anchored in Shanghai has become more frequent in recent days. Since most of them have gathered in the Wusong and Liuhang areas to attack our coastal ports, they have to make more redeployments in order to find another opportunity to make other plans. In total, the number of enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River was only eleven yesterday morning, but increased to as many as twenty in the afternoon. Their distribution situation is as follows: one 16th Destroyer at the Mitsubishi Wharf, one 30th Destroyer at the Central Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, one 21st and one 32nd Destroyer at the Goushan Wharf, one transport ship at the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, one 16th Destroyer at the No. 1 pontoon, one Izumo flagship at the No. 2 pontoon, one gunboat at the No. 5 pontoon, one 30th Destroyer at the No. 6 pontoon, one 21st Destroyer at the No. 7 pontoon, one Destroyer at the No. 10 pontoon, two gunboats at the No. 11 pontoon, and one each Destroyer at the No. 13, No. 16, and No. 19 pontoons, one each gunboat at the No. 22 and No. 25 pontoons, two Destroyers at the No. 39 pontoon, for a total of twenty ships.

Commander Yang Is Concerned About Wounded Soldiers

Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, our frontline soldiers have fought bravely against the invaders, each one being as good as ten. Commander Yang Hu of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters has done his best to maintain rear security since taking office, and public sentiment has gradually stabilized. The reporter met with Mr. Yang at the headquarters somewhere yesterday and learned that he is extremely concerned about the affairs of relieving wounded soldiers. In addition to ordering the relevant agencies and groups under the Garrison Headquarters to comprehensively accelerate relief efforts, he has also sent responsible personnel to assist in handling the work of comforting, treating, and sending them to safe areas.

### Enemy Troops Deliberately Destroy Cultural Institutions, Tongji University Was Destroyed

The enemy's Plot Is in Effect A Declaration of War on Global Culture

The National Tongji University, located in Wusong, has been repeatedly scouted by enemy aircraft after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, hoping to destroy it. However, because it was focusing on dealing with the Zhabei war, it initially only occasionally bombed it with naval artillery fire. Until this time, when the enemy's reinforcements arrived and attempted to land in Wusong and other places, they concentrated artillery fire on bombing the school when the war was lost. On the 28th and 29th, they bombed all the school's buildings with aircraft bombs all day long, and almost all of them have now been destroyed. In particular, the large-scale buildings such as the auditorium, practice factory, student dormitory, and College of Science have been almost completely destroyed. Other buildings, such as the Surveying Hall, which had not yet been completed, were also destroyed. The school's location is far to the north of Wusong Town, and it is not militarily important. Even our army has not used the school for combat. That the enemy destroyed it in this way must be a planned plot, who can believe otherwise? It is said that at the beginning of the war, the school had already decided that destroying cultural and educational institutions was the enemy's entire plan, and had selected and moved various machines, instruments, books, and files in the school to safe areas. In addition, this practical university with decades of history and a considerable reputation at home and abroad has in fact met the same fate as Nankai University in Tianjin. The enemy's act of deliberately destroying cultural construction is in effect a declaration of war on global culture. The ferocious face is becoming more and more exposed.

Current Commentary

### The Atrocity of Enemy Aircraft Killing Innocent Civilians

— An Outcry

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, only a few weeks have passed. However, the atrocities committed by the Japanese army against our innocent civilians are already too numerous to count. The bombings of the Sincere Company and the South Railway Station were the most tragic. At the South Railway Station, the number of civilian casualties was no less than six or seven hundred. At the Sincere Company, the number of civilian casualties was no less than four or five hundred. All of these were innocent civilians, not frontline combatants. Furthermore, in nearby towns and cities, regardless of whether or not troops were stationed or defensive works existed, bombs rained down, demonstrating a lack of humanity. Even trains and vehicles transporting refugees were attacked. Even medical personnel from the Red Swastika Society were brutally murdered. Such actions are not only intolerable by the principles of Heaven, but also forbidden by law.

International law stipulates that, whether inside or outside war zones, any direct or intentional actions against non-combatants are prohibited. Aerial attacks cannot be considered an exception. This is to uphold humanity and demonstrate good faith. Now, the enemy army specializes in bombing innocent civilians as if it were a feat, and specializes in destroying undefended towns and cities as if it were a successful strategy. If the world still values justice and humanity, then no one can bear to stand idly by and watch such atrocities. The recent sniper attack on the British ambassador is clear proof of this. The area had no troops stationed there, and the person was not a combatant, yet they were attacked. The Japanese side still tries to conceal the truth, first claiming that the flag was too small to be seen, and then saying that it was an accident, clearly making excuses to evade responsibility. But what can they say about the thousands of innocent civilians in our country whose brains and livers were destroyed by bombs?

Shanghai is the most prosperous international market in the Far East, known as the New York of the Orient. The value of investments made here by countries such as Britain, France, and the United States cannot be calculated in numbers. Now, under the baptism of Japanese artillery fire, commercial activities in Shanghai have completely ceased. The British and French concessions are almost like ghost towns. Even if the war were to stop immediately, it would be almost impossible to restore the previous business conditions. Japanese aircraft are bombing famous cities everywhere, such as Jiading, Nanxiang, Taicang, Suzhou, Songjiang, and other places. How can the Shanghai market alone enjoy prosperity when towns and cities everywhere are becoming scorched earth? The current situation is already like this after only a short period of war. If the war is prolonged, the British and French concessions will likely become uninhabited areas. Therefore, there is no doubt that Japan's actions are directly aimed at destroying our people's territory and indirectly aimed at destroying the commerce and property of countries such as Britain, France, and the United States in China.

Furthermore, according to international law during wartime, if one side commits illegal atrocities, the other side can take retaliatory action. However, our country is determined not to resort to this. "I would rather be wronged than wrong others." Our country's policy has always been like this. Now, we dare to say to the Japanese: If Japan truly considers itself a civilized country, then it should abide by the laws of civilized countries and immediately stop its inhumane actions. If Japan considers itself a barbaric nation, then it can only do as it pleases. Our country can only do its utmost to defend itself. We will never submit to the Japanese, no matter the threats or atrocities.

### Measures for the Placement of University Students During Extraordinary Times

Concentrated in Two Groups in Xi'an and Changsha; Suitable Work Provided for Those Willing to Serve

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Education believes that during this extraordinary period, education should not be neglected even though the front lines are engaged in war. In particular, the issue of future education for university students from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai is being planned and handled in order to seek a good outcome. The preliminary proposed measures are divided into three categories: (1) Universities from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai will be divided into two groups, one group concentrated in Xi'an and one group concentrated in Changsha. The universities will be assigned to groups first, and offices will be set up in both Xi'an and Changsha. Furthermore, a school of joint university nature will be established in each of these two locations to continue classes. However, the curriculum content will be significantly changed to suit the extraordinary period. Preliminary contact has been made. Peking University, Nankai University, and Tsinghua University will move to Changsha, and negotiations with the remaining universities are still underway. (2) University students who wish to serve in the future will be provided with suitable work by the Ministry of Education and educational institutions. Those who wish to return home may do so. Those who wish to continue their studies will be handled in accordance with the first measure mentioned above. (3) The Ministry of Education plans to open special training classes to make immediate use of science and engineering students from various universities. Students from universities in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai who have already arrived in Nanjing may wait for further news for the time being. Students who have already returned home may stay home temporarily. A notification will be issued after each university has determined its relocation address and established an office. As for all important matters concerning Tsinghua University in Beijing, President Mei Yiqi is currently in Nanjing to negotiate. There are no students on campus in Beijing, but professors such as Pan Guangdan and Chen Futian are still stationed on campus. Furthermore, faculty and staff take turns commuting to the school from Beijing every day to work, so the rumor that no one is in charge is not accurate. The school previously built houses at the foot of Yuelu Mountain across the Xiang River in Changsha, which should be completed before the winter vacation this year. If funding can be arranged, the school can open independently. However, Tsinghua's funding is allocated from the Boxer Indemnity, which is guaranteed by customs revenue. Now that Shanghai and Tianjin have become war zones, customs revenue has sharply decreased, making it impossible for the school to open independently due to a lack of funding. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)

### Sichuan Salt Merchants Donate Funds to Comfort the Troops

[Chongqing] The salt merchants of Zigong believe that our army and air force soldiers are bravely serving and repeatedly defeating stubborn bandits. The people in the rear should enthusiastically donate and contribute to the country. Therefore, they have collected a special fund of 10,000 yuan.

### Typhoon Hits Guangzhou Yesterday

Losses Exceed Several Million; Hong Kong Presents a Desolate Scene

### Save Non-Urgent Expenses to Supplement National Defense

Suggestion from the Wuhan Party Headquarters

[Hankou] The Wuhan City Party Headquarters sent a letter to the Garrison Headquarters on the 2nd, requesting that the Provincial and City Governments be ordered to suspend non-urgent matters and transfer the funds saved to supplement national defense. It stated that items in the Hubei Provincial Government's budget, such as the 1 million yuan investment in shipping, the 700,000+ yuan operating expenses of the Agricultural Improvement Institute, and the 540,000 yuan for Wuhan municipal construction, are largely unrelated to national defense. In addition, the 7,000 yuan monthly expenses of the Food Bureau are wasteful.

⊙Hyde Park: After President Roosevelt met with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy today, the Associated Press learned from official sources that the government has decided that there is no need to send more warships to China at this time. US Ambassador to Britain Bingham had lunch with the President today and then told reporters that it is not convenient to discuss at this time whether Britain and the United States may take joint action regarding China. Like the United States, Britain naturally hopes to maintain peace as much as possible. Therefore, it is doing its best to prevent the Spanish Civil War from expanding into a European war. Britain also wants to use moral force to try to stop the terrible massacre in the Far East. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

⊙Hyde Park: President Roosevelt, who is currently resting here, is still paying close attention to the situation in the Far East, even during his vacation, and is in constant communication with Secretary of State Hull. Observers generally believe that Roosevelt and Hull's attitude toward the situation in the Far East is still to maintain the most resolute attitude morally, while maintaining considerable flexibility in actual action. Morally speaking, President Roosevelt has repeatedly delivered speeches recently, harshly condemning the ideas of autocratic countries, and Secretary of State Hull has also criticized the economic policies pursued by those countries, saying that their results prevent the restoration of world prosperity, which is the guarantee of world peace. Hull also issued a written statement on July 16, revealing fourteen principles, saying that they are necessary to maintain world peace and restore general prosperity. This statement is actually a kind of hint to various countries, but American public opinion may not be prepared to accept the reasonable consequences arising from those principles. In the American press, it is also believed that the world situation has fallen into a dilemma. The United States must use all possible methods to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war.

Furthermore, they advocated establishing fundamental national policies based on those defined goals. Otherwise, it will be difficult to have a satisfactory policy for the mobilization of troops, military actions, finance, and the national economy. The people will never find peace of mind.

### Enthusiastic Subscription of National Salvation Bonds by People From All Walks of Life

Chambers of Commerce Issue Circular Telegrams to Provinces, Cities, and Counties to Solicit Subscriptions; Fellow-Provincial Associations Agree on Fundraising Methods

The General Association of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee yesterday issued an open letter to compatriots nationwide. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also issued circular telegrams to chambers of commerce in various provinces, cities, and counties to actively solicit subscriptions. Subscriptions from all walks of life have been quite enthusiastic. Details are recorded separately as follows:

Chambers of Commerce Issue Circular Telegrams to Provinces to Solicit Subscriptions

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued circular telegrams to chambers of commerce in various provinces, municipal chambers of commerce, and county chambers of commerce, stating: "To all provincial federations of chambers of commerce, municipal and county chambers of commerce: This war of resistance against Japan concerns the survival of the nation. The government's issuance of 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds is truly a preparation to amass financial strength for a sustained victory. The significance is self-evident. Considering the shared safety and danger of the people, sacrificing one's home to relieve the nation's crisis is precisely to seek life-sustaining medicine. It is like parents suffering from an illness; as children, we should spare no effort to provide the resources for medical treatment and medication, even if it means pawning our clothes and selling our belongings. Moreover, the regulations stipulate a 30-year repayment period with an annual interest rate of 4%. As long as the enemy is driven out of the country, the investment will still be recovered, which is different from a complete donation. Our chamber has recently established the Shanghai Commercial Sector National Salvation Bond Solicitation Headquarters. The fundraising method is as follows: stores should subscribe to 5% of their capital and 10% of their public reserve funds as the standard. For special circumstances, increases or decreases may be decided upon through public deliberation. Store employees with a monthly salary of 50 yuan or more should subscribe to 10%, while those with less than 50 yuan may subscribe freely. We are sending this circular telegram to inform you of the current planned measures in Shanghai for your reference. We hope that you will lead the business community in your area to consider and emulate them so that a large sum of money can be collected quickly to achieve the effect of well-fed soldiers and horses. We eagerly anticipate this." Sincerely, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.

Fellow-Provincial Associations' Fundraising Methods

The Shanghai Citizens' Solicitation Headquarters Fellow-Provincial Group, yesterday at 4 PM, invited fellow-provincial associations in Shanghai from various provinces and counties to discuss the matter of soliciting national salvation bonds. More than 60 representatives of fellow-provincial associations attended. The Commander of the Headquarters, Du Yuesheng, and Deputy Commanders Qian Xinzhi and Wang Xiaolai, were all present. Commander Du delivered a speech, followed by Group Director Xu Jiqing, who explained the establishment of the group. Immediately, the fundraising methods were discussed. After the attending representatives fully expressed their opinions, seven articles of methods were passed, which must be reported to the headquarters for record. The procedures are as follows: each fellow-provincial association will establish a branch team, and the head and deputy head of the branch team will be recommended by each fellow-provincial association and reported to the headquarters to distribute letters of appointment so that they can be responsible for fundraising. The fundraising methods of the group are copied below: ㊀ Each fellow-provincial association shall establish a branch team named after the association (e.g., the Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association is called the Ningbo Branch Team). ㊁ The branch team shall have one head, filled by the chairman or committee chairman, director general, chairman, or committee member; and several deputy heads, filled by all vice chairmen, standing committee members, deputy director generals, or vice chairmen; and several team members, filled by all executive and supervisory committee members, alternate executive and supervisory committee members, directors, supervisors, alternate directors, and alternate supervisors. ㊂ When soliciting national salvation bonds, each fellow-provincial association should subscribe at least 10% of the assets of the fellow-provincial association, such as the association's public hall, etc., such as funds and movable or immovable property that can be sold or mortgaged. ㊃ All fellow-provincial associations should find ways to solicit subscriptions from fellow-provincials who have the ability to subscribe to the bonds. ㊄ Each branch team should report its fundraising results to the headquarters every Monday. ㊅ The Fellow-Provincial Group is attached to the Citizens' Solicitation Headquarters (Shanghai Local Association, 4th Floor, Central Exchange Building, Avenue Edward VII). Each branch team will set up an office within the office of its respective fellow-provincial association. ㊆ These methods, after being discussed and decided by the joint meeting of all fellow-provincial associations, shall be sent by letter to the Solicitation Headquarters and forwarded to the General Solicitation Association for approval and implementation.

Municipal Federation Discusses Award Methods

Wang Zhaocheng, a member of the Municipal Federation of the First Special District of this city, believes that the government's issuance of national salvation bonds is entirely for defending the country and protecting the people. All citizens should purchase them according to their ability. However, to encourage participation, he specifically suggests the following award methods: ㊀ Those who purchase national salvation bonds worth 5,000 yuan or more should be given a commendation certificate. ㊁ Those who purchase 10,000 yuan or more should be allowed to have two of their children (or their relatives) enter middle school free of charge. ㊂ Those who purchase 50,000 yuan or more should be allowed to enter university free of charge. ㊃ Those who purchase 100,000 yuan or more should be given special preferential award methods. The federation, after considering the situation, has forwarded the matter to the General Association of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee for adjudication.

University Federation Holds Meeting to Solicit Subscriptions

The Shanghai University Federation held a meeting yesterday, attended by more than 30 presidents, deans, and secretaries of various universities and colleges. President Li Zhaohuan chaired the meeting, and Liu Shaochang recorded the minutes. The following important matters were resolved: ㊀ In accordance with the Ministry of Education's order, classes will begin on September 20, within the possible scope. ㊁ Presidents of each school will be responsible for soliciting subscriptions for national salvation bonds from faculty, staff, and students, and will also notify students to solicit cash or gold and silver utensils from their parents. ㊂ School authorities will collect gold and silver utensils and ornaments from faculty and staff within the school to donate to the government. President Liu Haisu and others set an example by generously donating several gold rings on the spot.

Jiangnan Railway Subscribes 50,000

Subscriptions for national salvation bonds have been increasingly enthusiastic recently. All employees of the Jiangnan Railway subscribed 50,000 yuan with one month's salary, which was delivered in full to the Wuhu branch of the Bank of China for transfer to the General Bond Solicitation Association.

Salt Administration Employees Subscribe 2 Million

The Salt Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has been extremely enthusiastic about subscribing to national salvation bonds. All employees of the bureau have worked together and have collected a total of 2 million yuan to subscribe to the bonds. Salt merchants nationwide are also widely soliciting subscriptions, and it is estimated that they can reach 10 million yuan.

### Pledging Industry's Withdrawal of Funds Approved With Flexibility

Approved by the Ministry of Finance

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, considering that the pawn industry is related to the circulation of the people's economy, not only issued a letter ordering the industry to resume operations, but also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that the industry's withdrawal of funds be handled with reference to the example of factories disbursing wages. After this was sent, the Ministry of Finance replied yesterday: "Your telegram has been received. After investigation, pawnshops in all areas should operate as usual. When withdrawing deposits, they should be allowed to be handled with flexibility. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association to forward the order to various banks and firms to handle the withdrawal of funds applied for by the pawn industry with flexibility, and sending a letter to the trade association to handle the matter specifically, you are hereby instructed to forward the information for your knowledge." This is the approval.

### British Ambassador's Condition Gradually Improving; Life in Convalescence Leisurely

Counselor Hoar Arrives in China by Plane to Handle Embassy Affairs as Chargé d'affaires

Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, was seriously injured in a strafing attack by Japanese aircraft on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway. A week has passed since then, and people from all walks of life are concerned about his condition. Yesterday, this reporter made a special trip to Hongen Hospital to inquire. According to the doctor, the ambassador's condition has been gradually improving in recent days and he is completely out of danger. Apart from his wife and the embassy secretary, there are no other people in the sickroom. The ambassador's life in convalescence is very leisurely. He often reads important telegrams of condolence from various parties and enjoys viewing the flower baskets sent by friends. It is also learned that because Ambassador Hugessen was injured and is unlikely to recover in the short term, the British government has dispatched an embassy counselor to China by plane. It is expected that he will arrive in Hong Kong next week and then transfer to Shanghai. At that time, he will handle embassy affairs as chargé d'affaires.

### American Sailors Propose Punishing Japan; Chinese Sailors Reply with Praise

The Japanese Army Intends to Challenge All of Humanity; Humanity Cannot Be at Peace Until It Is Eradicated

On August 31, 68,000 American sailors and workers held a meeting in Chicago, calling on all American seamen's unions to do their utmost to help China, and submitted a proposal to U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull to impose an economic blockade on Japan. Upon hearing this news, Yang Xiaotian, the special commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Union, ordered the union's secretary, Wang Jiyi, to convene a meeting of affiliated organizations to discuss the matter. Cheng Haifeng, director of the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, was also invited to attend. A unanimous resolution was passed to send a reply expressing support and gratitude. The original text of the reply is recorded below:

To the representatives of all American seamen and workers: Having read the newspaper reports, we learned that 68,000 seamen and workers in your country elected representatives to hold a meeting in Chicago. They expressed deep indignation at the Japanese army's invasion of China. After investigation, this Japanese violence, attacking the army of the Republic of China, was its pre-determined plan. Although the people of the Republic of China have always loved peace, they have no choice but to resist for self-defense. Unexpectedly, the brutal Japanese are extremely cruel. Failing in frontal combat, they use a large number of aircraft to bomb non-combatant civilians in our rear areas every day, even attacking Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador. The Japanese army is not only destroying world peace, but also intending to challenge all of humanity. Humanity cannot be at peace until violence is eradicated. It is hoped that we can work together for humanitarianism so that world peace can be consolidated. We hereby reply with thanks. The Chinese Seamen's Union and 800,000 sailors kowtow in unison.

In addition, the Special Party Branch of the Chinese Seamen also sent a telegram to the American Seamen's Union, expressing admiration: "To the American Seamen's Union in Chicago: On August 31, the National News Agency telegraphed that 68,000 members of your union held a representative conference in Chicago, expressing sympathy for the innocent suffering of our people from the enemy's illegal invasion and demanding that American merchant ships continue to call at various ports in our country, and advocating an economic blockade against Japan until all Japanese troops withdraw from our territory. The people of our country are deeply grateful for this resolution. In particular, the 800,000 Chinese sailors led by our branch are deeply admired for your union's advocacy of human justice. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has strived to foster friendly relations externally and seek the peaceful evolution of mankind together, and strived to build a modern state internally, so that it can coexist and prosper with all countries in the world. However, Japan has seized our Northeast Provinces, attacked and seized Tianjin, the commercial center, and Peiping, the cultural center, and recently invaded Shanghai, the world's commercial center, for the second time. It releases aircraft every day to bomb our capital Nanjing and various important cities before declaring war. At the South Railway Station in Shanghai, it bombed and killed more than 700 of our refugees. In the northern part of Shanghai, it bombed the Red Cross wounded soldier hospital. In Nantongzhou, it destroyed the Christian Hospital established by your country, and arbitrarily attacked non-combatant personnel in various parts of our country. Recently, it has illegally blockaded our seaports, making it impossible for our sailors to serve in maritime transport. The above are all the facts of Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Pact of Paris, and international law, as well as various inhumane acts. The people of our country, from top to bottom, are now united in one heart and mind, under the leadership of the supreme leader, to resist the invasion of the brutal enemy. This is not only our country's self-defense, but also a struggle to defend sacred treaties, international law, and human justice. The people of your country have always been close friends of our country, and we believe that you can uphold justice and promote righteousness, especially to liberate the Chinese sailors led by our branch and work together. We cannot express our anticipation enough." Yang Hu, special commissioner of the Special Party Branch of the Chinese Seamen of the Kuomintang, bows.

### A Survivor's Painful Account: Hongkou District a Scorched Wasteland

Could Such a Heartrending Scene Exist?

In the past week, the focus of the war has been concentrated in the Luodian and Wusong areas, and the readers' attention has followed the expansion of the war zone and turned to those areas. Although the situation in the Hongkou District is also something that everyone is eager to know, due to the shift in the war's focus, it has gradually faded from people's minds. This reporter accidentally encountered a compatriot who had just escaped from the Hongkou District in a refugee camp, and obtained some more detailed information about the district. Now, it is recorded below as he recounted it from memory. This is probably what the readers of this newspaper would like to know.

He lived in the slums of the Yangshupu area. After the war broke out, he lost his job, and his wife suddenly disappeared one night, and naturally must be dead. Because he was sick, he was unable to escape the war zone even during the intense fighting, and he resigned himself to certain death. But strangely enough, his illness gradually improved, and his will to survive forced him to endure many dangers and safely escape across the Suzhou Creek. When he recounted this story, he seemed to be still in shock, and even the listeners felt like they were hearing a legendary tale.

Because he had to avoid harassment from Japanese ruffians, he detoured through many roads in Yangshupu, so he was able to see the situation in many parts of the Hongkou District. Now there are no more corpses on the roads, and even Japanese soldiers are rarely seen. Moreover, after the fire, the roads are extremely quiet. However, there are still a few corpses that have not been moved in the small alleys. Those corpses can no longer be distinguished as refugees or soldiers who were killed.

The scene of the great fire in the district burning for two days and two nights, what we saw was only the red light filling the sky and fire crows flying around, and even with experience, we could only guess that it was in a certain area. Although the situation he told the reporter cannot be said to be very detailed, it can also be seen in about eighty or ninety percent of the picture. From Yangshupu Road, Broadway Road, all the way to Waibaidu Bridge, the area along the Huangpu River is probably as good as new, and even the damage from gunfire is very limited. The area to the north is truly as the "Elegy for an Ancient Battlefield" says, "Could such a heartrending scene exist?" Now, I will describe what he saw along the way:

The area behind the Yangshupu Waterworks (on Huasheng Road) is almost a scorched wasteland, and three sides of the road were sacrificed in the fire.

Coming south from Yangshupu Road, there are many houses burned along the way, but it is intermittent. Generally speaking, it should be a lucky area.

The area from Maohai Road, Huishan Road, along Broadway Road to the Outer Hongqiao, suffered the most damage, and is completely a field of rubble. Even the Huaji Road section, which survived the fire, was destroyed by gunfire. All the houses are full of holes and leaning east and west.

On East Seward Road, from Maohai Road to Huaji Road, it was also completely burned down.

Others: Tilanqiao, Highway, Tangshan Road, Dalianwan Road, Yuanfang Road, and Zhaofeng Road have all suffered fires, but not as badly as Broadway Road and East Seward Road.

Several extremely large bomb craters were found on Kunming Road, Huishan Road, and Zhoushan Road.

The factory buildings of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were not burned down, but the warehouses on both sides were a pile of ashes.

As for our army occupying Huishan Wharf, according to what he told the reporter, the situation was like this: On the evening of the 17th, our troops did arrive at Huishan Wharf. At that time, the Japanese troops were collapsing and retreating. There is also an episode that can be recorded, that is, there was a warehouse next to Watson's, which was guarded by two Chinese people, and they were specially protected by the Japanese army. But that night, a Japanese soldier suddenly went to knock on the door of the warehouse. After the door was opened, he opened fire indiscriminately, and the two guards were almost scared out of their wits. They probably took the opportunity to slip away that night.

Regarding the place where the enemy and our army are facing each other, an ordinary person, of course, has no way of knowing, and he escaped from there. However, according to what he saw, it may be recorded below as a reference.

He came by way of Pingliang Road, looking remotely at Hejian Road to the north. At the three road junctions of Greenland Road, Ningwu Road, and Linqing Road, the enemy troops built very good defenses, and the sandbags were all facing north, and there were many enemy troops stationed there. Sandbags were also seen piled up at the south end of the Zhonghongqiao East Seward Road, because Tangshan Road and Zhaofeng Road to the northeast are our army's positions.

In addition, ㊀ There are formal army soldiers at the Huangpu Wharf, and they are all wearing rubber shoes. The style of those shoes, perhaps because they are used to wearing clogs, has a special part for the big toe. When talking about this passage, the other refugees all laughed, but the reporter admired that he could pay attention to these trivial parts when he was escaping, so it is speculated that the situation he talked about may not be very vague. ㊁ Japanese soldiers are also stationed in the China Merchants Bureau Central Warehouse, but the patrol outside the door is a plainclothes team, with yellow cloth epaulets on their arms. ㊂ There are also Japanese soldiers at the Binjiang Building at the north end of the Suzhou River Waterworks Bridge. ㊃ Because the sandbags are piled very high in front of the Japanese Consulate, it is impossible to know whether it has been bombed or not, and judging from the situation, there may still be troops stationed inside.

We should especially thank this suffering compatriot for the harvest of this valuable material.

(Special Telegram from This Newspaper) From last night until this morning, the enemy launched a general offensive on the entire front line, fiercely attacking our army's various positions. Our army fought bravely and fiercely killed the enemy. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties and finally retreated. The fighting in the Wusong and Luodian areas has not stopped as of 3 PM today. This reporter met with a certain military official who had just returned from the front line this afternoon and discussed the battle situation on various fronts in detail. According to him: ㊀ The fighting in the Luodian area was extremely fierce, and our army has always had the upper hand. The enemy launched several attacks, but were all repelled. Now, our army's front line has continued to advance, and it will not be long before the remaining enemies are eliminated. ㊁ Because the general offensive in Luodian failed, the enemy's conspiracy to attack Jiading from the side via the landing forces in Liuhang had to be abandoned. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy completely withdrew from Liuhang and planned to move elsewhere. ㊂ The Lion Grove Fort and Baoshan County are always defended by our army. Rumors of their loss are absolutely inaccurate. ㊃ In the Wusong area, the enemy attempted to encircle and attack Yuepu Town and open up a connection between Wusong and Luodian. After our reinforcements participated in the defense, the enemy's plan has completely failed. ㊄ The enemy in Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang Wusong, about five or six thousand people in total, has managed to establish contact. After days of bloody fighting by our army, the encirclement has been completed. After the enemy in Luodian is eliminated, it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. ㊅ In the Yangshupu, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas, the enemy repeatedly counterattacked in an attempt to contain our forces. Our army calmly responded, and the front line remained unchanged.

At about 2 PM this afternoon, a shell hit the entrance of the Jardine Matheson & Co. office at the intersection of the Bund and Beijing Road. Because the office was paying wages starting at 2 PM today, many workers were waiting, so dozens of people were injured. One member of the foreign Shanghai Volunteer Corps was also seriously injured in the head and arm and was taken away by ambulance. In addition, the injured and dead are being rescued by all the rescue personnel.

### Our Troops Shell the Japanese Consulate

Enemy Troops Attempt to Land in Pudong Fails; Japanese Consulate Hit by Six Shells

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) In the Pudong area, apart from the artillery battles of the past few days, things have been relatively calm. Today at 10:05 AM, the enemy dispatched a small steamer, fully loaded with soldiers and weapons. It sailed to the middle of the river off Lujiazui, but did not dare to immediately head towards Pudong. Instead, they used a small motorboat from their warship, carrying six or seven soldiers, and sailed towards the front of the Chunjiang Wharf (at the corner of Lujiazui), outside the parked sailboats, intending to secure a cable. The soldiers planned to land. Unexpectedly, our troops guarding that area waited until they were close and then fired machine guns. The enemy's small motorboat, not yet properly docked, saw bullets raining down from the shore and immediately sped away. This was witnessed by this reporter. The enemy warship No. 16, anchored in front of the Mitsubishi Wharf, then opened fire. Our troops remained calm and did not respond at first. At this time, the Japanese small steamer, carrying dozens of soldiers, which had been waiting in the middle of the river, then headed to the front of the Chunjiang Wharf, intending to find a way to land outside the sailboats. However, as the ship approached the sailboats, our rifles and machine guns opened fire fiercely again. The enemy ship was unable to get close. This reporter witnessed their efforts exhausted, retreating and advancing several times, but ultimately being driven back by our troops. At 11:00 AM, the enemy ship was unable to approach the Chunjiang Wharf and retreated to the middle of the river again. It then desperately tried to land to the south of the Chunjiang Wharf, but that area was filled with British and American warships. The enemy ship circled for a long time but was still unable to dock and land. By 11:30 AM, the ship had no choice but to retreat towards Yangshupu. After the Japanese troops failed to land at the Chunjiang Wharf, the enemy warship No. 16 at the Mitsubishi Wharf continued to shell Pudong. At first, they fired a shell every three minutes, and our side did not return fire. However, after 11:50 AM, our artillery also opened fire, fiercely attacking the enemy warships in Hongkou and at the Mitsubishi Wharf. At that point, the sound of artillery from both sides was as dense as linked beads, with each shell firing every second. Several steamships and sailboats anchored in front of the Chunjiang Wharf were hit by enemy shells and immediately caught fire and burned. For a time, smoke filled the air, and flames reached the sky. By 12:10 PM, the flames had subsided slightly, but the sound of artillery still rumbled continuously. Both sides fired hundreds of shells. When the Pudong battle broke out, the Bund was also cut off from traffic. The workers on the Huangpu Bund initially continued to work as usual, as if nothing was happening. It is said that many Westerners were on the Bund watching the battle.

At the height of the intense artillery battle, a Chinese sailboat approached the Gonghexiang Wharf near the enemy Izumo warship. The Izumo warship immediately fired machine guns at the sailboat. The Japanese Consulate was hit by several shells from our artillery. During the fierce artillery battle, an enemy plane took off and scouted Pudong. According to confirmed news, around 12:00 PM today, the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road on the Bund was accurately targeted by our artillery unit stationed in □□. Multiple shells were fired, hitting it six times. The consulate building was almost completely destroyed by the explosion. Flames soared, and the fire was intense. Dozens of Japanese soldiers who were left behind at the consulate were killed or injured, resulting in significant losses.

According to the Central News Agency, at 10:10 AM today, a small rowboat was traveling from south to north in the Huangpu River. As soon as it crossed the river surface in front of the Bund Public Organization, it was subjected to dense machine gun fire from an enemy patrol boat. At the same time, enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River also opened fire on Pudong. Our artillery positions immediately returned fire with heavy artillery, concentrating their fire on the enemy's positions in the Huangpu River. The artillery fire from both sides was very intense, and the rumbling sound could be heard clearly throughout the city. However, the enemy warships' shelling was aimless, and our side suffered no losses. Only the Xiang Sheng Shipyard in Lujiazui was hit and caught fire, burning down many civilian houses. On the other hand, our artillery fire was extremely accurate. Multiple enemy positions in Yangshupu caught fire, and the enemy suffered significant damage, with heavy casualties. As of 2:00 PM, the artillery battle had not stopped.

According to the Central News Agency, around 8:00 AM this morning, our artillery positions in □□ shelled the enemy's positions in Hongkou with heavy artillery for over an hour. The enemy suffered significant damage and was in a state of chaos.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The intense artillery battle this afternoon, although it paused briefly at 1:45 PM, continued intermittently. As of the time this publication went to print, both sides were still shelling each other. At the height of the artillery fire, three enemy planes simultaneously bombed Pudong to assist in the battle. One of the bombs fell near the Chunjiang Wharf Shipyard across the Bund from the Main Street, immediately starting a fire that spread rapidly, with smoke obscuring the sky. The fire intensified further at 2:00 PM. Foreigners generally stood on the Jianggan Bund, watching the fire from across the river, sighing at the tragic scene. There was also a fire at the opposite side of the Bund on Wuma Road, which was further away from Pudong, presumably also caused by enemy planes dropping bombs.

### Enemy Attempts to Probe Pudong, Initiates Shelling

In recent days, one or two small Japanese motorboats, carrying some soldiers and machine guns, have been sailing to Pudong day and night, seizing any opportunity to land and observe. Their intention seems to be to probe the military situation in Pudong. However, once our troops fire a warning shot, they quickly speed away. At 10:11 AM today, another Japanese motorboat, carrying over ten armed soldiers and a machine gun, approached the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui. First, they hid outside the pilot boat there, then moved closer to the wharf and used the machine gun to strafe the shore. Our troops also responded quickly with machine gun fire. At the same time, an enemy plane suddenly appeared in the sky, flying low and strafing downwards with its machine gun. Then, the enemy plane suddenly dropped two bombs. Our troops intensified their counterattack, and the enemy motorboat could no longer withstand the assault and quickly fled. Angered by this setback, the enemy's No. 16 warship, anchored at the Nikko Company Wharf in Hongkou, opened fire on the Chunjiang Wharf, carrying out close-range shelling for over ten consecutive shots. At 11:30 AM, an enemy plane again took off from the Huangpu River in Hongkou, scouting the sky above that area and strafing downwards with its machine gun. The enemy warship intensified its artillery fire, continuously shelling. However, our military strength along the Pudong area is strong, and we have calmly responded separately. Once the enemy troops land, they will undoubtedly be annihilated. As of the time of writing, apart from the enemy plane's strafing and the enemy warship's shelling, no enemy troops have attempted to forcibly land.

### Fierce Battle at Wusong, Enemy Troops Rout

Enemy Suffers 1-2 Thousand Casualties; Our Troops Complete Encirclement

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The remnants of the enemy at the Wenzaobang Canal, some of them fled into Wusong Town, while others relied on the artillery fire of enemy warships to cover their landing, attempting to advance towards Baoshan Yuepu Town, seeking to link up with the besieged enemy at Luodian. They were met with a head-on attack by our troops, resulting in a fierce battle for two days and nights. The enemy troops suffered numerous deaths, and it is estimated that the casualties were between one and two thousand. However, there are no defensible positions along the Wusong River, so some fled towards Paotai Bay, attempting to attack Baoshan, while others tended to attack Yuepu Town. Last night, our reinforcements arrived and launched a bloody charge, with more than ten assaults. The intensity of the struggle was unparalleled. After this heavy blow, the enemy finally collapsed and retreated. Our troops immediately advanced and encircled them. The enemy is still struggling, and our front lines in Baoshan Yuepu Yinhang have been further strengthened. A large encirclement has been formed, and the enemy will definitely not be able to break through.

### Luodian's Remnant Enemy to be Eliminated Soon

Enemy's General Offensive Plan Fails; Yangxing and Liuhang Are Both in Our Hands

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy trapped in Luodian launched several fierce assaults last night, attempting to break through the encirclement. However, after being attacked from both sides by our □□ troops, despite the enemy's desperate attempts to break out, they had to retreat under our fierce attack. Furthermore, the area is relatively far from the sea, and enemy warships cannot effectively deploy their artillery fire in the Luodian area. Currently, the enemy in that area, after days of casualties, has only about two brigades left, with only one route remaining open to the Xiaochuansha estuary. The two important villages to the left and right of this route have been recaptured by our troops, and the enemy's retreat route has been severely threatened. After the enemy's general offensive plan failed last night, the day of their elimination is not far off. Liuhang and Yangxing are both in our hands. Although enemy planes have repeatedly bombed the area, our troops have suffered little damage.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to reliable news from military circles, the enemy trapped north of Luodian for many days has been surrounded on three sides by our troops, with no reinforcements and exhausted morale. There has been no development. Suddenly, at dawn yesterday, the enemy mobilized about a thousand elite troops, infiltrated near Chengqiao along secluded village paths. The area is only two li away from Jiading, and was detected by our sentries, who immediately reported to their superiors, who dispatched reinforcements to pursue and attack. After an hour of engagement, the enemy could not withstand the assault and collapsed back to their original route. Our troops pursued them directly to north of Shixianggong Temple and Caowang Temple, making contact with our local garrison. In this battle, the enemy suffered many casualties but gained nothing.

### Enemy Warships Gather in Songliu Area

According to the Central News Agency, most of the enemy warships are still gathered in the river area of Wusong District and Liuh River. According to investigations by reporters today, there are a total of forty-four enemy warships gathered in the Songkou area. Their distribution is as follows: Twelve large and small warships in the Yangtze River Estuary Sanxia River area, sixteen large and small warships outside Wusong Estuary, one transport aircraft carrier, nine transport ships converted from merchant ships, two destroyers at Wenzaobang No. 17, one destroyer at Zhanghuabang No. 1, one additional gunboat, and two destroyers at Yushichang No. 23, totaling forty-four ships. Among the nine transport ships converted from merchant ships outside Wusong Estuary, many are loaded with enemy troops, seemingly preparing to sail to various ports at any time, attempting to land or reinforce. The aircraft carrier is named Kimoi, with a draft of 17,000 tons and can carry 30 aircraft.

### Enemy's Probe at Ningguo Road Fails

Saw Battle Results in Enemy Retreating to the Second Line of Defense; We Capture Heavy Machine Guns After an Initial Defense

There has been little news from the Yangshupu area of ​​East Shanghai recently, but small skirmishes occur every day. According to someone who returned from participating in the battle in East Shanghai this morning, from 10:00 PM last night, tug-of-war battles occurred many times in the Ningguo Road Bridge and Huangxing Road Bridge areas. Our troops have built solid fortifications and are temporarily on the defensive, and the enemy troops have repeatedly attacked, but are not to be feared. In the battle at Huangxing Road Bridge last night, the enemy used fifty or sixty people, opening fire randomly with rifles to probe. Our troops remained hidden in the trenches, and when the enemy reached about 100 meters, they jumped forward and fired fiercely with Mauser pistols and machine guns. The enemy heard the sound and retreated, fleeing to the second line of defense. At that time, five enemies carrying two heavy machine guns could not escape and were intercepted by us. Our troops saw that the enemy had retreated and gradually returned to the original line. According to recent observations, the enemy's attacks are only probing in nature and there is no possibility of a large-scale counterattack.

According to the Central News Agency, at 0:30 AM this morning, enemy troops concentrated their forces and launched a fierce attack on the North Station area. Our troops calmly responded, and when the enemy troops approached, they used machine guns to sweep densely. At the same time, they used mortars to bombard the enemy positions, causing heavy casualties to the enemy troops in the fierce battle for about half an hour, forcing them to retreat.

### Enemy Attack on Qiujiang Pier Repelled

Machine Guns Sweep Leaving Enemy Corpses Strewn About; Enemy Retreats in Disorder

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy in Yangshupu has repeatedly tried to break through, attacking the Qiujiang Pier and Jungong Road area, hoping to link up with the besieged enemy in Zhanghuabang. Last night, the enemy on that side was restless again. Our troops stationed at Qiujiang Pier responded calmly, and when they saw them advancing nearby, they rose up and attacked. Where machine guns swept, enemy corpses were strewn about, and those who could not retreat along the original route fell into the water and fled for their lives. After this heavy blow, the enemy retreated miserably towards Yangshupu. The enemy repeatedly attempted to attack the Jiangwan Zhabei line in an attempt to contain our forces. After our rear artillery bombarded the enemy's base in Hongkou, the enemy was in a state of utter confusion and retreated in poverty.

### Our Planes Shoot Down Two Enemy Planes

According to the Central News Agency, yesterday (2nd) at about 3:00 PM, a small team of enemy planes scouted our troop positions and bombed the Jiangwan Luodian area. Several of our planes flew in from the southwest, and a dogfight ensued. Our planes immediately surrounded the enemy planes and swept them with machine guns. The enemy planes could not withstand the attack, and two of them were hit by our planes, one falling near Luodian and the other falling near Jiangwan. One plane fled in panic.

### Enemy Planes Reconnoiter and Drop Bombs Ineffectively

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At 10:05 AM today, three enemy planes flew to the Pudong area and dropped bombs and used machine guns to strafe our shoulder-carrying workers along the Pudong shore. At the same time, the fierce artillery battle this afternoon began at this time.

Several Japanese planes flew to the skies above Pudong several times from 8:00 PM last night to 5:00 AM at dawn to reconnoiter and released red-white flares to enhance visibility. At about 7:00 AM this morning, three more planes flew low over various places to inspect. Because of this, the situation in Pudong is more serious than in the past few days, evidenced by the sudden shelling of Pudong by Japanese warships this morning, and the continuous visits of enemy boats to various docks in Pudong. Everyone expected that the enemy army would take action in Pudong. However, our army is already well-prepared, and what can the enemy do to us?

### Enemy Troops Quietly Withdraw from Liuh River

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the enemy's plan to attack Luodian failed, they had new attempts. Under the cover of enemy warships and aircraft, they landed at Liuh River, planning to attack Jiading to relieve the siege of Luodian. Our troops stationed in that area immediately advanced to drive them out. The enemy army, in view of the strength of our Luodian forces, launched a general offensive last night, which also failed, and had to seek other developments. The enemy in Liuh River quietly withdrew last night, and our army immediately pursued and cleared them.

### US Commander Discusses Anglo-American Cooperation

Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, expressed his satisfaction and gratification to reporters from local Western newspapers yesterday regarding the cooperation between the British Navy on the Chinese coast and the U.S. Navy. Yarnell further stated that he and Admiral Little, Commander of the British Navy's China Fleet, often hold consultations on issues such as the interests of the nationals of the two countries, the safety of the Public Concession, and the maintenance of navigation in Shanghai. He also expressed gratitude for the rescue of the Hoover Presidential Steamer by the British warship HMS Kent.

### Western Newspapers Observe Enemy's Ultimate Difficulty

The Times reports that the enemy troops landing in various places currently number approximately 60,000. In the past three days, approximately 30,000 have landed, and some cavalry have also landed, all used to drag heavy artillery. Each division has approximately 70 artillery pieces. According to Western observers, it is doubtful whether the Japanese army, with the strength of three divisions in this narrow line, intends to order a general offensive against the Chinese army, and whether their troop strength is sufficient. Moreover, the landing in various places has already been met with fierce attacks from the Chinese army, and the damage has been considerable. It is feared that the Japanese army's advance under this carefully defended Chinese army's formation will not be easy.

### Refugees Crossing River Shot Dead by Enemy

At approximately 9:30 AM today, nine refugees were crossing the river in a sampan from Shengjia Wharf in Pudong (opposite Beijing Road Wharf) intending to land at Xinkuan Wharf. Just after leaving the shore, they were strafed by the enemy warship's boat with machine guns anchored in the river. The bullets were like linked pearls. The refugees had no way to escape and were all shot dead. Several people jumped into the river, but were all submerged. The scene was extremely tragic. Those who witnessed the situation on the Bund from abroad, all shook their heads and sighed, deeply hating the barbaric behavior of the enemy. Zhengzhou

### Trivial Commentary

— Xiang

This time, the government is issuing 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds, which is truly a preparation to amass financial resources and sustain the resistance against the enemy. How significant its meaning is! Therefore, people who are generally aware of the righteousness and patriotism will be able to generously subscribe and actively contribute. This goes without saying. However, there are those who are merely guarding their wealth, who are usually exploitative and unkind, and who view social and national public welfare matters as if they were Qin and Yue, not even contributing a single hair. Those people can only be persuaded and rewarded, which is impossible to make them happily contribute. In this extraordinary period, more strict and mandatory methods should be used to prevent them from evading.

### Letter to the Nation from the National Salvation Bonds Solicitation General Assembly

Increase Savings for Yourself, Strengthen the Nation

The National Salvation Bonds Solicitation Committee General Assembly issues the following letter to the nation:

"Now, all 400 million compatriots across the country have a patriotic heart to contribute to the nation, and all have a fervent spirit to jointly save the country. However, everyone has a question in their hearts: how can we contribute this patriotic heart and use this fervent spirit to make the greatest effort for the country?

Naturally, the people want to contribute their strength to the country in the most practical and effective way, and the government also wants to concentrate and utilize the nation's strength in the most practical and effective way. Therefore, this question is felt simultaneously by the entire nation and is urgently demanded to be resolved.

Now we have a solution. The government has decided to issue 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds and has already begun soliciting subscriptions.

The nation already has unprecedented unity, and the people have unprecedented faith in the government. If we want to contribute our own strength, is there a more practical and effective way than contributing directly to the government? Purchasing national salvation bonds is the best way to directly contribute strength to the government.

The ultimate goal of the government is to build a modern, independent nation. This is also the goal that all compatriots have been hoping for day and night. Everyone is already aware of the achievements in economic construction and national defense construction in the past few years, so there is no need to say more. However, that is naturally not enough. Precisely because economic construction and national defense construction are still not enough, the lives and property of the people cannot have adequate protection. Let us think: what is the use of having money if even life and property are not guaranteed? Today has passed, but what about tomorrow? To ensure the protection of our lives and property, we must first contribute our own property so that the government can further enrich economic construction and national defense construction. In other words, we are making a sacred investment in the construction of this modern, independent nation. When the government repays the principal and interest of the bonds in the future, it will be the day when our lives and property are fully protected. That will be the time when everyone can live and work in peace and contentment.

When life and property are not guaranteed, all industrial and commercial investments are naturally not guaranteed. However, today, everyone already has a very clear understanding: our country will never perish. Therefore, purchasing national salvation bonds is a very stable investment. At present, it can increase the protection of our own lives and property, and in the future, there is a very reliable guarantee of repayment of principal and interest. It not only protects the country but also protects ourselves.

For national salvation bonds, the government also gives an interest rate of 4%, which is higher than the return on buying foreign bonds. Everyone must also understand that the future of other countries is not as bright as the future of our country. Even foreigners say this. That is to say, buying foreign bonds has a lower return and is not necessarily more secure.

During this period, the destruction of industrial centers by war has led to a particularly large expansion of the unemployed population. This is something that everyone knows and is very worried about. From this lesson, we can understand that industry needs the protection of the country. At the same time, we must also realize that to settle this huge unemployed population, we must quickly enable the country to have the strength to mobilize the entire nation to engage in economic construction and national defense construction. Only in this way will future industries have sufficient protection.

Furthermore, the reason why the government cannot but limit the payment of legal tender is because there is still a lot of floating capital and many securities that can be converted into floating capital in the country. The existence of this floating capital is the reason for capital flight and the reason for the turbulence in the financial market. Patriotic people will naturally no longer want to evade capital and should, at this time, convert all floating capital into national salvation bonds. In that way, the financial market will naturally stabilize, and the payment restrictions on legal tender will naturally become unnecessary.

I think that all patriotic people should not only provide all their floating capital to purchase national salvation bonds but also save on food and clothing and continue to purchase national salvation bonds continuously. Constantly save on extravagance and waste, purchase national salvation bonds, both to increase savings for ourselves and to strengthen the nation. This is killing two birds with one stone.

If we can take the useless and non-interest-bearing gold and silver coins, jewelry, and utensils and exchange them for national salvation bonds, then we can avoid the danger of hoarding treasures at home and generate interest. The contribution to the country is especially great. The government will give an additional 6% of the actual price for gold and silver exchanged for bonds to encourage this.

Regarding the progress of the solicitation work, the Shanghai General Assembly has organized the solicitation, and branch associations in various provinces, cities, and counties are also rapidly organizing. We hope that every enthusiastic person can contribute their strength to do the work of solicitation. You can contact the local solicitation team to participate. If you have any opinions or plans regarding solicitation, you can also submit them to our association at any time. We will naturally welcome them very much."

### Expansion of the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office

### Minister Kung Will Return to China Soon

Chen Bingzhang Has Been Ordered to Go to England

According to relevant sources, Minister Kung is currently suffering from heart disease in Germany. The doctor said that he needs to rest for six months before he can recover. However, Kung decided to return to China in the shortest possible time due to the seriousness of the national crisis.

### Madame Kung Provides Relief to Wounded Soldiers

Central News Agency reports that the war on the front lines is fierce. Our loyal soldiers are fighting bloody battles to defend the country and swear to defend the territory with a death wish. Madame Soong Ai-ling, wife of the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Kung Hsiang-hsi, in view of this, organized the Wounded Soldiers Relief Committee the day before yesterday. Madame Kung sent her eldest daughter, Ms. Ling-yi, to Hong Kong to solicit medicines and medical equipment from her close relatives and friends. A telegram was received yesterday stating that all relatives and friends in Hong Kong were inspired by Madame Kung's enthusiasm and immediately donated 100,000 yuan in cash, which was remitted to Shanghai that day. After receiving the telegram, Madame Kung immediately sent a reply expressing her gratitude and decided not to accept cash but to purchase medicines or surgical equipment instead. After this telegram was sent, it was heard that Ms. Ling-yi had already departed from Hong Kong for Shanghai, and it is unknown whether she can still make changes in time. Ms. Ling-yi was ordered by her mother to go to Hong Kong this time to solicit 100,000 yuan in donations for the relief of wounded soldiers, all of which will be used for the relief of wounded soldiers nationwide, not exclusively for Shanghai, and even less exclusively for the wounded soldiers hospital run by Madame Kung in Shanghai. Because Madame Kung is planning the nationwide relief of wounded soldiers. According to those who have met Madame Kung, her intention is that the nationwide relief of wounded soldiers must be universally established in all war zones under the central government's overall plan, and there must be a long-term plan. In the future, no matter what aspects donate funds or medicines, materials, and equipment, they must be remitted to the central government, which will coordinate the overall situation and allocate and handle them to avoid partiality. Therefore, the funds raised by Ms. Ling-yi this time will also be remitted to the central government in the same way and will not be used exclusively in one place.

### Madame Yang, Wife of Commander Yang, Comforts Wounded Soldiers

### Association of Professors and Writers Sends Telegram to Chairman Chiang and Soldiers

Expressing Respect and Vowing to be the Backing

The Wartime Cultural Construction Committee of the Shanghai Association of Professors and Writers sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang and the soldiers on the front lines yesterday as follows: ❶ To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanjing Military Commission, the brutal Japanese are invading and the fate of the country is at stake. People from all walks of life are grieving and indignant. You, sir, are directing the war effort and have repeatedly defeated the powerful enemy, suppressing the barbarity of the island barbarians and establishing the prestige of the great Han. The Association listens from afar and is filled with admiration.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: I have read your newspaper's report on the fire in Xian Gua Street, and there are slight inaccuracies in the facts. Our business resides at No. 128 Zhonghua Road and engages in the rice industry. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all staff members moved to No. 8 Cihe Lane in the British Concession to take refuge. As for the fire, it was caused by a fire breaking out in the neighboring Jie business behind us due to carelessness. All the buildings were completely destroyed. Fortunately, due to the strong efforts of the firefighters in various districts, only a portion of the rear of our building was damaged, and the goods inside were only damaged by water. This matter concerns our business's reputation, so we are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, He Yuan Rice Shop, September 2.

To the Editor: I have read your evening edition of August 28th, "News Intercepted by Our Reporter Inspecting the War Zone," which stated, "Refugees from Huangdu said that the town chief, Dai Di-ren, was shot by the garrison two days ago. Evidence of communication with the enemy and a radio transmitter were found in the town chief's home." I am currently the head of the Sixth District of Qingpu County. According to a confidential report, "Fang Songtai, the town chief of Huimin Town, Jiading Nanxiang, had organized a maintenance association with the Japanese when the Japanese army arrived in Nanxiang during the January 28th Incident. He is now suspected of communicating with the enemy and has a radio transmitter. He has now moved to Songnan Township in your district." After receiving the report, I immediately led the local militia to the address and arrested the town chief. After a brief interrogation, he was transferred to the Jiading County Government for questioning and prosecution. As for what was reported in your newspaper, it must be hearsay. I am deeply afraid of confusing the public, so I am writing to correct it. I hope that you will publish it as soon as possible to rectify public opinion. Sincerely, Dai Di-ren, Head of the Sixth District of Qingpu County, to the Editor of Shen Bao.
