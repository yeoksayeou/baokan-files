### The Situation in Danyang is Critical, We Are Firmly Defending the Jiangyin Forts

Jingjiang is Still Peaceful, External Reports are Unconfirmed; Large Fire in Yixing, Fierce Battles in the Suburbs; Our Positions in Haiyan Shift Westward to Haining

The following is a summary of war news from various fronts received by this newspaper last night: ① Although the Japanese army has broken through our Jiangyin-Changzhou line and invaded Jiangyin city, according to various reports, the Jiangyin fortress is still in our army's hands. Our loyal and brave soldiers are prepared to defend the fortress to the death, and the blockade line has not been breached. Japanese claims yesterday of bombing the Tianshenggang fort facing the river near Jiangyin are likely misinformation, as Tianshenggang is a port in Nantong and has no military facilities or forts. According to people arriving from Jingjiang yesterday, the situation is still peaceful and not as dire as external reports suggest. ② On the main Beijing-Shanghai railway line, our army in Changzhou moved westward yesterday and has established positions between Lücheng and Lingkou. Therefore, Danyang is now extremely critical. Japanese claims of occupying Lingkou station and engaging our army in fierce battles there are difficult to verify. Japanese troops in Changzhou appear to be advancing towards Jintan. ③ After Yixing was invaded by the Japanese army, a large fire broke out in the city, but our army is still fiercely resisting the Japanese army in the suburbs, with battles continuing. Due to the fall of Yixing, Liyang has also become a target for continued Japanese attacks, and there were reports yesterday of Japanese troops attempting to advance there. ④ The war situation in Guangde was indeed once occupied by the Japanese army, which divided its forces into three routes: one advancing through Dai Bu Town to attack Liyang, one through Lujiapu to attack Langxi, and one through Sidianpu to attack Xuancheng. According to reliable sources late yesterday evening, it has been recovered by our army, but the Japanese army is actively counterattacking. ⑤ News from the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway front is scarce. Although the Japanese army has a three-pronged approach to attack Hangzhou - one from the south of Wuxing, one advancing west along the railway, and one attacking along the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway - our entire line has been reinforced with fresh troops, and there should be no changes in the short term. It is said that our army in Haiyan moved westward to Haining yesterday.

### Our Army Recaptures Guangde

External news: Our army on the Anji front advanced north and recaptured an important stronghold on the right flank in the morning, while also capturing two Japanese artillery pieces and many other firearms. After occupying Guangde on the 29th of last month, the Japanese army advanced fifty miles westward, reaching the Shijiedu town. Now that both flanks are under threat, they are retreating eastward towards Changxing by circuitous routes. Our army took advantage of the victory to launch a sudden advance, immediately recovering Guangde. External news: From morning to noon, our army launched a fierce counterattack on Shimenwan. Due to insufficient strength, the Japanese army there has switched from offense to defense.

### Our New Positions are Defensible

[Nanjing] The Chinese military authorities here remain optimistic about the military situation on the eastern front, believing that the Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jurong to Liyang positions are sufficient to resist Japanese attacks for a long time. At the same time, they believe that the Guangde to Xuancheng line is also difficult for the Japanese army to break through, as the mountain ranges winding through the junction of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces make it extremely easy to defend. Furthermore, according to Chinese authorities, the Zhenjiang forts can resist the Japanese army for at least one and a half to two months. Since the area near Zhenjiang is mostly mountainous and the river is narrow there, it is easier to defend than the Jiangyin forts. In short, the Chinese authorities are determined to defend Nanjing at any cost. In the near future, Nanjing will become China's Madrid. (One-day quick news agency report)

### Our Army Blows Up Highway Bridges

[Hankou] As the Japanese army approaches Nanjing, intense fighting is expected in the suburbs. To prevent part of the Japanese army from reaching Wuhu, the Chinese army has blown up all the bridges between Guangde and Wuhu and destroyed the highways to prevent mechanized units from passing through. The Chinese army has also built many obstacles in the Yangtze River between Wuhu and Zhenjiang. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is still in Nanjing and exchanged phone calls with a senior Chinese official here yesterday afternoon. (One-day Reuters report)

### Fierce Battles Still Raging in Changzhou City

[Nanjing] According to Chinese sources, fierce hand-to-hand combat continued in Changzhou city last night. However, the main force of the Chinese army has retreated to new positions near Benniu, west of Changzhou. On the Jiangyin fort front, loyal and brave Chinese soldiers continued to resist the attacking Japanese army last night, so the Jiangyin blockade line has not been breached. The fighting on the Beijing-Hangzhou highway is still raging in the suburbs of Yixing. The fire in the city has been burning all day, and there are still 10,000 poor people in the city, all of whom are destitute and unable to move elsewhere. (One-day quick news agency report)

### Fire at Pujiang, Smoke and Mist Fill the Air

After a part of the Pujiang 16th Pier blockade line was dismantled by the Japanese army last month to facilitate the passage of Japanese warships, many wooden fishing boats docked on the river surface were burned. At about 10 a.m. yesterday, the fishing boats that had not been affected by the flames were set on fire again, and smoke and mist filled the Pujiang River for a time. The fire was quite fierce. At about 2 p.m., the burning became even more intense, and a total of seven or eight boats were burned. Suddenly, more than a dozen gunshots were heard on the river surface. It was learned that many dock loafers had boarded rowboats and gone to the burning boats to retrieve charred firewood, so the Japanese army on both sides fired to stop them. However, the flames gradually subsided until about 5 p.m. As of now, there are only two intact fishing boats that have not caught fire left in the middle of the river.

### The Current Situation in Songjiang

A Scorched Earth, a Dead City

(Songjiang Correspondence) Since Songjiang was lost, transportation has been blocked and news has been cut off. Although one or two refugees occasionally escape to Shanghai to give reports, they have not been able to fully clarify the situation. Several residents of Songjiang recently arrived in Shanghai yesterday and provided a detailed report, which is recorded below. Since Songjiang fell on the 9th, a large fire broke out in the city on the 10th, burning all day. The firelight was so bright that it could be seen from more than ten miles away. The entire city, from inside the East Gate to the Xiuye Bridge outside the West Gate, except for the residence of lawyer Ni Guangrong and the Guangda Chang silk shop, which still stand tall, has become a scorched earth. The Songhui Road outside the West Gate, the engine room of the Zhuganhui Electricity Company, and the entire Songhui Village have also been burned down. The bodies of men and women who were burned to death along the way are endless. The fire was not completely extinguished until the 27th. Among the shops, only the Qianyuan Sauce Garden near the Zhangta Bridge outside the East Gate is barely operating, and there are few pedestrians. Huayang Qiaozhen outside the East Gate, although not burned, has also become a dead city. The situation in the four villages such as Ye Xie, Deshenggang, Zhuangjiahang, Sheshan, and Zhang Liantang is still good, except for a clash that occurred on Tianma Mountain. However, general bandits are taking the opportunity to carry out large-scale activities. In Ye Xie Town in Pu South, a large number of local bandits suddenly arrived on the afternoon of the 29th and carried out a large-scale robbery. Almost no shops or households in the town were spared, and the losses were enormous. There are about 1,000 Japanese troops stationed in Songjiang. A small maintenance committee has also been established in Deshenggang and Ye Xie Pu, and a self-defense force has been formed in the East Gate. Zhang Jianshu, a resident of Fenglezhen in Songjiang City, moved with his family to Feng Batu in Zhangze Town, Pu South, after the outbreak of the Shanghai war. Before long, he was robbed by a gang of bandits, losing about several thousand yuan. Afterwards, he moved to Tinglin Town and rented a house. However, on the 8th, amidst heavy artillery fire, Zhang and his entire family of eight were unable to escape and perished. The other day, it was heard that Song and other citizens of Songjiang came to Shanghai to consult with various related parties and request the issuance of passes to facilitate transportation. Permission was granted, and five people, including Zhu Jiuwang and Xu Chunbo, set off together for Song on the morning of yesterday (the 1st).

### Both Armies Confront Each Other Across the River on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line

The Pinghan Railway Line Becomes Quiet; War Resumes in Central Shanxi

[Qingdao] Chinese and Japanese troops are confronting each other across the river on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. The Chinese army is still holding key points on the southern bank, both on the front and on both flanks. But the Japanese army is eager to peep at Dong'a, so the situation on the left flank of the Chinese army is more tense. (One-day quick news agency report)

[Beiping] Yesterday, the front line of Pinghan Road became quiet again, but the Japanese army between Shijiazhuang and Zhangde was busy mobilizing, seemingly intending to continue the southern invasion.

### British Ships and Aircraft Attacked by Mysterious Ships

The Plane Has Been Lost

[Hong Kong] The British warship Eagle sent a plane to practice bombing on the 30th. One plane dropped a smoke ball 30 miles east of the Henglan Lighthouse. It was shot at by a mysterious ship of unknown nationality, but it was not hit. The British side is investigating. (One-day special telegram)

[Hong Kong] According to official sources here, a British naval aircraft took off from the aircraft carrier "Eagle" yesterday morning to conduct a training flight outside the port. On the way, it was suddenly attacked by a merchant ship of unknown nationality, but it was not hit.

[Hong Kong] An aircraft belonging to the British aircraft carrier "Eagle" (displacement of 22,000 tons) was suddenly attacked yesterday by a warship of unknown nationality. The incident occurred in an area 40 miles southeast of the Waglan Lighthouse, apparently due to a misunderstanding. The plane and its pilot were not injured. The "Eagle" aircraft carrier was conducting exercises at the time of the accident. After the plane flew out of the clouds, it dropped a smoke bomb in the air to observe the wind direction. The smoke bomb landed near a warship of unknown nationality. The warship suspected it was being bombed and immediately opened fire. The details of this matter will probably not be known until the "Eagle" aircraft carrier returns to port. (One-day Reuters report)

[Hong Kong] The pilot Miller of the British aircraft carrier Eagle, which was conducting exercises outside the port, was about to land his plane on the ship today when, for some reason, he crashed into the sea. The pilot has been rescued, but the plane has been lost. (One-day Reuters report)

### Nanjing's Defenses are Strengthened, with a Garrison of 50,000 Troops

The Situation is Serious, We are Determined to Defend to the Death; Trenches are Built Everywhere in the City

[Nanjing] Chinese troops are now actively preparing defensive works in the suburbs of Nanjing. General Chiang Kai-shek expressed his satisfaction after inspecting the newly built defensive works yesterday. At present, ten of the Nanjing city gates have been closed with obstacles, while the remaining thirteen gates are still open as usual. Trenches have been built everywhere in the city, and sandbags and barbed wire have been placed at key transportation points on the streets. Artillery positions have also been deployed and landmines buried at key military points outside the city. Currently, there are about 50,000 troops stationed in Nanjing, and more are continuing to arrive within days. This large-scale preparation for defending the city proves the Chinese authorities' declaration that they will defend Nanjing to the death as long as there is a breath and a bullet. Most of the people of Nanjing have moved away, so the city looks extremely desolate. Most of the shops are closed, and there are few pedestrians on the road. There are still 50 foreigners left in the capital. The authorities are taking various measures to ensure the safe evacuation of these foreigners. These foreigners leaving Nanjing are all boarding British, American, and French gunboats to go west. (One-day National News Agency report)

[Hankou] A spokesman for the Chinese government recently declared to a representative of the Haitong News Agency here that Nanjing will be defended to the end as long as there is a breath and a bullet. The national defense line near Nanjing has now been strengthened, and a large army has been concentrated there. Although the government has left the capital, it cannot be regarded as abandoning Nanjing. The spokesman only said that General Chiang Kai-shek is now putting forward a slogan: "Surrender to Japan loses everything, resist Japan gains everything." China is technically inferior, so the only way is to prolong the war to exhaust Japan. As for the situation in Nanjing, the spokesman declared that it is very stable. The evacuation of the people has been settled, and there is no shortage of food and supplies. Although the front-line war is very serious, it is not hopeless. Japan often says that it will fight to Chongqing, which is absolutely impossible. It only shows Japan's "thunder." China's resistance will never waver. As long as there is still a single Japanese soldier on Chinese soil, China will resolutely resist to the end. (One-day National News Agency report)

### Italy Recognizes the Manchukuo Puppet Regime and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges a Protest

It also learned that the Chinese ambassador to Italy has received instructions from the government to lodge a serious protest with the Italian government. (One-day National News Agency report)

[Rome] Authoritative Chinese sources here declared that the Chinese ambassador to Italy, Liu Wendao, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday to protest against Italy's recognition of "Manchukuo," stating that this recognition is completely contrary to the League of Nations resolution, and Italy is still a member of the League of Nations. It is heard that a formal protest letter has not been submitted, so the Italian side will not send out a formal reply. At most, it will only be a verbal reply. (One-day National News Agency report)

[Nanjing] Chinese officials here are quite indignant about Italy's recognition of Manchukuo, saying that it contradicts its usual expressions of friendliness towards China and that Italy was one of the countries that voted in favor of the League of Nations' re-declaration of non-recognition of Manchukuo.

### Japanese Military Authorities Announce the Scope of Occupied and Confiscated Property

Chinese Ships that Change to Foreign Flags are Still Occupied; Private Property is Purchased at a Fair Price When Needed

According to the Japanese military authorities, Chinese-owned ships that change to foreign flags will still be occupied by the Japanese authorities. The Japanese authorities have noticed several such incidents. The Japanese army will not confiscate the private property of Chinese people, but will purchase it at a fair price when needed. When discussing the general political situation in Shanghai, a Japanese spokesman said that the Japanese authorities sympathize with a certain local group established in the outer districts. When asked whether the Japanese authorities have considered establishing an agency to replace the Shanghai government, the spokesman replied that the current development has not yet reached this stage.

### Japanese Confiscation of Foreign Small Vessels: US and Italy Protest

Yesterday one vessel was returned; negotiations for the rest are ongoing. Portuguese merchant's inland river vessel expected to be returned today. "North-China Daily News" reports Italian vessel being towed away.

National Maritime News Agency, Shanghai dispatch: Japan's confiscation of six small boats flying the flags of the US, Italy, and Portugal has caused extreme excitement here. The US and Italy lodged protests yesterday. It is reported that the vessels flying the American flag were docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession. When Japanese soldiers boarded the ships, they tore down the American flag and threw it into the river. The US Consul General has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities and reported the incident to the US government. The Japanese side explained that the vessels were only registered in the US but were actually the property of the Chinese government. According to news from here this morning, the Italian Consul General has also sent a protest letter to the Japanese authorities.

The Japanese Navy successively towed away the Italian merchant Hua Yi Company's two medium-sized steamers, the "Lido" (i.e., "Nanyang") and "Romolo" (i.e., "Beiyang"), and the Texaco's "Yun Tai" small steamer, the American merchant China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Flying Boat" small steamer, the French merchant "Yue Bin" small steamer, and the Customs' "Hu Ning" fireboat from the Huangpu River the day before yesterday, mooring them together at the Tai Tong Wharf in Pudong, opposite Yangshupu. It is now known that after the authorities of various foreign shipping companies separately sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese side, the Hua Yi Company's two vessels and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Flying Boat" vessel were returned at 3:00 PM. There is also hope that the "Yun Tai" small steamer will be released, but negotiations for the "Yue Bin" small steamer have not yet yielded results. As for the "Hu Ning" fireboat, it suffered the same fate as the detained "Pu Ji" fireboat, being placed under similar guard.

The Portuguese merchant De Qi Company had a total of five small vessels confiscated. As they were all purchased from former Chinese merchant shipping companies on the inland rivers, the ship names have not yet been changed. They are named "Xin Ying Zhou," "Li Ning," "Da You," "Yuan Feng," and "Li An." After the Portuguese merchant filed a complaint with the Portuguese Consulate, the Consul negotiated with the Japanese side. According to the company, the ships are expected to be released today.

"North-China Daily News" reports eyewitness account. The "North-China Daily News" reported that yesterday (November 30th), Japanese naval landing forces unloaded the Italian and American flags from several small steamers docked at the Bund and replaced them with Japanese flags, towing them downstream into the Huangpu River, destination unknown. In addition, there were four river steamers towed downstream from a point opposite the HSBC bank by a Japanese tugboat, one of which was a river patrol boat. A foreigner witnessed this incident at the Jinliyuan Wharf's Italian dock, on the "Tam Ping" ship, and relayed the details to the "North-China Daily News." It is known that Italian Consul General Nilon lodged what amounted to a formal protest with the Japanese consular authorities in the afternoon. However, as of yesterday evening, the Japanese authorities still denied seizing small boats flying British, French, or Italian flags. Two Italian small steamers, named "Romolo" and "Lido," belong to an Italian shipping company on Guangdong Road and are used exclusively for transporting passengers. They are well-known in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Passengers going to Wusong to board Italian mail ships often take these two boats. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the two boats have frequently travelled in the Huangpu River, flying the Italian flag from the masthead and painting the Italian flag on both sides of the wheelhouse. The two vessels were docked at the French Concession Bund when they were seized. Although the company manager witnessed the incident, he was powerless to stop it. According to a foreigner who witnessed the details told the "North-China Daily News," the incident occurred between noon and 2:00 PM yesterday. An American-owned small steamer was also seized at the same time. Japanese naval landing forces suddenly arrived at the ships, removed the Italian and American flags, and replaced them with Japanese flags before towing them downstream, passing in front of the Japanese cruiser "Izumo." The Italian company manager immediately reported the incident to the Italian Consul General and protested to Japanese Consul General Okamoto. Okamoto reportedly replied that he was unaware of the matter but would investigate. Those concerned are currently awaiting the development of the case.

The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the two Italian company small boats seized by the Japanese army yesterday are rumored to be returned to their original owners. Although the company staff has not yet received the news, it is reliably reported that the case has been resolved by the Italian and Japanese consuls. The Japanese side reportedly expressed regret for the wrongful seizure.

The US Consul General replied that he had nothing to say. According to reliable sources, US Consul General Gauss has lodged a formal protest with the Japanese authorities over the Japanese army's seizure of the American vessel and reported the matter to the government in Washington. Another report said that the American flag taken down by the Japanese soldiers was thrown into the river. Whether this was intentional is unknown. The US authorities have not yet attempted to recover it. This morning, American expatriates in Shanghai visited Gauss to inquire whether he had heard of the matter, whether he had received a report, whether he had lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities, or taken other actions. Gauss only replied that he had nothing to say, so the crowd bid farewell and left the office. Since the incident occurred, foreign officials in Shanghai and overseas have been quite shocked.

National News Agency, New York, 30th: Today, the newspapers here published reports from Shanghai stating that an American-flagged vessel, fully loaded with paper, was seized by the Japanese army for no reason. The "New York News" used a large headline for this incident, recognizing that "unexpected incidents in China are emerging one after another, and insults to the American flag have reached their extreme." (30th National Dispatch)

National News Agency, Washington, 30th: The State Department announced today that according to a telegram from the US Consul General in Shanghai, a team of Japanese naval forces hijacked the small steamboat "Flying Boat," flying the American flag, parked on the Bund in the French Concession this afternoon and tore down the American flag. The ship was originally owned by the Chinese China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but it was later sold to the American-Chinese Shipping Company, so it was re-flagged with the American flag and repainted with ownership markings. According to Gauss, several steamboats flying the Italian flag were also hijacked at the same time, and several steamboats of German merchants had also been hijacked several days ago. The State Department has now instructed Gauss to provide a more detailed report. (30th National Dispatch)

National News Agency, Washington, 30th: After receiving the report from Consul General Gauss in Shanghai, the State Department is temporarily silent on the incident of Japan insulting the American flag. Whether the State Department will instruct Gauss to negotiate with the Japanese army in Shanghai, or whether the US Ambassador to Japan will directly negotiate with the Japanese government, is unknown.

### Britain and France Willing to Cooperate with All Countries to Protect Rights and Interests in the Far East

Advocating the Use of Free Negotiations to Stabilize the International Situation

[London] French Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos left here at 4:30 PM today to return to France. Before departing, Chautemps met with news reporters and only stated that everything was detailed in the official report. The French representatives had a very good impression on this trip. (30th Hai Tong Dispatch)

[London] The talks between French Premier Chautemps, Foreign Minister Delbos, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Foreign Minister Eden concluded yesterday. During their talks, the serious situation in China was thoroughly studied. According to a communique issued after the meeting,

"British and French cabinet members all recognized the seriousness of the situation in the Far East. Both sides agreed to be prepared to cooperate with powers in a similar position to protect their rights and interests and to fulfill all obligations arising from international treaties in that region. British and French cabinet members further stated their willingness to cooperate with all countries to undertake the common task of promoting international harmony through free and peaceful negotiations."

One of the biggest features of this talk was the complete agreement of opinions between the British and French governments. French Premier Chautemps told reporters as he set off to return to Paris that the communique on the Anglo-French talks was broad and substantial. He could not add anything further beyond the communique. Our opinions are in complete agreement, which is what he was most pleased with. He was deeply grateful for the hospitality received in Britain and especially grateful for the hospitality of the King of England.

Judging from this clear and frank communique, one can know the broad scope of the Anglo-French talks. The two governments have expressed their ultimate goal in this talk, which is the general resolution of the overall situation, and have agreed on a grand plan to achieve this goal.

Yesterday, after British Prime Minister Chamberlain read this communique in the House of Commons, Labour Party leader Attlee rose and asked whether it was planned to extend this talk to other countries in order to achieve a general solution. The Prime Minister replied that the ultimate goal we hold is a general solution. What is obvious is that talks between only two or three countries cannot achieve this goal, so we must find a way to enlist other countries to join the talks. At the same time, he should clearly tell them that he believed that the current progress was not very far and it was not advisable to immediately expand the talks, but that it may be necessary in the future.

A communique issued after the meeting stated that British Privy Councilor Halifax's visit to Germany was of a private nature and may not produce results immediately, but it could help dispel international misunderstandings and improve the atmosphere. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

### Berlin Welcomes, Rome Disappointed

Britain and France Safeguard European Peace, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania All Express Satisfaction

[London] The communique issued in London regarding the Anglo-French talks was given a relatively good welcome in both Paris and Berlin today, but Rome was very disappointed because it did not mention any steps to improve Anglo-Italian relations. The Italian welcoming text mentioned the colonial issue, prompting the Italians to believe that the communique only acknowledged the existence of the issue, but its resolution was almost indefinitely delayed. At the same time, according to news from Berlin, political circles in Berlin stated directly that if their interpretation of the entire communique was correct, then British Privy Councilor Halifax had made a valuable elucidation of Germany's goals. Germany also welcomed the communique's statement on the colonial issue. As for France's criticism of the communique, only the "Times" has been published so far, stating that there are various reasons to congratulate the talks between the two leaders. If someone tried to create a split between Britain and France, they have suffered a complete failure. The unity of Britain and France is now a reality, at least it can balance the axis between Rome and Berlin. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

[Berlin] After the authorities of Britain and France conducted talks, a communique was issued today. Upon learning the content of the communique, German political figures neither expressed optimism nor pessimism, only saying that the communique was worded gently and could help stabilize the international situation. As for what kind of concessions Germany intends to make as exchange conditions when it recovers its old colonies in the future, political figures refused to disclose anything. Observers said that "Germany's current diplomatic policy belongs to a peaceful nature, and the various methods it has adopted to create peace are also suitable for the times. This has been recognized more clearly in other countries, and they have gradually realized that the extremely deep-seated prejudices that all countries previously had against Germany's goals have gradually been eliminated, presumably due to the explanations provided by Lord Halifax, Privy Councilor of England." (30th Havas Dispatch)

[Rome] After the Anglo-French talks ended, Italian political figures commented on them, saying that Italy was very doubtful about whether the talks could produce real results, and it has now been proven to be correct. Regarding the situation in the Far East, the Anglo-French communique stated that the current international treaties must be respected, which is in conflict with Italy's adopted attitude, that is, unreservedly supporting Japan's current policies. In addition, regarding the colonial issue, the British and French authorities believed that it could not be discussed separately. Observers here expressed disappointment upon learning this and said that Germany's view is that the restoration of old colonies is not subject to bargaining, which Italy agrees with. As for British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons advocating the establishment of a "general European agreement," people here also expressed surprise, because Italy has always believed that Prime Minister Chamberlain is an advocate of restoring the Four-Power Pact. (30th Havas Dispatch)

Warsaw. Regarding the results of the talks in London between the authorities of Britain and France, the "Warsaw Courier," representing the Polish general public, commented briefly, "Whether Britain and France are sincere in guaranteeing peace in Western and Eastern Europe was previously doubtful, but this has now been dispelled by this talk." (1st Havas Dispatch)

Warsaw. The results of the talks between the authorities of Britain and France have proven that the attitudes of both sides are completely consistent. Polish officials are very satisfied upon learning this, but they believe that the government is unable to express a formal opinion until more detailed information is obtained. In addition, French Foreign Minister Delbos will be visiting within days, at which time he will inform Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck of the various demands made by Germany and the methods decided by the authorities of Britain and France. (30th Havas Dispatch)

Prague. According to a dispatch from the Prague Daily News reporter in London, when French Foreign Minister Delbos visits Central European countries within days, he may express opinions in the name of the British and French governments, and after expressing friendship, he will warn Czechoslovakia to take extremely appropriate actions towards Germany and German minorities. In short, "Britain and France must use all their strength to seek a general solution to various European problems, or they may require Central European countries to establish a kind of 'truce,' or even force those countries to accept a compromise solution, which is also not impossible." (1st Havas Dispatch)

Romanian Capital. Regarding the results of the talks in London between the authorities of Britain and France, public opinion here is quite satisfied, believing that the line of defense of Britain and France guaranteeing peace has been strengthened as a result, and the allies of France have also received a guarantee that the benefits of each country will continue to be preserved. (1st Havas Dispatch)

Vienna. Regarding the communique issued after the talks in London between the authorities of Britain and France, informed sources here have expressed satisfaction, believing that the concern of Britain and France for the German colonial issue is a good omen for resolving general Central European issues. (1st Havas Dispatch)

[Vienna] The "Vienna Daily News" commented on the communique issued after the Anglo-French talks, "The issue of re-allocating the colonies of various countries has seen its beginnings, and therefore Germany must treat the suggestions that it can make to Britain and France with a more compromising attitude, which may be different from what the country's semi-official press says. In this way, the peaceful situation in Central Europe can still be maintained, and Germany will not infringe on the current borders of Central European countries, and Western European countries will not allow it to infringe."

### Japan Recognizes the Franco Regime

Western Rebels Recognize Manchukuo in Exchange

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota informed Mr. Castillo, the former Spanish consul in Kobe, who is now the representative in Tokyo of the Salamanca government, today that Japan legally recognizes the government of Franco, leader of the Spanish Nationalist forces. It is heard that "Manchukuo" will also formally recognize the government tomorrow. Before Japan's official recognition, the Nationalist forces promised to fully respect Japan's existing treaties with Spain, and Japan promised to handle all diplomatic negotiations regarding Spain with the Franco government. Castillo has received instructions from his government to announce tomorrow to Xie Jieshi, the "Manchukuo" representative in Tokyo, that the Franco government recognizes "Manchukuo." (1st Reuters Dispatch)

[Tokyo] The Japanese government announced this morning that it formally recognized the Western rebel government and appointed Koaka Teiichiro, the second secretary of the current embassy in Czechoslovakia, as the first envoy to Salamanca. (1st Express News Dispatch)

[Berlin] After the Japanese government decided to recognize the Spanish Nationalist forces government tomorrow, political circles here expressed unanimous favor and said that as of now, a total of ten countries have recognized the Spanish Nationalist forces government legally or in fact. The Japanese government's move is sufficient to prove that the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan have a united relationship. (30th Havas Dispatch)

### Italian Prime Minister Publishes Essay Advocating Sino-Japanese Reconciliation

Ridicules the Failure of Collective Action, Supports Japan's Current Policy

[Rome] Today's "Italian People's News"

Today, an editorial was published, showing the handwriting of Prime Minister Mussolini, which warned Britain, the United States and other countries not to take strong action against Japan, because Japan is in an invincible position. The article also ridiculed the lack of achievement of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and advised China to beg for peace with Japan. Regarding the participation of the United States in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the article ridiculed the chief American representative Davis, saying, "The prudent Mr. Davis, as soon as the meeting was over, hurried home, not daring to keep his appointment to England. Now Mr. Davis can reveal the chaotic state of the meeting. This is the first time that the United States has participated in a meeting of European collective action. President Roosevelt's Chicago speech gave endless hope, but the result was like this. It can be seen that whether Britain, the United States, and France act alone or in cooperation, they cannot defeat Japan's invincible position." (1st National Dispatch)

Milan. The Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's organ "Italian People's News" today published an unsigned essay stating that China had best make peace with Japan, which still could obtain good terms. This article is written by Mussolini himself, stating that if China still trusts any assistance of a collective nature, then it is simply committing suicide, because Japan will obviously be victorious in every battle and force China to submit to its scope. It is also said that collective action has now failed again, and what China can do is directly ask Japan for peace conditions, which will probably not be as harsh as China imagines. It is expected that this article obviously has political implications, because Mussolini has recently been in contact with important Japanese figures touring Europe. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

Milan. Prime Minister Mussolini personally wrote an article in the "Italian People's News" today, declaring that he was pleased with the failure of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, because he has never had faith in the effectiveness of the League of Nations' collective action. Now he has seen the principle of collective security causing the collective failure in Beijing this time. The prudent Davis has seen that the European meeting of collective action cannot succeed and has begun to know that organizing the meeting is not a wise policy. "From the Italian experience, no country dares to advocate the word 'sanctions,' in fact, it is only a verbal advocacy, and it is of no help to China or Japan. Judging from historical, geographical, and balance of power factors, Japan cannot be restricted. Japan is indestructible. All economic means against Japan are only harmful to the implementing countries. The aid of the powers to China is only beneficial to Japan, because the more aid, the more the victor will gain in the future. Japan's only threat is the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union is undergoing internal changes and cannot look outward. Assuming that China still hopes for group assistance from a certain aspect, it is no different from China signing its own death warrant. Since collective action has failed again and again, China has no other way but to seek peace with Japan. Japan's attempt to make drastic changes to the map of the Far East is inevitable. All those who want to change what is inevitable will only be disappointed. The failure in Geneva has been so many times, but this is not the last time. It is impossible to change the natural process of history." Finally, Mussolini concluded that what he said may be considered unpleasant by benevolent politicians, but it must be known that the roar of artillery in the Far East is more pleasant to listen to than the meeting in Geneva. (1st Hai Tong Dispatch)

[Rome] An article published in today's "Italian People's News" is said to be written by Prime Minister Mussolini, in which one sentence says, "Japan has now changed the map of the Far East, and those who do not believe in this fact will see that they are greatly mistaken." General observers believe that this sentence is a response to the section on the Far East in the joint communique of the British and French authorities. According to yesterday's "Italian People's News," which commented on Italy's recognition of "Manchukuo," "The new country of Manchukuo and the Japanese Empire are sufficient to represent the defensive forces of order in the Far East. The mission that these two countries bear in Asia is the same as the mission that Germany and Italy bear in Europe. Italy's recognition of "Manchukuo" is actually recognizing this fact and this mission. (1st Havas Dispatch)

### British Concessions on Colonial Issues

A General Solution to European Problems Required; Demands on Germany Deemed Difficult to Accept

[London] Following the conclusion of talks between Britain and France, figures in British diplomatic circles have commented on the section regarding colonial issues in the communique, stating that the British government has now agreed to make measured changes to the current status of its colonial territories. This marks a complete reversal from the stance held by former Prime Minister Baldwin two years ago. However, any future concessions to Germany regarding colonial issues would be subject to the following conditions: first, a general solution to all European problems must be established; second, the agreement of all relevant nations must be obtained; third, the strategic positions of Britain and its allies must not be prejudiced; and fourth, the interests of smaller nations must not be harmed. Regarding the first point, the specific meaning of a "general solution" remains unclear. However, according to well-informed sources here, the idea of a Four-Power Pact among Britain, France, Germany, and Italy has not been considered. Furthermore, the British government has never advocated revising the mutual assistance treaties between France and Russia. However, an arms limitation treaty must be established, and the mutual relations between Germany and its neighbors must be clarified to avoid misunderstandings. (30th Havas dispatch)

[London] Regarding Germany's demand for the restoration of its former colonies, well-informed sources here have stated that Germany may not agree to negotiate with other countries to establish a general solution to European problems as an exchange for regaining its colonies. Therefore, lengthy discussions between the relevant countries and Germany through diplomatic channels are likely necessary. As for the views of Germany's neighbors, they should become clear after French Foreign Minister Delbos consults with Central European countries. It is rumored that Germany has clearly demanded that half of the Belgian Congo in Africa be ceded to Germany, while the other half, along with Portuguese Angola, would be designated as a mandated territory, managed by a privileged company in which Germany would hold a leading position. This is the proposal advocated by the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Schacht, before his resignation. Regarding this, British observers believe that it is obvious that Britain and France are unwilling to ask Belgium and Portugal to sacrifice their respective territories. Therefore, if any land concessions do occur in the future, they must be a collective sacrifice by all relevant countries, rather than being made by a few countries alone. Given that Britain and France have considered this, it is evident that these countries will insist that a broad solution to all European problems must be established before Germany's demands on colonial issues can be met. Furthermore, they may even demand that Germany reissue a statement respecting the territorial integrity of its neighbors, with some freedom rights granted to German minorities within Czechoslovakia as a condition. Regarding the Mediterranean issue, British and French authorities are said to have agreed that the anti-British and anti-French propaganda campaigns in Italian newspapers must cease before any solution is established. In addition, regarding Germany's return to the League of Nations, the British and French governments will exchange views through diplomatic channels. It is generally believed that if the League of Nations Covenant could be separated from the Treaty of Versailles and the clauses regarding sanctions in Article 16 of the Covenant could be amended, in essence, if the League of Nations could become a purely advisory body, then Germany might return to the League of Nations. (30th Havas dispatch)

Beijing The semi-official Belgian news agency recently declared: "Regarding various reports of a solution to the German colonial problem, official sources are quite skeptical. Several months ago, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels announced that Germany demanded the Belgian Congo be ceded to Germany. At that time, it was denounced as absurd by Belgian figures. Subsequently, the Belgian government repeatedly and publicly declared that the territorial integrity of the Congo and Belgium's sovereignty over the Congo were not negotiable." (1st Havas dispatch)

[London] Regarding Germany's demand for colonies, newspapers this morning carried reports that Germany not only demanded that the British-mandated territory of Togoland and French Cameroon in Africa be returned to Germany but also demanded the establishment of a joint German-Portuguese-Belgian company in multiple locations on the African coast, with large portions of the Belgian Congo and Portuguese Angola placed under the mandate of that company. Regarding this information, official sources declined to comment. However, if Germany has indeed made this demand, it seems unlikely that the British government would accept it. (1st Havas dispatch)

### Glimpses of British and French Newspaper Commentary

[London] Regarding the outcome of the talks between British and French authorities, newspapers here generally expressed satisfaction. Most of them believed that the establishment of European coordination would require lengthy negotiations. However, some newspapers suggested the possibility of convening a Four-Power conference among Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. For example, "The Times" stated, "After continued progress in the exchange of views among the relevant countries, an international conference may also be convened, because Germany's colonial demands involve several countries." "The Monthly Mail" stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain is currently considering signing a Four-Power Pact among Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. However, "The Monthly Voice" opposed this plan, stating that any attempt to sign a Four-Power Pact must be linked to the League of Nations. Regarding the section on the Far East issue in the Anglo-French communique, only "The Daily News" commented, stating that this explanation is of significant value. (1st Havas dispatch)

[Paris] French newspapers today discussed the close convergence of attitudes and opinions between the two sides as demonstrated in the Anglo-French talks. "Le Petit Parisien" stated that if Germany's strategy is to alienate the Anglo-French alliance by seeking British favor, then it dares to say that this strategy has now failed. "Le Journal des Débats" reporter Bertina, referring to a general solution and talks between Italy and Germany regarding a Four-Power Pact, stated that it could not support this proposal because it did not include Poland, the Soviet Union, and the Little Entente. However, if France's three allies could participate, and the United States and Japan were also willing to join, then it might bring countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations or have never joined into an international cooperation system.

### Yugoslavian Prime Minister Scheduled to Visit Rome

To Promote Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries

[Rome] Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović is scheduled to arrive here before the 5th of this month to return the visit of Foreign Minister Ciano. Count Ciano visited the Yugoslavian capital in March of this year to sign the Italo-Yugoslav political and economic agreement. Until recently, Yugoslavia has sent a military delegation to Italy to promote friendly relations between the two countries. This time, Stojadinović is returning the visit in person and will take the opportunity to meet with Pope Pius XI, as relations between Yugoslavia and the Holy See have been quite good since the signing of the ecclesiastical agreement in July of the previous year.

### Dr. Schacht and His Resignation (Part 1)

— By Feng Lieshan

The rumors of Dr. Schacht's resignation, which have been circulating for the past two or three years, were finally confirmed by the German authorities three days ago. However, the matter is not as simple as some people have speculated, that Dr. Schacht's position as the dictator of the German economy has been completely shaken. In reality, the position he resigned from was merely a near-titular position as Minister of Economic Affairs with an annual salary of 38,000 marks. He retains the position of President of the German Reichsbank, which has considerable power and an annual salary of 300,000 marks. Perhaps he will lose some prestige on the surface, but this does not seem to be enough to affect his real power.

Dr. Schacht himself is not a member of the Nazi Party, although he has received the highest honors from the Nazi Party. He is a financial expert, a financial expert who occupies a position in modern world history. This is the main reason why his position is not easily shaken. Within the Nazi Party, there is General Göring in charge of military affairs, Dr. Goebbels in charge of propaganda, Mr. Rosenberg in charge of theory, but when it comes to managing the economy, no one can replace Dr. Schacht. As for Führer Hitler himself, he does not feel any interest in the economy. We dare not predict that Dr. Schacht will not be removed from office one day, but at least now is not the time for him to fall out of favor.

Dr. Schacht personally is friends with many key figures in the German financial world, including the most important bankers and industrialists, such as the banker Schroder, and the owners of the Krupp, Siemens, and chemical trust industries. This certainly gives him many conveniences, but at the same time, it has also made him the target of attacks from the younger faction within the Nazi Party, who say that his economic policies favor private capital and hinder the Nazi Party's economic plans. Besides this, he has many other things that displease this younger faction in private. First, he is not a great advocate of excluding Jews, perhaps because he has personally seen the losses suffered by Germany in international trade after the issue of Jewish exclusion arose. Secondly, he is a senior member of the Freemasons (a secret society with religious elements). When the Nazi authorities ordered the ban of all Freemason lodges in Germany, a branch under his control maintained itself for a long time before voluntarily dissolving. Thirdly, he does not agree with the Nazi Party's controlled economy policy. He not only expresses opposing views in private conversations, but even gives public speeches at times. Finally, and also importantly, he is not a member of the Nazi Party.

The conflict between Dr. Schacht and the younger faction within the Nazi Party is a well-known fact. This rift worsened after he gave his famous speech two years ago (in Königsberg, East Prussia). In his speech, Dr. Schacht pointed out that the issue of Jewish exclusion should be carefully considered, that a prudent approach should be taken to overcome the current economic difficulties, and that the shouts of propagandists were of no use at all. Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels' response was to ban German newspapers from publishing this speech. Later, it went even further, with some Nazi Party newspapers even hinting at opposition to Dr. Schacht.

After the turmoil expanded, the Nazi Party authorities felt the difficulty of dealing with it. The only effective method was to pull out someone to serve as Dr. Schacht's bodyguard. That person later became General Göring. In fact, General Göring is a busy man. He has to manage everything from the air force to the theater, so where would he have time to take care of economic issues, let alone that he is not a financial expert. The significance of General Göring's appointment as Director of the German Four-Year Plan lies in using his position to suppress the momentum of the younger faction in the party, so that they have no excuse to oppose. Dr. Schacht is a behind-the-scenes planner, while General Göring is the one acting on the stage.

According to a Havas dispatch from Berlin, the reason for Dr. Schacht's resignation this time was due to a conflict with General Göring. This view seems worthy of discussion. General Göring is not only the one who recommended Dr. Schacht to Führer Hitler, but more importantly, he is a moderate within the Nazi Party. Most of Dr. Schacht's friends are also his friends. General Göring is also a person who does not talk much about National Socialism. Why would they have a conflict? In name, everything is still General Göring's!

We can only see Dr. Schacht's resignation from his concurrent position as Minister of Economic Affairs as a superficial concession to the younger faction within the Nazi Party, allowing General Göring to come forward and take responsibility for everything. It cannot be said that his position has been shaken unless he resigns from the position of President of the Reichsbank, because in fact, all the power of the entire German economic structure is concentrated in the hands of the Reichsbank.

### Japan Seeks to Control Chinese Customs; The United States is Extremely Concerned

Believes it Violates the Open Door Policy; British House of Commons Inquires About the Situation in Shanghai

[Washington] Regarding the Japanese attempt to control Chinese customs, official circles here are particularly concerned about any Chinese incident. The United States is currently seeking to contact Britain, France, and other powers, but at the same time, it also seems to want to use its own strength to determine the limits of the rights that the Japanese want to seize from China. The State Department has sent a telegram to the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, instructing him to investigate whether the Japanese reduction of import duties on Japanese goods is true. If it is true, the United States will consider Japan to be intentionally violating the Open Door Policy and reducing U.S.-China trade. On the other hand, the State Department has instructed U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew to submit a note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry yesterday, requesting that the Japanese government consult with the United States before making any changes to Chinese customs. It is reported that influential U.S. Senator Borah has expressed satisfaction with the State Department's China customs policy. (30th National Telegram)

[Washington] The State Department today ordered officials in the American consulate in China to provide information regarding the alleged large reduction of Tianjin customs duties on Japanese products. According to sources here, if the tax reduction is confirmed, it would directly close the door to equal commercial opportunities for all countries in China. Newspapers recently reported Japanese news stating that the Tianjin Security Maintenance Association has significantly reduced import duties on ten items, including rice, wheat, sugar, tobacco, cement, grains, lead sheets, and petroleum, since November 20. It is reported that the tax reduction for sugar is approximately 100 yen per hundred pounds, and the tax reduction for flour is from 6 sen and 4 fen to 1 sen per bag. (30th Reuters dispatch)

[Washington] According to a source, the import duties paid on Japanese goods shipped to Tianjin have been reduced somewhat. U.S. Secretary of State Hull believes that this move is in direct conflict with Article 3 of the Nine-Power Treaty signed by Japan and has instructed the Consul General in Tianjin to investigate and report. (Note: Article 3 of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that all countries shall enjoy equal opportunities in China for commercial and industrial enterprises.) (30th Havas dispatch)

[London] Regarding the Chinese customs issue, British diplomatic circles have recently stated that British and Japanese authorities are currently conducting negotiations to ascertain Japan's intentions and inform them of the measures that Britain, the United States, and France intend to take to protect their respective interests. (1st Havas dispatch)

[London] Labour Party MP Noel-Baker asked Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons today about the current situation of the Shanghai customs. Eden replied that the British government viewed the recent remarks by the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai as a serious threat to the proper administration of Chinese customs and the use of customs duties to repay foreign debts. The British government immediately consulted with the U.S. and French governments. The British government has notified the Japanese government that Chinese customs are always related to international interests, and any measures involving customs administration during the current period of hostilities should be discussed with the British government first. The U.S. and French governments have also made similar representations to Japan. Discussions are still ongoing. Labour Party MP Fletcher asked whether the Japanese government had guaranteed the portion of Chinese customs duties allocated to British debts. Eden replied that discussions were still ongoing. The House of Commons should know that this matter is very important, and he does not want to answer supplementary questions. Noel-Baker then asked whether they have agreed to the proposal that if tax revenue exceeds the amount needed to repay foreign debts, it will no longer belong to the Chinese government as before. Eden replied that judging from the ongoing negotiations, it is clear that we have not agreed to anything. (1st Reuters dispatch)

[London] Labour Party MP Henderson asked the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons today whether he could comment on recent remarks by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe regarding the possibility of Japanese military administration of Shanghai. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that he had seen such remarks in the newspapers. The British government is unwilling to over-interpret remarks, but of course, it cannot recognize the right of any country to take unilateral action to resolve problems arising from the administration of the international settlement. Henderson also asked whether the Foreign Secretary had investigated whether the reported remarks were indeed made by the Japanese Prime Minister. Eden replied that he thought his answer was quite broad, so he would prefer not to answer for the time being. Labour Party MP Bellenger suggested that it would be best for Ambassador to Japan Craigie to make representations to the Japanese government regarding the inauthentic manner in which such and similar remarks were published. Eden replied that it should not be said that the Ambassador had not done so; unfortunately, inauthentic remarks are not limited to one country. (21st Reuters dispatch)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden told Labour Party MP Eckersley in the House of Commons today that the information he received did not indicate that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai were currently inspecting or demanding to inspect telegrams from British newspapers in Shanghai sent to England. MP Martin asked whether it was true that the Japanese had occupied the Chinese post office in Shanghai. The Foreign Secretary replied that as far as he knew, the post office had not been occupied. (1st Reuters dispatch)

[London] According to today's "Daily Telegraph," the Japanese authorities' attempt to control the Chinese Maritime Customs Service has encountered strong resistance from the Customs Service itself. Inspector General of Customs Frederick Maze and all European and American personnel have notified the Japanese military authorities that if the Japanese military takes control of Chinese customs, they will immediately resign. Frederick Maze has also notified the British government of this decision. According to the "Daily Telegraph," this threat is quite troublesome for Japan because if the customs personnel resign en masse, Japan will have no way to collect taxes. (1st Haitong dispatch)

### Japan Actively Promotes Southern Expansion Policy

British General Urges All Countries to Unite and Respond; The United States Reinforces Defenses of the Hawaiian Islands

[London] British General Hamilton, a famous general during the European War, recently gave a speech at a banquet of the Royal Scottish Association, solemnly warning European countries to pay attention to Japanese imperialism. He said: "Throughout the year 1937, European countries were constantly quarreling with each other over the Spanish issue. In fact, at this time, not only the general staffs of Britain and France should have held talks and discussed cooperation methods, but the general staffs of all European countries should have contacted each other to prevent Far Eastern incidents. As of today, the advancing route of the Japanese army has become clear, that is, from Hankou southward to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. It is difficult to stop it unless European countries unite. Although the defenses of Singapore naval base are strong, if it is approached on land to attack its rear, it can be surrounded and easily captured, as the Japanese army did when it occupied Lushun during the Russo-Japanese War." (30th Havas dispatch)

Honolulu According to a Washington report today, the United States is currently planning to greatly strengthen the defenses of the Hawaiian Islands at a great cost. It will build underground bunkers for storing munitions and fuel, as well as underground emergency aircraft hangars. It will also build large barracks on Oahu, where Honolulu is located, that can accommodate a large number of U.S. troops. Senior U.S. Army and Navy officers here today declined to comment on this information. The Hawaiian Islands were discovered by Cook in 1778 and form a chain in the Pacific Ocean. Eight of the islands are inhabited, while the rest are uninhabited. All of the islands were originally volcanoes, so almost all of them are surrounded by coral reefs. Hawaii is the main island, where the world's largest volcano is located. Pearl Harbor has a great naval defense project, located about seven miles from Honolulu. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### New Dutch Foreign Minister Announces Humanitarian Aid to China

Will Spare No Cost to Defend Itself; Foreign Policy Remains Consistent

The Hague The new Dutch Foreign Minister, Dr. Patijn, announced in the Lower House today that a bill will be submitted soon providing humanitarian aid to China. He stated that foreign policy would follow the legacy of his predecessor, Dr. Colijn. Since the Netherlands has earned trust, it will spare no cost to defend itself. Therefore, all possible conditions for security will be fulfilled. The Foreign Minister clearly stated that the Netherlands is now completely free on the issue of armaments and is not bound by promises or secret treaties. As for the Netherlands' declaration of neutrality, it cannot do so because the Netherlands is in a different position than Belgium. The Dutch government has always believed that the government should decide whether to allow foreign troops to pass through Dutch territory. If major powers that do not have obligations to the Netherlands regard the invasion of Dutch territory as an event that would trigger war, then the Dutch government cannot disagree.

Barcelona Regarding the dispatch of an international investigation team to Spain to prepare for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, after the Non-Intervention Committee sent a note to both sides of the Spanish Civil War to solicit opinions, the Spanish Republican government recently submitted a response to British Ambassador to Spain Chilton, asking him to forward it to the Non-Intervention Committee in London. The content expressed support for the dispatch of an international investigation team, but considered that recognizing the Nationalists as belligerents would be tantamount to rewarding aggressors and could not be accepted. The Spanish Nationalist government has also submitted a response, requesting that the tasks of the investigation team be explained and arguing that the relevant countries should recognize it as a belligerent power once both sides have withdrawn 3,000 volunteers.

### International Tea Export Quota Increased

Rubber Quota Reduced

[London] According to a bulletin issued today by the International Tea Committee, the tea export quota for the year from April 1, 1938, to the end of March 1939, is set at 92.5% of the standard export volume. The quota for the previous year was 87.5%. Britain's recent inventory has increased compared to a year ago, so the committee's decision to increase the quota by 5% is surprising to tea industry insiders. An increase of 5% in the quota will mean that 40 million pounds of tea will be put on the market. Adding the 20 million pounds left over from the last time, the market will have to absorb 60 to 70 million pounds more tea from April 1938 to March 1939. According to tea industry insiders, the increase in the source of tea will inevitably lead to lower market prices, especially for ordinary types. When the London tea market opened this morning, Ceylon tea merchants expressed caution, and prices fluctuated, eventually falling by half a penny to one penny per pound. (30th Reuters Telegraph)

[London] The International Rubber Regulation Committee's decision yesterday to reduce the rubber export quota for the first quarter of 1938 from 90% to 70% was considered a surprisingly good news by market participants. After the announcement of this decision, the buying mood immediately became feverish, and transactions were brisk, with prices rising by half a penny. However, due to profit-taking, the highest price could not be maintained. According to this quota, rubber-producing countries will reduce production in the first quarter of 1938 by about 56,000 tons compared to the last quarter of 1937, so as to cope with the decline in US consumption. The investigation committee has not pre-determined the quota for the second quarter of 1938. This move shows its determination to pay attention to the trend of the New York market and adjust it on time. It is heard that the US representative in the committee did not have any objection to this sudden reduction in production. According to public opinion, since the quota has been reduced, production and consumption in the first quarter of 1938 should be equal, and there will be no surplus as in the last quarter of 1937.

### Continued Shipment of Rice to Relieve Food Shortages

150,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Ordered by Various Industries to Arrive in Shanghai - Rice Merchants Procure Zhejiang Rice, Chamber of Commerce Requests Release - Fourth Batch of 30,000 Bags of Tribute Rice Scheduled to Arrive Tomorrow

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, in cooperation with the South China Rice Industry Company, has procured 110,000 bags of foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai to regulate food supplies. In addition to the three batches that have already arrived, the fourth batch is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. According to reliable sources, the food industry in this city has entrusted British and French foreign firms to continue ordering large quantities of foreign rice from Siam, Saigon, and Annam. About 150,000 bags have now been ordered from Siam and will be shipped to Shanghai in three batches before the middle of this month. Negotiations are still underway in Annam and Saigon, and no transaction telegrams have yet been received in Shanghai. In addition, the Miscellaneous Grain, Bean, and Rice Merchants' Association is also in contact to procure 300,000 dan of Zhejiang rice. The details are summarized as follows:

Zhejiang Rice and Foreign Rice Shipped in Batches - In addition to requesting the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to certify the procurement of 300,000 dan of domestic rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, the Miscellaneous Grain, Bean, and Rice Merchants' Association has also obtained the assistance of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council and entrusted foreign firms to order a huge amount of foreign rice, which has been loaded on foreign ships. The total amount arriving in Shanghai before the 15th of this month is approximately 15,000 tons, equivalent to approximately 150,000 bags, divided into four batches arriving in Shanghai on December 3, 8, 12, and 15.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Zhejiang Haimen Town Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting them to protect the transport of Zhejiang rice to Shanghai to relieve food shortages. The letter reads: "To the Zhejiang Haimen Town Chamber of Commerce, We are writing to you regarding a letter from the Shanghai Rice Merchants' Association stating that in view of the current rice shortage, although there is assistance from Saigon, it is a drop in the bucket and still difficult to meet the needs of the population. Purchasers are suffering greatly. Rice merchants should have the responsibility to regulate food supplies. Our company intends to provide its own capital and send personnel to Taizhou (Haimen), Zhejiang, to purchase 10,000 shi of white rice and transport it to Shanghai for sale to relieve food shortages. We request your chamber to send a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to issue a certificate and send official documents to the Zhejiang Haimen Chamber of Commerce and the county government so that we can take them to purchase the rice without hindrance, etc. We are writing to you to inform you of the situation and hope that you will investigate and handle it accordingly, etc. In view of this, since the movement of the front lines, the food supply in Shanghai has been in a state of panic. Relying solely on the foreign rice stored and purchased by the authorities of the concession and sold sporadically, the citizens are still sometimes without food. The rice company intends to prepare capital and send personnel to your area to purchase 10,000 shi of white rice and transport it to Shanghai to relieve food shortages, which is beneficial to both production and sales. In addition to filling out a certificate issued by our chamber, we are writing to your chamber to investigate and facilitate the purchase and transport, and please forward it to your county government to order its subordinates to protect the transport and maintain the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai."

Four Batches of Foreign Rice to Arrive Tomorrow - The fourth batch of 30,000 bags of Saigon rice, shipped by the Taikoo Company's Zhejiang Wheel, was originally scheduled to arrive last Saturday. However, due to severe weather along the coast and difficulties in navigation, it was delayed. According to a telegram received by the Taikoo Company from the shipowner, it is possible to arrive in Shanghai this Friday (3rd). The South China Rice Industry Company has notified the Rice Merchants' Association, and the association has issued a notice that the registration for the distribution of the fourth batch of rice will be handled from now on. All 500 registered rice shops in the two concessions can bring their shop cards and pay a pre-paid vehicle miscellaneous fee of ten yuan to the association to fill out a rice purchase application form. Yesterday, registration at the association was quite enthusiastic.

Strictly Prohibit Whole Sales and Deductions in Weight - The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council have made great efforts to help order foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai to regulate food supplies. It has recently been heard that most rice shops in the boundary are following the retail methods, but there are also many who are selling whole bags for profit and deducting weight. The Rice Merchants' Association has been notified to inform its members to pay attention to the following: (1) Saigon rice obtained must be retailed and must not be sold privately in whole bags. (2) The weight sold should be accurate and must not be deducted. Those who violate the above methods will be severely punished and suspended from rice distribution business.

Rice and Flour Prices Gradually Adjusted - Since the transportation in Shanghai was blocked, the food supply has been quite lacking. After various food organizations tried to dredge the source, huge amounts of foreign rice and domestic rice have been shipped to Shanghai in batches. There is no fear of a food shortage in the future. The situation of retailers crowding the rice shops has gradually decreased. As for prices, after adjustment, each dan has not exceeded 14 yuan in national currency. Regarding flour prices, after the Flour Millers' Association adjusted them, the rising trend has been curbed and is gradually stabilizing. The wholesale price is 4.35 yuan per bag (standard flour), and the retail price is 4.40 to 4.50 yuan per bag.

Rice Shop Set Up in the Nanshi Refugee Area - The South China Rice Industry Company has allocated 3,200 bags of foreign rice to the various refugee camps in the French Concession in four batches to help provide food for the refugees. Except for the first, second, and third batches of 800 bags each, which have been received by the various refugee camps according to the number of people, the last batch of 800 bags has also been allocated in full on the 30th. The association has notified the refugee camps to collect them from the association from the 1st. It is also understood that the food for the refugees in the refugee camps is temporarily safe after the supply from the South China Rice Industry Company and the efforts of the International Relief Committee to procure food. However, the number of people is large and the future is long. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically donate one dime per day to provide assistance.

Regarding the rice and grain problem in the refugee area, the International Relief Committee convened a meeting of district chiefs yesterday. In addition to issuing rice to the refugees, the entire area was divided into nine districts, and three rice shops were set up in each district to meet the needs of the residents in the refugee area. It is scheduled to be implemented today.

The Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society is an organization jointly established by Chinese and foreign people in this city, specializing in relieving refugees of all countries within Shanghai and assisting hospitals in rescue work.

### Since the Shanghai War Broke Out, the Relief Funds of the International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society Have Reached 2 Million Yuan

The Nanshi Refugee Area is Improving Day by Day - Father Zhao is the Greatest Help - Li Guiyong Reports on the Relief Situation

Li Guiyong, Executive Committee Member of the International Relief Committee, reported on the situation of refugee relief work in this city since the outbreak of the Shanghai War at the Tuesday Luncheon of the YMCA. He said that there are currently 250,000 refugees in the city, including 90,000 in the Public Concession, 94,000 in the French Concession, and 66,000 in the Nanshi Refugee Area (poor households not included). There are a total of 296 shelters in the city, including 152 in the Public Concession, 40 in the French Concession, and 104 in the Nanshi Refugee Area. Charitable organizations are in charge of refugee relief work, and the important ones include the Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, the Chinese Jisheng Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the World Red Swastika Society, the Yellow Swastika Society, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers' Association, the Pudong Fellow Villagers' Association, the YMCA, the International Relief Committee, etc., about 14 groups. In addition, the number of fellow villagers' associations and enthusiastic groups participating in the relief work is countless. Since the outbreak of the war, it is estimated that more than 2 million yuan has been spent on refugee relief. During the early stage of the war, when the factory areas in Yangshupu were all in the war zone, tens of thousands of workers had to take refuge in the concession, and their families were displaced and had no food or clothing. Therefore, about 50% of the money was used for the workers. Later, the war zone expanded, such as Baoshan, Jiading, and Pudong cities and villages, and they also came to Shanghai to take refuge one after another, and 46% of the money was used for this area. Then, those who were engaged in small business were also difficult to establish themselves, and about 1% of the money was used for this area. In addition, about 3% of the money was used for those who had no fixed occupation. As for the Nanshi refugee area, from its conception to its establishment, and until the recent work has become more concrete, Father Zhao's efforts and planning have been the greatest help. Now, the supply of water to the households in the area has restored 24 tiger stoves. As for the food problem, (1) The refugees are relieved, and the meals are now distributed to each district based on the badges issued, which is quite orderly. (2) Holding flat sales to benefit the households, according to the original plan, three places are planned to be set up in each district, but it is still difficult to be universal for a while. There are already five companies starting to sell rice, the rice price is temporarily set at 16 yuan per bag, and each flat sales place is given 14 yuan per bag, and 2 yuan is used as a handling fee. For health work, there are now three obstetrics hospitals, two serious illness hospitals, one mild illness hospital, and twelve clinics. However, due to the weather conditions, the number of deaths is still alarming. The number of deaths every day is still 30 to 40. We are now trying to remedy it from many aspects. As for the International Relief Committee, it now needs about 90,000 yuan per month. The funds used before were all donated by group members and individual members. At present, the scope of relief is expanding day by day, so we are promoting one dime donation per day. We hope that enthusiastic people will save one dime every day, and 3 yuan per month can save one refugee. If 300,000 enthusiastic people can participate together, then all the current refugees will have no fear of hunger. Fortunately, since the implementation, we have received the enthusiastic cooperation of all sectors. At present, dozens of people come to the meeting every day to take on this donation, and it is expected that there will be considerable results.

### All Transportation in Pudong Was Cut Off Yesterday

Muller Company Tries to Dredge

Since the Japanese side blocked the only remaining ferry crossing in Gaoqiao, Pudong, and then the Yangjing and Donggou ferry crossings, the Pudong temporary ferry has been completely suspended yesterday. The transportation between Pudong West and East was completely cut off, and the number of passengers stranded on both sides was very large, and Pudong vegetables could not be shipped to Shanghai. It is now heard that the Yishang Huayi Company and the British Muller Company, etc., believe that the temporary ferry they run is purely for the villagers and vegetable vendors, and has absolutely nothing to do with the military. Therefore, they have tried their best to dredge the situation in order to resume sailing as soon as possible.

### Red Cross Medicines Transported to China by Air

British Enthusiasts' Righteous Deeds - Planning to Serve Our Country's Red Cross

The Zilin News reported from London on November 30 that a private plane carrying Mr. Duri-Mickey, Mr. Smith, and Dr. Hanke departed from Heston today and flew to China.

### Rice Industry Groups Declare on Distributing Rice to Members

Sent a Letter to the Municipal Council Authorities - Crack Down on Inaccurate News

Yesterday, the Shanghai Rice Shops' Association, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, and the Shanghai Rice Milling Industry Association sent a letter to Mr. Hodekui, Chinese Deputy General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, which reads: "Dear Sir, Yesterday, we saw in the evening newspaper that Zhuang Ping, Chairman of the Xilianyi Association in West Shanghai, sent a letter to Mr. Hodekui, Chinese Deputy General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, stating that on the afternoon of the 29th of last month, he saw a truck carrying more than 40 bags of Saigon rice being transported to our association at No. 52 Maoyi Lane, etc., and exaggeratedly claimed that we were hoarding a large amount of foreign rice, which was suspected of monopolizing and violating the regulations for retail sales, and should be strictly investigated by your bureau to prevent abuses, etc. We have investigated the food situation in Shanghai, which was affected by the war, blocked traffic, and lack of sources, causing panic among the citizens. Our association has spared no effort to seek remedies, and especially thanks to the efforts of the members of the Rice Shops' Association, and fortunately with the assistance of your bureau, we were able to supply the citizens with tax-free and parity-priced foreign rice, which is of no small benefit to the relationship between public security, and all the situations have been praised by Chinese and foreign people. The 40 bags of Saigon rice that came to No. 52 Maoyi Lane on the 29th were formally applied for and issued by the Bean and Rice Industry Association on behalf of the members' rice shops, prepared to distribute to the families of the staff in the industry. At the same time, 30 members of the Bean and Rice Industry Association received them. The rice that came to this place was the rice received by the Wanshengtai Rice Shop, a member of the (Bean and Rice Wholesale Merchants' Association), which is completely different from the Rice War Industry Association (Retail Merchants' Association) distributing to the rice shops for retail sales. This is because Wanshengtai Rice Shop moved here to live and work together after August 13, which is verifiable. However, Zhuang Ping, Chairman of the Xilianyi Association in West Shanghai, did not understand the facts, and recklessly made remarks and announced them in the newspaper, confusing the public. We should ask your bureau to crack down on the above situation, and order the person in charge of the association not to make arbitrary attacks on inaccurate news in the future, so as not to sensationalize the public and maintain public security within the boundary, which is really convenient for the public."

### Elementary School Teacher Turned Thief Killed After Not Reforming

An elementary school teacher has been captured alive after turning to theft.  He will be interrogated again after the accomplices are found.

Min Xinhao, a young local thief, used to be an elementary school teacher in Sanlintang, Pudong. After losing his job, he turned to crime three years ago. He was first arrested for participating in the kidnapping of Sun Qiebao, the son of Sun Yu of Shaoxing, in Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, in the French Concession. Due to insufficient evidence, he was declared innocent by the Special Second Court. He was later arrested for committing robbery in both the British and French Concessions, sentenced and imprisoned. After being released upon completion of his sentence, he was arrested again this spring for luring a woman in the French Concession, intending to sell her to Hankou. Due to the outbreak of war, he was released from the Special Second Prison after being pardoned for the remainder of his sentence. Unexpectedly, Min did not reform but continued his life of robbery. Yesterday afternoon around 3 PM, Min, together with his accomplices, including Xiao Xu (about twenty-five or six years old), and four others, armed with Mauser pistols, broke into the home of Zhang Yuan, No. 5 Weixin Lane, Rue du Père Froc, French Concession, to rob. They rummaged through boxes and chests but did not find anything of value. The bandits left disappointed. The victim and neighbors shouted for help. Two of the bandits escaped into the crowd and disappeared. Min (wearing a suit with a yellow camel hair coat) and Xiao Xu (wearing a gray cloth jacket) were identified as targets and pursued. When Min and Xiao Xu rushed out of Liyuan Lane next to the Rongjin Grand Theater on Route Conty, Western Constable No. 105, Chinese Constable No. 444 of Erdaotou, and Detective Wang Rusong led other detectives to surround and arrest them. Min was captured, but Xiao Xu, seeing the detectives approaching, fled into the Hexing Small Inn next to Liyuan Lane, hoping to escape by crossing the rooftops from the sundeck. Chinese and Western detectives followed him into the inn and onto the sundeck. Xiao Xu immediately pulled out a Mauser pistol and fired seven shots in a row to resist arrest. Fortunately, no one was hit. Constable No. 105 returned fire, firing five shots, one of which hit Xiao Xu in the back of the head, piercing through the skull. He fell to the ground and died. The police transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for an autopsy, scheduled for today. Meanwhile, a senior detective was dispatched with the captured thief Min Xinhao to investigate and bring the two fugitives to justice for interrogation.

### Japanese Legation Official Visits the Tax Bureau

The North China Daily News reports that around 10 AM on Tuesday morning, a Second Secretary of the Japanese Legation, accompanied by a military attache, visited Mr. Luff, the Shanghai Customs Commissioner. They discussed matters for about fifteen minutes. The details are unknown, but according to Japanese sources, this was merely a "courtesy visit" to customs officials.

### Public Concession Strictly Pursues Robbers

Laozha and Gordon Road Police Stations Arrest Many Male and Female Robbers

Yao A'gen, Chief Detective of the Laozha Police Station, along with Detectives Li Shugui, Wang Shusen, Zhu Shanghe, Zhang Keqin, and others, arrested two robbers, Liu Asi from Tongzhou and Huo Yunxiang (also known as A'bao) from Nanjing, in Room 321 of the Tianran Restaurant on Zhifu Road at 8 PM the day before yesterday. They then went to No. 18 Rongshou Lane, Xiamen Road, to arrest Xiao Jiangbei but failed to find him, only capturing his mistress, Zhang Xiuzhen, a woman from Suzhou. Subsequently, they arrested Ji Shiliang from Wuxi and Cai Guimin (also known as Xiao Sanwan) from Pudong at the Dajiangnan Restaurant on Fujian Road. They then arrested Yang Yukang from Ningbo and Tao Meidi, a woman from Shanghai, at No. 505 of the China Hotel on Guizhou Road. Based on Cai Guimin's confession, they arrested Wang Ziming, Wang Yongfu, and a woman, Wang Fan, from Haimen at No. 31 Fuxu Road. They confiscated one Mauser pistol, three handguns, 134 bullets, two gold rings, and two watches, and brought them all back to the police station. It was found that the above-mentioned criminals had committed numerous crimes within the concession. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special Court. Due to the suddenness of the matter, the police lawyer Li Zhishan did not have time to investigate, so he requested a postponement, which was granted by Judge Huang Risheng after questioning, and the hearing was rescheduled for Monday. Furthermore, Zhu Hanbo, Chinese Detective Chief of the Gordon Road Police Station, arrested two robbers, Hu Haisheng and Yuan Junde, at No. 864 Lane, Route Magy at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday. A Mauser pistol and sixteen bullets were found on Hu and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special First Court. The police lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Xunjiu requested permission to detain them, which was granted by Judge Xiao.

### Mrs. Niu Huisheng Clarifies the Truth About the Clothing Donation in a Letter

Yesterday, this newspaper published an article "Mrs. Niu Donates 30,000 Sets of Clothing." Now, we have received a letter from Mrs. Niu, stating that there are discrepancies in the facts, requesting a correction. We have transcribed the original letter as follows: Dear Editor, I was utterly astonished to read in your newspaper on November 29, under the heading "Relief News for Refugees," the statement that "Mrs. Niu Huisheng generously donated 30,000 sets of cotton clothing." There is clearly a misunderstanding. On October 15, at the request of Mr. Shi Siming of the Chinese Medical Association, I oversaw the distribution of 71 bags of used clothing sent by the Hong Kong Women's慰勞Association. At that time, I requested the cooperation of the Shanghai Alumni Association of Ginling Women's College. By the end of October, we had distributed 7,000 pieces of used clothing to 21 locations. All receipts were returned to Hong Kong as a completion report. However, on November 5, we received another 1,000 bags of used clothing from the Hong Kong Women's慰勞Association, specifying that they must be handled through my humble hands. Therefore, we immediately continued and expanded the organization, enlisting the assistance of groups such as the Chinese Women's Association, the YWCA of China, and the Salvation Army. At the same time, we obtained the cooperation of the Investigation Department of the International Committee to expedite the distribution. By the end of November, we had distributed over 20,000 pieces of clothing to over 70 locations. Recently, the International Committee formally appointed us as the Refugee Clothing Department under the jurisdiction of the Father Jacquinot Relief Committee. Mrs. Chen Huang Liming, Mrs. Chen Huang Dinghui, Mrs. Cao Guocai, and Mrs. Zhu Juefang organized a committee to manage refugee clothing affairs. Recently, Liu Hongsheng and others donated a large sum of 50,000 yuan for cloth and cotton. Therefore, at Father Jacquinot's request, we are acting as agents to sew cotton coats and trousers for the refugees in the Nantou refugee area and various shelters in the concessions. We have temporarily borrowed the Sacred Heart School on Route Tenant de la Tour as a storage and cutting room, with Mrs. Chen Huang Dinghui in charge of the affairs there. We estimate the first batch to be 10,000 sets, and we will continue to make more as materials become available. The so-called donation of 30,000 sets in your newspaper is likely a misunderstanding of this matter. Because the matter is of great importance, I hereby make this clarification and request a correction. Respectfully, Niu Xu Yizhen, December 1st.
