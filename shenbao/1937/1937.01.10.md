### Japanese Army Claims Diplomatic Issues Should Not Be Used as a Tool for Political Strife

Expresses Great Sympathy for Foreign Minister Arita. Although there are no results at present, future development can be expected.

[Tokyo] The voices from political parties demanding two investigations into the government's achievements in diplomacy with China and Russia and other diplomatic policies are gradually increasing. After the reopening of the Diet, diplomatic issues will definitely be the central topic of discussion. The Army authorities have always been in contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisting its policy towards China. Therefore, they expressed great sympathy for Foreign Minister Arita's dedicated efforts to adjust national relations under extremely difficult circumstances. According to the Army authorities, although diplomacy has not achieved the desired results, future development can be expected. The reason lies in China, and Japan is not solely responsible. Furthermore, Japan's international position is serious, and diplomatic issues should not be used as a tool for political strife.

### Results of Autopsy of British Girl Murdered in Beiping

Cause of death was a fractured skull caused by a blow. The elderly father wept during the interrogation.

[Beiping] The trial of the British girl murder case that occurred here has begun today. However, the results of the doctor's examination of the body will be delayed until next week. The girl's father, Mr. Huina, is a 72-year-old man. His hair was white, and he wept during the interrogation by the judge because he was overwhelmed with grief. It is said that on Thursday at 3:30 PM, his daughter Pamela told him that she was going to visit an old classmate and then go skating. When she did not return home in the evening, he sent a servant to look for her at the French Club skating rink. The servant returned after a while and said that the people in the rink had all left. At that time, he thought that his daughter might have stayed at a friend's house because of the bad weather, but he was still uneasy. So he went out to walk along the road by the city wall, hoping to meet his daughter, but he was disappointed and returned home. The old man wandered around until dawn, and then went out to look for her again the next morning. He walked along the road by the city wall and suddenly saw a crowd gathered by the roadside about 250 yards from his home. So he also went to investigate. He did not expect that the fragmented body he saw was his beloved daughter. Mr. Huina fainted immediately when he saw this tragic scene. After being rescued, he went to examine the body again and immediately recognized a torn skirt beside the body as his daughter's and confirmed that the watch on the body also belonged to his daughter. Mr. Huina continued that his daughter was 19 years and 11 months old and had just come to Beiping from Tianjin on Christmas Day. It is heard that the autopsy of the body was completed this afternoon. According to reliable sources, the girl's death was caused by a fractured skull from a blow by a heavy object. Based on the clues obtained so far, the girl's death seems to be mostly due to murder, because a French Club skating rink membership card full of blood stains was found near the body. The doctor's examination results stated that the blood stains were fresh and were blood that flowed while she was alive. From this, it can be seen that the girl was indeed attacked. (Reuters, 9th)

### Flexible Measures for Settling Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax

[Nanjing] Regarding the income tax on Category One profit-seeking enterprises, which began to be levied on New Year's Day this year, according to Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Law, "The income of Category One, Sections A and B of labor-intensive enterprises may be settled once a year according to the customs of each industry." However, according to business customs, the settlement period for most industries is at the end of the Lunar Year. The income from January 1, 1937, to the end of the Lunar Year (i.e., February 10) is subject to taxation in accordance with the regulations and the date of commencement of taxation. However, the income tax is still a novel concept in our country, and many industrial and commercial enterprises may not fully understand the calculation of capital and income, as well as the reporting procedures. If they were required to report their income within three months of the settlement, as stipulated in the Provisional Regulations, taxpayers would inevitably face difficulties. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance, based on a request for extension from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, and Chairman Huang of the Guangxi Provincial Government, also requested instructions from the Ministry due to difficulties in taxation. To facilitate matters, the Ministry has stipulated that for Category One, Sections A and B profit-seeking enterprises with a settlement period at the end of the Lunar Year, the income from January 1, 1937, to the end of the Lunar Year (i.e., February 10) may be reported and paid separately after the next settlement. This will be publicly announced and reported to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for record. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Talking About Japan in the New Year

— Nanyun

On Japanese calendars, the New Calendar is printed in font size four, and the Old Calendar is printed in font size seven. In addition, the Japanese era name and various commemorative days are printed. Needless to say, the Old Calendar comes from China, and the New Calendar comes from the West. The New Calendar is more suitable, so it is placed in the main position, and the Old Calendar is only secondary. This arrangement aptly illustrates the attitude of modern Japan towards accepting foreign culture. The confluence of foreign culture and Japanese indigenous culture (which various commemorative days can represent) is what Japan is today.

Any culture will only be preserved and developed if it is applicable. Most of the culture that is preserved and developed is limited to what suits the tastes of the "powerful" at the time and can satisfy the interests of the "powerful" at the time. Anything that does not suit the tastes of the "powerful" or resists the "powerful" is bound to be strictly prohibited and rejected. Today, the Old Calendar is still arranged in a subordinate position on Japanese calendars, which is of course because the Old Calendar still has some use.

Natural science is much more fortunate than social science. Whether it is a democratic country, an imperial country, or a socialist country... natural science almost always has a value that can be realized. What about social science? Since the establishment of the Japan-Germany Pact, a special international anti-communism has achieved further contact. But it is only a contact. Japan has its own "Greater Japanism" and will never completely copy Hitlerism. Just as when Japanese Army Minister Terauchi engaged in a war of words with political parties, the political parties used constitutionalism as a weapon, and Terauchi said, "Japan's constitutionalism should be different from that of Europe and the United States." The political parties could not deny this difference. On the day the Japan-Germany Pact was announced, Asoh Hisashi, the secretary-general of the Japanese Social Democratic Party, stated that the party was originally "anti-communist," but in the same statement, he also said that the party advocated socialism. In the history of the socialist movement, there were many factions of socialism. I wonder which faction Asoh Hisashi believed in? At a symposium discussing "People's Front" and "National Front," Asoh Hisashi's biggest reason for not supporting the People's Front movement was: "Japan has its own unique national circumstances." - From this, it can be seen that the socialism of the Japanese Social Democratic Party is neither the socialism of the Soviet Union today, nor the socialism of any faction in Europe and the United States. In all likelihood, the spirit with which Army Minister Terauchi recognized constitutionalism is the same spirit with which Asoh Hisashi recognized socialism. Originally, constitutionalism and socialism, etc., are all foreign cultures, but in a country of "Imperial Way Restoration," the extent to which they can be applied is indeed very small. This is much more complicated and difficult than arranging the New and Old Calendars.

To make the complex simple, the military that dominates today says: "Based on the Japanese spirit..." (From the Army's booklet: Army Strengthening and Administrative Reform - page 87). To make the difficult easy, they have long said: "Abandon individualism and take collectivism, sacrifice the individual and follow the great righteousness of the country's will..." (The Essence of National Defense and the Promotion of its Strengthening). This is almost like dealing with the calendars on the monthly calendar.

Zhang San is a pretty boy, and Li Kui is a reckless brute. Some Chinese people love to eat Western food, and generally, Orientals love to eat "Chinese cuisine." Each country has its own peculiarities, which is originally a truth. In modern warfare, which country does not use airplanes and cannons? This is another universal truth. However, most of the military supplies imported by Japan are raw materials (metals, crude oil, heavy oil, etc.). After the raw materials are made into weapons, they are no longer foreign goods, but weapons that are imbued with the "Japanese spirit." In short, "Japanese spirit" expresses Japan's uniqueness in the international sense, but at home, it expresses Japan's national unity. If there are still inconsistencies, then strengthen control, strengthen...

There is no need to mention the facts of this "strengthening of control," such as "administrative organization reform," "parliamentary reform," "trade control," and "nationalization of electricity." Here are a few common examples: A few days before the New Year, the Tokyo Transportation Workers' General Federation, in order to improve their lives, made twenty-eight demands (general newspapers only published a rough outline of this demand). This is the so-called "New Year's struggle." However, although the news of mediation has been reported, what was the result? This matter has not been followed up. Recalling the end of 1935, the "Tokyo Transportation Workers" also had similar demands. Comparing the attitude of that demand from newspaper reports, it was stronger than this time. But it was also resolved under "compulsory mediation." A large-scale Tokyo tram strike like in 1934 has not occurred in recent years. This is to prove the great progress of the "Japanese spirit." In addition, although the Social Democratic Party and the Tenant and Proletarian Association opposed the military's ban on workers in its military industrial sectors joining labor unions, once an order was issued, the ban was finally carried out. Because this is an "emergency poem," one should "sacrifice the individual and follow the great righteousness of the country's will." As for the collapse of the copper mine (Osarizawa) of the Mitsubishi financial king's family, 1,600 people were affected. These disaster-stricken workers can only say that they were destined for this fate. Saying that Mitsubishi only tried to reduce costs and the equipment was inadequate is just talk.

In the "Japanese spirit," today is the first principle of national defense. The military's advocacy for strengthening national defense is: "...opposing class struggle, developing resources, revitalizing industry, promoting trade, and even economic control." (According to Ryuzo Kuroda)

Under strengthened control and strengthened national defense, the internal contradictions of Japanese society seem to have disappeared for the most part. What is leaping forward is the "Japanese spirit!"

In the New Year, when the "Japanese spirit" is leaping forward, it is of course a universal celebration.

Although the national burden has increased by 600 million compared to previous years (a large tax increase), children still want their parents to buy them kites, snacks, and new clothes.... Although Japan's trade in 1936 was not as good as in 1935 (import excess of 130 million yuan), and the expected import excess for trade in 1937 will increase to a value of 180 million yuan (Yomiuri Shimbun - January 1), the military budget has increased to more than 1.4 billion yuan, and since January 1, the global naval development competition has entered the era of no treaties. Therefore, at least the boom in the military industrial sector can embellish the prosperity of Japanese society.

This is a country of cherry blossoms. Although the cherry blossoms have not yet budded, the cherry blossom-like colors of women's clothing, the cherry blossom-like decorations of stores..., everything looks beautiful and full of smiles.

The elephant under President Hitler's rule has also come to Tokyo at this time, along with other exotic wild animals, for the sake of friendly relations. The elephant is a symbol of peace. As the elephant comes to the East, how peaceful will 1937 be in the East?

Japan's right-wing political parties have already begun to engage in construction. The work of the Islamic Cultural Promotion Association (established in Tokyo in November 1936) is also progressing with each passing day. As a result of discussions between the three provinces (Army, Foreign Affairs, and Education), the number of students from "Manchukuo" studying in Japan has also been decided to shift from quantitative development to qualitative improvement. This year, about 500 students are planned.

A few kites are bound to break their strings in the New Year, if the wind is too strong.

Even watching Japanese children fly kites, one cannot forget that they are in a foreign country, because the kites in Japan are mostly painted with "Bushido."

Talking about Japan in the New Year evokes even more homesickness. (January 1, 1937.)

### The Unity of the Chinese Nation

— Gu Jiegang

A group with the same bloodline is called a race. A group with a common historical background, way of life, and a united national sentiment is called a nation. In our country, everyone has long been familiar with the fact that it can be divided into five ethnic groups, so after the Xinhai Revolution, the banner of "Five Ethnic Groups United" was raised. We may as well follow the general concept for the time being and say that there are five races in China; but we firmly believe that there is only one Chinese nation within China's territory. The interests, honor, and disgrace of the races in this nation are consistent. Separating them will hurt everyone, and uniting them will make everyone prosperous. If we want to make China an independent and free country, we must first start with uniting the various races within the country.

We should know that the people currently regarded as belonging to the five races and the areas in which they live were formed during the Qing Dynasty. Before the Qing Dynasty, due to war, conquest, migration, and assimilation, bloodlines had been mixed countless times, and regions had been moved countless times. Therefore, the Han race had already incorporated the blood of other races, and the other races also had Han blood. It is impossible to find a pure race. Especially the Han race. According to legend, when Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, "If the feudal lords use the rites of the Yi, they should be Yi; if the Yi and Di advance to China, they should be Chinese." He only recognized the similarity of culture and not the difference of bloodline. Later generations also accepted this view, so anyone who was willing to join could be accepted, and their bloodline was particularly complex. Therefore, we can further say that we only have an awareness of national culture and no prejudice against racial bloodlines. We have long had a very advanced nationalism.

Unfortunately, in order to facilitate separate rule, the Manchu Qing Dynasty strictly implemented a policy of alienating the various races. They could not marry each other, nor could they travel, which made their feelings very alienated. Many unequal laws were also established, and many unequal treatments were imposed, forcing strong suspicion and hatred among the various races. Originally a family, they were separated by the political tactics of the Qing Dynasty, so the residences of the four races surrounding the Central Plains clearly demarcated their boundaries, and the view of race gradually became strong. After the founding of the Republic of China, there should have been an opportunity for integration. However, because the general public had been obstructed for more than two hundred years, they were too indifferent to this issue and could not create public opinion. The government was too busy dealing with internal and external troubles and could not pay special attention to this aspect. Even today, the alienation and suspicion between each other have not been eliminated. However, the encroachment and annexation of powerful enemies no longer allow us to ignore it. If we want to promote nationalism, we must enable the various races in the country to achieve a state of cooperation.

When I say this, people living in the inland areas may not feel the urgency of this need. In fact, the Chinese people lack common sense in this area. A Mongolian youth once complained to me, saying, "When we go to the inland areas to study, classmates often ask me, 'What are the differences between your Mongolian customs and our Chinese customs?' They don't think that Mongolia is part of China!" I only felt ashamed when I heard this. Students are like this, let alone others! This attitude of taking the Han people as the standard of China and excluding other races from China is naturally most likely to arouse the uneasiness of other races. Imperialist countries know that the feelings between our various races are too alienated, so they use deceptive means to carry out divisive movements. Therefore, they use various opportunities to forcibly seize our territory and establish a certain country; they also use money to buy off traitors in our country and do everything possible to disrupt and brew the organization of a certain country. The Han people are careless, the other races are fooled, and the enemy reaps huge profits without any effort. If we do not take precautions and prevent future hidden worries, it is foreseeable that the lively races in our country will successively become dull puppets and perish together!

Among the various races in the country, the Han race naturally has the highest culture, occupies a leading position, and assumes the responsibility of guidance. However, it is natural that the older brother has more knowledge than the younger brothers, and there is no reason to be proud. Moreover, if the Han people reflect on themselves, they have no reason to be ashamed. May I ask, do the Han people have the fervent faith of the Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan people who sacrifice everything for religion? Do the Han people have the martial spirit of the Mongolian and Hui people who are good at riding and shooting and can eat and sleep on horseback? Do the Han people have the asceticism of the Hui people who abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and other addictions? These habits are the driving force for the revival of our nation and are invaluable. The culture of the Han people is indeed brilliant and admirable, but when the bottom layer is uncovered, there is only the "retreating" thinking of the Huang-Lao school, which leads to only seeking enjoyment, unwilling to sacrifice, only caring about personal and family interests, and not knowing society. The national spirit has reached an extremely precarious point. We are still in time to absorb the strengths of other races, so how can we use arrogant eyes to look at people!

If we Han people can use equal eyes and compassion to look at the various races in the country, and if we can recognize the needs of the times to awaken their national emotions, then we should thoroughly abolish the misconception of "appendages," and do our best to enhance mutual understanding, so that the various races in the country can truly unite and become a solid nation. In other words, we must not only unite in name, nor can we force unity under private interests and pressure, but we must achieve sincere unity in sympathy and cooperation: we must live in mutual peace in order to exist together and achieve an independent and free position in the world.

How can we unite? I think there should be preliminary work in the following three aspects.

First, in terms of material, is economic construction. The poverty of the people in the border areas is an undeniable fact, but the border areas are full of undeveloped resources. Not to mention that minerals are still hidden in the mountains, the livestock that the people in the area rely on for a living often die in entire groups due to the lack of medical equipment. After slaughter, bones, horns, fur, and feathers are discarded all over the ground, preventing materials from being used to their full potential. We should encourage agricultural and industrial experts to go to the border areas to guide the local people to improve production technology so that they can develop on their own. Inconvenient transportation is also a major reason hindering development. Today, it is far more difficult for us to go to Xinjiang and Tibet than it is to go to Europe and the United States. How can we seek production cooperation in this way? Therefore, railway, highway, waterway, aviation, postal and telecommunications networks should be established in order to circulate information and facilitate transportation throughout the country, and to reap the benefits of regional specialization.

Second, in terms of spirit, is cultural construction. Each race has its own unique culture, and full mutual understanding must be sought. The first thing to pay attention to is the introduction of language and writing. The four languages ​​of Han, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan are all national languages ​​used in the Republic of China today and should not be neglected. Schools in Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan areas should focus on local languages ​​and writing, supplemented by Chinese. Schools in the interior should focus on Chinese, supplemented by Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan languages. We must not only preserve local languages ​​and writing, but also develop local literature and art and enrich their intellectual heritage. Only in this way can the various different cultural elements in the country understand the various cultures in other cultural groups.

Third, in terms of administration, is the granting of positions to talents from the border areas and the removal of the corrupt forces of the old Han people. Are there no talented children in the border areas? It's just that they are far from the central government and cannot be known to the government. If we can establish more schools due to the development of resources in the border areas (schools that do not violate their customs, religions, and social organizations), then it will be like land that has just been reclaimed. Due to the abundance of soil, great production will be obtained, and it can be asserted that special talents will emerge. As for the corrupt forces of the old Han people, they disregard the overall interests of the country, exploit the inadequate protection of local people by national laws, bully the good, exploit heavy profits, and fraudulently obtain goods, without exception. They are an obstacle to cooperation and must be removed. Otherwise, the local people will forever misunderstand that the Han people are seeking private interests and look at us with suspicion. Our sincere cooperation will not be able to gain their trust.

The unity of the Chinese nation is a major issue. The purpose of this article is only to arouse the attention of the Chinese people to this aspect. A detailed plan cannot be fully explained in a single article. I hope that everyone will always keep this issue in mind, discuss it together, and deal with the current urgent situation.

### German Troops from Spanish Morocco Invade

France Protests to Spanish Rebels and Exchanges Views with the British Government

Rabat, French Morocco: According to reliable sources, approximately two to three hundred German soldiers have landed separately in various ports in Spanish Morocco. (Havas, 8th)

Casablanca, French Morocco: It is learned that in the past ten days, a large number of German troops have landed at the port of Melilla in Spanish Morocco and are stationed there. These German troops are fully armed and in uniform. In addition, three German destroyers and several submarines are anchored in the port. A number of German engineers and specialized workers have also arrived at the recently opened iron mine in the same region. (Havas, 8th)

[London] According to various sources, Germany is undertaking significant activities in Spanish Morocco, North Africa. The British and French governments are exchanging views on this matter. Foreign Secretary Eden had a lengthy conversation with the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin. It is generally believed that Corbin informed Eden of various disquieting news obtained from Paris, stating that a large number of Germans had arrived in Spanish Morocco, setting up new barracks, procuring military supplies, and preparing to build fortifications along the coast of Ceuta. The French Consul in Tetouan, the capital of Spanish Morocco, in the name of the French Resident General in Morocco, has already made representations to the local authorities, requesting them to take note that the landing of foreign troops in Morocco is not permitted under current international treaties. (Havas, 8th)

[London] The British and French governments have been exchanging information on this matter for more than two months. Yesterday, the British Cabinet held a meeting, paying particular attention to the recent developments in the Spanish situation. It is reported that France's concerns are largely due to the propaganda of Germany and Italy among the Moroccan natives. This propaganda has given the Spanish Moroccans a hope that they will gain more, and perhaps even achieve autonomy, if Spain is ruled by the Nationalist forces. This has also caused unrest in French Morocco. The British government is currently considering the matter and awaiting further information from its own sources, but does not view the matter as particularly serious. (Reuters, 9th)

[London] This afternoon, members of the Cabinet who were in London convened another meeting at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street to continue discussing the Spanish situation. (Reuters, 9th)

[Paris] According to official sources tonight, the French government has made representations to the Spanish Nationalist authorities, asking them to take note of the 1912 Morocco Treaty signed between France and Spain, which stipulates that France and Spain mutually guarantee that no foreign troops are allowed to enter Moroccan territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received reports that the Spanish Moroccan authorities had planned to build barracks to house German troops. Therefore, the French government made the aforementioned representations to the Nationalist authorities. (Havas, 8th)

[Berlin] Well-informed sources say that the various rumors from the French side are too absurd and do not require formal denial. Their purpose is merely to influence world public opinion. At the same time, it is reported that the Oldenburg-Portuguese Shipping Company of Hamburg, Germany, has decided to extend its route to Morocco and plans to stop at various ports in Algeria. (Reuters, 9th)

### French Government Orders Expansion of Troops Stationed in Morocco to Wartime Strength

French Navy to Conduct Maneuvers off the Coast of Africa; German Troop Presence in Morocco Violates Treaties

[Paris] The French government today ordered the expansion of troops stationed in Morocco to wartime strength to prevent emergencies. (National News Agency, 9th)

[Paris] The Ministry of the Navy has just issued a public statement saying that the Atlantic and Mediterranean French naval fleets will conduct their customary winter exercises in mid-January each year. These exercises will be held along the Mediterranean coast of French Africa and the west coast of Africa. Therefore, warships are frequently moving in and out of French ports, but this is an annual event and should not be considered unusual. (Havas, 9th)

[Paris] Regarding the matter of German activities in Spanish Morocco, the French government made representations to the Spanish Nationalist authorities yesterday. According to responsible sources, the French government's representations are based on the treaty between France and Spain of October 3, 1904, the treaty between France and Morocco of 1912, and the agreement between France and Spain of 1912, declaring that the stationing of German troops in Spanish Morocco violates the above treaties. The 1904 Franco-Spanish treaty stipulates that in the event of military action, the French and Spanish governments should notify each other and that neither country should appeal to foreign governments. The 1912 Franco-Moroccan treaty stipulates that Morocco is a French protectorate, but allows a part of Moroccan territory to be designated as a Spanish sphere of influence. As for the 1912 Franco-Spanish agreement, one section states as follows: "The Spanish government guarantees that it will not transfer or relinquish all or part of the Spanish sphere of influence in Morocco, even temporarily." Responsible sources said that the various facts that have given rise to the French representations clearly violate the aforementioned treaties. (Havas, 9th)

[Paris] "L'Intransigeant" recently published a dispatch from Rabat, French Morocco, stating that the German government intends to establish three German naval bases in Spanish Morocco: (1) Ifni, where a submarine base will be established, protected by 30,000 soldiers; (2) White Beach, on the coast of Spanish Río de Oro, which will serve as a seaplane base; and (3) Villa Cisneros, which will also be assigned to Germany by the Spanish Nationalist authorities. The report also said that Germany is conducting extensive propaganda among the tribes in southern French Morocco, inciting them to revolt against France. In addition, since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, France has closed its northern Moroccan border, and the abandoned commercial markets have been taken over by the German commercial delegation in Spanish Morocco and monopolized by Germany. The report also stated that a Fascist rifle association with anti-French tendencies has been established in the Tetouan area of Spanish Morocco. Furthermore, German Zeppelins often fly low over Spanish Morocco, and several German warships frequently patrol the neutral port of Tangier, where they unload military supplies. (Havas, 9th)

### The Moroccan Question Becomes Serious Again; British and French Newspapers Express Unease

[London] Regarding the entry of German troops into Spanish Morocco, North Africa, the newspapers have expressed unease. The Times correspondent in Paris stated: "According to extraordinarily reliable sources, a large number of German troops are about to arrive there, roughly on Sunday. Although the French government is unlikely to take drastic action to restore the status quo, maintaining the integrity of the territory is in France's vital interests, and the French government will naturally respond accordingly." The diplomatic correspondent of the Manchester Guardian stated: "It is generally believed that even if the Spanish government forces win, they will not be able or willing to restore Morocco. The Moroccan question, which affected the European situation before the European War, has reappeared in another form. British and French figures have long been aware of German activities in Spanish Morocco, but thought they would not quickly lead to a serious situation. Whether this issue will deteriorate further depends on the outcome of the Spanish Civil War and Germany's attitude." (Havas, 9th)

[Paris] The newspapers have commented on the stationing of German troops in Spanish Morocco, North Africa, saying that "the Agadir Crisis of 1911 has been revisited today." (Note: Agadir is a Moroccan port. In 1911, Germany sent the gunboat "Panther" there to protect German interests, causing a great shock in France and endangering European peace.) An article published by the famous reporter Bertin of the Paris Echo adequately expresses the general sentiment, stating: "The German gunboat's voyage to the port of Agadir has not been forgotten. Now Germany is replaying the old drama in another way. If it gains a foothold in North Africa, it will be very satisfied with its prospects. The minerals of the Triff region are insignificant in the eyes of the Germans. What they hope for is to win over the local tribes and oppress French Morocco and Algeria, and to redistribute the colonies as requested by the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr. Schacht. The French government made a big mistake in July last year, when the Spanish Civil War broke out, by not demonstrating its strength or clearly declaring its intention to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean situation. Now the French Atlantic fleet has sailed to Spanish waters to conduct exercises, and the Minister of State and Minister of National Defense, Daladier, will also visit French Morocco to inspect the defenses. These steps are a warning. If this is not enough, then the British and French should blockade Spain and its territories by land and sea. If not, the communications of the British and French in the Mediterranean will be threatened, and when the European situation changes, they will not be able to cope with it." (Havas, 9th)

### German and Italian Soldiers Arrive in Spain

Incessantly

Gibraltar: According to travelers who recently arrived here from the port of Cádiz, groups of uniformed German and Italian soldiers are disembarking at the port almost daily. Their ships do not display ship names and do not fly national flags. (Reuters, 9th)

Gibraltar: It is reported that another 3,500 Italian troops landed in Cádiz, Spain, today and have taken trains to Seville. (National News Agency, 8th)

[London] The Manchester Guardian reports that as thousands of Italian volunteer soldiers are landing in Cádiz, southern Spain, a commercial air route has been opened between Rome and Cádiz, with three round trips per week, with stops at Mallorca in the Spanish Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean and Melilla in Spanish Morocco, North Africa. Since its opening, the planes departing from Rome have been filled with Italian industrialists and experts from military and political circles traveling to Spain. (Havas, 9th)

### Trotsky Arrives in Mexico

Tampico, Mexico: Leon Trotsky, the head of the anti-Stalinist faction of the Soviet Communist Party, who was granted permission by the Mexican authorities to move from Sweden to Mexico, arrived here at 8:15 this morning. (Havas, 8th)

### British Secretary for Trade Departs for the United States

Official Confirmation Still Pending

[Washington] The news that the British Secretary for Trade, Runciman, has sailed from Glasgow to the United States has attracted significant attention here today, but officials cannot confirm Runciman's arrival. Runciman's visit may be related to the conclusion of a trade agreement between Britain and the United States. It is reported that the preliminary talks on the agreement have been satisfactory, although the two sides have not yet reached a final stage. However, U.S. Secretary of State Hull will return to the United States from Buenos Aires on the 14th of this month, which may lead to a satisfactory outcome. (Reuters, 9th)

### Roosevelt Announces Construction of Two Battleships

Each of 35,000 Tons, Costing $100 Million

[Washington] President Roosevelt's proposed budget for 1938, submitted to Congress today, has a military expenditure that breaks all previous peacetime records. The budget stipulates $587,302,600 for the Navy Department, $399,460,400 for the Army Department, and $34,828,200 for the Army Department's non-military expenses. River and harbor fees total $143,322,101. In total, defense expenditures will exceed $1,000,000,000. The largest expenditures are for recruiting new troops, adding aircraft, and building warships. In the previous budget, the Navy Department's expenses were $391,424,149, and the Army Department's expenses were $373,014,977. The Navy Department's new expenses will be used to add two battleships, as announced by President Roosevelt, increase naval personnel, continue construction of two aircraft carriers, one heavy cruiser, three light cruisers, twenty destroyers, four submarines, and two gunboats. The ships currently under construction include twelve destroyers, six submarines, and two super battleships. As for the new warships, President Roosevelt stated today that they are only intended to replace the old battleships Arkansas and Texas. (National News Agency, 8th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt told reporters that the United States currently has three battleships, the Arkansas (26,000 tons), the New York, and the Texas (both 27,000 tons), which have been in service for more than 26 years. The construction of two new 35,000-ton battleships is underway to replace them, with an estimated cost of approximately $50 million per ship. He also said that at last year's London Naval Conference, the United States proposed to keep these obsolete warships for several more years before scrapping them, but this proposal was not accepted by the Naval Conference. On the contrary, various countries have recently built new battleships, such as Britain building two, France three, Italy two, and Germany three. The United States should not lag behind. The designs for the new battleships have already been drawn, but it is not yet known whether the caliber of their guns will be 14 inches or 16 inches. (Havas, 8th)

### Italian Budget

[Rome] The government has decided on the budget for 1937-38 today, estimating a shortfall of approximately 3,172,000,000 lire. (The current year's budget is estimated to have a surplus of 20,442,000 lire.) Revenue is estimated at 20,596,000,000 lire, and expenditures at 23,769,000,000 lire. Expenditures for education, public works, and the army, navy, and air force have all increased, with the largest increase for the colonial department, probably due to the need to carry out public works in Abyssinia. The 1936-37 budget was balanced largely by eliminating the usual shortfall of the state-owned railways. (Reuters, 9th)

### British Embassy in Madrid Bombed; Britain Protests to the Rebels

Rebels Continue to Make Progress in Attacking the Capital; Women in Barcelona Demand Bread

[London] Spanish Nationalist aircraft flew to Madrid yesterday morning and bombed the city. A bomb hit the British Consulate. The government has lodged a protest with the Nationalist authorities over this incident. (Havas, 9th)

Madrid: Several Nationalist aircraft bombed the British Embassy today, dropping four incendiary bombs that hit the roof of the building. The Army Attaché, Captain Lance, and Mrs. Mallory, a British national, were injured. Another incendiary bomb hit the residence of the British acting consul, Mr. Millan, and his wife escaped unharmed. Trees in front of the American Embassy were also uprooted by the bombs. (National News Agency, 8th)

Madrid: After the British Embassy staff moved to Valencia, the embassy building was only used to store food. Today, a bomb dropped by a Nationalist aircraft hit the building, injuring three people: Captain Lance, a British Army attaché; Mrs. Norris, a British national who was discussing matters with Lance; and the embassy cook. It is reported that several incendiary bombs landed in the so-called neutral zone. (Reuters, 8th)

Madrid: Nationalist aircraft flew to the capital twice this morning, at 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM, and bombed the city intensely. Last night, many residents spent the night in the streets for fear of Nationalist aircraft attacking at night, while others fled to the suburbs and hid in the fields. (Havas, 9th)

Avila: The city of Aravaca, northwest of Madrid, is strategically important and not easy to conquer. The Nationalist forces launched a major offensive half a month ago, but failed. In the past three days, they have been constantly bombarding it with artillery in preparation for another offensive. Yesterday, they launched two fierce attacks. Although the government forces resisted vigorously, the city fell at noon. As a result, the Nationalist forces can control the entire area along the Manzanares River west of the capital, as well as the towns and villages north of the capital, and threaten the main road to Burgos. All the residents of the northern suburbs were shocked, and refugees gathered in the village of Fuencarral, which is also being approached by the troops commanded by General Mola, the Nationalist commander in the north. In addition, the Nationalist forces now have unobstructed access to the transportation line between the Casa de Campo park, the university district, and the Puerta de Hierro on the western outskirts of Madrid. (Havas, 9th)

Perpignan: According to news received here, a riot occurred in Barcelona today as women carrying infants stormed the city. These women marched from empty bread shops to the Catalan Autonomous Region Food Committee office, shouting slogans demanding bread. The demonstrators then sent representatives to demand that the authorities stop the infighting and provide bread. Fearing that the riot would escalate and lead to looting, the authorities told the rioters that food was already being transported to various places and that bread coupons would be issued next week.

### Germany Confiscates Two Spanish Ships

Spanish Government Asks Britain to Investigate; Rebels Repeatedly Detain Foreign Ships

[Berlin] Germany has confiscated the Spanish ships Aragón and Mata Chica, in retaliation for the Spanish government's detention of cargo and passengers on the German ship Palos. Germany now intends to sell the two ships, and the proceeds may be given to the Nationalist forces to compensate for the detained cargo on the Palos and to console the families of the detained passengers. According to official statements, the sailors of the two ships will be returned to the Spanish government, probably sent to ports under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government, and then transferred to Spanish ships. (Reuters, 9th)

[London] The Spanish Ambassador to Britain, Yanguas, has informed the Foreign Office that the Spanish government is prepared to submit the issue of the nature of the cargo detained on the German freighter Palos to the Non-Intervention Committee for investigation to determine whether it is indeed military supplies. If the Committee determines that it is not military supplies, then the Spanish government will return the detained cargo to Germany. (Havas, 8th)

[Moscow] According to news received here, the Soviet ship Rosenberg, carrying coal from Rotterdam to Italy, was intercepted by a rebel minesweeper on January 6 while passing through the Strait of Gibraltar and escorted to Ceuta for a thorough search before being released.

### British Cabinet Discusses German and Italian Replies

Continuing Diplomatic Negotiations

[London] The cabinet convened an emergency meeting today to discuss the serious situation caused by the Italian and German military aid to the Spanish Nationalist forces and the German troops' deep penetration into Spanish Morocco. It is reported that Britain and France may demand a promise from Germany to respect the territorial integrity of Spanish Morocco. The cabinet also discussed the replies from Italy and Germany regarding the Anglo-French proposal to prevent volunteers from going to Spain. According to a Foreign Office spokesman, Britain believes that the plan to stop volunteers from going to Spain should be discussed first. Although Germany has requested that this issue be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee for handling, Britain still advocates seeking a solution through direct diplomatic channels. (8th National Telegram)

[London] Prime Minister Baldwin convened a meeting of cabinet members currently in London this afternoon to discuss the issue of prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain. They studied the situation regarding the prohibition of volunteers after the replies from Germany and Italy were received. They believe that the replies from the two countries did not close the door to negotiations; on the contrary, they have already provided a basis for concrete proposals. However, according to informed sources, the replies from Germany and Italy did not directly address the issues raised by Britain and France. Therefore, the general public is now hoping that the British and French governments will reach an agreement and immediately begin diplomatic action to continue direct negotiations with the governments of the countries concerned, so that all these countries can understand the need to immediately establish an agreement regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteers, and no longer delay.

### French-Turkish Dispute

Turkey Proposes a Solution

Istanbul: Turkish President Kemal, after going to Konya in southern Anatolia to discuss the French-Turkish dispute with senior officials, will return here tonight. The dispute between the two countries arose because France allowed Syria to become independent. Turkey is deeply concerned that after Syria's independence, the status of the Turkish minority in Alexandretta and Antioch will be affected, hence the disagreement. The tense situation between the two countries has now eased, as the two countries have resumed negotiations, and France's proposal to postpone the League of Nations Council meeting scheduled for January 18 has also been helpful. (8th Reuters Telegram)

[Paris] Turkish President Kemal today demanded that the Alexandretta region be excluded from the territory of independent Syria. As relations between France and Turkey have become strained, the Turkish Ambassador to France visited Foreign Minister Viénot today, prompting the latter to declare that France intends to resolve the case peacefully. (8th National Telegram)

Turkish Capital: When French Deputy Foreign Minister Viénot held talks with Turkish Ambassador to France Suad on the 7th of this month regarding the issue of the Turkish minority in Antioch and Alexandretta in Syria, he asked the ambassador to submit a solution as soon as possible. Informed sources have recently announced that this plan was delivered by the ambassador to the French government yesterday afternoon. (9th Havas Telegram)

Turkish Capital: Foreign Minister Rüştü is scheduled to invite members of the National People's Party (the ruling party) of the parliament this afternoon to report on the talks between Viénot and Suad, and to inform the members of the content of the new note sent by the Turkish government to the French government yesterday.

Pro-Turkish radicals in this area held a strike this morning, and all shops opened by Turks were closed. More than a thousand Syrian students held a counter-demonstration in front of the residences of the observers, singing Syrian songs and holding Syrian flags, and the situation was very enthusiastic. The French authorities came forward to restore order, and the students immediately returned to school in formation. (9th Havas Telegram)

### US Maritime Workers' Strike Nears Resolution

More Than Eighty-Eight Thousand Auto Workers on Strike

[San Francisco] Negotiations on the Pacific Coast labor strike are progressing smoothly. Shipping Association President Prentis issued a statement today saying that the resolution of the strike is not far away. The negotiations in the past few days have shown that both labor and management can act in good faith and with a fair spirit, which proves that peace is just around the corner. (9th National Telegram)

Detroit: The auto workers' strike has expanded again. Five thousand one hundred workers at Cadillac Motor Car Company joined the strike today. The Chevrolet Gear and Axle plant announced that eight thousand people would strike at 5:00 pm, and four thousand five hundred will act in unison at 1:00 am tomorrow. Five hundred people at the Michigan Gear and Axle plant also went on strike. According to the General Motors Company authorities, as of tomorrow, the number of striking workers will reach 88,000. (8th National Telegram)

Detroit: Since the start of the U.S. auto industry strike, the number of striking workers has reached 76,000. There was a minor clash between police and strikers in Flint, Michigan today, and the situation is deteriorating. Police in the area are now stationed with tear gas. At the same time, some workers at several factories have passed an anti-strike resolution and have organized an anti-strike group. After the addition of five more factories to the strike list yesterday and the failure of negotiations to break the deadlock, there is little hope for an early resolution of the dispute.

### Impact of Japanese Exchange Control

[Tokyo] Trade in early January is the first step of the year. Usually, there are 60 to 70 million yuan of exports per ten-day period, but this ten-day period only saw 15.9 million yuan. Imports were also only 28.3 million yuan, which is very little compared to the usual 70 to 80 million yuan per ten-day period. However, the trade volume in the first ten days of each month cannot be generalized. It is meaningless to compare it with the same period last year, and it is not possible to use this single ten-day period as a standard for predicting this year's trade. However, depending on the authorities' handling of the Ministry of Finance order strengthening exchange control, which came into effect on the 8th, the trade situation will inevitably be affected. Japan's trade from now on will inevitably be slightly different from what it was before, which is predictable. However, the overall trend will inevitably be the same as last year, continuing the trend of decreasing exports and increasing imports, without a doubt. (9th Allied Telegram)

### New Trends in North China Diplomacy

The Authorities Decide to Start Negotiations to Abolish the East Hebei Problem, and Have Already Ordered Chen Zhongfu and Others to Conduct Informal Talks

Tianjin Correspondence: Since the New Year, the general situation in North China has been renewed with the changing seasons. The local area is peaceful, and people's sentiments remain the same. Although various institutions of friendly nations stationed in North China seem to be working tirelessly and progressing rapidly, most of their plans are still hidden and have not yet surfaced. In recent days, only two things are worthy of attention: one is that on the 8th of this month, the North China Garrison Army of Japan, with the 1st Regiment Mutaguchi and the 2nd Regiment Higashijima as the center, united with various special forces soldiers and held a New Year's military parade at Limingzhuang Airport in the suburbs of Tianjin and Fengtai Railway Station. Each site had about 3,000 participating infantry, cavalry, artillery, and chemical warfare troops, commanded by Mutaguchi and Kayashima. The commander of the Japanese army, Tashiro, was in Tianjin, so the brigade commander, Kawabe, went to Fengtai to serve as the reviewing officer. At the same time, foreign guests were also invited. All Japanese veterans, volunteer corps, youth groups, and national defense women's associations in Tianjin, Fengtai, and other places in the Pingjin area participated. This is an unprecedented event in previous years. Whether it is a demonstration or a display of military force is unknown. The second is the expansion of the puppet organization in East Hebei into a puppet anti-communist government. After the resolution of the Shaanxi Incident, the only work of the Kwantung and North China armies of Japan has been focused on this. Within the New Year, Staff Officer Zenda of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, acting on Tashiro's orders, went to Tongzhou to visit traitor Yin Rugeng for negotiations. On the 5th of this month, Chief of Staff Hashimoto of the North China Garrison Army and Second Section Chief Wachi went to Ping to attend Song Zheyuan's New Year's banquet and also made a trip to Tongzhou. The head of the Special Service Agency in Ping, Matsui Takuro, accompanied them. On the same day, there were consultations with that side. On the 6th, the military attachés of Japan stationed in Jinan, Ishino, and Qingdao, Tanigaki, were summoned to Tianjin. A meeting was held at the Japanese Army Headquarters in Haiguang Temple, chaired by Tashiro, to study the affairs of supporting the expansion of the puppet organization in East Hebei and decided to take consistent action with the Kwantung Army Headquarters. Recently, anti-communist and anti-communist leaflets signed by certain groups have been found in Tianjin, and the wording is very激烈激烈, which is a response from certain parties supporting various puppet organizations and the puppet government of East Hebei, vainly hoping to realize their plans.

Last year, the Hebei-Chahar authorities suffered a heavy impact in terms of diplomacy, economy, taxation, and administration due to the failure to abolish the puppet organization in East Hebei. In the first half of last year, when Xiao Zhenying had not left office, he tried hard to negotiate the abolition of the puppet organization. After Xiao left, this issue was put aside. This year, the situation in North China is peaceful, and the authorities feel that the government's strength is sufficient to be a backing, so they are determined to raise the old matter again and demand the abolition of the puppet government in East Hebei. On the 4th of this month, Chen Zhongfu came to Tianjin on Song Zheyuan's orders to wish Tashiro and Hashimoto a happy New Year and incidentally expressed this intention. That side naturally did not want to talk, but the authorities are determined to overcome all difficulties and discuss this matter. When Hashimoto and Wachi were in Ping a few days ago, the authorities also made slight expressions during the banquet. In the view of the authorities, both the Hebei and Chahar negotiations must be negotiated, but because of the meaning of it being easier to break alone, Hebei is given priority over Chahar. Chen Zhongfu and Chen Juesheng are ordered to make contact from both the front and the side, and it is planned to first consult with Matsui, the head of the Special Service Agency stationed in Ping, and then formally propose negotiations to the Japanese Army Headquarters after there are signs. The Chahar matter belongs to the scope of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and in the future it is planned to contact that side directly through the introduction of the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin. In short, the authorities, in view of the impact of the existence of the puppet East Hebei in the past year and the description of a certain party's request for the clarification of political power, must abolish the puppet organization this year and then finish. (7th)

### Hong Kong Government Sends Police to Demolish Houses in Kowloon City

Britain Has Long Been Deeply Concerned About Operating Kowloon, and the Residents of Kowloon City Are Rising Up to Call for Help

Guangzhou Correspondence: The sovereignty of Kowloon City has recently become a major diplomatic issue, which has attracted the attention of Chinese people. Kowloon is adjacent to the land of Bao'an County in Guangdong Province. Since Kowloon was ceded to Britain, the Hong Kong government has worked hard to operate it. Hong Kong is an isolated island, and only the coastal area is a gathering place for shops. Except for a few major roads, it is mountainous and can only be developed as a residential area, and it cannot fully develop industry and commerce. Kowloon is separated from Hong Kong by the sea, which can be crossed by a single reed. It is connected to the mainland of Guangdong Province. Nearby villages provide food and fresh water (Hong Kong lacks fresh water, and drinking water is supplied by reservoirs using rainwater for daily use). Therefore, after the British government ceded Kowloon, it jointly operated the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway with our country. At present, the terminal of the British section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is in Kowloon. In recent years, huge factories and warehouses in Hong Kong have been mostly set up in Kowloon. The British regard Kowloon as nothing less than the lifeline of Hong Kong. Recently, the north-south traffic of the Yuehan Railway has been opened, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways are planned to be connected. When the connection is completed in the future, Kowloon will become the southern terminus of the Yuehan Railway, which is also the southern terminus of the north-south artery of our country. Its position is even more important than Hong Kong. The British, with their keen and far-sighted eyes, attach great importance to Kowloon, which is almost deeply concerned.

Although "Kowloon" and "Kowloon City" are in the same place, there are historical relations and sovereignty differences between them. When Kowloon was ceded in the Qing Dynasty, Qing officials, for the sake of national face, tried hard to fight for a small plot of land to build a castle, with officials stationed there, to show the country that there was still the good name of Kowloon's national territory. At that time, the British, having ceded Kowloon and almost all of it, were willing to return Kowloon City, which was only more than 20 miles away, to China. The establishment of Kowloon City was in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, about 80 years ago. There are more than 400 residents in the city, with 60 or 70 households, a primary school, and a classroom and a temple each. Most of the residents are middle- and upper-class families engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, and they do business in Hong Kong and Nanyang. Our country's rule over Kowloon City is recorded in the treaty signed between China and Britain in June 1898, and it has been safe and without difference. The British, seeing that Kowloon will become the terminus of land transportation in South China, and there is great potential for development, are thinking about annexing Kowloon City to complete their ideal plan, so they disregard the treaty and, on the pretext that Kowloon City is within the ceded area of Kowloon, say that the Chinese flag flying in Kowloon City is an obstacle to the Hong Kong government's public security and administrative power, and declare that the Chinese sovereignty of the city must be abolished. Then, in October of last year, they forcibly sent British police to demolish houses in Kowloon City. At that time, the residents of the city strongly opposed it and sent telegrams to the Guangdong-Guangxi Diplomatic Office asking them to protest to Britain. At that time, the Hong Kong government temporarily suspended the demolition project due to the diplomatic negotiations raised by our diplomatic authorities and the resistance of the residents.

Unexpectedly, at the end of last year (December 29, 1936), the South Yau Ma Tei Civil Affairs Office of British Hong Kong suddenly sent two British policemen and several workers to Kowloon City and forcibly demolished the house at No. 25. The owner, Yang Weixiong, bare-handed, was unable to stop it and had to lead his family of old and weak people away from their ancestral home in tears. The neighborhood was threatened by imminent disaster and immediately set up the Kowloon City Case Support Association. On the one hand, they immediately telegraphed the Guangdong-Guangxi Diplomatic Commissioner's Office to complain, and on the other hand, they sent representatives Yang Weixiong and Lu Zhang to Yue on December 30 to pay respects to the Diplomatic Commissioner Diao Zuqian and the Chairman of Guangdong Province, Huang Musong, asking them to immediately negotiate with the other party to maintain national territory and protect sovereignty. Diao promised to first ask the British Consul in Guangzhou to consult the Kowloon Civil Affairs Office and first stop demolishing civilian houses. The reason is based on the British Ambassador to China's reply, stating that there will be no more forced relocation of Kowloon City residents in the future. The sudden forced demolition is a clear violation of the agreement. One party also telegraphed the British Ambassador to China, urging them to respect our country's sovereignty over the administration of Kowloon City. The two representatives, Lu and Yang, then separately asked the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and overseas Chinese groups for unified support. The Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Office sent two officials to Kowloon City to comfort the refugees. In addition to sending telegrams to support them in March, overseas Chinese groups convened a meeting on the 4th to discuss rescue measures. The Diplomatic Commissioner's Office will also send personnel to Kowloon City to investigate the truth of the demolished houses and collect materials for preparing for negotiations.

### Shuyang County Cracks Down on a Traitor Organization

Many Reactionary Exhibits Were Seized, and More Than Twenty Traitors Were Arrested

Haizhou Correspondence: On the evening of the 1st of this month, while all sectors of Shuyang County were holding a lantern parade, the county government suddenly received a secret report that traitors were plotting to take advantage of the opportunity to riot. County Magistrate Qi Lunji quickly ordered the business group and militia team to strictly guard against it. At the same time, he sent Rong, the chief of the first district, and many police officers from the Public Security Bureau to search various places inside and outside the city. Soon, 3,000 talismans were found in the house of a farmer surnamed Ye outside the North Gate. The words "Sworn Brotherhood" were written on the talismans, and a red seal was affixed in the middle. The seal text was "Longevity King Electric" in four characters. A white cloth flag was also found, with a five-colored circle on it and the word "順" (obedience) written on it. In addition, many password strips and more than 2,000 yuan of paper money from the Bank of China were also found. The password was the two words "天意" (Heaven's Will). Chief Rong then captured Ye and took him to the county government along with the exhibits. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau successively arrested more than 20 traitors in various places. It is heard that several traitors have also been arrested in various districts in the surrounding countryside in recent days.

### Songjiang

Commissioner's Office Holds Nine-County Conference

Detailed resolutions and concrete measures were made on all items.

Please Extend the Student Fee Payment Period

Citizens Xu Shiqi, Jun Dai Lian Zhang, and others believe that the start of the second semester of the 25th academic year of famous schools is at the time of the Lunar New Year. According to the regulations, students can only obtain class cards by paying fees at the prescribed rate; otherwise, they will not be allowed to attend classes. My country's production is backward and people's livelihood is poor. The Lunar New Year is the general end of all income and expenditure. The parents of poor children are trying to put together a collection to settle their debts so that they can make a spring turnaround. How can they have the surplus power to pay for their children's education? If they are not flexible, they will miss the opportunity for their children to study. What can the parents bear? Some parents of students are rich, but poor people are still in the majority, and many of them are suffering personally. They jointly presented a petition to the Provincial Education Department asking for flexibility so that the schools can collect fees in one month so that the schools' finances will not be hindered too much and poor parents will have the opportunity for economic turnaround and will not be put in a desperate situation.

Severe Weather Brings Auspicious Snow

The weather in this county has been warm in recent days. On the morning of the 8th, the humidity dropped sharply, and the weather was severe. It snowed at around 10:00 a.m., and the roofs were white in an instant, turning into a crystal world.

### Jiading

The Gun Used by the Bandit Was Borrowed from the Police Station

The Yiyong Team of Anting Town, District 4, captured bandit Hong Di, a Wenzhou native, on the evening of the 4th. He had worked in the County Public Security Bureau and the Waigang Public Security Branch. A pistol was found on him. According to him, it was borrowed from the patrol leader of the Third Branch of the Lou Tang Public Security Bureau in District 5 for the purpose of killing a Yan. The tunnel immediately sent a telegram to inquire about Niu Patrol Xiao of the Lou Tang Branch. Niu was furious when he heard the news and strictly interrogated Zou Baotian, the patrol leader in charge of the pistol. Zou claimed that it was stolen and immediately sent household registration police officer Wu Xun San to go to An to take the gun offender to Lou. The Yiyong team refused and reported it to the County Government, which ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to the case for interrogation.

Two Murder Cases in Nanxiang

Wang Azhao, who sells used goods in Maojiawan, East Market, Nanxiang, and Wang Anfu, who works in the same industry in the same place, severely injured each other on December 26 two years ago. The town's Public Security Bureau has already imposed a fine on the matter. However, on the 5th of this month, Wang died of severe injuries and vomiting blood. Wang's wife, Shen, reported the matter to the bureau, and the bureau detained and sent the case to the county. Wang's body is now exposed next to the Ziliu Well awaiting examination. Also, near Nanyuan in the West Market, a corpse was found on the morning of the 8th.

### Changshu

Tobacco and Alcohol Merchants Oppose Tax Increases

The four trades of tobacco, alcohol, etc. here have protested against the tax bureau's increase in license tax and have appointed representatives to petition the party and government organs. Before the matter is resolved, they will uniformly postpone the payment of taxes. The tax amount has always been contracted by merchants according to the amount of the contract. As a result, the tax amount has increased endlessly. The direct victims are small merchants. Due to sluggish business and poor strength, they have closed down one after another. Now that the tax is jointly handled by the Business Tax Bureau, the stall levels have been increased when the tax is levied this season due to the amount relationship. The merchants are indeed unable to compare with the business of the past and are not deliberately resisting taxes. Therefore, the four trades were summoned and Peng Songjiu and Liu Weizu were appointed as representatives to petition the party and government authorities to unanimously oppose the tax increase.

### Wuxi

Petition to Increase Silkworm Seed Prices

Since the provincial government implemented control over silkworm seeds in Jiangsu Province, seed prices have been set by the Silk Management Committee.

Yesterday, it was decided by the industry to submit a petition to the Department of Construction to increase silkworm seed prices in order to maintain business.

Since the 24th year, the fiscal year has been implemented, stipulating that land tax be collected in two installments each year. The provincial government has repeatedly instructed the county government to strictly urge the collection of the above-mentioned old arrears. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Long began urging collection on December 1st of last year, limiting the completion to five months. The provincial government also sent Dong Chengqi, a member of the Old Tax Clearance Committee, to Wuxi to strictly supervise. Committee Member Dong also concurrently handles the old taxes of Changshu and Taicang counties. The new tax levy for the 25th year of this county is 1.2 million yuan. The first installment levy is 40%, totaling more than 480,000 yuan, of which more than 350,000 yuan has already been collected, which is a good result.

### Hangzhou

Qianjiang Sends Police Escort

The Hangzhou Zhakou Qianjiang Dahua Sanlian Steamship Bureau believes that with the convenience of highways and railways in recent years, shipping has declined sharply. However, people with decent financial means mostly switch to steamboats. Some try to get half-price tickets or borrow the names of military and police agencies to avoid paying fares, leading to repeated disputes. Shipping merchants are suffering greatly. Now the company has recommended directors to the provincial public security bureau, requesting that six volunteer police officers and one special task force leader be assigned to carefully navigate and take care of water security. The bureau has approved this and ordered the 3rd Military Police Inspection Team to dispatch personnel to start work on a specific date.

### Iron City Cup Basketball Closing Ceremony and South China Men's A Championship

South China Defeats Fudan 35-19, South China Leads from Beginning to End

The last act of the Iron City Cup Basketball Tournament was successfully completed yesterday, and the order was very good. South China defeated Fudan to win the Group A championship. Southeast won the first game but lost the second; the Municipal Sports Team A defeated the Faculty of Law to win a championship; Xinmin defeated Chizhong to win the Group B4 championship. The details are as follows:

South China Defeats Fudan

Yin, Han, and Xu of South China had not played for a long time. Yesterday was the first time they played with the official lineup. Yin Guiren had just recovered from a new illness and was slightly weaker, but still scored a lot of points. Kuang Yaoya and Cai Yanxiong worked particularly hard and performed very well. Wang Nanzhen and Han Zhenyuan each did their best, but the whole team still made many mistakes, due to not having played for a long time. Moreover, yesterday's style of play was not as good as the previous day's game against the Xin team, partly because South China's defense was too strict, making it impossible to advance, and partly because they were too cautious, affected by psychology, and missed many throws. Zhou Dayun was not able to perform as desired. The two teams were too stable, so the atmosphere on the court was serious, tense, and not active. The details of the game are as follows:

First Half

South China sent Yin, Han, Kuang, Cai, and Wang; Fudan sent Chuan, Zhou, Qiu, Weng, and Chen. The battle began. For two minutes, neither team scored. Chuan Xiangrui fouled, Wang Nanzhen missed the free throw. Han Zhenyuan rushed into the encirclement and opened the scoring. Zhou Dayun fouled, Cai Binxiong added one point. Han Zhenyuan scored twice, and South China took the lead with 5-0. Fudan called a timeout. Weng Ren'an fouled, Yin Guiren missed both free throws. Fudan still relied on Zhou Dayun's long throw to score two points for the first time, making it 7-6. This was the closest score of the evening. Zhou Dayun and Chen Zongqi fouled in succession. Zhou Dayun was too cautious and missed again. Yin Guiren scored from a long shot, and then Weng Ren'an and Qiu Guangxie successively scored, making it 7-6. This was the closest score of the evening. Zhou Dayun and Chen Zongqi fouled in succession. Yin Guiren missed repeatedly. Then Yin went straight in and scored. Nan Zhen followed suit and succeeded again. Han Zhenyuan was unwilling to be left behind and added another point, making it 14-6, South China leading by eight points. The first half ended with South China leading 18-8.

Second Half

The second half began, and Chen Zongqi rushed in from behind and succeeded. Han Zhenyuan and Kuang Yaoya fouled one after another. Fudan missed completely, being too cautious, which was a pity. Kuang Yaoya scored three points with consecutive throws and penalties. Yin Guiren took time out from his busy schedule to add two points. South China then took the lead by as many as twelve points, with a score of 25-11. After a while, South China made it 31-17. In the last minute, the situation was set. Kuang Yaoya scored two goals in three minutes, and South China won the Group A championship with a score of 35-19.

There were five games yesterday, especially the game between National Goods and Shanghai in the bank group, which was more intense. The two teams had their own strengths in attack and defense. As a result, National Goods, with the help of Dai Linjing and Jia Youliang, and because the former Niu team led 18-10, although they were three points behind in the second half, finally won 28-23. Dai Linjing scored twelve points alone, making a great contribution. However, Zhang Hua, a dark horse in this competition, defeated the defending champion Xiangtai Jia Yan, which can be said to be not easy. The results of each game are as follows:

### The Ten-Point Ping-Pong Scoring Method Has Also Been Studied and Adopted by Japan

The ten-point ping-pong scoring method created by Wang Yi of the Chinese Ping-Pong Research Association, after being approved by the All-China Ping-Pong Promotion Association and unanimously adopted by ping-pong organizations in various places, the Japanese ping-pong community also believes that this method is very reasonable. They immediately studied and repeatedly tried it. Now the highest ping-pong authority in Japan, the Japan Table Tennis Association, has officially decided to announce its adoption. It is reported that ping-pong authorities from all over the country, including Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo, participated in the meeting and discussed and studied it very carefully. As a result, they all considered it satisfactory and regarded it as a reasonable manifestation of progress. Also, the variable time system proposed by Mr. Wang before the National Games two years ago has not yet been officially adopted in our country, but it has been included in the new Japanese rules, stipulating that the maximum time for each game is one hour. If it is not possible to finish within this time, the winner is the one with more points at the time of suspension. Recently, Mr. Meng Tieke, the secretary of the World Ping-Pong Association, also published his opinion in the British Ping-Pong Daily, believing that ping-pong games seem to need to have a time limit, so as not to be extended indefinitely, hindering other games and preventing them from being completed on time.

### Grains

The Future of Rice Prices: Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall; Grain Merchants Smile and Refuse to Sell Easily; the Poor Struggle to Make Ends Meet and Suffer from Expensive Rice

(Hu Nan) Yesterday, more than 30 rice boats from various Hu Nan, Pujiang, and other gangs arrived in Shanghai, with about 6,120 shi of cargo. Among them, there were more than 20 boats of thin rice. Rice sales in Pujiang have been sluggish in recent days, and the stock has gradually increased. The sales floors in this street are also showing a wait-and-see attitude. The other gangs are also waiting and not advancing because the Tianjin market is declining step by step. Only the Qingdao gang handled 700-800 bags of thin rice, resulting in the seller's goods being sold out in a few days, and the market situation is even more deserted. As a result, the market prices of thin rice were reduced by a few cents to a dime, thick japonica rice was cut by half a dime, and Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan and other varieties were not traded. The market is still weak. According to this, the rice stock in Pujiang is increasing day by day, and the sales of "baozi" (rice shipments) have become dull again and again, making it difficult to be optimistic. However, for a year, not only has the Shanghai rice market almost entirely relied on sales to the north, but also the amount of rice from Changzhou and Wuxi transported directly to the north and south of Guangdong without going through Shanghai is even greater than the amount shipped out of Shanghai. In the past month, Shanghai rice merchants have been buying rice from various places in western Zhejiang and transporting it continuously, mostly indica and pointed rice, so the price of coarse indica rice has also risen to about eight yuan. Guangdong is still worried about insufficient rice and is still requesting the exemption of import tariffs on foreign rice to seek relief. Although the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to stabilize rice prices has been established, it has not yet seen any development. The price of thin coarse rice in Suzhou and Songjiang has reached about nine yuan through various means of transportation. This year, agricultural products are all expensive, and the villagers have the ability to wait for the selling price before selling. Therefore, if the price of rice in Shanghai is weak, it may not be difficult for mainland merchants to temporarily store the goods arriving in Shanghai in the mainland to wait for opportunities. Since the supply is scarce, they will not easily sell it until a considerable price is reached. Therefore, observing the changes in the market outlook, it is feared that it will become a situation where it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. In addition, none of the Shanghai grain merchants have failed to increase their prices in the past year. This is due to the implementation of income tax in January of this year, and many of them have made a settlement at the end of the lunar year. Therefore, all kinds of grain firms have been smiling and have made huge profits. In particular, the disclosed surplus of Zhu's firm has reached 200,000-300,000 yuan, and the others can be known. Since the merchants have all benefited, they will also be powerful in secretly maintaining grain prices. As a result, it is not yet known whether the adjustment of people's food can be realized. The price of rice is as expensive as pearls, and firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, which is already imminent and people are sighing. As for the rice market in Zhabei yesterday, 30-40 goods arrived from various places, and the sales of various goods in the market were stable. The price of white japonica rice fell by 20-30 cents, the price of thin rice fell by a little more than a dime, the price of early rice also fell by a dime, and the price of Yangbu Du Jian fell by nearly a dime. The price of Bian Yuan fell by about a dime, and the prices of other rice varieties also fell by a few cents to nearly a dime.

(Passenger Indica) Yesterday, the passenger indica market was booming in terms of both arrivals and sales. The arrivals loaded from Hankou, Hunan, Jiangxi and other places were about 10,000 bags per day. The sales were very brisk due to the strong demand in Guangdong. The Shantou, Henan, Beiyang and other gangs in this street all had dealings. The Guangdong gang was even more greedy in purchasing coarse rice, purchasing 5,000 bags of Hankou coarse rice and 3,000-4,000 bags of Hunan and Jiangxi coarse rice. Because of the continued strong demand, the market price immediately jumped by a dime. Other milled rice and the like were only for the station because they were not in demand in Guangdong. Today's opening showed 1,600 bags of Hunan rice, 5,000 bags of Hankou coarse rice, 4,924 bags of Gan rice, 1,225 bags of Wen, Yong, and Shao rice, and 200 bags of Siamese rice.

Fluctuations in Flour and Wheat Prices are Unpredictable; Yesterday, they Fell Sharply Again with Foreign Wheat

After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month suddenly showed a sharp decline, because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell sharply. Chicago fell by 50 cents in the near term and 70 cents in the far term. Canada fell by 45 cents. After the opening price, the goal of most of the off-market market was to shift to foreign countries. The rebound the day before was based on foreign wheat, so yesterday's fall in foreign wheat made people feel relaxed again. Moreover, the final settlement is not far away, and most of the guest business is suspended, so the outsiders are working hard to move and pursue the price very hard. The volatility of the market is for this reason. It is estimated that in half a day, each month fell by 456 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the transaction turned clear, and the market car hovered. January and February were better by one cent, while March and April were the same. In the future, the fluctuations of foreign wheat are uncertain, and the fluctuations will be many.

At the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market in each month showed a consistent loosening and decline. The quoted price of foreign wheat also fell by 45 cents to 70 cents. After the opening price, because the rise the day before was purely driven by foreign wheat, and now foreign wheat has fallen, the selling atmosphere is very strong, and the opening price fell by 678 cents. However, the real households are watching and the transaction is not smooth. When the market opened in the afternoon, because the flour market was very flat, some of the long positions outside the industry returned, so the far-term fell by another 35 cents. After that, if the flour sales are lonely, the wheat market will be less colorful. At present, the wheat market is not smooth, and the whole market has only more than 2,000 bags of transactions, and the price is slightly smaller than the previous day by 34 cents. Financial

### Yarn and Cotton

Japanese Controlled Foreign Exchange; Spot Yarn Returned to Stability; Spot Sales are Also Increasingly Quiet

After the wild rise and fall of the yarn market the day before, the momentum has turned calm. In addition, after the official announcement of the Japanese Foreign Exchange Control Law, people's minds have become more stable. At the same time, spot yarn business has become increasingly dull, and the situation of 10-count coarse yarn is particularly weak. Yihuo Factory opened 20-count Wufu Shepherd and mostly sold it to the spot yarn market. Therefore, Qian Ruan has been soft in recent months. However, because the Dagu Sanpin Yarn market is still strong, the long position has not changed its intention. However, most of the industry has gradually increased its yarn stock, and the yarn factory spindles have been fully opened, and production can be increased, so the interest is slightly diminished.

In total, over 83,671,100 national currency dollars were collected in the past six months, an increase of over 16,700,000 dollars compared to the same period last year. The Administration's tax revenue figures and comparisons with the same period last year are recorded separately below:

Of the above items, only stamp tax had a significant shortfall. The reason is a large decrease in revenue from Hebei Province, possibly due to the impact of smuggling on commercial sales. Tobacco and alcohol taxes also had a slight shortfall. However, the surpluses in unified and mining taxes were significant. For unified taxes, cigarettes accounted for the largest portion, followed by cotton yarn, cement, and smoked tobacco. Such significant progress in six months is unprecedented since the start of unified taxes.

### Over Seventy Organizations in the City Telegraph Yang and Yu to Urge Them to

Awaken and Obey the Central Government; Do Not Cause Losses to the Nation and Locality

The National Society says that rumors have been circulating recently that Yang Hucheng of Shaanxi and Yu Xuezhong of Gansu are plotting to resist orders. Upon hearing the news, various organizations in the city were extremely shocked. The City Education Association, the Cultural Construction Association, the Boy Scout Council, the Cooperative Business Promotion Association, the Joint Association of Secondary Schools, and over 70 other cultural organizations in the city sent a telegram to Yang and Yu yesterday, urging them to awaken and obey the Central Government and not to cause losses to the nation and locality. The original telegram is as follows: "Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an, Mr. Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou, the Central Government has already appointed Mr. Sun Weiru, a subordinate of Mr. Yang Hucheng, as Chairman of Shaanxi Province, and Mr. Wang Shutang, a veteran of the Northeast, as Director of the Gansu Pacification Office after considering the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu. The defense areas of the various armies have also been properly redistributed, and the soldiers' pay has also been handled more appropriately than before. As for your crimes of destroying the law and discipline and disrupting the local area, the Central Government has only given you the punishment of dismissal with retention of position, and this punishment does not harm your high official positions and generous salaries in the slightest. It is clear that the Central Government is being overly tolerant, not holding you accountable for the past. Legal principles and human sentiments are both considered, and the people of the country are all convinced. However, many days have passed, and you have not shown any signs of obeying the orders, and rumors of your attempts to resist the orders are causing our associations to be extremely alarmed. We believe that the Northwestern provinces are regarded by the people of the country as a new foundation for the revitalization of China. Not only does the government attach special importance to the economic construction of Shaanxi and Gansu, but also the private banking industry has invested heavily. You are both high officials in the North, and you should solemnly obey the orders and quickly return to the legal track. How can you bear to cause further disturbances, to destroy the nation's plans, and to increase local losses? We are sending this telegram specifically to urge you to consider the suppression of the bandits on the border, which is awaiting eradication, and the remnants of the bandits in Shaanxi and Gansu, which still need to be wiped out. Awaken and obey the Central Government, immediately express your proper attitude, so as to redeem your previous mistakes and plan for future achievements."

### Letter from the City Party Headquarters to Party Members

Report in Person Today to Fill Out Forms; Be Assigned to New Divisions

The City Party Headquarters of this city, in order to reorganize the various divisions in the city, specially issued a letter to comrades yesterday, stating: "All comrades in the city are hereby informed that the district divisions are the basic organizations of our party, directly built by party members. The will and actions of party members are expressed through them. Whether the foundation of the party is solid depends on whether the district divisions are sound, and whether the district divisions have strength depends on the quality of their constituent party members. Therefore, considering the importance of the position of the district divisions, efforts should be made to ensure that their organization is strict and their operation is flexible. Considering the close relationship between the district divisions and party members, they should be guided according to the situation so that they all become excellent revolutionary elements. This is the responsibility that the district divisions should bear internally and cannot be ignored. Secondly, in terms of external affairs, the district divisions are the mechanism that links party members with the higher-level party headquarters. Only through the district divisions can the opinions of party members be directly gathered and contributed to the higher-level party headquarters. Only through the district divisions can the resolutions and orders of the higher-level party headquarters be transmitted and directly direct party members to implement them. Therefore, whether the will of party members and the will of the party are integrated into one, the district divisions bear full responsibility. Furthermore, the district divisions are closest to the people. The district divisions should lead the way in relieving the people's suffering, realizing the people's interests, publicizing the party's doctrines, and implementing revolutionary work, so as to gain their sympathy and cooperation. The association has reviewed the past district divisions in this city, which were loosely organized and slack in their work. The majority of them failed to shoulder the above-mentioned tasks. This time, there is a reorganization. According to the regulations, all district divisions under the headquarters must be reorganized, and all party members must re-register. The association hopes to achieve the following goals after the reorganization: (A) Through the re-delimitation of the areas of the district divisions, it is hoped that the distribution of the district divisions will be improved compared to before. (B) Through the handling of party members' registration and form-filling procedures, it is hoped that party members who do not work hard will be eliminated. (C) Re-elect the executive committee of the district divisions. It is hoped that more sound cadres will be produced, especially the election of appropriate duty commissioners. (D) Due to the reorganization of the district division organization, it is hoped that the spirit of party members will be uplifted and the perception of the outside world will be renewed. (E) Due to the uplifted spirit of party members, it is hoped that work can be actively promoted. Now the reorganization work has just begun. The association hopes that all comrades in the city will understand this meaning and must go to the original or nearby district party headquarters in person on the 9th or 10th of this month to complete the registration and form-filling procedures, wait to be assigned to the new district divisions, and actively work. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the order and fails to complete the registration and form-filling procedures within the deadline, they will be severely punished once they are found out in the future. All comrades in the city should pay attention to this. The Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Special Municipality of Shanghai."

### All Party Members in This City Re-registered Yesterday and Today

Those Who Registered Yesterday Were Very Enthusiastic; New Divisions Will Be Formed Immediately After Completion

The City Party Headquarters of this city, in order to improve the district division organization and promote party affairs, has initiated this re-registration. Starting yesterday (the 9th), registration points were set up in the ten district party headquarters and one district division in the city. All party members in this city were required to bring a half-length photo with them to the nearest registration point yesterday and today to complete the registration procedures. It is reported that those who filled out forms and registered at the registration points in various districts yesterday were very enthusiastic. From morning to night, the threshold was worn through. It is reported that there is still one day left today, and the number is already small. Those who do not comply with the order and register according to the regulations after the deadline will not only lose their party membership in this city, but the City Party Headquarters will also severely punish them.

### Cai Zengji, Manager of the Wharf Department of the China Merchants Bureau, Also Serves as Manager

Shen Zhongyi Appointed Deputy Manager of the Bureau

Tan Boying, Deputy Manager of the state-run China Merchants Bureau and Manager of the Wharf Management Department, has requested to resign. It is reported that it has been approved by the Ministry of Communications, and Mr. Shen Shenyi has been appointed as Deputy Manager of the Bureau. Mr. Shen has previously served as Section Chief and Manager of the Hankou Bureau in the China Merchants Bureau. In recent years, he has also held important positions in the Sanbei Steamship Company. He has rich experience in the shipping industry and can be said to be a talented person for the Bureau. As for the position of Manager of the Wharf Management Department of the Bureau, it has been temporarily held by General Manager Cai Zengji by order of the Ministry. According to a statement issued by General Manager Cai yesterday, since the reorganization, the head office and its affiliated branch offices have been tidied up and have taken shape. However, although the wharf and cargo yard matters have been established as a Wharf Management Department responsible for tidying up, except for the public bidding of the wharf porters, which is organized by the head office, other tidying matters have not been actively carried out. After the resignation of Concurrent Manager Tan, the Ministry ordered that I concurrently serve as the post, which is to facilitate direct supervision and command, so as to thoroughly tidy up. It has been decided that after taking over, the wharf affairs will be fundamentally improved as much as possible, such as (1) Although the Bureau is a state-run agency, it belongs to the transportation public utilities. The principles of commercialization and convenience to customers first should be used for soliciting business and handling procedures. It is different from the handling procedures of ordinary administrative agencies. (2) Shipping companies have always had compensation methods for cargo damage. In the future, the Bureau will not only strive for swift action in handling damage procedures, but also try to absolutely protect the goods, so that customers are protected from losses and reduce damage incidents. (3) Stacking goods in various yards is one of the main tasks. If the stacking is not done properly, it will be uneconomical in terms of yard location and loading and unloading time, and it will also be inconvenient for customers to load and unload goods. In the future, it is necessary to plan in advance to make the stacking reasonable and reduce various losses. (4) Since the public bidding of the wharf porters has been handed over to contractors, there are occasional imperfections in the handling. In the future, strict orders should be given to rectify them, so that the contractors fulfill the contracting contracts and improve the efficiency of the porters, so as to avoid further delays in the Bureau's schedule. It is also necessary to prepare for the berthing of foreign ships and the loading and unloading of cargo without any delay. The bad habits of contractors deducting workers' wages and soliciting from customers must also be fundamentally eliminated. (5) The lives of the dockworkers are extremely difficult. Therefore, there are often all kinds of unnecessary disputes caused by being exploited and oppressed. The workers themselves suffer, and the Bureau's business is also affected. In addition to ordering the contractors of each search to treat the workers fairly according to the contracting contracts, the Bureau is also starting to study and organize employee welfare projects (such as setting up consumer cooperatives, clinics, bathrooms, toilets, etc., and plans to try them out at Jinliyuan Wharf first). The above are just a few examples. Other periods of this matter will also be considered for appropriate improvement. However, this is only passive, and the existing wharf affairs will be thoroughly tidied up. As for active tidying up, such as repairing wharves and cargo yards and adding new equipment to adapt to the needs of expanding business and commercial competition, the amount of money required is about tens of millions. I will also be responsible for planning this financial problem. In general, after taking over, all the various problems will be solved separately, so as to live up to the expectations of the Ministry of Communications. However, the matter is heavy and my thinking may not be perfect. I deeply hope that the gentlemen of the state and the Bureau's customers will give instructions on the Bureau's wharf reform matters at any time, so that they can be used as a model. As for my affairs, they are very busy. If the wharf tidying policy can be realized and all matters can be on track, then I will definitely ask the Ministry to appoint other suitable personnel to take over the post of Manager of the Concurrently held Wharf Management Department.

It is also reported that a person in charge of the China Merchants Bureau said that the contractor of the Nan Wharf (i.e., Jinliyuan Wharf) porter was replaced by the Bureau due to poor handling, weak ability, and slow work that delayed the schedule. Qiu Dinglai, the alternate bidder, was appointed to take over. Yesterday, because the original contractor delayed in handing over, the Bureau specially ordered the Wharf Management Department to supervise the handover by the 13th of this month. The original contractor still refused to comply with the order, so only forced execution was possible. Or, if the business suffers losses as a result, the original contractor should be held responsible for compensation.

### The French Concession Authorities Will Also Reduce Administration

Only Cutting Subsidies Without Reducing Salaries

The "Shanghai Times" reports that the discussion of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works' plan to reduce administration is still ongoing. Yesterday (the 8th), it was learned that the French Concession Municipal Authorities also intend to engage in reducing administration, but not as severely as the Public Concession, only intending to cut the special subsidies for senior personnel without reducing salaries. According to personnel from several departments of the Board of Directors, the French authorities are especially unwilling for the various staff to reduce their efficiency due to seeing their salaries about to be drastically cut, especially for the police administration, which has recently been engaged in encouraging officers to stay in their jobs with peace of mind and trying to facilitate various matters, so that later personnel can obtain superior materials. However, due to the financial expenses, it is necessary to ask the staff to accept certain cuts to make up for part of the short funds. The Economic Committee, which was appointed at the beginning of November last year, has now stated that the shortage of municipal expenses cannot be regarded as a thing of the past and must be prevented from increasing again. However, temporary plans cannot help. It is said that the entire committee holds this opinion and is now planning to save 45,941 yuan by cutting English language learning subsidies, housing subsidies, etc. It is also said that 246,726 yuan will be allocated from the special budget to make up for the shortage. A new committee will be appointed soon to study a long-term plan to balance income and expenditure and will eventually pay attention to reducing staff, reducing salaries, and revising donation rates. As for the cuts in subsidies that were planned to be implemented from January 1st of this year, they are still limited to senior personnel. The regular budget for 1937 will reach 9,786,115 yuan, including 5,490,000 in donation tax revenue and 2,137,000 in license revenue. The police administration expenses for this year are calculated to be 3,067,531 yuan.

### Emergency Meeting of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry in the French Concession

Opposing the Public Works Bureau's Collection of Medicine Donations

In the summer of last year, the French Concession Board of Directors suddenly had the act of collecting donations for the Chinese medicine and medicine dispensing regulations, ranging from 25 yuan to 10 yuan per year. The national medicine stores in the entire district, because they have no legal basis and also have no ability to do so during this commercial downturn, have requested the National Medicine Industry Association to negotiate with the French Board of Directors based on reason, but have not been successful. At the end of the year, the French Board of Directors sent Chinese and foreign personnel to notify the various national medicine stores to reduce the collection by half, and said that if it is not paid before the 12th, the water and electricity will be cut off. The various national medicine stores are indignant that they have not accumulated water and electricity bills. How can they be unreasonably oppressed? So they held two district representative conferences on the 8th and 9th. Although it was raining and snowing, all of them participated, which shows the tension of the situation. It has been found that there are many resolution plans: (1) If the means of cutting off electricity and water are used to oppress, one family encounters it, the entire district will strike in protest, and all the representatives have sworn to pass it. (2) If necessary, launch a joint action by colleagues throughout the city. (3) Those who suffer from the pain of cutting off water and electricity are not limited to one family and one industry, and should promote the unanimous opposition of Chinese taxpayers in the entire French Concession district. (4) Submit a petition to the City Party Headquarters, the City Government, and the City Chamber of Commerce for public relations negotiations, and ask various public groups for sympathy and support, and issue a strike declaration after the implementation of the water and electricity cut off, and the rest are omitted.

### The Silver Jubilee Ceremony of the Catholic Central Bureau of China Was Held Yesterday

Archbishop Cai Ning Presided Over the Commemorative Mass, and General President Lu Bohong Reported on the Bureau's Affairs

The Catholic Central Bureau of China is an organization of Catholic believers dedicated to handling three major areas: charity, education, and evangelization. Founded in the first year of the Republic of China, it has branches in various parts of the country. This year marks the 25th anniversary of its establishment. Yesterday at 4 p.m., a silver jubilee ceremony was held in the grand hall of the bureau in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, presided over by Archbishop Cai Ning, the Papal Nuncio to China. The details are as follows:

A Glimpse of the Venue

High national flags and Papal flags stood at the entrance of the bureau. Horizontally arranged electric lights spelled out "Silver Jubilee Commemoration." Inside the venue, colorful ribbons were everywhere. Inscriptions from all walks of life adorned the walls, and large and small flower baskets shone brightly.

Order of Proceedings

(1) Music, (2) Opening address by Cai, the Archbishop and concurrently the National Supervisor of the Catholic Central Bureau, (3) Report on the bureau's affairs by General President Lu, (4) Address by Bishop Hui, (5) Address by Bishop Yu, (6) Speech by Dean Zhang, the directing priest, (7) Archbishop Cai, representing the Pope, awards the Cross of Honor, (8) Performance by students of Zheng Xiu Middle School, (9) Music, (10) Completion of the ceremony and adjournment.

Attending Religious Believers

Archbishop Cai Ning, Bishop Hui of the Shanghai Diocese, Bishop Yu of the Nanjing Diocese, Bishop Tian of the Hangzhou Diocese, Vice-Bishop Jin, President Sang, Dean Zhang, Dean Yao, Dean Leng, Father Xu, chief editor of the Holy Church Magazine, Father Ding, the editor of the Sacred Heart Daily, Lu Bohong, Zhu Zhiyao, Dong Junfu, Lu Yigeng, He Lizhong, Wang Baolun, and more than 500 members in total.

Archbishop Cai's Admonition

Archbishop Cai Ning spoke first, mainly emphasizing: (1) Deeply study the doctrines of the Holy Church, elevate thinking, and suppress sin. (2) Cultivate a spirit of sacrifice, not fearing hardship, not begrudging wealth, and being prepared to go to any lengths. (3) Encourage receiving the Holy Eucharist, so as to obtain abundant divine grace and blessings.

Abstract of the Report

Subsequently, President Lu Bohong reported on the bureau's affairs, stating: 89 clinics have provided medical care to 9,695,086 people; 20 schools have been established with 1,838 students and 69 teachers; 108 preaching venues have been set up, with 40,320 preaching sessions, attended by 1,562,079 people; 27,094 people have been converted; 337,854 people have been baptized; 30 churches have been built through independent construction, and over 50 churches have been assisted in construction, with a total expenditure of approximately 8 million yuan. There are over 100 branches nationwide, with more than 150,000 male and female members.

Bishop Yu's Admonition

Bishop Yu's remarks mainly stated: According to General President Lu's report, it is as if reading a new painting in imagination. In this large garden of the Catholic Central Bureau, there is an extremely bright and splendid corner (referring to the Shanghai area), colorful and fragrant. This is all thanks to General President Lu, serving as the leader of the members, guiding all members and working hard to cultivate the fruits of their efforts. He also stated that the continuous work of the Shanghai Catholic Central Bureau for 25 years has made great strides in charity, education, and evangelization. However, after the silver jubilee, cultural and social enterprises should be the new focus of efforts. Cultural enterprises include book publishing and the newspaper industry, while social enterprises include rural relief and cooperative ventures. These are all needed by the Catholic Church. The Pope is calling loudly for believers to actively participate in these works. The Central Bureau has not yet achieved results in these two major areas. It is hoped that new apostles of cultural and social enterprises will emerge from all departments of the Shanghai Central Bureau. Following past experience and working hard, there will surely be a day when things come naturally. It must be known that our work is not only to save the dead, but also to save the living; not only to remove temporary suffering, but also to find a long-term solution. Loving people should also mean loving society, and saving people should also mean saving society, starting with the entire social system. Bishop Yu concluded by expressing his deep hope that at the 50-year golden jubilee, under the leadership of General President Lu, the Central Bureau will not only continue to report on charity, education, and evangelization, but also report on the achievements of cultural and social enterprises, which is his greatest and most earnest hope.

Bishop Hui's Admonition

Bishop Hui's admonition stated in general: Today, the Catholic Central Bureau is holding its silver jubilee. The intention of this commemoration is no different from a milestone on the roadside, indicating the process and proclaiming the future. In these 25 years, your sacrifices of spirit and wealth, and the contribution of tangible things, all stem from the supernatural foundation of loving God above and loving others below. As the Apostle Paul said, "Demonstrate the truth with love." The past road has been so bright and splendid, and the future journey is long and extensive. It is even more important to redouble our efforts and concentrate our minds to go forward. Recalling when this bishop was consecrated, he prayed to God for strong assistants. In addition to the clergy bearing this inherent responsibility, it truly depends on the members of the Catholic Central Bureau acting as left and right hands, exerting their full strength to assist in continuing to advance in the future, so that we can enter the path of light even more. He also said that the current Pope attaches the greatest importance to the work of the Catholic Central Bureau, so he bestowed upon Mr. Lu the most honorable title of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, urging everyone to respect the Holy See's intentions, lead the entire bureau, and diligently and tirelessly advance forward.

Special Conferment of Medals

Lu Yigeng is the third son of Mr. Bohong. Young, handsome, capable, and energetic, he assists his father in planning various charitable enterprises. Mr. Lu currently serves as the vice president of Sacred Heart Hospital and Puji Sanitarium, and the principal of Zhengxiu Elementary School and Ren'ai Elementary School. In 1933, the Chinese Roman Pilgrimage Group unanimously elected Mr. Lu as the general leader, leading the group members to visit various countries, make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and meet with the Pope, who personally praised him. This time, his father was awarded the title of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by the Pope, and Mr. Lu was also specially awarded the Vatican Gold Grand Cross of Honor by the Pope to recognize his merits. At yesterday's silver jubilee ceremony of the Catholic Central Bureau, Archbishop Cai, representing the Pope, conferred the medal. The meaning of the cross is that Mr. Lu is responsible for assisting his father in running various charitable and educational undertakings, not shirking hard work, and has a ribbon attached to it, indicating obedience and conformity to the Pope's will.

### The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notified the French Ambassador Regarding Participation in the Paris Exposition

The French government will hold an International Exposition in Paris on May 1st of this year. Previously, Li Shizeng, Chu Minyi, and others, together with leaders of various circles under the Department of Culture and Education, jointly initiated and organized the Chinese Association for Participation in the Paris International Exposition.

### Request to Continue Negotiations on Inspection of Factories in the Concessions

The Manufacturers Association Submitted a Document to the Municipal Government

The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Regarding the request to continue negotiations on the inspection of factories in the concessions to ensure industrial safety: In recent times, with the progress of material things, factory enterprises have become increasingly developed. All countries in the world pay close attention to factory equipment and conduct inspections at any time to ensure perfection and benefit laborers. Shanghai is an area with many factories. In the past, due to a lack of attention, disasters occurred from time to time. Your government, concerned about laborers and protecting industries, has repeatedly negotiated with the authorities of various concessions to implement factory inspections. However, foreigners have used consular jurisdiction as an excuse and have not accepted the inspections, causing negotiations to stall for many years. As a result, accidental events in factories in the concessions occur frequently, and many people have lost their lives. This is enough to expose the shortcomings of factory equipment in the concessions. Our association, as a group of national products factories, cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specifically request that your government continue to negotiate to achieve the goal of Chinese industry and workers being protected by Chinese law. This would be fortunate for the laborers and fortunate for the country. Respectfully submitted."

### The Japanese Yen Exchange Rate in Shanghai is Chaotic After Japan Regulates Foreign Exchange

Foreign Banks Selling Off En Masse, Japanese Merchants Buying In Forcefully to Maintain the Rate

The New Voice reports that after Japan announced the Foreign Exchange Control Law and began regulating foreign exchange, the Japanese yen exchange rate in Shanghai was chaotic. Foreign merchants were selling off en masse, and Japanese merchants were buying in large amounts to maintain the exchange rate. The details are as follows:

Chaotic Trading

The Central Bank announced the yen exchange rate as 103 yen to 100 national currency yuan, while the British-owned HSBC Bank announced the yen exchange rate as 103.375 yen to 100 national currency yuan. However, the market trading was very chaotic. Foreign banks (except for Japanese banks) and Chinese banks were selling off Japanese yen en masse. Therefore, the exchange rate announced by HSBC Bank yesterday was 0.25 yuan lower than the previous day, while the exchange rate announced by the Central Bank yesterday did not involve actual transactions, which proves that the Japanese yen has devalued.

Japanese Merchants Maintaining

Japanese banks such as Yokohama Specie, Taiwan, Korea, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Shanghai, and Hankou were trying to maintain the yen exchange rate in order to prevent it from collapsing. Therefore, starting yesterday, they bought in large amounts and worked hard to stabilize it. Except for Japanese merchants, no merchants from other countries were buying. Although Japanese banks are working hard to stabilize the rate, whether they can maintain it in the past is currently a major issue.

Foreign Exchange Rates

The devaluation of the Japanese yen is unrelated to the foreign exchange rates of other countries, such as Britain, the United States, Germany, France, and Hong Kong. Therefore, the foreign exchange rates of the Central Bank yesterday were very stable. London was 1 shilling and 2.5 pence, New York was 30 US dollars, Paris was 630 francs, Berlin was 73.5 marks, and Hong Kong was 97 Hong Kong dollars. The foreign exchange rates of HSBC Bank were 1 shilling and 2.375 pence for British pound, 29.375 yuan for US dollar, 629 francs for French franc, 72.5 marks for German mark, and 96.75 Hong Kong dollars for Hong Kong dollar.

### Bandits Rob a Yunfei Car and Kidnap Yang Ruisheng

Yang is a Contractor and Has Been Kidnapped Twice, After the Car Was Found, a Handgun and Bullets Were Seized

At 5:30 p.m. yesterday, two people wearing black and gray cotton robes and one person wearing a blue cloth jacket, speaking with local accents, came to the Yunfei taxi station next to the Nanjing Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII, claiming they wanted to rent a car to Longhua. The driver, Wu Jinhai (38 years old, from Ningbo, driver's license number 25520), drove the car with municipal license number 4434 and concession permit number 12292. Unexpectedly, when they drove to a location near the No. 119 pole next to the tomb garden of Lujiayan, west of the defense post of the Longhua Road Jinji Road Ta Chao Dong small wooden bridge on South Shanghai Longhua Road, the three bandits suddenly showed handguns and ordered them to stop, claiming to know the situation. The driver, knowing he had encountered bandits, allowed them to arrange things. He was driven down, and one bandit in a blue cloth jacket put on the driver's hat and drove the car away at high speed. The remaining bandits dragged the driver into the nearby graveyard, first stuffing his mouth with pre-prepared cotton, tying his hands behind his back with hemp rope, and pushing him to the ground before leaving. It was dusk, and the location was remote with few pedestrians. The driver struggled for an hour and ten minutes before managing to free himself. He ran to the nearby Longhua Road Defense Corps and telegraphed the Yunfei taxi head office on Route Cardinal Mercier, who sent another car to pick him up and bring him to the Xinxiqu police station, who transferred him to the Ximen branch. Passing by the French-owned water tower on Xujiahui Road Lujiawan, they saw the car that had been robbed abandoned on the side of the road. Inside the car, there was a six-inch handgun, two bullets, and a hat, one of the car door handles was broken, fortunately there was no other damage, the parts were intact, so Wu Jinhai drove it to the Yunfei taxi station next to the Chen Ying Shii Memorial Tower in Ximen of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. An employee from the Yunfei head office filled out the receipt and drove it back to the Yunfei taxi station next to the Chen Ying Shii Memorial Tower in Ximen to continue to supply it for hire. However, according to information obtained by the police agency, the bandits robbed the No. 12292 car at around 6:30 p.m. and drove to the vicinity of No. 332 Lane of Seymour Road to wait. At that time, Yang Ruisheng, a nearly sixty-year-old man from Pudong who lived at No. 15 of the lane (started his career as a building contractor and owns the Yang Rui Ji Construction Factory), was returning from the Qinglian Court teahouse in a rented rickshaw No. 2869, pulled by the rickshaw puller Lu Zhijiang from Tongzhou. As soon as the bandits in the car saw him, they jumped out of the car, punched Lu Zhijiang in the face when he was not prepared, and Lu immediately fell to the ground. The bandits then kidnapped Yang Ruisheng, jumped back into the car, and sped away. By the time Lu Zhijiang got up, the bandit's car had long disappeared. He returned home to report the incident and sought help from the Jing'an Temple police station under whose jurisdiction the area fell. After Hua Detective Tang Keng and others went to investigate, they assigned detectives to search in all directions. It was learned that Yang Ruisheng had been kidnapped once before on February 2, 1927. The bandits demanded a large sum of money. After repeated private negotiations, he was released. This is the second time he has been kidnapped.

### Ringing the Doorbell to Report Injustice

The Local Court Vigorously Implements Oral Lawsuits, and Judicial Organs in Various Places Should Urgently Follow Suit

Lu Yimei, the president of the Shanghai Local Court, and Zhu Huanbiao, the chief prosecutor, believe that Shanghai has many lawsuits, and impoverished people who have been wronged and have urgent matters have neither the ability to hire lawyers nor the time to write complaints. At the same time, receiving complaints and dividing cases also delays the process. In order to vigorously implement oral lawsuits, similar to the old Qing county government's method of beating drums to report injustice, a doorbell is installed on the wall of the civil and criminal reporting office inside the second door of the main gate on the west side of the court. A separate line connects to the chief prosecutor's office and the bailiff's office. If a person has a grievance to report, they only need to press the doorbell, and the chief prosecutor's office and the bailiff's office will ring at the same time. The bailiff will immediately take the person reporting the grievance, and the chief prosecutor will immediately send a prosecutor to open an investigation court for questioning. If the complaint is true, the defendant will be immediately arrested and prosecuted. If the complaint is a malicious accusation or intentional harassment, they will also be immediately punished. After submitting a report to the Jiangsu High Court, it was considered that this method was feasible, and it has been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice for record. The Shanghai Court was informed to implement it starting yesterday.

### Extortion Attempt Fails, Sentenced to Ten Months

Li Daocai, a native of Ningbo and the general manager of the Victory Medical Instrument Company in the Zhonghe Building on Shansi Road, lived at No. 2, Shunde Lane, Avenue Haig. On the 28th of last month, Li suddenly received a pair of threatening letters from a gang named He Yeshan, attempting to extort 1,000 legal currency yuan, and instructed him to send the money to the Feilong Dance School at No. 3, Yuren Lane, Yuchaqing Road. After receiving the letter, Li immediately reported it to the Xinzha police station, who ordered Detective Huang Siming to go to the address and arrest the suspect, He Awu, a native of Ningbo. They found that He had also written a threatening letter on December 28 of last year to Xu Jinsheng, who lived at No. 33, Jiuchang Lane, Xinzha Road, attempting to extort 1,000 yuan. He was escorted to the First Special Court for questioning and is awaiting trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin presided over the eighth criminal court and announced the verdict. The main text stated, "He Awu, jointly and continuously attempting to obtain property by intimidation, is sentenced to ten months of imprisonment. The two letters and one business card are confiscated."

### The Tragedy of a Fish Vendor Truck Overturning, Li Yuanhan Has Died

The Driver is Suspected of Negligence, and the Police Station Has Filed a Public Prosecution with the Court

Yang Yuding, a native of Xuzhou, was driving truck No. 1729, fully loaded with thirty fish vendors, from the 16th pier to the fish market at around 3:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. When passing the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Qiwupu Road, there was a bicycle in front of him. Yang tried to avoid it, but because he was driving at full speed, he could not avoid it and knocked the bicycle down. Seeing that he had caused an accident, Yang quickly turned the steering wheel, but crashed into two large trees on the side of the road, causing the entire truck to overturn. Fish vendors Shao Heshang, Zhou Aixing, Li Chugen, Wang Ada, Huang Qiankun, Kong Kuangsheng, Zheng Muquan, Shen Fengshi, Yang Heqing, Li Hongqing, and Li Yuanhan, who was riding the bicycle, were all seriously injured. After the police officers received the report and arrived, they transported the injured to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. After investigating the circumstances, it was determined that the driver, Yang Yuding, was indeed negligent, and he was detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and prosecuted him for negligent injury under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. Because all the injured parties were still in the hospital, he requested a postponement of the hearing. After questioning by Judge Ye Shengchao, he was ordered to be remanded in custody and await further hearing at a later date. Li Yuanhan, because he was more seriously injured, died at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday after ineffective treatment. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Song of the First Special Court determined that he had died from the collision, and the body was temporarily claimed by Yin Bin Yuan for coffin encoffinment.

### Fortune Teller Tragically Crushed to Death by a Car

Zhao Shizhai, a native of Huai'an, 40 years old, earned a living by setting up a fortune-telling stall on the banks of the Macgregor Road Xinzha Bridge. At around 1:00 p.m. yesterday, Zhao needed to use the restroom, so he went to a nearby toilet. After finishing, he hurried back, but at that moment, a public bus No. 15038 of the Tenth Route was speeding from east to west. Zhao was walking quickly with his head down and did not pay attention, and the driver of the bus was unable to brake in time, causing Zhao to be hit head-on by the public bus. He was thrown two or three zhang away and fell to the ground, his head hitting the road, his skull shattered, and blood gushed out like a spring. His brain matter flowed out, and he died instantly. When the patrol officer saw this, he quickly summoned an ambulance, but it was too late. He then transferred the body to the coroner's office and took the driver who caused the accident to the Xinzha police station under whose jurisdiction the area fell for investigation.

### Drug Trafficking Must Be Punished by Death

Drug Offenders in the Concessions are Also Judged According to the Law, Zhou A'gen Detained for Drug Use and Trafficking

Since this year, anyone who manufactures, transports, sells, or consumes drugs will be punished by death according to the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Drug Crimes, as announced by the Songhu Headquarters. However, the general population who manufacture, transport, sell, and consume red pills, white powder, morphine, cocaine, heroin, etc. in the concessions still mistakenly believe that these anti-drug regulations will not apply to the concession areas. They continue to harbor侥倖 psychological and continue to manufacture, sell, and consume as before. However, this is not the case. It must be known that the judicial organs in the concessions now abide by Chinese law and are no longer comparable to the past. The day before yesterday, Guo Ruiyu, an anti-drug agent, arrested Zhou A'gen, a local, in the front room on the third floor of No. 62, North Shansi Road, for privately smoking and selling drugs. Ten small packets of heroin, two opium pipes, and two opium lamps were seized on the spot. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Police station lawyer Li Zhishan filed a complaint against Zhou based on Article 4 of the Anti-Drug Regulations (those who sell or intend to sell and possess drugs shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment). After lawyer Li explained the process of solving the case, Zhou confessed that he bought these drugs from a Japanese person at No. 5, Yule Lane, Qiujiang Road, for 18 packs per yuan, and he sold them for one cent per pack. He repeatedly thought of quitting, but had no funds for rehabilitation, so he continued in this way. A few days ago, he met a detective who asked him to place the drug packages on the table so that the detectives could come to search, and if he was detained in the police station, he could be sent to the hospital for rehabilitation, etc. The judge believed that the case was important, so he appointed a lawyer for the defense and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and wait for sentencing next Tuesday.

### Huang Jiaju Accuses Kan Duo's Daughter

Cousins in Litigation: The Goal is to Contest the Inheritance

Kan Duo, courtesy name Huochu (deceased), former Director of the Railway Bureau of the Puppet State of Manchukuo, his fourth daughter, Kan Suwan, also known as Suwan (resident at 60 Rue Lastre), is being privately prosecuted in the District Court by her cousin, Huang Jiaju (26 years old, from Hefei, Anhui), a university student residing at 694 Dalianwan Road, represented by lawyer Ding Wei, for false accusation, theft, and unlawful detention. The prosecution alleges that the defendant is the fourth daughter of the late Kan Huochu, the plaintiff's maternal uncle. Because the late uncle had no sons, he showed Huang Jiaju exceptional favor, teaching him from a young age and providing generous financial support for his studies. Upon adulthood, he strongly supported and promoted Huang Jiaju. Though their relationship was that of uncle and nephew, their affection was akin to father and son. Sadly, misfortune struck, and in the second month of the year before last, Huochu suddenly fell ill and died during a trip to Shenyang. At the time, Huang Jiaju was also seriously ill and receiving treatment in a hospital, unable to attend his uncle or receive his final words. By the time he recovered and returned, the funeral arrangements were complete. Previously, Huochu had prepared a will disposing of all his assets, including a bequest to Huang Jiaju, which was clearly stated in the will. Furthermore, those present at the time, such as Kan Chaoxi, Chen Yi, and Tao Lanquan, were also deeply aware of the situation. The defendant, however, is cold and unfeeling, disregarding the will and refusing to grant Huang Jiaju the inheritance due to him. Despite repeated attempts at negotiation, she remained indifferent, delaying for nearly three years. In the summer of the twenty-fifth year, Huang Jiaju learned that the defendant had moved her entire family south to Shanghai. He also came to Shanghai to attempt to negotiate with her, but she was avoiding the summer heat in Qingdao, preventing them from meeting. Unexpectedly, upon returning from Qingdao, the defendant preemptively reported to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, falsely accusing Huang Jiaju of stealing her jewelry. On September 16th, Huang Jiaju and his friend Cao Jiandong were arrested and detained for many days without interrogation. The defendant then requested the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to send Huang Jiaju to the Caohejing Vagrant Work Training Center. Subsequently, Huang Jiaju hired a lawyer who sent a letter of inquiry, and on October 22nd, the bureau brought Huang Jiaju back from the training center and transferred him to the Prosecutor's Office, which dismissed the charges and released him. Therefore, the plaintiff requests legal punishment for her crimes, and so on. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Peiming opened the court session. The defendant was absent, with the bailiff reporting that she had gone to Hangzhou. The plaintiff stated that he had met her yesterday. The court ordered another summons to be issued. Important report.

Thirty-Six Deaths in the Past Month; Passengers Departing Shanghai for Hong Kong Must Present Vaccination Certificates to Land; Quarantine Office Secretary Discusses the Urgent Need for Citizens to Vaccinate

Smallpox has suddenly become prevalent in this city since the beginning of last month. In the past month, 36 people have died from the disease. The Seaport Quarantine Office has declared Shanghai a smallpox-infected port. A Datong News Agency reporter provides details below:

Alarming Death Toll

This morning, the reporter visited Zhou Zhongqian, secretary of the Seaport Quarantine Office. According to Zhou, smallpox has recently become prevalent in Shanghai. According to investigations by the office's medical officers, from the week before the fifth of last month to the present, 36 citizens have died from the disease, and the trend is still unabated, which is cause for great concern.

Landing Ban in Hong Kong

Zhou continued, "Due to the prevalence of smallpox in Shanghai, coastlines everywhere are paying close attention. The Hong Kong authorities, for example, are prohibiting passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong from landing if they do not have a vaccination certificate issued by the Shanghai Quarantine Office. Therefore, to prevent travelers going from Shanghai to Hong Kong or other ports from experiencing difficulties upon arrival, we are starting today to vaccinate travelers departing Shanghai for Hong Kong and other ports and issuing vaccination certificates at the same time."

Urgent Need for Vaccination

Zhou concluded, "In the past year, 87 people died from smallpox in this port, while in the past month alone, there were 36 deaths. The situation is very serious. We deeply hope that citizens will quickly go to vaccination locations designated by the Chinese Concession Health Authority to request vaccination. Parents should especially have their children vaccinated against smallpox. Otherwise, neglecting this even slightly may lead to regret too late."

Declaration of Infected Port

The text of the Seaport Quarantine Office's announcement is as follows: "Investigation reveals that smallpox is currently prevalent in Shanghai. All passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong and other ports should first report to the Shanghai Quarantine Office at 2 Beijing Road to request vaccination and obtain a vaccination certificate to avoid difficulties upon arrival at those ports. This is hereby announced. January 9, 26th year of the Republic of China. Director Wu Liande."

### Chinese and Western Detectives Go to Dalian to Rescue Two Prostitutes and Return Them to Shanghai

Kidnappers Also Separately Escorted to Shanghai; Court Orders a Date for Examination and Interrogation

Zhang Fengying, a 14-year-old girl from Wuxi, residing at the home of her relative Yang Changwen at 21 Mao Hai Road, disappeared on the ninth of last month after being abducted. The Hongkou Police Station was notified. Subsequently, Chinese detectives Feng Qishan and Xia Shutang arrested two suspects, Liu Fengsheng and Zhang Changbao, from Changzhou, and escorted them to the First Special District Court. They confessed that several accomplices had taken Zhang to Qingdao to be sold. They were ordered to be held in custody. Recently, the police station dispatched detectives Feng and Xia, along with Western detective Ayers, to Qingdao. Working with the local Public Security Bureau, they arrested five accomplices at the Qingdao Eryitai Chaoyang Hotel and the Huaxing Public Hotel on Yinxi Road: Lu Jiale from Yangzhou, Wang Runzhi, a woman named Zhang Chenshi, Bao Zishan from Anhui, and Ma Gongchen from Shandong. They learned that Zhang had been sold to the Lebaoshan brothel at 12 Zhiergou, Sifangyuan, Dalian, for 190 yuan. The Chinese and Western detectives then went to Dalian (which is a Japanese concession) and paid 190 yuan to Lebaoshan to redeem Zhang. They also rescued Zhu Xiuying, a girl from Huzhou, who had been lured into the brothel by a kidnapper named Zhang Laowu. They then arrested Ling Defu from Yangzhou, who was responsible for sending Zhang to Dalian. The two women and Lu Jiale and the others were put on the Fengtian steamship and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. They were brought to the police station. Zhang was taken back by her relative Yang Changwen. Zhu, because she had no family in Shanghai, was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday morning, the case was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case and requested a postponement to combine the trial with Liu Fengsheng. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported on the process of arresting the defendants in Qingdao. Zhang and Zhu testified about the circumstances of their abduction. When questioned, Lu Jiale and the others gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao Xiefen ruled that they should remain in custody and set another date for further investigation.

### Robbers Pre-Arrange a Car to Steal a Small Silver Box

First, They Called a Car Company Posing as Someone Else to Rent a Car; Unable to Open the Box, the Robbers Simply Carried it Away

Da Wen, Hua Xin, and Guang Xin Printing and Book Bureau, located at 38 Ning'an Lane, 997 North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road, also prints picture cards and calendars, and its business is doing well. However, it has attracted the attention of robbers. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 6:30 p.m., six robbers suddenly arrived. Four of them were armed. Four robbers entered through the front door and two entered through the back door. They first held up more than ten employees and apprentices, leading them to a small room upstairs and guarding them. They then demanded the keys to the silver box from the employees, hoping to open the Da Wen Book Bureau's empty silver box downstairs, but were unable to do so because they did not have the keys. The robbers then went to the Hua Xin and Guang Xin accounting room upstairs. At this time, there was a sudden knock at the door. It was a chauffeur who had come to ask if they had hired a car. The robbers inside answered in the affirmative and told the chauffeur to wait a moment. The chauffeur was unaware of the situation and was also taken into custody by the robbers, who forced him into the small room upstairs to be watched. At the same time, one of the robbers ran out of the lane and drove the car into Ning'an Lane. The other four robbers were still upstairs, trying to force open the silver box. However, because the accountant, Ding, happened to be out, they were unable to open it. The five robbers, in a fit of desperation, worked together to steal the small silver box from the accounting room, carried it downstairs, put it in the car, and sped out of the lane. After the robbers left, those who had been detained were freed. When questioned about his presence, the chauffeur said that his name was Chen Dexing and that he worked for the Southern Automobile Company on Avenue Edward VII. At approximately 6:20 p.m., the car company received a phone call from someone claiming to be from the Da Wen Book Bureau at 38 Ning'an Lane, Haining Road, wanting to hire a car. Therefore, the car company ordered Chen to drive rental car number 12695 to the location. The owners then realized that the robbers had been planning this all along. They immediately reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, requesting an investigation. It is understood that there were over 1,000 yuan in banknotes in the stolen silver box, as well as important documents and files. After learning of the incident, the police station dispatched detectives to investigate and notified all police agencies in the city, requesting assistance in locating the car. At approximately 8:30 p.m., car number 12695 was found at the intersection of Gordon Road and Xinza Road. However, there was no sign of the robbers or the silver box. The beat officer reported this to the police station, which took the car back for inspection and notified the Southern Automobile Company to retrieve it.

### Joint Transport Luggage Inspection Strictly Enforced by Order

Yesterday, Further Instructions Were Issued to All Railway Bureaus

The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations received instruction number 4734 from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which stated: "Approved is official letter number 4077 from the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and concurrently Director-General of the Opium Suppression Bureau, stating: 'Approved is the report from the Railway Police Headquarters stating that the Pinghan Railway Police Department reported that the section chief of the Xingyan section reported that at 1:50 p.m. on October 14th of last year, the 7th and 11th express trains arrived at the station and unloaded two wicker baskets and one leather suitcase. The stationmaster and the passenger inspected the items together, but the passenger suddenly disappeared. They checked the ticket office but found no trace of the passenger. The deputy stationmaster was then joined to open the items, and they found 80 packets of the drug 'red pill,' weighing 77 kilograms. The drug was then sent to the Henan office of the Opium Suppression Inspectorate. A formal document is now being submitted for review. As such, the procedure for inspecting joint transport luggage upon arrival at the destination station was previously communicated to your ministry and the police headquarters for compliance on August 6th of the 25th year, in official letter number 2542 from the Opium Suppression Bureau. It is imperative to pay attention to the smuggling of drugs. This case occurred because the felon escaped due to a lack of attention beforehand. In addition to issuing instructions, we are sending another official letter requesting that you review the previous case and thoroughly instruct your staff to pay attention. Although this is the case, this ministry previously approved a letter from the Military Affairs Commission stating that for joint transport luggage picked up outside of inspection hours, the stationmaster should instruct the railway police to inspect it together when the items are picked up. If there are privately transported drugs, it is certain that the suspect will try to escape. Special attention should be paid to the situation during inspection. This was previously communicated in an official order. Now that the preceding has been approved, in addition to issuing separate instructions, we are reiterating the previous order and instructing the railway to comply strictly to emphasize the importance of opium suppression. This order.'"

### Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Approves Installation of Electric Lights on Zi Di Embankment

The gentry of Zidi Town (Zhuzhai) in the western district of this city, including Hou Quanda and hundreds of businesses such as Wang Dachang, have noted that all the surrounding towns and villages have installed electric lights, illuminating the night. Only their town is lacking. Therefore, between June and October of last year, they petitioned the Bureau of Public Utilities three times, requesting that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company be ordered to install electric lights. They also sent a letter to the Local Association for assistance. The Local Association's board of directors approved this and forwarded a request to the municipal government on their behalf.

### Qingning Escapes Danger and Comes to Shanghai

The Haiyi and Qingning vessels collided seven miles downstream from Nanjing. The first and second holds of the Qingning vessel were breached and flooded. The vessel ran aground on its own. The Haiyi vessel was undamaged and able to continue. The China Ship Insurance Association had planned to send Xu Zufan to the scene of the accident to inspect the Qingning vessel. However, yesterday morning, the Hwanin Wheel Company received a telegram from the owner of the Qingning vessel stating that they had used cement and wooden planks to repair the breaches in the first and second holds and floated the vessel off the sandbar during high tide.

Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to reorganize into the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Director Cai has issued a general order that all sub-bureaus and teams be named "Shanghai Municipal Police Sub-Bureau" or "Sub-Station." It is reported that the organizational aspect is currently being discussed by the Bureau Affairs Committee. It is said that the original eight sub-bureaus and more than twenty police stations in this city will be changed to twenty sub-bureaus, and all remote police stations will be changed to sub-outposts. The original three-tier system will be changed to a two-tier system so that they report directly to the bureau director more nimbly. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval before implementation. Although the name has been changed in name, it will remain the same for the time being.

### Counterfeit Money-Making Operation Cracked in Rue Routeville

Over Two Hundred Counterfeit Bills Seized; Three Suspects Arrested and Sent to the Public Security Bureau for Interrogation

Zhu Yulin, also known as Zhu Zhixiang, resident of the first-floor front room at 6 Renchang Lane, 30 Route Routeville, was previously arrested and imprisoned for five years for making counterfeit money. After being released on parole in October of last year, he did not change his ways and continued his counterfeit money-making business. His middleman, Ke Guangsheng, also known as Liu Chang, was arrested by Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau detectives on December 30th of last year in the Tangjiawan Chinese area. He confessed that the counterfeit money-making operation was located at Zhu Yulin's home at 6 Renchang Lane on Route Routeville. Detective Zhang Linqing and Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police Station went to 6 Renchang Lane, Route Routeville, to arrest the accomplices. However, the main suspect, Zhu Yulin, was out on business and escaped. Only suspects Liu Ziting, Jiang Yuqian, Xu Caoshi, and Geng Taikun were apprehended. Counterfeit bills from the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Guangdong Provincial Exchange Coupon, Four Provinces Farmers Bank, and Chinese Farmers Bank, worth ten yuan, five yuan, and one yuan, totaling 250 bills with a value of 486 yuan, were seized. In addition, 32 seals with the names of the Chinese Farmers Bank, Four Provinces Farmers Bank, Hubei Province, Zhejiang Local, and Central South banks that had not been impressed and many mimeographed attachments were confiscated. They were taken to the French Concession Police Station and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau sent a written request, dispatching squad leader Wang Peiting to the case, requesting that the defendants and evidence be transferred to the case and investigated by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. After the court questioned the defendants, it asked Gu Shouxi, the lawyer from the Police Department, for his opinion on the transfer. The court ruled that the three suspects, Liu Ziting, Jiang Yuqian, and Xu Caoshi, along with the counterfeit bills and seals, should be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation. The suspect, Geng Taikun, was remanded in custody and the trial was rescheduled for the 14th.

Upon inspection, it was found that over 2,000 yuan in banknotes, as well as pearls and diamonds, worth more than 10,000 yuan, had been lost. However, the owner did not report the incident to the local police station until late at night, forcing the detectives to search for the robbers' whereabouts throughout the night. It is unknown if they will find any clues.

### Municipal Government Promotes Labor Service

Most Districts Focus on River Dredging; First Phase Expected to Be Completed in Mid-April

In addition to Gaoqiao, most other districts are focusing on river dredging. All service personnel within ten li of the project should participate, so the total number of participants in each district reaches more than 50,000. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed in mid-April. The committee is currently sending personnel to supervise the labor service personnel in each district to carry out dredging work, and the progress is going smoothly.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating, "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: Investigation reveals that the central government's income tax collection began on January 1st of this year. The collection procedure involves numerous details. The previously promulgated implementation rules are not sufficient to cover all aspects. It is understood that your ministry plans to issue separate collection guidelines. Now that tax collection has begun, but the guidelines have not yet been promulgated, taxpayers are at a loss as to how to comply, especially regarding the calculation of interim reports. We request that you issue the guidelines as soon as possible so that we may comply. We eagerly await your instructions. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows in respect."

### Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital Revokes Registration License

The Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital on the corner of Haining Road and Ke Xiong Road was opened by Dr. Shen Zhaoquan. Since its establishment, its business has been slow. Shen Zhaoquan, with far-fetched ideas, specialized in recruiting medical students to achieve his fraudulent purposes. In March of the 24th year, he advertised for recruitment, which was ordered to be banned by the former Ministry of Interior Health Department, and issued to this city's Health Bureau. Shen Zhaoquan, obstinately unrepentant, advertised for recruitment twice again on August 13th and October 28th of the 25th year. The Health and Social Bureaus jointly sent personnel to investigate and found that students Lu Yingjun, Deng Lichao, and others all expressed regret at being deceived and requested assistance. The bureaus separately issued warnings and ordered the students to be dismissed and tuition fees to be refunded. However, after several months, Shen Zhaoquan ignored the orders and deceived the Social Bureau, claiming that the students had already been dismissed, to cover up his deceitful crimes. The bureaus, recognizing that Shen Zhaoquan had repeatedly committed illegal acts, disregarded government orders, and deceived youth, leaving no room for further leniency, revoked his doctor's registration license and ordered him to cease operations. The Social Bureau strictly ordered him to dismiss the students and refund their tuition fees as punishment and to deter others from following suit.

### Chen Qiucao's Exhibition to Aid Sui Reaches Its Final Day

The Chen Qiucao Lyric Development Exhibition, a pioneering effort in the art world to aid Suiyuan, has been open since the beginning of the New Year and has lasted for over a week. All sectors of Shanghai have paid exceptional attention to it, and various newspapers have published eulogies, praising it as a great and deeply meaningful demonstration. Despite the severe cold, the number of viewers has been high, mainly because, although many painting exhibitions have been held in recent years, few have had the substantial content, stimulating themes, and profound impact on people as Chen's exhibition. In recent days, both Chinese and foreign reporters have visited the exhibition to view it, and writers have recorded detailed accounts. Famous photographers Lu Shifu and Ao Huan Gong have personally taken photographs of the grand occasion of the venue. The Chinese painter Wang Geyi also composed a poem on the spot to congratulate the exhibition. Viewers were deeply moved by Chen's sincerity in exhibiting paintings to aid Suiyuan and the enthusiasm and abundance of his works, and many lingered, reluctant to leave. Today is the last day of the exhibition, and those who love art and are enthusiastic about the aid-Suiyuan movement should not miss this opportunity.

### Disaster Relief Association Plans to Allocate Another 20,000 Yuan to Huixui for Disaster Relief

Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong Arrive in Sui – Telegram Reports the Bitter Suffering of Disaster in Sui

The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, recognizing the urgent need for relief for the disaster victims in the Suiyuan area, specially dispatched Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong, standing committee members of the association, carrying a large quantity of winter clothing and medicines for disaster relief. It is now learned that the association received a telegram yesterday from Yang and Feng, stating: "The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association understands that Cai et al. arrived in Guisui on Yu Ri'an and were warmly welcomed by all sectors. According to local officials and gentry, the unprecedented victory in the Sui battle was due to the meritorious service of the soldiers, but the unity and shared hatred of the enemy among the people of all regions was even more crucial. Consequently, many were wounded, and the damage to houses, livestock, and implements is being investigated. Currently, the residents of the war zone are without clothing, food, or shelter, wandering and displaced, suffering from hunger and cold, in extreme misery, urgently requiring relief for no less than tens of thousands of people. In addition to the allocation of 100,000 yuan, it is hoped that funds will be raised quickly and continuously provided to save the lives of all. Ye et al. are scheduled to depart with the committee and provincial officials to inspect the affected areas, with further reports to follow. Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong bow in respect." It is also learned that after receiving the telegram, the association plans to first allocate another 20,000 yuan to Huixui for disaster relief.

### Two Brothers Prevented from Visiting Relatives After Secretly Leaving with Their Father's Belongings

Currently Held at the Railway Police Department, Awaiting Relatives to Claim Them and Take Them Home

At 1:00 AM yesterday, at the South Railway Station, railway police officer Wang Deying discovered two boys, approximately twelve or thirteen years old, at the station. They claimed they wanted to buy tickets to travel to Xieqiao to visit relatives. Officer Wang, concerned that the two children were young and traveling far, fearing they might encounter an accident, questioned them in detail. He learned their names were Zhou Zhongkui, thirteen years old, and Zhou Yanzhong, twelve years old, brothers. Their father's name is Zhou Shusong, from Haining, and he works at the Donglai Photo Studio on Dongmen Road, Xiaodongmen, residing at No. 60, Fengyu Lane, Sappho Road in the French Concession. They had studied at Zhuqiao Elementary School in their hometown. At 9:00 AM yesterday, they stole a piece of clothing from their father, pawned it for eight jiao, and planned to take the train to Xieqiao to visit their aunt, the Shen family, and so on. They were taken to the Railway Police Department to await relatives to claim them and take them home.

### Ye Linsheng Searches for Wife, Wife Denies Being Married

Ye Linsheng, a Taoist priest from Zhitang, Taicang, in his prime, married Ms. Ba Ruibao (currently 25 years old) from the same village ten years ago. They had a child, now seven years old. Ba Ruishi left in the 23rd year (a previous report mistakenly stated the 13th year), saying she was going to Shanghai to work as a servant, and never returned. There has been no news since. After Ruishi came to Shanghai, she was introduced by someone and married Zhou Zhaozhang (from Ningbo), the owner of a milk shed in Fenglinqiao, West Shanghai, as a concubine. It was not until recently, after Ba Ruishi sent a letter to her mother, that Ba Yin'nan, Ruishi's cousin, learned of this and informed Ye Linsheng. Ye Linsheng came to Shanghai to find her and learned that Tang Xinfu, a matchmaker and fellow villager who owns a matchmaking shop at No. 49, Dongxinqiao Street, had arranged for Ruibao to remarry. Ye et al. went to Zhou's place and took Ruibao out, taking her to the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to stay, intending to take the train back to their hometown the next morning. However, the next morning, Tang Jinfu gathered people to the hotel and stopped Ba Ruibao from leaving. Ye Linsheng then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Tang Jinfu, Ba Suobao, and others of disrupting his family. After a preliminary hearing, the defendants did not appear, and it was announced that the date would be changed. This was reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Judge Wang Gangxu presided over a continued hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The two defendants arrived with lawyers. First, the plaintiff, Ye Linsheng, testified that his wife was brought to Shanghai by Tang Xinlan in March of the 23rd year. This time, he found her at the milk shed, took her back to the hotel, and the next morning, Tang came and took his wife away. When Tang Jinfu was questioned, he denied participating in Ba Ruishi's marriage and denied having recommended Ba as a servant. He said that because Ye and Ba Yin'nan came to him to ask him to send a message, he asked Ruishi to meet at the hotel, but he did not stop Ye from taking Ruishi home. Ba Ruibao denied marrying Li and said that when she was young, her mother arranged an engagement for her, and the child was hers. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that after the previous court hearing, he suddenly received a criminal complaint from the First Special District Court, in which Ba Ruishi accused Ye Linsheng of restricting her freedom. Ba denied being married to Ye and did not admit to having a child. Ba Ruishi admitted to the news police that she was married to Ye and was willing to go home with her husband. The news police have a record. Whether Ba and Ye are formally married is a procedural question. He has requested the First Special District Court to investigate the news police record and presented a copy of the summons and complaint from the First Special District Court. He also stated that Ba Ruishi had hired a lawyer to publish a notice of divorce in the newspaper and presented the newspaper and the engagement documents. He requested that the file from the First Special District Court be investigated so that the truth could be clarified. Furthermore, Ba Ruibao's testimony in court today contradicts her testimony in the First Special District Court. He requested that this be noted in the record. When Ba Ruibao was questioned, she said that Hua Linsheng had come to cheat her. She was working as a servant at Li's residence at No. 5, Lane 302, Seymour Road, and had not married a Zhou family member. How could she have money to be cheated, so she accused Ye Linsheng of extortion? After verifying the testimony, it was decided that the hearing would be continued on the 16th. Tang Jinfu was released on bail.

Children's Special

### Setting a Year's Work Plan with the Lowest Standards

— Hua Ling

At the beginning of each year, almost every child always makes a plan that is as complete as possible. At the beginning of this year, I want to advise children to start with small things and do what they can with their lowest abilities. Here are a few examples:

Accumulate One Cent a Day: In general, children's savings plans always involve saving a dime or two a day. If you can save a dime or two every day, that's great, but saving a dime or two every day is almost like saving all your pocket money. Three or five days are no problem, but as the days go by, watching classmates eat snacks and candy is inevitable, and you can't help but regret that you shouldn't have saved so completely, leaving you with so little money in your hand. So you are unhappy to save, and all previous efforts are abandoned. So I now advocate accumulating one cent a day to develop the habit of saving. Fortunately, one cent won't affect your pocket money.

Do One Good Deed a Day: When making plans, you don't have to plan to save the country, save the nation, and other big problems. It's best to plan to do one good deed a day or to work for a while every day. For example, when walking on the street, if you see a vendor knocking over a load, help him pick it up. If you see a banana peel on the side of the street, pick it up and throw it in the trash can, and so on. If you plan to work once a day, then sweeping the floor, wiping the windows, and so on are all possible. These may seem to have no great significance, but they are very useful in cultivating a spirit of service. If a person can develop a spirit of service from childhood, he will not worry about not being able to stand up for what is right when he grows up.

Learn One Character a Day: Learning one character a day seems too little, but if we can really learn one character a day, that's enough. The so-called learning one character a day here needs to be explained. For example, if you learn the character "天" (tiān, sky), we don't just mean knowing the appearance of the character "天", knowing the pronunciation of the character "天", and being able to write it. At a minimum, you must fully understand the meaning of the character "天" and all the nouns and adjectives related to the character "天". Then, in the future, no matter where you read "天×" or "×天", you will be able to fully understand it. If you can also understand the usage of the character "天", that would naturally be even better.

The so-called "accumulate one cent a day", "do one good deed a day", and "learn one character a day" here are just the lowest standards. If you have a slightly stronger ability, you can naturally change "one" to "two" or "three", all of which are possible. The most important thing is to be consistent. If "accumulating two cents a day" is a bit difficult, it is better to "accumulate one cent a day" to avoid interruption. If the grades are excellent every year, then from the second year onwards, you may wish to slightly increase the standards you set. In this way, step by step, after ten years, you will become a young person with perseverance, responsibility, thrift, and great knowledge.

### The Four Little Heroes

— Zhen Lu

Even in his twilight years, on this New Year's Day when everything is renewed, seeing the four children, all the same age and similar in appearance, coming to wish him a Happy New Year and calling him grandpa, filled Old Li's heart with infinite joy. He smiled and beckoned them to come closer, saying kindly, "It's so coincidental that you four children were born in the same year, and today you are all eleven years old. Now you are all studying in school, preparing to be people in the future. But what skills do you want to learn, and what things do you want to do in the future? You can take turns in order of seniority and tell me about it. ... Yuan, your birthday is the earliest, you speak first."

So Zhao Yuan stepped forward and said loudly:

"Our country has never had a complete legal system, and the people do not know the meaning of the law, so people's hearts are mostly bad, and everything is not on track. I am willing to study law and strive to create a country ruled by law."

Qian Heng, without waiting to be called, interjected:

"The law should be improved, but it is inevitable that some people will use force to subdue others. The best effect of hard work is the so-called 'people are forced to be shameless.' I want to study art, hoping to use aesthetic education to transform people and improve the spiritual civilization of the public, so as to achieve the realm of world harmony."

Sun Li, because his companions usually gave him the nickname "Little Merchant" based on his actions, was about to speak, but he was shy first. Unable to withstand the urging of the crowd, he honestly expressed:

"Everyone knows that my father is a businessman, and I also hope to inherit my father's business, but I want to work hard to develop it. The teacher said: 'If the country is rich, the people will be strong. Only when people are well-fed and clothed will they know etiquette.' To know the way to manage money is to study economics, right?"

The youngest Li Zhen straightened his clothes and spoke eloquently:

"Military force is omnipotent! Only military force can conquer everything! In this world of power, it is necessary to strengthen the army and consolidate the national defense line. I am very interested in military science and want to be a person who dominates the world!"

The decisive words came from a powerful mouth, and the thumbs could not help but be raised!

Although their thoughts are different, they are all patriotic little citizens. Old Li was very happy and earnestly encouraged them in their respective ambitions.

The sound of firecrackers,

Out with the old, in with the new,

Let's think,

Have we added some new knowledge!

New habits, good temperament?

Did you get up early?

Did you study hard?

Are you clean?

Worth our reflection?

It's not about wearing new clothes,

Wearing a new hat,

Watching a movie,

That's the "new" of "year"

One year passes, one year older,

The responsibility of each year increases,

Listen to the sound of firecrackers once, you have to prepare once,

How to push away the country's misfortune

How to aspire to be a new person

### A Chemical Toy

— Wang Ziding

Electric Spark Branch

Dear children: The New Year is here, let's make some games that are helpful to learning and very interesting. Here I will tell you about a chemical toy.

The name of this chemical toy is "Electric Spark Branch". I think you children must be saying that you have never heard of it! But I can guarantee that you have all seen it. That is a copper wire with gray-salt-colored powder on the top. As long as you light it with a match, it will burn, and at the same time, it will emit many needle-like sparks (see picture) until the powder is burned out. Because the sparks are like needles, many people don't call it "Electric Spark Branch" but call it "Dot Dot Needle".

Children! Haven't you seen this before?

Going to a Guanghuo store to buy one will probably cost four or five coins, but if we make it ourselves, it won't cost that much. At the same time, making it ourselves is more interesting, and it is also somewhat helpful to learning.

Now let's talk about how to make it!

Applied chemicals - Weaving powder one part, sulfur flower one part, saltpeter five parts, magnesium powder three parts. (The total is less than two jiao.)

Other supplies - Glue, copper wire (or iron wire.)

First, grind the saltpeter and sulfur flower into a fine powder, then mix them with aluminum powder and magnesium powder. Add glue and mix with chopsticks. Then you can use a brush to moisten and apply it to the upper end of the copper wire. (Apply evenly.) After applying, put it in the sun to dry (see picture). In this way, an "Electric Spark Branch" is successfully made.

When the "Electric Spark Branch" catches fire and burns, we shouldn't be afraid of the sparks: these sparks are not dangerous. Touching them will not hurt your hand, and touching paper will not burn it, because they cannot last.

### The Number of Aircraft in the World's Major Powers

— (Ning Ziqiang)

Children! Since everyone dedicated airplanes to celebrate birthdays, everyone's impression of the importance of airplanes is of course very deep. It is not only enriching national defense and resisting foreign insults, but also the only competitive weapon of various countries today! Now, I will report the number of aircraft in the world's major powers to you.

Soviet Russia 7,150 aircraft

France 5,200 aircraft

England 3,600 aircraft

United States 3,650 aircraft

Italy 2,800 aircraft

Germany 3,000 aircraft

Japan 1,900 aircraft

Looking at the air force equipment of the above countries, and looking back at our country, it is far from being able to reach it, it is precisely "a drop in the ocean".

### Quick Knife

— Huai Liang

Prepare two bowls of the same height and size, a chopstick or other bamboo strip, its length should be two inches longer than the diameter of the two bowls. A kitchen knife.

When playing, put eight points of water in each of the two bowls, and arrange them side by side on a wooden board, the distance between the two bowls is about an inch, and put the chopsticks on the two bowls.

The most important thing to pay attention to is that the chopsticks should be placed in the center of the two bowls. The two ends of the chopsticks should be outside the edge of the bowl, if it is a little off, it will fail

If you, dear friends, cut the chopsticks with this knife, do you think the water in these two bowls will be affected? That's natural! Either the bowl is crushed, or the water splashes everywhere! That's not right, these two bowls and water are not affected, the bowl will not be crushed, and the water will not fly around.

If you don't believe it, try it, raise the kitchen knife, and chop the center of the chopsticks with a "chop" sound. Only the chopsticks are divided into two sections, and the water in the bowl does not move. Children, isn't it very interesting?

### Blood

— Zhen

One day, Min'er accidentally broke the skin on his hand, and bright red blood quickly flowed out, staining his left hand with bright red color.

"Quickly tie up his hand, so that the blood will not flow out again, it is better, "Ting'er said anxiously to him, and quickly went to get the hemostatic lotion.

They were busy for a while, and the blood on Min'er's left hand gradually stopped flowing out.

"Don't be too bold, this is not a game, blood is a very important thing, you can't let it flow out too much, flowing out too much is dangerous," Ting'er was not as playful as before, but solemnly explained to his young and ignorant brother.

"Brother, the blood on my hand has stopped, so it doesn't matter, look, what is this light yellow liquid."

"This light yellow liquid is secreted when the blood clots, so we know that blood is not a simple liquid, there are many solids in it, and those solids are blood cells, and the liquid is plasma, so in the blood, solids and liquids account for about half each.

"The blood cells you are talking about are white blood cells' blood cells?"

"You need to know that blood cells contain white blood cells and red blood cells. These white blood cells are used by our human body to resist the invasion of harmful bacteria from the outside. If they can't resist them, then people will get sick. But white blood cells are a strange thing, they can move freely, creeping along the walls of tiny tubes, they can pass through the walls of these capillaries, swim out of the tube, and engulf foreign germs, but their number is very small, about 500 red blood cells have one white blood cell. Red blood cells contain yellowish-red hemoglobin, and because of the difference in hemoglobin, there are now five major races in the world - red, yellow, white, brown, and black.

"Then what is the use of blood for the human body?"

"The importance of blood to the human body is like the people in a country. Blood circulates continuously in the human body, on the one hand, it transports the nutrients that have been made in the human bone marrow to all parts of the body, and on the other hand, it excretes the waste from the whole body. If the blood stops flowing, then the person will die. But the flow of blood depends entirely on the beating of the heart."

### Filial Piety (11)

— Hai

Empress Maria Feodorovna was a most kind and simple woman. She received Princess Tarakanova in her private chamber and listened very gently to her story. After hearing it, she repeatedly praised the old monk, promising to intercede with the Emperor on her behalf, and granted her three hundred rubles for her immediate needs. Tarakanova was incredibly grateful and speechless. Afterwards, when Madame Vivien asked her about her audience with the Empress, she was so happy that tears streamed down her face.

Two days later, Empress Maria Feodorovna personally took her to see the Emperor and Empress Elizabeth. The Emperor and Empress were very moved by her story and treated her with great kindness. They even ordered a re-examination of her father's case. When she left, she received an additional five thousand rubles as a reward.

From the moment Princess Tarakanova entered the palace, those who had previously paid little attention to her immediately took notice. They all praised her beautiful face and remarked on her distinguished bearing, eagerly inviting her to their homes. However, Princess Tarakanova remained calm and showed no signs of being carried away. She never thought of her own comfort, nor was she proud of the favorable outcome. She simply retained her innocence and accepted people's kindness. One noble lady took her to see many magnificent halls in the palace. When they pointed out the Emperor's throne to her, she suddenly stopped and exclaimed in surprise, "Is that really the throne? When I thought of it in Siberia, I was so afraid!" In that instant, all her past hopes and disappointments, worries and fears, seemed to flood her heart like a tide. She raised her hands and cried out, "What a throne for an Emperor!" She was so excited that she almost fainted. Then, she asked for permission to approach it, knelt down, kissed the steps before the throne, and cried out to the sky: "Father! Father! Look, the authority of God has led me to this place! My God, bless this throne—bless the holy Son of Heaven who sits upon it—grant him infinite joy, just as he has made me happy!" At that moment, the two noble ladies could barely get her to leave the throne. She remained kneeling there, refusing to move. But because she was so overcome with emotion, she was exhausted and could no longer continue the tour.

### The Esperanto Movement in China Over the Past Year

— Ganglin

1936 was a year of suffering. The national enemy's invasion of China reached its most severe stage, and the tide of the national salvation movement surged everywhere in the country. In such an environment, what progress has the Esperanto movement made?

First, Esperanto has been applied to the national salvation movement. In the past, most people who learned Esperanto used it as a tool for their own knowledge or enjoyment. It seemed that learning Esperanto would allow them to read many more books and achieve their goal of seeking knowledge, or they could use Esperanto to engage in international correspondence, make many foreign friends, and exchange books, newspapers, pictures, stamps, and so on, to satisfy their desires for hobbies and interests. But this year, domestic Esperantists rarely displayed such ambitions based on individualism. In Peiping, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, large groups of Esperantists used Esperanto to participate in the national salvation movement. Under the slogan "Use Esperanto for the freedom and liberation of China," they organized international correspondence groups and published correspondence publications, such as Peiping's "Radio" and Shanghai's "China Roars!" (Cinjo Hurias), which made great efforts this year to report the current situation in China to international people. In particular, the latter was able to frankly and objectively report the suffering situation in China to the international people as much as possible, which has won them a lot of praise. At the same time, Esperantists from various places have also translated many foreign communications and published them in domestic publications, such as the civil war in Spain, which provided domestic publications with a lot of valuable materials. These all confirmed the great significance of the Esperanto movement in the national liberation movement, and that modern Esperantists have indeed shouldered the task of using Esperanto to participate in the national salvation movement.

Second, the universal expansion of the movement. We cannot deny that in many places, such as Kunming, Changsha, Fuzhou, Guiyang, etc., the Esperanto movement was quite silent this year. But in other places such as Peiping, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuchang, Hangzhou, Nanning, Tianjin, Hong Kong, etc., there has been great new progress, and a large number of new Esperantists have emerged. In other inland counties, there were also more individual learners than in previous years, which can be indirectly proved by the large number of elementary textbooks, dictionaries, etc. sold in various places by Shanghai.

Third, the deepening of social understanding of Esperanto. The Esperanto movement has a history of thirty years in China, but it has not been noticed by people. In recent years, due to the tireless efforts of the workers of the Esperanto movement, such as the progress of publicity methods, and the regular publication of Esperanto translations in various publications, the social understanding of Esperanto has deepened day by day. In the past, there were often some people with prejudices who came out to obstruct or even destroy the Esperanto movement, but this phenomenon did not occur this year. At the same time, the government also understood the essence of the Esperanto movement and confirmed that the Esperanto movement has a considerable contribution to the national resistance movement. Therefore, many groups have been approved for registration by the authorities; for example, in Guangzhou, Nanning, and Taiyuan, the Esperanto movement has been given considerable and generous support by the authorities, and has been given many conveniences in its work.

Fourth, the active Esperanto publishing industry. This year, the Esperanto publishing industry has unprecedented harvests in quantity. The most important books, in Shanghai alone, have been published as "International Esperanto Communication Collection," "Elementary Lecture Textbook," "Emerging Language Theory," "New Theory of Esperanto," "Esperanto Translation Research," "Esperanto Grammar Rhetoric Lecture," "How I Learned," "Voice of the World," "Fifty Years of Esperanto" and many other types; and other places such as Guangzhou have also published several types. Publications such as Shanghai's "The World" have been published for four years, and have been improved in form and content this year. Shanghai's "China Roars" has also been changed to letterpress. In addition to "Light of Esperanto" and "Radio" in Peiping, there is a new publication called "Aurora Star." Guangzhou has two new publications, "Hell" and "Storm." Hangzhou has "Oasis" and Hong Kong has "New Culture", both of which are published as supplements to the local newspapers. The activity of this kind of publication reflects how rapid the progress of the Esperanto movement in China has been this year.

1937 is the 50th anniversary of the birth of Esperanto. What work will the more than 20,000 Esperantists across the country do this year? What kind of development will the Chinese Esperanto movement have this year? I think this is a matter worthy of attention by the cultural circles in the future.

### China's Urgent Task Today

— Ye Qing

China's history in the past century is a history of transition from feudalism to capitalism. But the world in the past century has begun a transition from capitalism to socialism. Because the world is China's environment, the transition from capitalism to socialism must act on China's transition from feudalism to capitalism. This is an unavoidable thing.

In my opinion, the greatest of these effects was from the "May Fourth" to "1927" stage. It made our eighteenth-century Enlightenment thought abruptly encounter nineteenth-century social thought, and made our February Revolution-style national revolution have the possibility of abruptly transitioning to the October Revolution-style social revolution. At that time, there were two futures for China: capitalism and non-capitalism. But the resolution of this contradiction moved China's revolutionary direction to the side of capitalism.

Once history embarks on a certain stage, it cannot be changed according to our subjective wishes. It must go through a considerable period of time before it can reach the side of its own opposition. Only then can we change its direction and make it embark on a new stage. Therefore, although human power can promote history, it can only promote it, and there is an indispensable natural growth.

And the transition from capitalism to socialism in the world? There was a climax in the "May Fourth" era, so it stimulated our Enlightenment movement and thereby stimulated our national revolution. But after "1927", the climax has long passed. The new climax has not yet arrived. This is simply a receding era, a low tide era. Therefore, the influence of the world's transition from capitalism to socialism on China is very small. It can be said to be equal to zero.

Under these two circumstances, the attempt to disobey the historical decision of "1927" to move China towards capitalism and to reverse China's transition from feudalism to capitalism so that it becomes a transition from capitalism to socialism in order to leap over the capital stage, failed. Artificially brewed climaxes are just fantasies to comfort oneself. All movements, whether it is the Red Army or the Soviets, are nothing more than an unpromising peasant movement. China's history is still in the transition from feudalism to capitalism.

Therefore, we cannot but give a new examination and a new analysis to the history before and after "1927" until now. In this way, we feel that China's history from the Opium War to the present is still in the stage of transition from feudalism to capitalism. The possibility of the transition from capitalism to socialism in "1927" was only a reaction caused by the stimulation of China by the climax of the world's transition from capitalism to socialism, and can only be a flash in the pan. And today when it cannot give China stimulation, China's history must follow its own direction.

Here, I would like to explain a few words about the general process of transition from feudalism to capitalism. This process is completed with a revolution. The revolution in the transition from feudalism to capitalism is the movement of the capitalist citizens against the feudal aristocracy. It is usually called the democratic revolution, that is, the anti-feudal civic revolution. This kind of civic revolution has three characteristics: "for democracy, that is, opposing aristocratic politics and establishing democratic politics, which can be represented by the revolutions of England and France;" for the nation, that is, opposing feudal countries and establishing national countries, which can be represented by the independence of the Netherlands and the United States; and for unity, that is, opposing separatist forces and establishing a unified regime, which can be represented by the unification movement of Germany and Italy. Any civic revolution must have these three characteristics in order to complete its democratic, national and unified tasks. Because in this way, history can pass from feudalism to capitalism. The aforementioned civic revolutions of the six countries of England, France, the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and Italy are only in terms of their special development in a certain aspect under their respective historical conditions.

China's history, in the current stage, is in the transition from feudalism to capitalism, then there can be no exception. That is to say, it must make a civic revolution, and develop

## Page 20

the three aspects of this revolution to complete its democratic, national and unified tasks. In this way, it can pass from feudalism to capitalism, and complete the historical development of the current stage.

According to this view, the civic revolution is a general process of change in the current stage of history. Then, the democratic nature of this revolution as expressed by the Xinhai Revolution, has it not overthrown the Manchu aristocracy and established a democratic republic? The national nature of this revolution as expressed by the National Revolution of 1927, has it not loudly called for the overthrow of imperialism, and taken the warlords as the tools of imperialism, and established a national government that can be translated as a national government? The unified nature of this revolution as expressed by the unification war since 1928, has it not used the slogan of unification to overthrow the separatist forces in order to establish and consolidate a unified central government? These three characteristics have unfolded into three periods in China, becoming the three tasks of China's civic revolution.

Why can't they be completed all at once in China? In other words, why are they divided into three periods? This can be explained by China's special situation. What should be paid attention to here is that it is not enough for China to complete only one of the three tasks of the civic revolution. If one revolution only completes one, then another revolution must be made to complete the others. The facts show this very clearly.

Perhaps some people say that the Xinhai Revolution did not complete democratic politics, and the National Revolution did not complete the national movement. Your analysis is incorrect. Then, please note: The failure of the Xinhai Revolution to complete democratic politics was because it did not complete unification at that time: The failure of the National Revolution to complete the national movement was also because it did not complete unification at that time; therefore, unification has a key effect on democracy and the nation.

Without unification, there will be separatist forces. Separatist forces are feudal and incompatible with democracy. In the past, everyone advocated provincial constitutions, thinking that with constitutions in each province, it would be better. But in fact, even if provincial constitutions existed, they could not be implemented. At that time, everyone advocated federalism for China, thinking that this could eliminate separatism and civil war. But in fact, it was completely impossible. Therefore, the national constitution is the same as the provincial constitution, all because separatist forces exist and cannot be put into effect. This shows that democracy is a political form of a unified country. There is no democracy without unification.

The success of the national movement also depends on unification. The fact that Germany and Italy in the nineteenth century were able to become independent and autonomous countries came from their unification movement. It is completely national suicide to have foreign troubles and internal separatist wars. Today, when a certain imperialism is using a divisive policy to gradually carve up China, the method of dealing with it is the unification movement. Otherwise, if we are the clam and the oyster, and the enemy is the fisherman, there will be no country that will not perish. This has been said bitterly in Moscow's Pravda and New Dawn Daily. Therefore, if we do not say resistance to the enemy to save the country, then if we say resistance to the enemy to save the country, we must complete unification. This is a self-evident and unchangeable principle.

Then, the unification that the third period of China's civic revolution is engaged in is very important. It is not only the urgent task at present, but also the urgent task of completing the revolutions of the first two periods. This is a necessary logic.

Anyone who defines the Chinese revolution in the current stage as a civic revolution ("second-property-class-nature-of-the-people's-rights-revolution") cannot oppose unification. And they should actively demand unification and complete unification. Recognizing unification as the work of China's civic revolution, as the necessary process for China to pass from feudalism to capitalism, as the key to China's completion of democratic politics internally and the national movement externally in the present, can not only make us understand the history of the past 25 years, especially the history of the past 9 years, but also make us understand our work in the current stage. This is a very important thing.

### The National Academy of Music and Dance in Paris

— Junming

Paris, this "capital of art and literature," this famous "city of flowers," has so much to see and do that it is impossible to describe it all. But everyone knows about the Palace of Versailles, the museums, and the Arc de Triomphe, so there is no need to go into detail here. In addition to these, there is another place in Paris, no, even in Europe, that is very famous and that few people ever talk about specifically: this place is the famous music and dance theater—"The National Academy of Music and Dance."

The "National Academy of Music and Dance" in Paris is one of the national theaters of France, located in the center of Paris. The grand and beautiful building that we see now was not built in recent years: in fact, it has quite a history. It is said that as far back as half a century ago, in 1861, an architect named Charles Garnier began to build this music and dance theater, and it was largely completed at the end of 1874, and the opening ceremony was held on January 5, 1875. The cost of the project was 36.5 million francs, and the cost of purchasing the land was 10.5 million francs, for a total of nearly 50 million francs. However, before that, it went through eleven changes of location, lasting about two hundred years, before it was fixed in its current location; at the same time, the name of the theater also went through nine changes during that long period. In this way, the magnificence of the theater's construction, its position and value among general theaters, can be imagined.

Indeed, the architecture of the "National Academy of Music and Dance" itself is a work of art. Standing on the streets of Paris, just looking at its exterior is already quite impressive; if you go inside, you will be even more amazed by the greatness of its design and the luxury of its arrangement. Its stage is 14 meters high, 54 meters wide, and 26 meters deep; it is really not an exaggeration to say that it is the "world's top stage." A huge fireproof iron gate is set up between the audience seats and the stage, which is very safe. The dancers' rooms are separate: generally, first-class singers and dancers have one room per person; most of the other members of the choir or temporary personnel share a room, but men and women are separated; second-class and below singers and dancers have two, three, up to seven or eight people per room. There are also various offices for the theater staff, a library, and a museum.

This music and dance theater has a total of 1,200 audience seats. It employs about 1,200 people, from the general manager to the gatekeepers, firefighters, and workers, including about 60 professional singers, a choir of about 100 people, about 200 dancers, and an orchestra of about 160 people, for a total of about 500 people in the art department.

There are no definite regulations for the appointment of professional singers here. It is entirely up to the general manager to recruit them. So in reality, although many of these singers are highly praised, they are not necessarily all first-class artists. However, the music and dance of this music and dance theater in Paris is very famous, and almost everyone engaged in music and dance wants to come here to find a way out; as long as there is a shortage of personnel in the choir here, the number of applicants is often more than seven or eight times the number of vacancies.

Personnel who come here to apply must pass two tests before they can be admitted as members; at the same time, in the first year, new members must not only have the obligation to perform in 194 performances, but also receive training in the theater for three afternoons a week. In addition, male and female students of the official music school are required to study at public expense, so if this national theater requires them to perform temporarily while they are studying, they cannot refuse. As for the general choir members, most of them have part-time jobs.

The "National Academy of Music and Dance" in Paris also has an affiliated music and dance school. The students here, aged eight to nine, must also receive elementary compulsory education; the time for specialized dance training is five years for the elementary level; three years for the first grade, and two years for the second grade. These students must hold one to three competitive examinations each year. After passing the examination, they are incorporated into the theater's music and dance troupe. The so-called "little mice of Coterse" are students of this music and dance school. As for the status and level of all music and dance men and women, that is the same as in other places, and the highest is something like "star" or "queen."

There are eight kinds of tickets for the theater: the lowest is 3 francs per ticket, and the highest is 61 francs per ticket. But on the International Day of July 14th every year, it is open to the general public for one day, and tickets are not sold.

The French government issues a subsidy of 2.4 million francs to this national theater every year, and a special person is entrusted to manage it. This person is the general manager of the theater, and of course also a government official. His term of office is seven years, and during these seven years, in addition to the originally performed programs, he must add 17 new programs, of which 14 must be the works of French composers; at the same time, the theater must have 190 ticketed performances within one year.

In addition to these general performances, the largest dance party in Europe to help sick and weak children—the "White Bed Dance Party"—and the dance party of the Paris fashion merchants are held every year in January in this "National Academy of Music and Dance"; and the grand occasion of these two special dance parties is of course not comparable to ordinary dance parties at ordinary times.

However, what most people do not know is the mysterious basement of this theater. What is particularly interesting here is the "sound storage room." In detail, in a corner of this dark basement, you can see a tightly closed iron door. Inside the door are boxes containing several lead boxes. In these lead boxes are the voices and works of world musicians who have appeared on the stage of this theater since this century; these are all made into records and placed in those lead boxes, so the place where these lead boxes are placed is called the "sound storage room."

This "sound storage room" was proposed to the theater by the French Gramophone Company in 1907, and at that time the company produced many records and sent them to the theater; later it was increased three or four times. But the sender made a condition when sending the records, that is, they must be opened after a hundred years, and then it was shortened to fifty years; now fifty years have not passed, so this "sound storage room" is still a secret, and the records in it are still tightly closed in lead boxes; it will be up to the Minister of Education to decide the opening date and implement the opening after fifty years; at that time, people will probably rush to listen to the voices of many famous musicians, and the grand occasion is really difficult for us to imagine now.

### The Temporality of Dance

— South Wind

The art of dance, like other artistic disciplines, must have its value supported by its temporality and practicality. The history and progress of the art of dance are also, both visibly and invisibly, governed by this temporal practicality. At the same time, because the art of dance is a natural expression and manifestation of the life of the times, it possesses a sharp sensitivity to the era, and can be said to be a vivid experience of real life.

The dance of each era possesses a unique "style" of that era. During periods of historical or cultural transition, people not only undergo development and transformation in their spiritual aspects, but also experience changes in their physical and even psychological makeup. The complex relationships between people in this period, labor, and daily habits all create the unique temperament and posture of this era, forming unique dynamic rhythms and rules of emotional movement.

The frenzied "Carmagnole" dance, a song and dance that emerged during the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century, the "Polka" dance, which expressed the joy of the conservative restoration in the mid-19th century, and the solemn and elegant "Menuet" dance, which originated in the 18th century, each of these eras' images is imprinted on all ballroom dances and folk dances. Even the exaggerated "Waltz" dance of modern times, the gorgeous "Tango" dance, the decadent "Blues" dance, and the agile "Foxtrot" dance are also products of the romantic life of modern backward populations.

These dances can be said to be milestones in the historical lives of European and American nations. They certainly left us with many dance techniques; however, if these techniques are not reorganized and refined, and their external forms are retained and accepted, then the stage movement of these dances will undoubtedly feel discordant and isolated from the life movement of people living in this era. At the same time, it can also affect the progress of dance itself.

In Soviet dance art, like other artistic disciplines, a major purge and reform was carried out. The labor relations and daily life in the transformed Soviet Union have undergone a major change, and at the same time, Soviet dance art has followed the laws of this life, showing significant reforms and progress.

Initially, several geniuses of dance art emerged in the Soviet Union. However, because they were deeply influenced by classical dance, although they tried their best to bring dance closer to real life, they often inevitably made the new dance forms they created merely products of pure intellectual ideals and keen imagination, and could not truly penetrate into real life. As a result, they could not escape the shallow circle of aestheticism. For example, Goreytsaov's ballet "Temp • Tu • Kolombian", "Tragedy of the Mask", "Salome", and "The Revolt" can be said to fully demonstrate the incorrect points of Goreytsaov's artistic thinking.

The dances expressed in these plays do have astonishing progress and a spirit that breaks through outdated old forms, creating the initial stage of the progress of Soviet dance art today. However, some of the new dance forms he expressed in the two plays "The Revolt" and "Salome" are somewhat similar to mechanical exercises, especially the dance on high ladders in "The Revolt". He wanted to capture the techniques of "lightness" to create clear and sharp lines as an artistic expression of "force", in order to suit the powerful life at the time. However, this "force" line expressed by the body using lightness is often saturated with sexuality, and often falls into undisguised ugly erotic movements. And only in these erotic movements can one discover the "force" art that Goreytsaov wanted to express in his dance. The reason why Goreytsaov's creations are like this is entirely because the new dance form of mechanics art that he wanted to express was created by the old dance experience accumulated over a long period of time and the uncritical absorption of the techniques of old-style dance. His art stands outside of real life, and the new dance form he created is nothing more than an ideal object in his brain, and cannot be in line with the actual life movement at that time.

Lukin, who was equally famous as Goreytsaov and confined to classical music, was also ridiculed by general moralists at the time as an "Apia-Man's spasm" and a "sexuality expresser", but his acute-angled, distinct, and static expression method was praised for a time.

Today's Soviet Union has created new rules of life, and it can be said that it has formulated concrete norms in all aspects. The new dance form is not simply a pile of old dance techniques, but is created by adapting and modifying them.

The dance programs in the recently produced musical dramas and film dramas all show the success of the new dance at this stage. In dances where we only see people wearing athletic shorts similar to nudity, we do not see any erotic feelings, but only the expression of strength and health. Sometimes, in jazz rhythms and tap dances, there is no empty, hedonistic Grotesque feeling, but rather the expression of a regular, scientific collective life. And it also uses bugles and cannons to accompany the melody of the dance music.

Modern dance art, apart from the Soviet Union, we do not see any symbols of progress. Some only focus on the development of formal aspects, and create a lonely character for the dance. It can be said that it is contradictory and incompatible with real life. Since dance has lost its temporality, it cannot have progressive development.

We Chinese are even more blindly accepting some classical and some European and American dances that are for the purpose of enjoyment. For our nation that has suffered so much, it is absolutely incompatible and poisonous to our real life.

### Pilgrimage to Ancient Italian City

— Ms. Jia Yin

Ever since reading Madame de Staël's "Pompeii," I have been fascinated by this ancient city from two thousand years ago. I never thought I would actually be able to visit it in this lifetime. Imagine my joy and satisfaction.

It was eight o'clock in the morning when we landed in Naples. The Italian sky is always clear and bright, so Naples was bathed in warm sunlight. Everyone was wearing very light and graceful clothing. After we landed, attendants from various travel agencies came to greet us. They could speak French, English, or German, so there was no communication barrier with the travelers. We chose to take a tour bus from the Flying Eagle Travel Agency. This bus was similar to a public bus in Shanghai, except there was no ticket purchasing or checking process, as we had rented it entirely. The bus traveled along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Looking out from the bus window, on one side was the endless sea, with white waves swirling like water chestnuts greeting the wind, lifting one by one, and on the other side was a dense and lush grove of sorghum, swaying in the breeze like the sound of birds. Further away, standing in the distance, was a massive volcano, its mouth emitting thick smoke, appearing sulfur-colored in the sunlight. The bus sped along like lightning for more than two hours before reaching the foot of the volcano. Next to the foot of the mountain was the ancient city of Pompeii, which we had come to visit specifically. At the city gate, there was a large coffee shop and a museum. The coffee shop was for tourists to rest and quench their thirst. The food was very clean, but very expensive. The museum was opposite the coffee shop. The museum was divided into two parts: one part was dedicated to displaying the utensils excavated from the city, and the other part displayed the dead people and other animals excavated from the city. In the middle of the two parts was the main road leading into the ancient city. In order to first draw an outline of the culture of this ancient city, we first went to visit the museum. To anyone who boasts that modern material civilization far surpasses that of the past, please come here and take a look! This museum has already shown us that a thousand years ago, we already had our chemical, physical, and other gadgets of today. The unburned bottles, jars, bowls, pots, scales, weights, and all other instruments are no simpler or cruder than those used in our laboratories today. In addition, the whole box of silk and the whole case of jewelry, in their exquisiteness, can be said to far surpass what we have now. Unfortunately, after being excavated, they have all turned to ash and can only be displayed in glass cabinets for us to see. As for the dead people displayed at the end, they were probably the owners or distinguished guests of wealthy families on that day. Perhaps they were in the midst of colorful and dazzling revelry when they suddenly encountered this great calamity and were buried alive in the volcanic solution. Therefore, the women still had beads and bracelets on their wrists and gems on their ears, and the men still had diamond rings on their fingers, but they were all hunched over, with their backs bent and their teeth slightly exposed, showing the unbearable suffering they experienced at the time. As for the other animals, such as dogs and horses, they were also burned by the fire and were bent and twisted. These animals did not rot due to the high heat and have all become fossils.

After visiting the museum, we were led by an old man of about sixty years of age to visit this great ancient city. According to this old man, this city was destroyed by the volcano next to it. It is only that now, due to geological changes, the active volcano has become a dead volcano and no longer harms people. The Italian government has also found experts to carefully excavate this ancient city, and the part that has been excavated so far is already quite considerable.

We followed the old man among the broken steles and remnant pillars for a full three hours. What can be seen in its entirety is the grand theater. The roof of the theater has naturally long been burned down, but the seats and stage are still intact as before. These are all built of stone, very neat and careful. After careful calculation, it can accommodate two or three thousand people. The next is the bathhouse. It is said that in those days, the nature of the bathhouse was similar to that of a coffee shop today. Finding friends, chatting idly, and discussing all kinds of matters all took place in the bathhouse. This bathhouse was indeed an entertainment venue, so attention was paid to the architectural equipment to attract customers. What can still be seen now is the bathtub as large as a room. In fact, it can also be said to be a bathing pool, because it is built into the ground with marble, and water is also input through tap water pipes. In front of the bathing pool is a large hall, with patterns and flower tiles laid on the floor, dazzling with colors. It is said that this is a place where everyone dances after bathing while their muscles are excited. This kind of situation seems unimaginable to Chinese people who have been subjected to "etiquette", but many famous Western paintings have taken their material from here. In addition to these two public places that are still relatively intact, the next is a brothel. The roof of this brothel has been carefully designed and rebuilt by excavation experts, because it is said that this brothel can represent the entire culture of this ancient city two thousand years ago. This brothel forms a courtyard, in the middle of which is a large patio, surrounded by small rooms, each with different wall paintings, floor tile patterns, and colors. One room has walls with the upper half peach red and the lower half black, but between the upper and lower halves is a half-foot wide strip of scallion green, with various postures of Cupid painted on it. Walking into the room, the dazzling colors simply make people's hearts flutter and their minds wander! In another room, a large angel is painted on the wall, with a scale in the angel's hand. One end of the scale is fame and fortune, and the other end is a man's genitals. Everyone, think about which end is heavier? And in this painting, the end of fame and fortune is held high! This is the creed of everyone in this ancient city a thousand years ago! The philosophy of everyone! Therefore, the Bible records that the destruction of this ancient city was due to excessive licentiousness and was punished by God. However, they used this licentiousness as a starting point and created the ancient civilization of the Roman Empire that dominated for a time!

In this ancient city, in addition to these two or three places that are relatively complete and can give a glimpse of the whole picture, the rest are only broken pillars and ruined walls. They belonged to polytheism at that time, so incomplete marble altars are everywhere, and the forms and carvings of these altars are no less than the best works of art today. Everyone may be very surprised that at that time, the entire city already had tap water facilities. After being buried by the volcano, many were naturally destroyed, but they have now been reorganized and repaired by the excavators. This tap water can not only be used by every family in the city, but also provides water for passers-by to quench their thirst. Therefore, there is a semicircular stone well railing at the corner of every street, and on one side of the railing are children in various postures, and water is sent out by these children, either from the mouth, or from the bottle held in the hand, or from the beak of the bird clipped under the arm, or the child's urine flows out. There is naturally a hole in the middle of the railing, which can output water that has been splashed out. Whose brain can say that the ingenious conception is not as good as that of today's people?

What they didn't have at that time was probably only airplanes, cars, trams, etc. The streets in this city are paved with gravel, similar to the roads in the Ximen area of Shanghai. Although they are neat, they are not as smooth as asphalt roads. The streets are also not wide, usually only about five feet wide, except for the one leading to the Temple of Aphrodite, which is about ten feet wide. Their means of transportation at that time were sedan chairs and carriages. There is still a small house for placing this type of transportation that has not been destroyed. The floor of that small house is inlaid with colored tiles in the shape of the sedan chairs or carriages they sat in. It is truly magnificent!

We walked in this city for three hours, and because there was no shelter above our heads, we were a little dizzy from being exposed to the Italian sun. We hurriedly turned around and came out to rest in the coffee shop. There was also a music team in the coffee shop, with about five or six people in the team, including violins, cellos, guitars, etc., and a singer. They were all wearing tailcoats, white bow ties, slicked hair, and powdered faces, and were well-mannered. However, after singing a song, the singer held a tall, towering top hat and came to each guest to ask for coins! - Who knew that the people of a country that had such a magnificent civilization in ancient times and now has such a strong military force would have such a living situation! Filled with endless questions, I followed my companions back to the ship.

### The Origin of Mysterious Life

— Seeking Truth

Humans and all animals are sentient beings, even capable of speech and thought, completely different from all inanimate objects such as minerals. But where does the difference lie? According to the research of physics and chemistry, whether it is a living thing, an inanimate thing, a plant or an animal among living things, the chemical basis of their composition is nothing more than certain elements, and more fundamentally, they are all composed of atoms and electrons. Then why do objects composed of the same amount of atoms and electrons have some that can feel or think, and some that cannot feel or think? That is, why do some have life and some do not have life? Furthermore, what exactly is life? Where does it reside? Where does it come from? To study biology, this is indeed the most important question.

Throughout history, the question of the origin of life has sparked countless debates, and it is still the same today. Because the solution to general world view issues and philosophical issues is inextricably linked to this one question.

According to the Bible, all living things were created by the Creator alone. Life is not a product of historical development,

but a creation of an omnipotent God. All living things possess the "spirit" created by God Himself. However, scientific progress has proven the absurdity of this claim. According to science, life not only has its own history, but life itself is also a product of the natural development of inanimate objects.

Modern scientific research on the origin of life has several opinions, the main ones being "spontaneous generation" and "the perpetuity of life." In addition, there are many claims that can be attached to these two items.

So-called spontaneous generation believes that life is generated by the special combination of inorganic particles, and at the same time, its combination is produced by a favorable environment. However, the spontaneous generation of life was proven to be impossible by French scholar Pasteur in 1860. At that time, it was already known that the decay of organic matter was caused by special microorganisms - bacteria. Dead animals and plants undergo destructive effects after a certain period of time, in which putrefactive bacteria appear. Pasteur proved that microorganisms may fall from the air, which usually contains a large number of cells, into the gradually decaying remains of animals and plants. He did an experiment. He took two jars filled with boiling meat broth, opened one and sealed one. In the open one, the development of bacteria could be seen quickly. No bacteria appeared in the sealed one. This proves that living things cannot be spontaneously generated from decaying matter. Pasteur's experiment overturned that unscientific assumption. Only medieval scholars would assert that highly organized animals can now be generated from matter in the microbial world. The emergence of life requires a very complex and long process, and it is by no means possible to succeed overnight. As Engels said, "To use a small amount of water and hope that nature will do in twenty-four hours what nature necessarily needs thousands of years to do is probably futile and unreasonable."

Next is the perpetuity of life. It believes that life is eternally sustained; organisms in the form of tiny organisms are filled throughout the universe, and there is no need to explore from what other substances they emerge and their roots. Life, like matter, existed from the beginning. Life is based on indestructible organic particles. Given a suitable environment, it will continue to survive forever. Proponents of this claim—the "particle theory" or "atomic theory"—are Rieter von Hohenlindern in 1870 and later Arrhenius. But is this statement about life correct? Does it not contradict the fundamental laws of nature? As far as we know, both the living and inanimate worlds are in a constant process of development. Nebulae transform into stars and planets. When a planet reaches a certain state, life is found on it. Life also follows its own cycle, experiencing a long history of self-development. If it is said that life existed from the beginning, then it is fundamentally inconsistent with the law of cosmic evolution, so the perpetuity of life is unscientific.

There is also a group of "vitalists" who believe that life cannot be generated from inanimate natural objects. Each organism has a special "vital force," and all life phenomena depend on it. This vital force is similar to the "spirit" created by the celestial God in the Bible. But chemical research has shattered this claim. Because the most basic substance that constitutes life, protein, has now reached the point where it can be manufactured artificially. And can that vital force, which is attributed to the basis of life, exist apart from tangible matter? If as long as it is a substance, it can have vitality, then all substances, such as minerals and plants, should have life. So this statement is also unscientific.

Originally, life and protein are inextricably linked. The organisms that live on the earth today are fundamentally composed of proteins. Therefore, to solve the problem of the origin of life, one must understand under what conditions protein can appear. Protein can only exist at a certain temperature, and it will solidify if it exceeds eighty to one hundred degrees. The protein of cells is a colloidal solution, and the liquid can only exist below one hundred degrees. Therefore, the occurrence of life must be when the earth cools to below one hundred degrees. According to paleontological research, aquatic animals existed before terrestrial animals, so the ocean is the cradle of life. The predecessor of life depends on organic compounds. The reason why living things are different from inanimate things is that the former has the effect of metabolism, while the latter does not. Organic compounds can use light to produce metabolism. So life originated from organic compounds. Organic matter is the source of very highly colloidal solutions. Under certain conditions, the colloid turns into a solidified mass, which is "gel". And "gel" is the beginning of biological construction. In short, life is the property of matter that is specially and highly organized. Life is the result of the development of inanimate natural objects. It is the result of natural evolution, not a sudden occurrence, as "spontaneous generation" says; nor does it coexist with the earth and the universe, as "the perpetuity of life" says; nor is there a so-called "vital force" apart from matter, as "vitalism" says.

The earliest form of life is "protoplasm", which is the so-called "basis of life form". The next is the cell. Initially, it was a single, low-level protoplasm, which was only a colloidal liquid with sensitivity and reflectivity, and later evolved into a cell. But the organization of the cell is very complex, with a nucleus in the center and a cell membrane outside. Simple lower primitive organisms are single-celled, with only one cell, and they can also metabolize and live independently. But general organisms are multicellular. The production of cells takes the form of division, and there is always the death of old cells and the production of new cells. In this way, the life of an adult organism can continue.

From the above, life has its material basis and comes from evolution, and is by no means endowed by the Creator. Since life is the property of highly organized matter, then if the matter that possesses this property is destroyed or dies, then life will also be reduced or die. If all the cells in a person's body die, then life will be gone. What "immortal soul", what "heaven", what "God" is all unreliable. Life has its occurrence, development, and death. And only in this way can there be evolution.

### A Certain Person's Confession (5)

— Original by French writer André Gide, translated by Xiang Shi

With what fervent love she cared for me after we left Sousse; with what meticulous attention, protection, help, and care... was I surrounded! From Sousse to Tunis, and from Tunis to Constantine, Marcelle was truly admirable. Only when I arrived in Biskra did I begin to recover. Her faith was unwavering; her enthusiasm never waned for a moment. She planned everything, arranged the itinerary, and decided on our lodging. Alas, she could not make the journey any easier. Many times, I had to stop, thinking my life was about to end. I was drenched in sweat, like a dying man, gasping for air, and occasionally fainting. By the afternoon of the third day, upon reaching Biskra, I was practically a dead man.

(2)

Why bring up the past? What is there to commemorate? Yet, unpleasant memories constantly flood back. At that time, I no longer knew who I was or where I was. I only remember lying very weakly in bed, with Marcelle, my wife, my life, leaning over the bedside watching me. I knew it was her ardent care and deep love that revived me. Like a sailor who has lost his boat at sea and finally sees land, I felt a glimmer of life ignite; I was able to smile at Marcelle—why recount all this? Because then the black wings of death had touched me, and yet I lived; this was truly unexpected light and hope for me. Before, I truly did not know I was living. So now I regard life as an astonishing discovery.

The day came when I was able to get out of bed. Our lodging tempted me to take a look. It was actually just a rooftop platform. Yet what a wonderful platform it was! My and Marcelle's rooms were both on it: towering above the neighbors' roofs. When we stood at that highest point, we saw many houses, above them palm trees, and above the palm trees, the vast sky. The other side of the platform adjoined the municipal park; wisteria vines completely covered it; below the platform was a courtyard, a very small and tidy courtyard, in the center of which were planted six palm trees. My room was large, with plenty of air, the walls were plastered with whitewash, with no decorations hanging; a small door led to Marcelle's room, and another glass door led out to the platform.

How many uncounted hours flowed by here! I don't know how many times, in my solitude, I remembered these leisurely scenes—Marcelle beside me, reading, sewing, or writing. I did nothing, I only gazed at her. Oh, Marcelle! Marcelle! I looked, I looked at the sun, I looked at the shadows, I looked at the lines of the shadows slowly moving, I thought very little, saw a lot. I was still very weak; breathing was difficult; everything tired me, even reading; besides, what else did I need to read, all this was enough to overwhelm me. (To be continued)
