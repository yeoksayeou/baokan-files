### Enemy's Two-Pronged Attack on the North Bank of Zoumatang, Grandstand, Ultimately Unsuccessful

We Fought Bravely Against the Enemy, Still Engaging in Hand-to-Hand Combat This Morning. We Deployed New Positions at Chenjiaxing and Mengjiazai. The Positions North of Guangfu Town Remain Firmly Defended by Us.

For days, the enemy has concentrated heavy troops to fiercely attack our line of Nanxiang, Grandstand. The intensity of the main force engagements between the two armies is unprecedented. Over a hundred enemy planes have been frantically bombing the front lines to assist in the battle. Heavy artillery and tanks are also concentrated for the assault. Our defensive works in various villages have been largely destroyed, forcing us to temporarily move back to await an opportunity for a counterattack. Currently, our troops are firmly defending the line along Zoumatang to Xiaonanxiang, equipped with heavy troops to protect Nanxiang, Grandstand. We are determined to meet any enemy advances with a head-on blow. News from the military reports that since the night before last, the enemy has continued to advance directly on Grandstand via the Liuhang-Grandstand highway. After our troops tenaciously resisted and inflicted heavy casualties, the enemy turned west of the highway, attacking the line of Taheqiao, Zhai, and Hujiazai on the north bank of Zoumatang. The enemy concentrated firepower from about thirty tanks and armored vehicles to launch a fierce attack on us. Our position was once breached, nearly collapsing. However, our reinforcements arrived in time and launched a counterattack against the enemy. With a shout of killing, a barrage of bullets was unleashed. Our loyal and brave soldiers charged into the enemy ranks, engaging in bayonet charges. The enemy suffered severe casualties, and their morale plummeted, ultimately forcing them to retreat. In this battle, the enemy suffered over two thousand casualties. We also had heroic sacrifices, demonstrating the intensity of the fighting at the time. Our troops restored the original positions. Simultaneously, a portion of the enemy, attempting to invade our Zoumatang from Chenjiaxiang via Tanjiatou, was met with strong resistance around Yupengmiao, about one kilometer from Zoumatang, and eventually retreated with injuries. By yesterday morning, the enemy troops on that route had moved east, joining forces with the unit attacking the Grandstand front, and launched another fierce attack. The enemy first used a large number of aircraft to bomb and bombard, the sounds of explosions continuous and almost countless. The enemy then launched repeated assaults. Our troops fought wave after wave, resisting with all their might. Despite the enemy's stubbornness, they did not gain an inch. As of two o'clock this morning, the two sides were still engaged in hand-to-hand combat. As for the enemy who invaded Nanxiang from Chenjiaxiang via Mengjiazai and Chenjiaxing (Chenjiaxing is about 1,400 meters southwest of Chenjiaxiang), our troops initially defended the Xiaonanxiang position. In the evening, they launched a full-scale counterattack, recovering the pure areas of Chenjiaxing and Mengjiazai. The area from Guangfu Town to Luodian, Shixianggongmiao, and Caowangmiao is still firmly defended by our troops. The enemy's heavy troops have attacked Guangfu more than a dozen times, but they have been repelled each time. Last night, the enemy launched another major offensive and are currently still engaged in intense fighting.

Central News Agency reports that our military reporter accompanying the troops in Grandstand reported at 11:25 pm on the 25th that our army's position on the Grandstand front is extremely stable. At dawn today, the enemy, using its elite weapons, attacked along the Liuhang-Grandstand highway. The enemy launched a joint assault with dozens of tanks and dozens of planes, but were repelled. Currently, the front line of our Grandstand is still in the area of Fengjiazai and Lijialouzai, two kilometers north of Grandstand Town, and the situation is extremely stable. Also, about two kilometers west of Grandstand, the enemy also broke through near Laorenqiao at dawn and started fierce fighting. A certain division commander personally went to the front line to command, boosting morale. Under heavy artillery fire, they calmly fought back. The enemy's momentum was fierce, charging towards our position. Our troops immediately jumped out of the trenches and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat until noon. Our reinforcements arrived and joined the counterattack, pushing the enemy back to the edge of the Zoumatang shore. The enemy had a river and pond behind them, making it impossible to cross, so they had to fight stubbornly. Although we had considerable sacrifices, we continued to charge, giving the enemy no chance to breathe. By the time of the report, the enemy had suffered heavy casualties and were in a state of disarray. It is expected that the enemy can be completely eliminated before dawn tomorrow.

### Stalemate Between Our Troops and the Enemy on the Chenjiaxiang Line, Mengjiazai

Our Troops Counterattacked and Advanced Last Night. The Enemy Repeatedly Attacked the Guangfu Front Without Success.

While the enemy is focusing all its efforts on attacking Grandstand, it has not abandoned its strategy of trying to seize Nanxiang from Guangfu. While the fighting on the north bank of Zoumatang was exceptionally fierce, the enemy on the Guangfu front also kept attacking our troops. From 8 pm the night before last until dawn yesterday, large units of enemy troops fiercely attacked Guangfu more than twelve times, but were repelled head-on by our troops. Since yesterday afternoon, fierce fighting has been ongoing in the vicinity of the town. Southeast of Guangfu, our troops from Chenjiaxiang have moved back to the area of Mengjiazai and Chenjiaxing (about 1,400 meters southwest of Chenjiaxiang). Enemy artillery fire continues to concentrate on bombarding our positions. The enemy's aerial bombardment is particularly fierce, destroying all of our army's positions and defensive works, making it inconvenient to hold them. Therefore, they retreated slightly to the new positions defending the east side of Xiaonanxiang yesterday morning, which is more than three kilometers northeast of Nanxiang. Last night, our reinforcements arrived to support and counterattacked the enemy. The enemy had not yet gained a firm foothold and collapsed in disarray. Our vanguard advanced again to the line of Mengjiazai and Chenjiaxing. After advancing to Chenjiaxing, a portion of the invading enemy turned southwest, advancing towards the western end of Zoumatang. Their purpose seemed to be to make contact with the enemy forces on the north side of Zoumatang. As for the line from Caowangmiao to Shixianggongmiao north of Guangfu, our troops are still firmly defending it, with no problems whatsoever.

Central News Agency's military reporter accompanying the troops in Guangfu reported at 10:00 am on the 25th that after the enemy reoccupied Xinmuqiao, they attempted to coordinate with their attacking force in Chenjiaxiang. Therefore, starting yesterday afternoon, they again bombarded our Guangfu front positions with fierce artillery fire, followed by an attack by about two battalions of infantry. Our troops waited calmly until they approached, then launched a fierce attack with machine guns and grenade launchers, killing many enemies. One enemy soldier was captured by us. Because he was seriously injured and lost too much blood, he was on the verge of death. Last night at 8 pm and again at 2 am this morning, another 2,000 enemies attacked several times. We used surprise troops to attack from both sides, defeating them. The enemy retreated in a panic, leaving behind light and heavy machine guns and rifles all over the ground, which were all recovered by us.

Central News Agency's military reporter accompanying the troops in Guangfu reported at 10:00 am on the 25th that the enemy north of Luodian has been using heavy artillery to carry out rapid fire on our positions for days. At night, enemy planes flew in formation to drop bombs and bombard. The flares they dropped were as bright as daylight. However, our troops remained calm and suffered no losses. As a result of our several fierce attacks, the enemy soldiers were extremely panicked. Yesterday, they even hung wooden signs high on trees inside their positions, reading "Brave Chinese soldiers, please stop fighting." Their actions are absurd, but their fear has been fully exposed. Central News Agency's military reporter accompanying the troops in Guangfu reported at 9:00 pm on the 25th that at noon today, the enemy bombarded the area west of Shixianggongmiao with fierce artillery fire. The damage to our position's fortifications was minimal. Our troops immediately took strict precautions. However, the enemy troops remained hiding in the trenches, not daring to attack.

Central News Agency reports that after the enemy troops invading west along the Wenzaobang broke through Chenjiaxiang, our troops deployed defenses at Mengjiazai south of the river and Zhujiazai north of the river to hold firm. According to reports late at night on the 25th from our military reporters accompanying the troops in Jiangwan and Grandstand, the enemy attacked both locations but were repelled and were unable to advance a single step. Our position is absolutely stable. It is reported that both locations are about two kilometers east of Xiaonanxiang and four kilometers from Nanxiang.

### Intense Fighting in Jiangwan: Our Troops Recapture the Business School

A Large Force of Enemy Troops Launched a Fierce Attack. We Immediately Sent Reinforcements to Counterattack and Quickly Recapture.

Central News Agency military reporter in Jiangwan reported at 12:00 am on the 26th that at noon today, a large force of enemy troops, under the cover of tanks, launched a fierce attack on our Business School position. Our outposts fought bravely to meet the attack, but due to the disparity in numbers, the Business School was ultimately lost. Then our reinforcements arrived and launched a counterattack with all their strength. After several hours of intense hand-to-hand combat, by 4:30, more than a hundred enemy soldiers were killed by us. The rest of the enemy could not withstand the assault and fled in a panic. Our troops recaptured the Business School and seized a heavy machine gun and seventy or eighty rifles. At 5:00, the enemy attacked our army's position in the northwest corner of Fudan University, triggering fierce outpost battles. After about an hour, the enemy collapsed and retreated. Currently, in the Jiangwan area, our outposts are still in the area of ​​Yejia Garden and the Wanguo Sports Association, and the position has remained unshaken.

Our Troops Launched a Night Attack on Shuidian Road

Central News Agency military reporter in Jiangwan reported at 12:10 pm on the 25th that on Shuidian Road, after the hand-to-hand combat last night inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, the enemy remained hidden and did not come out. Therefore, the second half of the night was very quiet. Around 2:00 am this morning, our troops at Fangjia Mqiao, Tanjia Zhai, Chih Tze University and other places launched a night raid, launching attacks on enemy positions such as the Japanese cemetery, the 63rd Flower Garden, and the Patriotic Girls' School. Our troops were exceptionally brave, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to put great pressure on them, making it difficult for the enemy to resist and giving them no chance to attack. By dawn, as our objective had been achieved, we returned to our original positions.

The Enemy Was Defeated and Retreated in Street Fighting in Zhabei

Central News Agency military reporter in Zhabei reported at 12:10 pm on the 25th that, starting at 8:00 pm last night, the enemy used small units to continuously harass our areas of Dongbaoxing Road, Guangdong Street, and Qiujiang Road. Our troops defended the main roads and alleys, calmly fighting back. Gunfire was sporadic, sometimes intense and sometimes relaxed. Around noon, the enemy gradually increased to four or five hundred men, attempting to launch a fierce attack on our position. Our troops also jumped out of the trenches and counterattacked the enemy, initiating fierce street fighting. The two sides charged back and forth, engaging in hand-to-hand combat several times. By dawn, the enemy began to retreat. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than a hundred casualties.

Our Miaohang Position Is Solid

Central News Agency military reporter in Jiangwan reported at 11:20 pm on the 25th that in the Miaohang area, we are still firmly defending our original position. However, the enemy believes that our position there protrudes on the south bank of Wenzaobang, posing a great threat to their protruding forces on the south bank of Fengcun Pond. Currently, it is extremely difficult for the enemy to attack Grandstand, so they will shift their target, attempting to pressure our Miaohang area positions. It is expected that there will be fierce fighting there in the coming days. Starting this afternoon, the enemy has harassed Xujiazai, Zhoujiazai, and the northeast of Dajinmazai three times, but were repelled by our troops. The three locations are northeast and southeast of Miaohang, between one and a half kilometers and two and a half kilometers away.

### Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses Attacking Guangfu

Central News Agency Suzhou, 25th: On the 24th, the enemy facing Guangfu attacked us more than ten times, but were all bravely repelled by our troops. In their first attack, the enemy numbered more than a thousand and came on fiercely. After fierce fighting, they suffered heavy casualties and were ultimately unable to withstand the assault and collapsed in disarray. In this battle, our troops captured many light and heavy machine guns and two to three hundred rifles from the enemy. On the 25th, they attacked more than a dozen times again, intending to recover the bodies of enemy soldiers in front of our position. But as a result, the number of corpses increased with each attack, resulting in enemy corpses everywhere in front of our position and the river water turning red. It has been determined that the enemy units involved in this attack were the 161st and 164th Regiments, which were recently conscripted and sent to China.

### Enemy Planes Continue to Wreak Havoc Yesterday

Dropping More Than 300 Bombs Between Zhenru and Grandstand. The Min Sheng Cotton Mill in West Shanghai Was Bombed and Suffered Heavy Losses.

Yesterday, the enemy continued to bomb the outskirts of the city, starting from 7:00 am. Over 40 enemy aircraft took off from the Shanghai No. 4 Minsheng Cotton Mill's bombed and heavily damaged Shupu enemy airfield. Six of these aircraft, divided into two groups, carried out indiscriminate bombing between the Commercial Press near Baoshan Road in Zhabei, the Republican New Road, and Song Park Road, destroying more than 20 civilian houses. The rest flew mostly between Zhenru and Grandstand, and the highway between Grandstand and Nanxiang, bombing throughout the day, dropping no fewer than 300 bombs, destroying countless of our civilian houses. In addition, in Beixinjing, west of Shanghai, 12 enemy aircraft went for reconnaissance yesterday morning. At 4:00 pm, the Minsheng Cotton Mill on Huobilan Road was hit by four bombs, two of which exploded, causing significant damage. Also, around 1:00 pm yesterday, enemy aircraft bombed Yangjiadu in Pudong. Around 5:00 pm, two more enemy aircraft flew low over Tangqiao, strafing with machine guns. Losses are unknown.

When enemy planes flew to the Zhongshan Road and Beixinjing areas in West Shanghai on the 24th to wreak havoc, Jiangqiao Town in Pu Jing District also suffered heavy bombing. In addition to the town's houses being completely destroyed, more than a dozen residents were killed or injured.

Zhabei

From 1:30 pm to 4:45 pm yesterday, enemy aircraft bombed Zhabei in three separate waves, each with three large heavy bombers carrying six bombs each. The bombs from the first and second waves all fell on the eastern end of Liuying Road to Baziqiao section in the north. While the second batch of enemy aircraft had just finished bombing and were about to return to the airfield, they encountered two other enemy aircraft at the intersection of the North Railway Station and Baoshan Road. Both separated and were practicing reconnaissance in the area. The third batch of enemy aircraft then flew in from the concession, circled once, and immediately began bombing. Each time they bombed, they would always pass through the public concession to drop bombs in the airspace over the Suzhou River Wuzhen Road Bridge to their destination. Our army used anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns to bombard them, but they were flying too high to hit them. They continued bombing until 4:45 pm, dropping about 100 bombs east of the Republican New Road, north of Zhongshan Road to the Liuying Road section throughout the day.

West Shanghai

Enemy planes bombed West Shanghai wildly the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, around 5:00 am, the sky was not yet bright, and a large group of enemy planes flew to West Shanghai again to continue bombing. The bombed locations had shifted north to the area of ​​Zhuangjiaqiao, Lijiaqiao, and Yujialong, three or four miles north of Caodu, which is the southern end of Grandstand and Zhenru. The bombing was especially fierce around 11:00 am and 2:00 pm, and the sound of explosions shook the area, with thick smoke rising straight into the sky. The extent of the damage is unknown. At 2:10 pm, six enemy planes wildly dropped more than a dozen bombs on Sun Yat-sen Bridge, Great China University, and the surrounding area, destroying part of the school buildings. Along the north bank of the Suzhou River and along Zhongshan Road, all bamboo forests, tree gardens, and reed thickets were considered targets by enemy aircraft, which either dropped bombs or strafed them. At 3:30 pm yesterday afternoon, six enemy planes suddenly came to the Minsheng Cotton Mill on Zhoujiaqiao and Hualun Road in West Shanghai. After circling for a while, they dropped three consecutive bombs, which hit the fine yarn workshop, causing great damage. More than 30 people were killed or injured inside and near the factory. This was the first time that the area along the extra-territorial roads in West Shanghai was bombed. The factory is insured against war risks and flies the American flag, but it was still unable to avoid the enemy planes' brutality. It can be said that they have no regard for humanity, law, or discipline.

Pudong

In Pudong, at 8:00 am yesterday, 12 enemy planes flew in all directions. At 2:00 pm, three light bombers flew in and dropped four bombs near Caoantou. One was an incendiary bomb, burning down five or six civilian houses. Around 3:00 pm, they flew to the vicinity of Zhangjialou and dropped six bombs on various villages, injuring three or four farmers and destroying four houses. Around 4:30 pm, two more enemy planes came to the Tiandu area and dropped four bombs in a row, destroying five civilian houses and causing no injuries.

Su/Jia

Three Suzhou-Jiaxing long-distance buses were driving close to the North 㘮 Station when four enemy planes suddenly came and chased them relentlessly, throwing bombs and firing machine guns. The buses immediately stopped, and luckily the passengers had already jumped off and scattered to take cover, so no one was injured. After the enemy planes left, they continued to drive. However, when they drove near Pingwang Station, three more enemy planes came, throwing bombs and firing machine guns. They immediately stopped again, and the drivers and passengers jumped off and scattered to take cover, and no one was injured.

Qishuyan

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th: News from the transportation sector says that the enemy's all-out attack in West Shanghai has been disastrously defeated. To vent their anger, they are focusing on destroying our railway transportation. The Qishuyan Rolling Stock Plant under the Ministry of Railways has also become a target for enemy aircraft. The plant has been bombed repeatedly since the 12th of this month, and the mechanical equipment has been damaged. Moreover, most of the original workers have moved away, and work in the plant cannot continue, effectively halting all operations.

### 12,000 Enemy Soldiers Killed in One Week

In addition, the Korean and Manchukuo forces that attacked us in the Luodian and Liuhang areas have suffered four to five thousand casualties.

### British Decision to Take Stern Measures Regarding the Case of Enemy Aircraft Strafing British Garrison

The situation is grave and cannot be resolved locally. Defense forces are equipped with machine guns to resist air raids. American and German consuls-general have lodged protests.

According to the Shanghai Times, the British military authorities issued a formal statement to the Shanghai Times on the evening of the 24th, stating that Rifleman McKeown of the 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles, was attacked by Japanese aircraft at 3:35 PM on the 24th at the British Q-defense post on Avenue Haig. The Japanese aircraft intentionally attacked British soldiers three or four times. The first or second attack was aimed at people riding horses on Avenue Haig, including two women, who immediately took shelter at the British Q-defense post. The Japanese aircraft then attacked the British Q-defense post, and British Rifleman McKeown was hit, the bullet piercing his shoulder and chest. He died upon arrival at the hospital at 4:00 PM. At that time, the British Corporal in charge of the defense at that location immediately ordered light machine guns to fire at the Japanese aircraft, but they missed. McKeown was from County Donegal, Ireland. According to Corporal Osborne of the Royal Ulster Rifles, who was in charge of the defense there, a Japanese aircraft flew from the south at approximately 3:35 PM, flying along the railway and Avenue Haig. The aircraft flew low, below 100 feet, and suddenly tilted its wings to strafe downwards with machine guns. At that time, there were many civilians riding horses on the road. The Japanese aircraft then circled once over Hongqiao and flew back, strafing again with machine guns. In his opinion, the Japanese aircraft tilted to allow the machine gunner to clearly see the situation on the road. Only after the Japanese aircraft flew away was it discovered that McKeown had been shot in the chest and wounded. He was immediately taken to the hospital in a military ambulance, but he died before arriving at the hospital.

Serious British Attitude

A dispatch from the National News Agency in Shanghai reports that regarding the incident of the Japanese military killing a British soldier, Japanese Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa has issued an order to hand over the air force personnel responsible for the incident to a military court for trial, and the Japanese naval authorities will conduct a detailed investigation into the incident. However, the British military commander issued a statement, believing that the matter was too important to be resolved locally and has reported it to London, awaiting the British government's disposition.

A Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency in London on the 25th reports that regarding the Japanese aircraft attacking British troops in Shanghai, it is claimed here that the British government has instructed its troops that if they encounter a similar situation again, they should immediately return fire. It is also said that although the British troops in the area are not equipped with anti-aircraft guns, Lewis machine guns can be used to drive them away. According to a Shanghai telegram, the British soldier who died yesterday was buried today. Commanders of the British, French, and American troops, as well as the Chief Commander of the Shanghai Merchant Corps, and a unit of the Italian Navy, all participated in carrying the coffin. China also sent important personnel to participate. The British authorities refused to allow Japanese military officials to send representatives to join.

A Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency in London on the 25th reports that the British government will likely lodge a protest with Tokyo regarding the Japanese aircraft firing on and killing a British soldier in Shanghai. The Times editorial stated that the Japanese military's action is in no way excusable. According to the newspaper's Shanghai sources, the British expatriate community in the area unanimously hopes that the government will take strong measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

A dispatch from the National News Agency in London on the 25th reports that the shooting of British soldiers by Japanese aircraft in Shanghai, resulting in one death and one injury, has left a painful impression here. A protest may be lodged with Tokyo. It is reported that the British authorities have instructed the Consul-General in Shanghai to immediately submit a detailed report. The commander of the British troops stationed in Shanghai has decided to equip all British defense forces with machine guns to resist any air raids. Regarding this incident, the Daily Telegraph reported that Japan is in no way excusable.

A Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency in London reports that regarding the Japanese aircraft attacking the British soldiers' defense post in Shanghai, official sources expect to receive a formal report from Shanghai this afternoon. However, officials have already stated that although the Japanese naval authorities have expressed their apology, it is still not considered satisfactory.

Records of Facts from Foreign Newspapers

The North China Daily News reported that Rifleman McKeown of the Royal Ulster Rifles was killed by machine gun fire from Japanese aircraft yesterday (Sunday). McKeown was on duty at the Avenue Haig defense post at the time. After being hit, he was immediately sent to the British military hospital and died at 3:55 PM. His remains are now placed in the International Funeral Parlor. That night, according to a statement from the British military headquarters, to the best of its knowledge at the time of the statement, the Japanese aircraft's machine gun fire was an intentional attack. The British defense troops did indeed return fire on the Japanese aircraft. The NCO in charge of the defense post ordered light machine guns to return fire on the aircraft after seeing a soldier killed, firing dozens of rounds, which apparently hit the aircraft. According to a German expatriate who was riding a horse on Avenue Haig at the time, he himself narrowly escaped harm. A Japanese aircraft circled above the British soldiers' defense post, firing on several foreigners riding horses along Avenue Haig and the British soldiers stationed at the defense post. He was traveling with another German expatriate. His horse was hit and killed, but the two men fortunately escaped injury, which was completely unexpected. A group of British and American riders, along with two Chinese friends and three women, were also traveling along Avenue Haig when the machine gun fire erupted. They quickly abandoned their horses and ran into the ditch on the side of the road to take cover. They were not injured, which was extremely fortunate. However, three horses were hit and killed. One was Agile Star, a famous horse that had won the race at Jumping Creek last Saturday and Sunday, and was owned by a Chinese man named Hu. Another British horse was shot in the leg and had to be euthanized to avoid lifelong suffering. According to the North China Daily News representative in the group, the aircraft was about 100 feet above the ground when it fired. One bullet hit a British soldier at the defense post. The aircraft then made a half-circle, apparently intending to return, but suddenly turned and flew away. The people in the group immediately went to the side of the dying British soldier. It was said that the riders were all dressed in civilian clothes. The place where the aircraft fired was definitely east of the railway line. The ditch was clear, and they could not be mistaken for Chinese soldiers. A British man named Johns was also walking on Avenue Haig when the Japanese aircraft fired, and he also managed to save his life. He told the North China Daily News representative that he had witnessed the entire incident. He believed that the Japanese aircraft intentionally harmed him and his wife, as well as the British soldiers at the defense post and the riders nearby. The aircraft was a light bomber and flew from the Jessfield Road area at about 3:15 PM. The aircraft had apparently bombed Chinese soldiers' positions in that area. Mr. and Mrs. John were walking along Avenue Haig to the intersection of Great Western Road when the aircraft dived straight down. Mr. and Mrs. John quickly ran into the ditch on the side of the road. The aircraft flew very low, and they could clearly see the pilot in the aircraft. The aircraft circled over their heads, diving straight down four times, with the machine guns roaring and bullets flying everywhere on the road and railway tracks. The aircraft then circled over the British soldiers' defense post and dived straight down again, with the target clearly being the British soldiers and the riders 40 yards away. This firing lasted for about five minutes. There were no Chinese soldiers nearby, except for two farmers working in the fields about 100 yards away. The aircraft landed very low and could not have mistaken the foreigners on the road for Chinese soldiers. Machine gun bullets were scattered along the railway line in the concession area for about three-quarters of a mile, from a dairy farm on Avenue Haig to the corner of Avenue Haig and Route Doumer, where there was also a British soldiers' defense post. Last night, British soldiers were still digging around the ground around the defense post, looking for machine gun bullets. Dozens of foreigners nearby, whether walking, riding horses, or driving, narrowly escaped harm. The Columbia Country Club, not far away, was holding a pig roast. The crowd was startled by the loud machine gun fire hundreds of yards away. A Japanese naval staff officer led a group of Japanese to visit Major General Smith, commander of the British defense forces, in the afternoon. Later, Major Lennie of the British defense forces led a group to investigate the scene of the incident. Subsequently, Vice Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, Major General Smith, commander of the defense forces, and Mr. Phillips, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, held a meeting to discuss the case. It was learned last night that another British soldier had his cigarette case and matchbox, which he carried on his body, pierced by machine gun bullets, but he was unharmed.

According to the Shanghai Times, British soldier McKeown, who was killed by machine gun fire from Japanese aircraft, was 22 years old and was about to go on leave to return home. He was only ten minutes away from his scheduled off-duty time when the accident occurred. The bullet entered one eye and exited the back of his head. There were about 24 people on duty at the defense post at the time. According to Corporal Osborne, who was in charge of the defense post, the aircraft circled several times, firing downwards. It was only on the last time that he ordered the defense soldiers to return fire with light machine guns. The aircraft then flew north. According to a British man named Payne, the aircraft circled and fired five times. He, a German girl, a British couple, and their children, fled into a nearby dairy farm with a British flag hanging, and managed to save their lives. An American named Nicholson stated that the aircraft swept along Avenue Haig, and what it used must have been heavy machine guns, which is evidenced by the many deep bullet holes along Avenue Haig.

According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, when the Japanese aircraft fired machine guns on Avenue Haig, Mr. Rogers, a well-known American lawyer in Shanghai, and several American women were passing by on horseback and narrowly escaped harm. Therefore, after the incident, the American Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Gao Wang, immediately lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul-General, Mr. Okamoto. Two German expatriates were injured after falling from their horses at the time. It is reported that the German Consul-General will also lodge a protest with the Japanese authorities. The American and German expatriates who were in danger all said that the Japanese pilots were so indiscriminate and attacked civilians, that it is no longer safe to walk on the roads in the concession. It was also said that the British soldier who was killed was shot while dragging a groom to a safe location. The British soldiers only returned fire when the Japanese aircraft fired for the fourth time. Many foreigners are now planning to lodge protests with the consuls of their home countries. It is heard that the British soldiers defending the boundary of the International Settlement have been ordered today that if any aircraft bombs them, they can immediately return fire. This order apparently declares that they no longer regard Japanese soldiers as collaborators in defending the concession. The British soldiers and other foreign soldiers had previously been ordered that they could only open fire on Chinese soldiers if they tried to forcibly enter their defense area. Major General Smith, commander of the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai, stated today that the case is serious and should not be resolved locally. He has reported it to the government of his country to negotiate with the Japanese government.

Hasegawa and Others Apologize

According to the Shanghai North China Daily News, regarding the case of the Japanese aircraft killing a British soldier on Avenue Haig, Japanese naval and consular officials have expressed their deep regret to the British authorities. Mr. Sugiyama, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Third Fleet, visited the commander of the British Far East Fleet on the evening of the 24th on behalf of Japanese Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa to apologize. At the same time, Japanese Consul-General Okamoto also visited British Consul-General Phillips and made the same expression.

Funeral Held for Remains

As for the victimized British soldier, his remains were moved to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road yesterday. After the technicians embalmed the body, a funeral was held. Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, represented the Municipal Council in attending the funeral. The Council sent a wreath to express condolences. Mr. MacDonald, a Western director, also personally attended the funeral. In addition, the British military authorities, in order to prevent similar incidents from happening again and avoid unnecessary sacrifices, because the Anhe Temple Road area is a residential area for British and American expatriates and Avenue Haig is a place where foreigners leisurely ride horses, have advised the expatriates to temporarily refrain from riding horses on Avenue Haig.

Anti-Enemy Association Sends Condolences

The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, deeply saddened by the sudden death of British soldier McKeown, who was stationed on Avenue Haig, due to being shot by Japanese aircraft, specially dispatched the association's secretary, Mr. Qin, to carry a wreath to the International Funeral Parlor yesterday to express condolences and grief on behalf of the association.

### Our Aircraft Raided Last Night and This Morning

Last night and this morning, our brave air force again launched three attacks on Shanghai, attacking enemy positions and posing a great threat to the enemy. The first time they flew over the Huangpu River was at 10:45 PM last night. After circling once, they headed towards the eastern part of Shanghai. Enemy ships fired briefly and then stopped. At 1:01 AM this morning, they launched a second air raid. At 1:50 AM, several of our aircraft flew over for the third time. Enemy ships in the Huangpu River and the enemy headquarters on Jiangwan Road frantically illuminated the sky with searchlights, and the red and green signals released by the enemy headquarters were particularly dazzling. Immediately, anti-aircraft guns and cannons formed a network of fire, and the bullets were like connected beads. Occasionally, there were loud explosions, which were the bombs dropped by our aircraft on the enemy. In the midst of the silence, a loud voice that echoed through the clouds suddenly erupted, invigorating the spirit. After completing their mission, our aircraft calmly flew away.

### Fierce Battle at Yanjiawan, Battalion Commander Niu Heroically Sacrifices His Life

According to the Central News Agency, on the evening of the 21st of this month, when our army began a full-scale offensive, Battalion Commander Ban Shengting of the ×× Regiment of our ×× Division, who had been defending the Yanjiawan area, had already suffered several injuries. His superiors repeatedly ordered him to retreat to the rear for treatment. Battalion Commander Niu believed that during this period of all-out resistance, as a soldier, he had a duty to defend the territory. If he had a breath left, he would never allow himself to seek comfort. Therefore, he continued to lead his troops and defend the front line, which boosted morale. On the evening of the 21st of this month, the army received an order to counterattack. Battalion Commander Niu took the lead, leading his troops in a fierce hand-to-hand battle with a Japanese regiment. Although the Japanese army suffered heavy losses, with numerous deaths and injuries, our loyal and brave Battalion Commander Niu heroically sacrificed his life in this battle. Niu was from Shanxi, a graduate of the fourth class of the military academy. He was a man of few words, courageous and responsible, and had no vices, which was especially rare. After his sacrifice, all the officers and soldiers of the division mourned him deeply.

[Taiyuan] A report from Mr. Belden, a reporter for the United Press of the United States at the front line of the Chinese army in northern Shanxi for the National News Agency, states: "Today, when the reporter told the Chinese army at the front line in northern Shanxi that the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty would convene a conference in Brussels to find a way to stop the Sino-Japanese War, they were willing to listen, but expressed doubts about whether the future conference could give China any advantage. The reporter rode in a military truck carrying goods, and after a difficult and bumpy journey, arrived in Xinzhou for two days. This morning, [blank] headquarters visited a certain general. The headquarters was extremely busy, receiving reports sent from the front line, one of which was: a certain route army sent more than one hundred guerrillas to Yangmingpu, north of Shuoxian, to attack the Japanese airport. Before the Japanese could gather, they destroyed twenty-two of their airplanes, and the Chinese daredevils also suffered heavy losses. This news has been verified by the fact that the few Japanese planes flying in the sky recently all came from the east. There is no way to fly from the north. The reporter is now living in the same suffering as the Chinese army. They eat very little at each meal. The ordinary soldiers cooperate very well with me. They often use ambulances to take me to the front line for inspection, but they are often dissuaded by military authorities. When I inspected Xinzhou, I saw that the county had been severely damaged by Japanese planes. When the reporter returned to the station, a group of Chinese soldiers surrounded me, examining my nationality. When they learned that the reporter was American, they seemed surprised by the ragged clothes of the reporter, thinking that the clothes of Americans should not be so tattered. One soldier showed me his hand, seeing that the palm was torn and bleeding. He intends to say that he grabbed the Japanese soldier's bayonet with his hand to kill the enemy during the hand-to-hand combat on the front line, causing the wound. He specifically cited this as an honor. When I waited at the station, I saw a car full of wounded Chinese soldiers, most of whom could not move freely and had to be carried by stretchers. Afterwards, I managed to hitch a ride on a freight car full of wounded soldiers with three guards back to Taiyuan. The hands of the wounded soldiers were black and stiff, like ice to the touch, their bodies covered in blood, their breath weak and their pulse faint, making it difficult to move them. There was silence in the car, with lips trembling, trying their best to speak but unable to. Seeing their situation, one cannot help but be deeply moved. When the train was running, the iron filings from the locomotive hit our faces, and the flames flickered with light. Looking down at the wounded soldiers, seeing them using their uninjured hands to move their disabled arms to take care of themselves, this scene, who can see it without being moved?" (National Telegram, 24th)

### Cabinet Crisis Suddenly Arises in Belgium, Nine-Power Conference Still Opens as Scheduled

Britain and the United States Cooperate to Mediate Sino-Japanese Disputes; Japan's Attitude Undecided, Russia and Germany to be Invited to Participate

[Paris] A cabinet crisis has arisen in Belgium, but French officials have confirmed that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will still open as scheduled in Brussels on the 30th of this month. When the Nine-Power Treaty was signed on February 6, 1922, there were nine signatory countries: China, Great Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Subsequently, five countries joined the treaty: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Bolivia, and Mexico, for a total of fourteen countries. As of now, only Japan and Bolivia have not submitted replies. In addition, all other countries have accepted participation. The first meeting will likely discuss whether other countries related to the Far East, such as the Soviet Union and Germany, should be invited to participate. If it is decided to invite them, the meeting will be temporarily adjourned to await replies from those countries. Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is likely to be delayed until November 4 before officially discussing the conflict between China and Japan. As such, when the conference opens on the 30th of this month, British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Delbos may not personally attend, but Delbos has not yet made any decision on this matter. (Havas Dispatch, Central News Agency, 25th)

[Nanjing] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, our representatives, Ambassadors Gu and Guo, are scheduled to travel from England and France on the 27th and 28th respectively to prepare to attend. It is generally observed that Japan, in invading China, knows it is wrong and avoids being condemned face-to-face at the meeting. It is anticipated that the cabinet meeting on the 27th will result in a majority favoring non-participation. Even when the formal meeting is held on the 12th of next month, Japan may not be prepared to participate. (Special Dispatch, 25th)

[Tokyo] An Associated Press reporter asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman today whether Belgium had any intention of postponing the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to accommodate Japan. The spokesman said that the Belgian Ambassador to Japan had not made any such representation to Foreign Minister Hirota.

### Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement, the United States Tests Public Opinion

Ninety-Nine Percent Support; British Peace Association Passes Resolution

[Washington] The American Public Opinion Testing Association recently conducted a test on the general public regarding the question of whether to hold a boycott of Japanese goods. Today, the association specially announced the results of the public vote. Among them, those who openly favored Japan and opposed boycotting Japanese goods accounted for one percent. As for those who clearly sympathized with China and advocated boycotting Japanese goods, California had the most, accounting for 50 percent, followed by Maryland, accounting for 47 percent, New England accounting for 44 percent, the Rocky Mountains accounting for 39 percent, the Middle East and South each accounting for 30 percent, and the Midwest accounting for 28 percent. However, the association believes that a purely civilian boycott movement, without the government's practical support, will be ineffective, as was the case with the previous US boycott of Italian and German goods. The failures of China's past boycotts of Japanese goods must be noted. (National Telegram, 24th)

[London] The British branch of the World Peace Congress recently held a meeting here to discuss the Far Eastern situation and the Spanish national issue, and closed today. A resolution was passed, requesting the British government to find ways to promote a universal boycott of Japanese goods by other countries.

British Newspaper's Commentary

[London] The Manchester Guardian today published an editorial on China's urgent appeal to the World Student Association, stating, "China's new sense of unity is the foundation for the vigorous progress of the new life of all countries, and universities are the place where this new sense is generated and promoted.

### British Banking Circles' Loans to Italy

News Still Awaiting Verification

[London] Recently, there have been rumors that several British banks have lent forty to fifty million pounds to Italy. Financial figures do not believe in this rumor. Firstly, under the current technical conditions of the financial market, issuing loans in London would be very unfavorable. Secondly, even if British banks wanted to lend to Italy, they would have to wait until the United Kingdom and Italy had fully established an agreement on the Mediterranean issue before considering it.

### Inside Story of the Political Turmoil in Belgium

Prime Minister Theunis Resigns

⊙Brussels Prime Minister Theunis once served as the vice president of the National Bank of Belgium before taking office. Recently, Theunis' political opponents attacked him for dereliction of duty during his tenure as vice president of the National Bank. According to responsible sources, the cabinet meeting this afternoon at 4 PM resulted in Theunis' decision to resign from the position of Prime Minister and request a temporary suspension of his duties as a member of the House of Representatives in order to present a defense to his political opponents regarding the old case of the National Bank. Regarding this matter, Theunis met with King Leopold III this morning and then consulted with Finance Minister De Man in the afternoon. Finally, he decided to resign during the cabinet meeting. What is not yet clear is whether Theunis resigned individually or whether the entire cabinet submitted a general resignation to the King. Responsible figures here believe that it is inappropriate for the cabinet to submit a general resignation on the eve of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Therefore, Prime Minister Theunis will probably submit his resignation alone, and the cabinet will be temporarily headed by Finance Minister De Man, who will also serve as Prime Minister, to continue the discussions on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference.

### Famous British Writer Upholds Justice

Says International Lawlessness Should Not Be Merely Condemned

[London] Sir Norman Angell, a famous British writer (who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1933), and several leftists recently co-signed a letter published in The Times, stating, "If we merely condemn international lawlessness, attempt to patch things up, and seek to safeguard peace, this policy has completely failed. As far as Italy is concerned, if European countries want to reach an understanding under the current circumstances, it must be based on the following: (1) Recognizing the country's annexation of Abyssinia, (2) Turning a blind eye to the country's invasion of Spain, (3) Not interfering with the country if it engages in further violations of international law, (4) Member states of the League of Nations agreeing not to implement the various provisions contained in the Covenant against that country again. If this is the case, it will be tantamount to promoting anarchy and respecting lawlessness. Is this acceptable? Moreover, seeking compromise at such a cost is not enough to establish a foundation for future peace. According to recent news from Africa, although the capital of Abyssinia has been occupied, Abyssinia has not yet been conquered by Italy. For example, Poland, Ireland, Serbia, and the two provinces of Alsace-Lorraine were once conquered by other countries, but they have all escaped their shackles. This can serve as clear evidence. Now that we know that a certain situation is not necessarily a fait accompli, how can we abandon justice and immediately recognize it as a fait accompli? Abyssinia may ultimately become a symbol of law and justice in international lawlessness, and we must not abandon it lightly." (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)

It is claimed that the topic of conversation between German Ambassador to England Ribbentrop in Italy and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was the strategy of delay. After the talks, Italy and Germany notified rebel leader General Franco that the date for withdrawing volunteers was still far away and that he could carry out a general offensive on the Aragon front.

(2) The situation in Central Europe. Regarding the latter, according to reports from Roman diplomatic circles, German leader Hitler intends to propose the organization of a neutral group in Central Europe in the near future, so that it can assume the task of security between the Italy-Germany axis and the France-Britain alliance.

### First Aid Knowledge for Burns

News Bureau Road Incendiary Bomb Injures People; Lack of Knowledge Leads to Severe Injury and Death

Dr. Zhang Jinshu, a renowned figure in Western medicine, observed that since the Japanese invaders began indiscriminate bombing, countless innocent people have been poisoned by them. Many died from severe injuries due to lack of timely treatment. However, many others suffered minor injuries but died due to lack of basic knowledge. In the recent incendiary bomb incident on Xinza Road, eyewitnesses reported that many victims ran around wildly when their clothes caught fire, causing the flames to intensify and burn their bodies. It was a pitiful sight. Therefore, he drafted simple first aid knowledge for burns to inform the people, hoping that all sectors would publicize it to remedy the situation. Burns can be broadly divided into three levels based on severity: ㊀ skin redness, heat, and pain; ㊁ blistering; ㊂ charring. These three levels can exist in one person simultaneously. If more than two-thirds of a person's skin is burned, or even less, it poses a significant danger, even if not immediately fatal. Treatment methods: ㊀ Apply any type of oil to prevent contact with air and alleviate pain. ㊁ If blisters are too large, use a needle or scissors to puncture the lowest part of the blister and gently squeeze out the water (the needle and scissors must be cleaned with alcohol or burned over a flame before use and allowed to cool). Avoid rubbing vigorously to prevent skinning, which can lead to infection and increased pain, making future healing difficult. Simply squeeze out the water and apply oil. ㊂ Charring is the most severe level of burn and requires medical treatment. In general, remain calm in the event of an accident. If clothing catches fire, do not run or jump, or pour water on it. Simply roll on the ground or wrap yourself in a coat or bedding to extinguish the fire by isolating it from the air. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to the fire consuming the body and causing death.

We hereby make the correction.

### The War of Resistance and Bountiful Harvest

— Sun Huairen

Judging from the agricultural conditions in various regions recently, this year is likely to be another bountiful year, similar to last year. This is indeed a welcome and joyful piece of news for our current War of Resistance. In other words, the abundant harvest of agricultural products not only solves the food problem in our War of Resistance but also stabilizes the economic strength of most of our people. However, based on past experience, a bountiful harvest in China sometimes not only brings no benefits but even leads to the adverse result of "low grain prices harming farmers." Therefore, whether we can effectively utilize this year's bountiful harvest for the War of Resistance depends on whether we can implement strict planning as early as possible.

Originally, China's grain production could not be considered sufficient. Even with last year's bountiful harvest, rice production was only 900 million shi dan (a Chinese unit of dry measure), and wheat production was only 460 million shi dan. If these amounts are divided equally among half of the national population, the per capita consumption is still extremely limited. In theory, it should not lead to "low grain prices harming farmers." Therefore, the cause of the past abnormal disasters caused by abundant harvests should not be attributed to agriculture itself. Instead, it should be attributed to the agricultural product circulation system outside of agriculture. In other words, the inconvenience of domestic transportation in the past and the food control policies of each province acting independently were the sole causes of disasters caused by abundant harvests.

These two factors may still exist during this War of Resistance period if they are not thoroughly adjusted. The inconvenience of transportation is likely to be even worse than usual, and uncoordinated food policies may still appear in various regions, resulting in abundant production areas having extremely low grain prices while production-deficient areas have exorbitantly high prices. This will not only fail to increase the economic power of most of the people (farmers) but will also greatly hinder the food problem in the War of Resistance. We know that new grains are already being harvested successively, and the situation of the War of Resistance is expanding daily. Therefore, the government seems to have a necessary need to promptly implement the Wartime Food Management Regulations promulgated on August 18th of this year. The distribution, transportation, and production and sales prices of wartime food nationwide should have comprehensive planning.

At the same time, to prevent food shortages during the future wartime, we feel it is necessary to promote a "grain consumption movement" during this bountiful year. On the one hand, we should promote the most effective utilization of grain (for example, minimizing bran consumption when milling wheat and avoiding excessive polishing when milling rice) and conserve many unnecessary grain consumption practices (such as brewing alcohol and feeding livestock). On the other hand, we should promote the consumption of coarse grains. This type of conservation movement should be promoted voluntarily by the public, but the Wartime Food Administration should also make every effort to encourage it. Many scientists (such as medical experts and food chemists) should also find ways to popularize correct grain knowledge among the public, simply telling the public what is the most economical and beneficial way for us to use grain and what things can replace daily grain. In this way, everyone's conservation can be properly guided.

In short, this year's bountiful harvest is already beyond doubt. However, how to make good use of this bountiful harvest to contribute to the War of Resistance is the most important thing at present. If this issue cannot be resolved, then we will face many troubles regarding the food and rural issues in the War of Resistance.

### Details of the Enemy Bombing in the West of Songjiang

Enemy planes bombed Songjiang extensively on the 24th of this month. As recorded by this newspaper, the details are as follows. Around 1 p.m. on that afternoon, residents had just finished their meals when they suddenly heard a rumbling sound. They saw an enemy plane circling in the air and dropping six bombs in the Nuoqiao Street in the western suburbs. As those planes were heading northeast, three more enemy planes circled once in the western suburbs and dropped four more bombs east and west of Qianjing Bridge, including one incendiary bomb. One bomb was dropped at Jingjiayan, two bombs were dropped west of Xiaocang Bridge, and one bomb was dropped at Caihuajing. While dropping bombs, the enemy planes also fired machine guns. The areas that suffered the most were Changqiao Street and Qianjing Bridge. These two places are the busiest parts of western Songyi County. From Chenjiaqiao Gate to the car road in Changqiao, buildings such as Yunmian Grand Theater, Deyi Tea House, Xin Song Hotel, and residential houses on both sides were bombed and destroyed, killing dozens of people and injuring over a hundred. Five staff members of a certain nanhuo (southern goods) store, three people inside a dim sum shop, and six workers inside a printing shop were all killed. The newly appointed police chief, Chen Yuchu, was staying at Xin Song Hotel with several attendants when the incident occurred. Fortunately, Guangjun soldiers Shen Xianren and Jin Bugen bravely stepped forward and rescued Chief Chen from serious injuries. His attendant Qian Yunlong was killed on the spot with a hole in his chest. Street vendors selling pancakes and sweet potatoes, customers at Deyi Tea House, and passers-by were either killed or seriously injured, totaling about a hundred people. All were rescued and buried by the Red Cross rescue team, and the injured were sent to hospitals for treatment. Two bombs landed inside the broken cotton shop on the east side of Qianjing Bridge. The shop had just built a bomb shelter the day before, using over a hundred large bags of broken cotton stacked in a hole in the open space behind the shop, which could accommodate fifty to sixty people. When the enemy planes circled, nearby residents rushed to the shelter, helping the old and carrying the young. Unexpectedly, two bombs landed in the shelter, causing the house to collapse and blocking the exit. The stacked broken cotton caught fire. All the people inside the shelter were burned to death, totaling over fifty people. Those who have been identified include Sheng Jingsheng's eldest son and his wife, a child, and his concubine and young son, all of whom were seriously injured. A doctor surnamed Wang, four members of a pig trader surnamed Shen's family, five members of a rice shop owner surnamed Xue's family, and two carpenters were also killed. According to nearby residents, about twenty to thirty people have not yet been found. Several bathers inside the Songquan Bathhouse were seriously injured. Two bombs on the west side landed in the homes of a carpenter surnamed Bao and Mao Yongchi, causing a fire on the spot. A vegetable apprentice was killed, and dozens of people were injured. Nearby houses were destroyed. For a time, both the east and west sides were ablaze, with cries of agony everywhere, a scene too horrible to bear. After the fire trucks from the Third District extinguished the fire, it was finally put out around 9 p.m. Two bombs on the west side of Xiaocang Bridge landed in Hu Rongchu's home, destroying five rooms and ten courtyards, leaving no tile intact. Nearby houses were also collapsed, crushing Hu's wife, Yu, his eldest son, Bo Yun, two grandchildren, two tenants, and an apprentice from Haoshengqia Sauce Garden. Dozens of people were injured. One bomb on the east side of Jiangjing Bridge landed on Liu Yancheng's house, destroying three buildings and seriously injuring one woman. The rest were slightly injured. One bomb on the west side landed on Du Wenquan's house. Fortunately, the Du family had already moved back to Shanghai, so no one was injured. Only a few huts were destroyed. One bomb at Jingjiayan landed in the field, and one bomb at Caihuajing landed in front of a wood shop, killing one person. In total, the enemy planes dropped sixteen bombs that day without any target. All those who suffered this catastrophe were civilians. About a hundred people were killed, and about two to three hundred people were injured. Such blatant brutality is intolerable to human nature and reason.

### Soldiers and Civilians Enthusiastically Purchase National Salvation Bonds

Security Corps Transfers Rewards to Purchase Bonds; Ms. Yu Danhan Sells Property to Alleviate National Crisis

Since the start of the fundraising for the National Salvation Bonds, people across the country, both soldiers and civilians, have been eagerly purchasing them. It is even more commendable that the entire officers and soldiers of the Shanghai Security Corps have used all their rewards and consolation money, totaling 6,500 yuan, to purchase National Salvation Bonds after fighting the war. The letter from the head of the corps, Ji Zhangjian, to the fundraising association is recorded below to show their general patriotic enthusiasm. "We have been ordered to participate in the front-line war of resistance since the start of the war. The morale of the officers and soldiers is very high. Officers and soldiers in each team, after reading reports of the government issuing National Salvation Bonds and overseas Chinese enthusiastically purchasing them, were greatly encouraged. Officers and soldiers voluntarily requested that the 3,500 yuan reward money given to our corps by the authorities this time, and the 3,000 yuan consolation money given to our corps by the Shanghai Municipal Government, totaling 6,500 yuan, be used to purchase public bonds to support the national treasury. This is a national salvation matter and should be the enthusiasm of soldiers. Now, we are sending a check from the Shanghai Municipal Bank for 6,500 yuan with this letter, hoping you will receive it and provide a receipt."

The women's group is very active in raising funds for public bonds, and their achievements have reached more than 300,000 yuan. Yesterday, they received a letter from Ms. Yu Danhan, who is willing to entrust the group to sell her real estate and diamond ring to purchase public bonds. Ms. Yu's enthusiasm for patriotism and willingness to sell her property to alleviate the national crisis is deeply admirable. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Since the start of the invasion by the violent Japanese, I, Danhan, believe that all that can be contributed to the country should be contributed. Therefore, at the beginning of the Shanghai war, I donated two-thirds of my spare gold and silver utensils to the local association and used one-third to purchase National Salvation Bonds. Later, when the Lawyers Association raised funds for public bonds, Danhan also purchased 2,000 yuan. I am grateful for the favor of being appointed as the leader of the public bond fundraising team, but Danhan's financial resources and talents are limited, and I am deeply ashamed of not being able to do more. Now, I am sending a platinum-set two-and-a-half-carat diamond ring and six title deeds for 25.25 mu in the eighth yuan in the first district of the thirty-seventh bao of Songjiang County. I hope you will sell them on my behalf and exchange them for National Salvation Bonds, to express my heartfelt sentiment. As for all matters related to the association's work, I can only rely on the wise. During this long-term war of resistance, if Danhan has any progress, I will continue to fulfill my national responsibilities at any time to live up to your kindness." Those who wish to purchase these items can contact the women's group.

The association has also raised 500 yuan for donations to comfort the northern soldiers, which was submitted to the finance department of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday.

Postal Workers' Union

Staff: ㊀ Those with a monthly salary of 50 yuan or less shall purchase half a month's salary; ㊁ Those with a monthly salary of more than 50 yuan shall purchase one month's salary. B. Porters: ㊀ Those with a monthly salary of 20 yuan or less may purchase freely; ㊁ Those with a monthly salary of more than 10 yuan to 40 yuan shall purchase 5 yuan; ㊂ Those with a monthly salary of 40 yuan to 60 yuan shall purchase 10 yuan; ㊃ Those with a monthly salary of more than 60 yuan shall purchase 15 yuan. It was also decided to deduct the money in three months when paying salaries in November and December of this year. According to the above regulations, the total amount of National Salvation Bonds purchased by postal workers across the country is estimated to be around 3 million yuan.

Guangzhao Public Association

The Shanghai Guangzhao Public Association issued a circular to fellow villagers living in Shanghai to promote the purchase of National Salvation Bonds. The circular stated, "The violent enemy is invading, and the country is in danger. The loss of the country is equal to the loss of the home. All of our citizens should understand this meaning. In past wars, war bonds were mostly raised to strengthen the national power and fight for national survival. The government's issuance of National Salvation Bonds this time is intended to enhance the ability to resist the war. Our citizens' purchase of National Salvation Bonds is the only way to save the country and is the duty of our citizens. The National Salvation Bonds have an annual interest rate of 4%. Those who purchase the bonds are both contributing to the country and saving money for themselves, which is beneficial to both public and private. No other method is more beneficial. Our fellow villagers in Guangdong have always been patriotic and will not lag behind others. We hope that you will enthusiastically purchase the bonds, the more the better, but even a small amount is welcome. The minimum denomination of the bonds is five cents in national currency. This is a way to enable our citizens to universally fulfill their aspirations to save the country. Those with a little strength should fulfill a little duty. Regardless of the amount of bonds purchased, our association will be happy to purchase them on your behalf. Please remember the pain of losing the country and quickly pay the money to our association to purchase the bonds for national use."

### The Wartime Daily - A Hundred Facets (Third Continuation)

㊈ Import and Export Restrictions and the People's Livelihood

The Shanghai Incident occurred, and the power of China's resistance awakened Japan from its illusions of a swift victory. Consequently, it hastily prepared for a long-term war. The commentator Ito Masanori published an article in the Sino-Foreign Commercial News entitled "Discourse on a Long-Term War." He found it difficult to reconcile Prime Minister Konoe's statement in the Diet, "Calculation for a short-term decisive battle," as being rash. He said, "China largely adopts a strategy of retreat warfare, with the posture of offensive being merely a tactical element within a situation. It is not easy to find opportunities to inflict annihilating blows on large groups of tens of thousands. In other words, before pushing them to the point of desperation and inflicting the pain of high pressure, forcing them to risk a final battle, the Japanese army may not get the chance to demonstrate its true value in large-scale field battles. Therefore, a considerably long period of attack will be necessary. Although this is only an amateur observation, judging from the Chinese army's performance of considerable retreat warfare and the promotion of a long-term war strategy, there is no major flaw in Japan avoiding a strong-willed warfare that could lead to short-term and annihilating defeats." He also said, "The Japanese national character is inherently suited to short-term decisive battles, possessing an abundance of qualities like quick to anger and quick to reconcile, and being straightforward. These are the shortcomings of the Japanese that should be reflected upon and corrected step by step. Otherwise, if future wars are based on a long-term perspective, then the current complete national defense will be insufficient. The current Sino-Japanese Incident is just a testing ground with relatively few dangers. In this sense, the government authorities should be wise to promote an awareness of the current war."

Not only did the commentators advocate this, but Konoe himself also stated in a broadcast on the night of September 11th, "Even if it is a long-term operation, we will never yield halfway," which was a correction to his response in the Diet.

Therefore, the Japanese government has many long-term war measures, with foreign exchange control and import and export restrictions being the most notable. As a result of foreign exchange control, the import of movies from Europe and the United States has stopped. Because there are still some in stock, Japanese movie fans can still watch Western movies this year. From next year, these movie fans will probably only be able to watch those shallow, low-level Japanese domestic films full of feudal consciousness and militarism. Another ridiculous phenomenon caused by foreign exchange control is the "cultural isolation." "Isolation" is synonymous with China's "closed-door policy," meaning that from now on, (at least during the war), Japan will no longer send students or experts to Europe and the United States for study and research. The import of Western books will also be greatly restricted. Going on like this for three to five years, it is not difficult to imagine the backwardness of Japanese culture.

The prohibition of imports is also due to the management of foreign exchange. Because they do not want to export a single penny to foreign countries, they must naturally restrict or prohibit the import of foreign goods. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry issued a ministerial ordinance on October 10th prohibiting the import of as many as 300 kinds of goods, saving less than 40 million yen per year. The impact on the people's livelihood is as follows: First, Lipton tea from Ceylon, imported Worcestershire sauce, macaroni, curry mustard, "Shanghai chicken eggs," foreign wine, apples, lemons, etc. However, coffee is not prohibited because it is imported from Brazil, and the Japanese living in Brazil mainly make coffee, which is practically the same as Japanese goods. Similarly to coffee, ham, sausage, and cheese (Heese) are not prohibited in consideration of the feelings of foreigners and attracting Western tourists.

Regarding prohibited exports, most of them are military supplies, totaling eight types. Public opinion criticized that this would have a great impact on domestic industry. Therefore, direct military materials such as iron, stone, oil, lead, and aluminum are not handled according to the Temporary Measures Law for Import and Export, but are dealt with by the Military Industry Mobilization Law.

In addition to the prohibited imports and exports, the Japanese government also encourages frugality, that is, to be as thrifty as possible in the following raw materials and products in the national family life: cotton, sheepskin, iron, platinum, gold, copper, brass, lead, zinc, tin, wire, antimony, petroleum, rubber, wood, paper, leather, hemp, and coal, totaling nineteen types.

Commentary

### Symbol of Madness

— Yi

Since the beginning of the war, the enemy has been abusing weapons of the sea, land and air. Everywhere they massacre our people who did not participate in the fighting. On land, enemy aircraft often drop bombs at the sight of crowds. At sea, enemy warships often "sink fishing boats upon encountering them. " Such atrocities have left a permanent stain on human civilization.

But things are beyond reason. Under the state of undeclared war against our country. The enemy's irrational atrocities are also repeatedly applied to officials and soldiers of third countries. In August, enemy aircraft injured Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen under the prominent British flag. On the twelfth of this month, the British Embassy's motorcade of four countries passed near Minhang. After the enemy received notification from the British side. They sent planes to bomb them again. British Air Attache Murray was almost killed. On the 22nd, enemy aircraft dropped incendiary bombs on the British military defense zone in the Public Concession. Forty or fifty civilians were killed or injured. On the 23rd, enemy aircraft went to the British military defense zone on the Avenue Haig and strafed British soldiers with machine guns. The result was one dead and one wounded. What is the intention of this series of atrocities? It does not seem to be predictable by common sense.

Everyone feels that the fragile Japanese imperialism, under the strong resistance of our country. Has felt very difficult. At least for now, they are definitely unwilling to make more enemies. But since the start of the war. The performance of various facts has proven that the enemy's disregard for the atrocities of third countries is a symbol of extreme madness. This implies to the world. Although it is still waging war in China now. But it is already preparing to invade the British and American territories in the Pacific.

### Part of the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway Line Has Been Breached, We Are Closely Defending and Actively Counterattacking

The enemy on the front of Dachang has been repelled by us. Our army is guarding Chenjiaxiang in the direction of Nanxiang. The enemy once attacked the Miaohang line and suffered heavy losses.

For several days, the enemy has been attempting to invade Nanxiang and Dachang with their main force. After our close interception, fierce battles have continued. On the front of Huochang, after our main force gave them a head-on blow, they have been unable to penetrate deeper. However, a section of the highway between Houjiakuzhai, about 1,500 meters west of Dachang, and Xinzhaizhai and Laozhai, was breached by the enemy last night. The enemy first used aircraft and artillery to bombard fiercely all day long, followed by armored vehicles to cover infantry, charging towards our positions. Although our army braved the dense artillery fire and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the position was breached due to overwhelming firepower. At night, our army launched a fierce counterattack and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. However, due to the heavy damage to the fortifications, it was impossible to hold, so they retreated to the line from Laoxuzhai to Wangjiazhai below the highway, closely deployed defenses, and are actively counterattacking. There is no change on the Guangfu line. The town is still in our hands. Although the enemy bombarded all day yesterday, we guarded Chen Di without any damage. The enemy in Chenjiahang, north of the bank (formerly Chenjiaxiang), has now advanced to Mengjiazhai, Jinjiazhai, Xiejiazhai, and Lijiazhai. Our army's fortifications are deep and strict, and the enemy will never be able to advance. Shixianggong Temple is still persevering and there is no war. As for the northeast side of Dachang, from Fengjiazhai to the Miaohang line, the enemy once attacked to support the enemy in the northwest of Dachang, threatening our Dachang position, but we resisted fiercely and were impeccable. We still hold the Miaohang stronghold. There was only a small contact in the Jiangwan area yesterday. We set up a guard line on the west side of the Shanghai Recreation Ground racecourse. Fierce street fighting broke out in Zhabei this morning. We killed more than 40 enemies and captured four light machine guns. The enemy was defeated miserably and continued to retreat.

### The Enemy Is Flanking Our Two Wings in An Attempt to Invade Dachang Is Still Safe

Although the Nanjing-Shanghai Highway on the Left Wing Was Breached at One Point, The Enemy Has Been Intercepted by Us and Is Exhausted and Unable to Advance Further The Right Wing Position Remains Unmoved, As Stable As a Rock

According to a report from the Central News Agency's Dachang correspondent at 1:15 PM on the 26th, the enemy army west of Dachang launched a fierce attack under the cover of aircraft and artillery, forcibly crossing Zoumatang. A fierce battle broke out between the highway and Zoumatang. The enemy continuously reinforced, gathering a force of more than one regiment. Our army repeatedly charged several times last night, annihilating many enemies, but eventually the artillery fire was too dense to advance forward to wipe out the enemy. By dawn this morning, the enemy, under the cover of aircraft, had fled south along the east bank of the river for about 800 meters. They were blocked by our army near Gejiaqiaozhai. The enemy's momentum has weakened, so they are hiding everywhere, not daring to engage in a decisive battle with us, seeming to preserve their remaining forces. We are now closely monitoring them. A part of the enemy army, in order to support the remnants of Gejiaqiaozhai, invaded to the southwest. They launched a fierce attack last night without success. This morning, they blocked Zoumatang, opened more than a dozen combat vehicles, and charged our positions. Airplanes and artillery also concentrated their bombardment. Our army was unusually calm, guarding the positions of Chenjiazhai and Meiyuanzhai, and confronting the enemy. On the Dachang front, the enemy crossed the Liuhang-Dachang Highway and attacked Yaocuntang in Ximipu. The fierce battle has not stopped from last night until this morning, but our position has not changed. After suffering a major blow from the enemy's frontal attack on Dachang, they have now changed their strategy and are flanking our two wings. Although our left wing has been breached, it has been intercepted by us and is unable to advance further. The right wing remains unmoved, so Dachang town is still intact and as stable as a rock.

### Intense Artillery Battle Unfolded in Guangfu

The Enemy Army Did Not Dare to Charge

In Guangfu, a fierce artillery battle unfolded starting at 10 PM last night, but the enemy army never dispersed and came forward to charge. According to a military organization report, the enemy initially began to concentrate artillery fire at 9:30, bombing our Guangfu position. Our army initially ignored it, but the enemy's artillery fire became increasingly dense, so our ×× artillery positions retaliated with heavy artillery, becoming more intense until 12:30 AM, the sound of artillery could be heard clearly within a five-kilometer radius. The two sides exchanged fire until after 2 AM this morning. It is estimated that the enemy fired no less than a thousand shells, and our side retaliated with 400 shells. However, the enemy fired without any target, so our side was not affected in any way. On the contrary, the shells fired by our gunners were exceptionally accurate, and the enemy suffered heavy losses.

Because many civilian houses in that area were hit and caught fire, our army knew that the enemy was attacking and immediately launched a fierce counterattack from the intersections of Dongshixing Road and Guangdong Street, etc. For a time, fierce street fighting unfolded, and until 6 AM this morning, the enemy army could not withstand it and retreated. In this battle, more than 40 enemies were killed and four light machine guns were captured.

### Pudong Is in a State of Truce

However, Enemy Machine Guns Still Strafe From Time to Time

In Pudong, our army and the enemy ships continued to be in a state of truce. Last night, when our air force came to Shanghai for a night raid for the third time, the enemy ships, fearing our land and air attack, fired five or six shots each time as a demonstration. However, the sound of machine guns throughout the night occurred every 20 to 30 minutes. This is the routine of the enemy ships strafing along the Pudong bank every night.

### Enemy Planes Continue Bombing This Morning

At around 6 AM this morning, more than 30 enemy planes took off and flew to Dachang, Nanxiang, and western Shanghai. After 8:30 AM, they continued to bomb Zhabei.

### The Enemy Has Transported Six More Heavy Artillery Pieces

Preparing to Attack Our Pudong and Zhabei

The enemy transported six heavy artillery pieces with a diameter of 40 degrees, and more than a dozen smaller-caliber ones, and placed them in the Jilin Road Huishan Park area. It is reported that they are preparing to attack our Pudong and Zhabei areas.

Because the enemy is afraid of the threat of our artillery fire in Pudong, most of the military supplies and necessities recently transported have not been unloaded at the Huangpu, Osaka, Huishan, and China Merchants Bureau wharves, but have been unloaded at the Qiujiang Wharf. The storage method of the unloaded military supplies has also been changed. Wooden stakes are planted along the north side of the Jiangong Road along the river, wooden beams are placed on the stakes, and then iron plates are covered, and the plates are covered with soil. The area of the original Jiangong Road is widened by one-third, and military supplies are stored in it. At the same time, the enemy can also enter it to avoid artillery fire and bombs. It has been found that this construction extends from Shanghai University in Yangshupu to Zhanghuabang, which is tens of miles long.

### Enemy Military Supplies Still on the Wharf

The Enemy Is Hurrying to Install Cranes to Facilitate Transportation

On the 24th, the enemy transport ship Amakusa Maru, etc., transported from Sasebo to the Osaka Wharf. Apart from the large number of military supplies at the Huangpu Wharf being transported by enemy trucks to the front line for use, the remaining military supplies and a small number of bullets had not been transported by 11 AM today.

At the same time, there are more than a dozen enemy soldiers hurrying to install cranes at the wharf to be used for lifting and unloading heavy military equipment.

According to the Central News Agency, at around 6 AM this morning (the 26th), another enemy merchant ship converted into a transport ship, Toyomitsu Maru, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Wharf, carrying more than a thousand articles of military supplies.

In Order to Facilitate the Nighttime Traffic and Berthing of Enemy Ships

It is reported that starting today, two enemy steamships have separately gone to transport them and install them in the Huangpu River and Wusong areas, so as to facilitate the nighttime traffic and berthing of enemy ships.

### The Nine-Power Treaty Conference Is Postponed for Three Days

The Reason Is That There Is a Political Tide in Belgium, The Japanese Cabinet Will Decide to Refuse to Participate, More Than Forty American Organizations Support the Meeting

⊙ Brussels The Nine-Power Conference was originally scheduled to open here on October 30, but according to semi-official news, the opening date may be postponed for several days due to the Belgian cabinet tide, about to be postponed to November 3. However, there is no definite hope for the postponement matter. According to Belgium, the occurrence of the cabinet tide is due to the resignation of Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland. The opposition has recently pointed out that Zeeland, when he was the Deputy Governor of the National Bank several years ago, had many drawbacks in handling the bank's affairs. Zeeland decided to resign for the sake of free defense. The cabinet members also unanimously decided to advance and retreat with the Prime Minister during the cabinet meeting yesterday, so the cabinet tide broke out. It is rumored that the United Kingdom and the United States want to cooperate at the meeting in order to terminate the Sino-Japanese conflict through international action and mediation methods. However, neither the United Kingdom nor the United States is willing to adopt any radical requirements for punishing Japan. Before the Belgian cabinet resigned, a reporter from the Deutsche Nachrichten Agentur visited Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, who said when talking about the Nine-Power Conference that the meeting encountered an extremely difficult problem. If this meeting is not a court to judge the merits and demerits of a country's behavior, and the representatives attending the meeting are willing to make sincere efforts to reconcile the existing disputes, then this meeting can satisfactorily resolve the matter. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 16th)

[Washington] The National Peace Congress, composed of forty organizations, wrote to Secretary of State Hull today, supporting the government's participation in the Nine-Power Conference, saying that condemning war or isolating military aggression is not enough to produce practical results. Economic and political justice is the only basis for rebuilding lasting peace. We believe that the United States should cooperate with the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to initiate steps towards economic adjustment to improve the living standards of all nations. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 25th)

[Tokyo] All Japanese newspapers expressed sympathy for the Japanese government's decision not to participate in the Nine-Power Conference in Belgium. According to semi-official news, the cabinet will approve this decision this morning. After approval by the Emperor of Japan, it will formally reply to the Belgian government. Asahi Shimbun reported that the wording of the reply will still be discussed, so it may be delayed by one or two days. The organizations that clearly expressed opposition to Japan's participation in the meeting include the House of Representatives Members' Association and the Retired Civil and Military Officials' Association.

### The Belgian Cabinet Resigned En Masse

⊙ Brussels According to an official announcement here tonight, the Zeeland cabinet formally resigned this afternoon. This move was expected long ago. Because of the matter of the National Bank, the opposition party spared no effort in criticizing Prime Minister Zeeland. It is said that Zeeland announced his resignation plan at the cabinet meeting this afternoon, so the cabinet decided to advance and retreat with the Prime Minister and proposed a mass resignation. After the meeting, Zeeland immediately met with King Leopold to report that he and the government had submitted their resignations. At the same time, the ministers jointly sent a letter to the Prime Minister, stating their loyalty. According to informed sources here, the new cabinet will not have any changes in terms of political inclination compared to the previous cabinet. In other words, it will still be jointly formed by the Social Democratic Party, the Catholic Party, and the Liberal Party. As for the candidate for Prime Minister, although Spaak and Finance Minister de Man have been called for to succeed, it has not been determined at this time. Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland submitted his resignation yesterday afternoon and gave a speech on the radio station in the evening, explaining the reason for his resignation. Zeeland first said that in his two times joining the cabinet, there was a spirit of unifying the country. This situation has gradually dissipated in recent months. Some people have expressed dissatisfaction from time to time. He himself has tried to cooperate with them, but has not succeeded, so the unity of the country cannot be achieved, and government measures are repeatedly obstructed. At the same time, the opposition party, because it cannot attack the policy and the government itself, is nitpicking and deliberately slandering the cabinet members, especially the Prime Minister. Although he has repeatedly refuted, he still cannot stop the slander. He has no choice but to take a leave of absence for several months and not ask about political affairs. The reason why he delayed his resignation at that time was to fear that the situation would become more complicated, but after leaving Beijing, the situation worsened. The attack on him personally involved the National Bank. Zeeland repeatedly stated that the National Bank has nothing to do with him personally and asked that for the sake of the bank, this misconception should be swept away immediately. He will often support this work after he has freedom of action. Zeeland expressed his regret that the government was forced to resign before completing its work, but he sought national unity as early as possible, saying, "Although personnel may change, the country will never change. The only important thing is the future of the country." (Telegraph from the National Maritime Daily on the 25th)

### Continued Reports of Deaths and Injuries from Enemy Aircraft Bombs

This Morning, Anti-Aircraft Shells Killed an Elderly Woman

More victims of enemy aircraft atrocities have been discovered today. ⑴ Chen Yousan, 38 years old, was injured by incendiary bombs on Xin Zha Road, Yangbaige Road, on the 22nd. ⑵ Zhou Agui, 36 years old, was injured by enemy aircraft bombs on Zhongshan Road at 4:10 pm on the 24th. ⑶ Gu Dengguang, 30 years old, was injured by enemy aircraft bombs in Beixinjing at 9:00 am on the 24th. ⑷ Chen Xiaolin, 17 years old, was killed by enemy aircraft bombs in Zhabei at 10:00 am on the 25th. The above cases have all been verified by the First Special Court and arrangements for burial have been ordered.

At 1:50 AM this morning, when our heroic air force came to Shanghai for the third time, before even reaching the airspace above Shanghai, enemy ships in the Huangpu River frantically opened fire with anti-aircraft machine guns. Enemy fire swept the area, causing stray bullets to fly everywhere. One of the bullets landed on No. 18, Mingde Lane, Fuxu Road, piercing a hole in the roof and falling straight through the second and third floors to the ground. At the same time, Ms. Wang, a 50-year-old tenant on the second floor, was seriously injured in the head. She died from her injuries before she could be taken to the hospital for treatment. Several pieces of anti-aircraft shrapnel also fell in the Chengdu Road area and near the Xin Zha police station. Yesterday, another shell (3-inch caliber) flew into No. 208 and No. 209 of the Hardoon Apartments and exploded immediately, fortunately without injuring anyone.

### Central, HSBC and Other Banks Open Reciprocal Accounts

No Interest Paid on Temporarily Deposited Funds

Since the Ministry of Finance announced measures to stabilize the financial situation, permitting the transfer of funds by draft and allowing account transfers but prohibiting cash withdrawals, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and other banks, together with foreign banks such as HSBC, Chartered Bank, and Citibank, have opened reciprocal accounts in order to stabilize the Shanghai financial market. It has been stipulated that no interest will be paid on temporarily deposited funds. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Before the Shanghai war, both Chinese and foreign banks settled accounts with each other daily through drafts. The above-mentioned method of opening reciprocal accounts was agreed upon only after the Shanghai war.

### Xie Lin's Appointment as Co-Organizer of the Sichuan Finance Department is Incorrect

Xie Has Sent a Telegram to Shanghai Denying It

A Chongqing telegram reported the previous day that Xie Lin, currently serving in the Sichuan Provincial Finance Department, was acting on behalf of the department and concurrently serving as its co-organizer. (Note: Mr. Xie is the former special commissioner of finance for Sichuan Province.) According to reliable information obtained by a Xin Xin News Agency reporter, this statement is completely based on external misreporting and is not factual. Furthermore, Mr. Xie himself sent a telegram to Shanghai from Chengdu this morning, denying it.

### British Consulate Observes the Shanghai Battle Situation

Japanese Army Occupying Zhabei by the End of the Month is Factually Impossible

According to observations by the British Consulate, the Japanese army in Guangfu Chenjiaxing seems to have the possibility of breaking through the Chinese army's positions and occupying Nanxiang, but the Chinese army in Zhabei will not be affected in any way and can still firmly defend its original positions. Moreover, the Chinese army's positions at Dachang are not likely to be in danger either. The Japanese army's plan to occupy Zhabei by the end of this month is factually impossible.

### Trivial Comments

— Fortune Telling

Someone said, "Nine One Eight," "One Two Eight," "Seven Seven," "Eight One Three," these numbers added together are "One Nine Three Seven," precisely the number for this year, 1937. Therefore, this year is the year to settle old scores with the enemy. Don't say this is a "King Wen Yi Jing" style prediction. But based on the facts, the opportunity to settle old scores has arrived. It will not be easily let go. But this time settling old scores with the enemy is a total settlement, a grand reckoning. It is not calculated piece by piece, nor one chapter today and one chapter tomorrow. It has to wait for the final total number. Now it is just beginning the period of settling scores. Before the Sino-Japanese war broke out, Chairman Chiang did not say, "The two countries will not break apart if they can help it. Once broken, there will be no reason for compromise midway, no reason to stop midway. Whether fighting to the last soldier and general, the last land and gun, we must criticize. We would rather perish together than compromise midway." The ancients said, "When will this day perish? I will perish with you." Using these two phrases today is very appropriate.

### A Returnee from Japan Speaks

(Special Write-up from Shuizhou) I heard a few days ago that a friend of mine had returned from Japan, but I couldn't find out his recent address from any of our acquaintances, or whether he was even staying in Shanghai. Yesterday, I happened to meet him at a gathering. When we tightly shook hands, it was truly a moment of "mixed joy and sorrow," and we couldn't speak for a long time.

He was very happy because many of our more familiar friends had gathered at this event. "I finally came back alive!" This was the first thing he said to me. At first, I wanted to laugh. "Escaping from the jaws of death" is something to be glad about. But then I didn't think that way. "Coming back alive"! What a strong expression!

Because he was very busy after returning to the country, we only had a two-hour chat before parting. During that time, he told me a lot about the dynamics of Japanese society after the outbreak of the war, which might be of interest to readers. Therefore, I have noted it down in a haphazard way below.

The strong resistance we put up after the outbreak of the Shanghai war was something the Japanese warlords did not expect, and the heavy losses made them unexpectedly flustered. At the same time, the war in North China was not going very smoothly either, so they mobilized all their powerful troops and the latest weapons in order to achieve a "quick victory." However, some people think that Japan cannot sustain this for more than half a year. That estimate is probably somewhat mistaken. Their decades of war preparations are unlikely to be so short-lived. Although the Japanese people oppose the warlords' militarism, under a consistent policy of coercion, they are all afraid to speak out. Moreover, thanks to their clever propaganda, some brainless Japanese people still seem to be anesthetized by the warlords.

After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, every city in Japan showed a feverish war fervor. Women were unexpectedly crowded on every bustling street corner. They were all sewing "thousand-person stitches" to be presented to every departing soldier. Housewives occasionally went out to buy something, but they often lingered on the street for several hours, being "kidnapped" at every reasonable distance to stitch a needle on a cloth. What effect does this thing have after all? It's really too disappointing for the patriotic women of Japan. He has created a lot of fresh material for Chinese newspapers.

At the same time, patriotic women's associations were also established. They went to the streets, cafes, cinemas... everywhere to raise donations. They didn't know that the government would use this money to bury their husbands and sons in the flames of war, and there would never be a day to reunite! In the newspapers, don't we often see letters from home found on Japanese soldiers? Their mothers and wives are burning incense day and night, praying for their safe return.

It is only natural for Chinese people to be monitored by their criminal police (police), especially students studying abroad. If there is the slightest suspicion, they are immediately arrested. After the arrest, they seem to disappear without a trace. Although the Returned Students Association of Japan has reported this situation in detail after returning to China, what else can we say besides considering it "regrettable" that civilized countries are using such uncivilized means!

Currently, there are still more than one hundred students studying abroad who cannot return to the country. Studying in Japan now, the mental pain they suffer is imaginable. We should help them so that they can return to the country and do the work they can do.

Next are the officials in the embassy. However, because they are officials, the treatment is a little more "civilized." Twenty or thirty cars park in front of the embassy every day. As long as someone comes out of the embassy, one of their cars will follow them. When necessary, they will also come to interrogate you and record your statement. It is said that once an embassy official lost track of the criminal police who was following him. The next day, the criminal police begged him not to play jokes like that in the future, because they had to report the record of the person they were following to the police department every day: naturally, how could they hand in a "blank paper?"

Since several requests for aid have failed, the domestic atmosphere has changed somewhat. Although their news control is quite strict, all Japanese newspapers publish news of the "Imperial Army" winning every day, such as capturing a certain place on a certain day, a certain place turning into ashes, and even the escape of certain important people, etc. But every day, only troops are seen departing, which makes people somewhat suspicious of the news of "victory." Therefore, when every soldier in the countryside departs, his family, relatives, neighbors, and colleagues, and if he is a teacher, his students, must hold a large-scale farewell party. The surface is of course to embolden them, but it is also an implication of "farewell."

The crazy warlords certainly see this situation, so they hope for a quick victory even more in the Shanghai war. However, regardless of the future of this hope, they are secretly planning and preparing for a long-term war even more. Because they feel that they have already encountered such unprecedented difficulties in dealing with China, and they have many more enemies to deal with, how can they be at ease?

Now they have banned the import of various luxury goods. Already imported inventory has invisibly raised prices. Many people can't even afford a cup of coffee now. The raw materials of various military supplies are all prohibited from export. Because the workers in various factories have already gone to war, female students are replacing them in their work. This situation shows that they are struggling to cope with the war. (Ping)

### Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi Publish Letters to the Public and Encouragement to the Soldiers Before Departing

Seeking Benevolence and Obtaining Benevolence, Righteousness Without Turning Back, Bravely Advancing and Killing All Japanese Bandits

Guilin Dispatch: Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army, and Bai Chongxi, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, have already gone to Nanjing one after another to supervise the anti-Japanese war as ordered. Before departing, they published letters to all comrades and compatriots in the province and letters of encouragement to all soldiers, full of generosity and indignation, and righteousness without turning back. Excerpts are as follows.

Letter to All Comrades and Compatriots in the Province

All Comrades in the Party, Government, and Military of Guangxi, and All Compatriots in the Province,

Zongren and Chongxi, as we are ordered to lead troops northward to participate in the sacred national self-defense war, specially issue these few words to inform our beloved comrades and compatriots throughout the province.

This time, Japan has used its brutal troops to launch a large-scale invasion, attempting to allow our Divine Land to be divided at will, and to enslave our compatriots across the country. Our National Government and the people across the country, having reached the point of unbearable tolerance, have united and risen up, determined to make the ultimate sacrifice, and wage a full-scale war of resistance against the Japanese bandits.

This war is a national self-defense war. This war is a sacred war of humanity. We are fighting to win national survival, to preserve our homes and foundations, to save ourselves, and to safeguard world peace. Every citizen of the Chinese nation must sacrifice everything and devote themselves to this sacred war of self-defense, and must concentrate everything to contribute to this war of life and death.

My beloved comrades and compatriots,

In recent years, we in Guangxi have long known that a national self-defense war is inevitable, and have long known the importance of our sacrifices and contributions in the self-defense war. We have made a brave and determined decision to work hard and diligently, guided by the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, and practicing the Three Self Policies, striving to build Guangxi and revive China in the great cause of national salvation. At the same time, we must promote the proposition and action of scorched-earth resistance, so that our spirit of saving the country can be carried forward and extended to the whole country. Fortunately, all our comrades in the Party, government, and military have devoted themselves to their duties, and all our compatriots in the province have reduced their food and clothing and shared the burden, so that our preparations for national salvation and construction in Guangxi have been able to proceed step by step, and our proposition of scorched-earth resistance has been able to promote today's nationwide struggle.

Since the rise of the anti-Japanese army, we have carried forward and promoted justice in spirit and strived to be the first. Because the Fifth Army was quickly mobilized, the hearts of people at home and abroad have been greatly shaken. At the same time, in practice, we have contributed all the results of our years of preparation to the country's sacred war. Whether it is the mobilization of soldiers, the requisition of military supplies, the construction of transportation, or the service of manpower, the country relies heavily on us in Guangxi and expects a lot from us.

This is ironclad evidence of the achievements of our Three Self Policies, and it is the only prayer for our construction of Guangxi. The sweat and blood of our years of hard work and sacrifice have condensed into today's great crystallization contributed to the country. Seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, righteousness without turning back, we truly feel that the hardships of the past are worth comforting, that the contributions of today are glorious, and we feel even more deeply the great responsibility of the future.

My beloved comrades and compatriots,

The survival of the nation depends on this self-defense war. The final victory of the war depends on the long-term battles ahead. And the long-term battles deeply rely on the continuous revitalization, continuous sacrifice, continuous construction, and continuous contribution of the rear.

We must know that every bullet that kills the enemy is supplied by the rear. Every soldier who kills the enemy is trained by the rear. Every grain of rice that fills the stomach of the soldiers is produced by the rear. Every piece of clothing that protects against the cold is manufactured by the rear. All the components of the war, all the activities of the war, and all the support of the war must constantly rely on our beloved comrades and compatriots in the rear. We, the people of the whole country, are fighting together. And this war is a war that determines our life and death. In this war, Guangxi bears a particularly heavy responsibility.

My beloved comrades and compatriots,

Take on our glorious mission and strive for the final victory of the war.

We must unite in spirit, strengthen our will, obey all the laws and decrees of the government, and support the Supreme Commander Chiang Kai-shek in resisting Japan to the end.

We must intensify youth military training, enrich militia training, and fulfill our military service obligations.

We must practice strict economy, donate to military supplies, work hard in production, and increase material resources.

We must assist in the recruitment of labor, complete transportation construction, and facilitate military transportation.

We must strictly organize to prevent traitors and bandits and consolidate social security.

Sacrifice and struggle, the final victory belongs to us. I wish you all health and hard work.

Letter of Encouragement to All Soldiers

Brave soldiers,

This commander-in-chief has been ordered to lead troops to participate in the sacred national self-defense war. I specially issue these few words with solemn sincerity to solemnly encourage all our soldiers.

This time, the Japanese bandits have dispatched their national troops to launch a large-scale invasion of our country, determined to destroy the entire China, wanting to allow our national territory to be divided at will, and wanting to enslave our compatriots across the country. Our National Government and the people across the country, having reached the point of unbearable tolerance, have united and risen up, determined to make the ultimate sacrifice, and wage a full-scale war of resistance against the Japanese bandits.

My brave soldiers, this is a war of national self-defense. We are unwilling to perish as a nation, we are unwilling to be exterminated as a race. We must fight to protect the country and defend the people, and to save ourselves. From this war, we will strive for the survival of our nation and develop the national destiny of China.

At the same time, this is also a sacred war in the world. The Japanese bandits' invasion of us violates world justice and damages human peace, which has aroused the indignation of the world. We are fighting to uphold world justice and to safeguard human peace. From this war, we will overthrow Japanese imperialism, safeguard human peace, and carry forward the glorious mission of righteousness and courage of our Chinese nation.

Because this is a war of national self-defense and a sacred war in the world, even if the entire country is turned into scorched earth, we must fight to the end. As long as there is the last bullet, we must fight to the end. With 470 million compatriots fighting together, and with the assistance of countless peace-loving people in the world, as long as our brave soldiers work hard to resist the war and carry out their respective tasks, then we will surely be able to kill the Japanese bandits until they flee in disarray, and we will surely achieve the final victory. My brave soldiers,

Enthusiasm can burn away our hunger and cold, and glory can comfort our hardships. We bear the heavy responsibility of the survival of the entire nation on our shoulders. Our parents, wives, and 470 million Chinese compatriots are counting on us to use our heads and hot blood to save our own nation from danger. Even if we have suffered all kinds of hardships, we must never retreat. We must be good men, dedicating everything to the country and dedicating our lives to this sacred war of resistance. This war is a matter of life and death for us. To achieve the final victory, everyone should be decisive, resolute, calm, and firm. Do not be arrogant because of a small victory, and do not be timid because of a small defeat. You should obey orders, strictly abide by discipline, bravely advance, and kill all Japanese bandits. This war is a long-term war. To achieve the final victory, everyone should accept the training of their superiors, strengthen their combat skills, and advance wave after wave, killing the enemy and achieving results.

This war is a war of the entire nation. To achieve the final victory, everyone should unite in good faith, cherish their compatriots, help each other, and consolidate the front line. You must know that every move of every combatant affects the entire war, and there must be no slightest sloppiness or moment of slackness. This commander-in-chief is responsible for leading you in your struggle with full enthusiasm, and at the same time, I will watch your actions with the greatest seriousness. My brave soldiers,

I hope you will serve the country with loyalty, work hard to kill the enemy, and strive for the final victory. Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, Bai Chongxi, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, October, 26th year of the Republic of China.

### Severe Flooding in Southern Fujian, Especially in Zhangzhou

Fuxi Losses Estimated at One Million, Heavy Losses in Autumn Harvest Crops

Xiamen Communication: From the 4th to 6th of this month, heavy rains broke out in southern Fujian. Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Yongchun all suffered from flooding, with Zhangzhou being particularly severe. This was because mountain floods occurred simultaneously in Zhangzhou, and the water level of the Jiulong River rose sharply by more than ten feet. On the 6th, the low-lying areas along the banks of the North and Four Creeks were flooded by the river water. The water from the South River in Zhangzhou reached the shore, and Nan City, Xingmin Road, Dingwei South Road, and East Xiuwen Road all became swamps, with water depths ranging from one foot to four or five feet. On the same day, the Zhanglong (Zhangzhou to Longyan) and Zhangfu (Zhangzhou to Zhao'an) roads were closed. On the 7th, the Zhangsong Road was also closed, interrupting the Zhangxia transportation. Furthermore, the Fuquan (Fuzhou to Quanzhou), Quanxia, and Quanyongde roads were also flooded. In Quanzhou, the Jinjiang Creek water rose to the edge of the bank, and Yongchun was particularly severely flooded. Starting on the 7th, the sky began to clear, and by the 9th, the Jiulong River water had receded, and the water on the banks of the North and West Creeks and in Zhangnan City began to recede. All roads except Zhanglong have been reopened. On the Quanzhou side, the Fuquan and Quanxia roads reopened on the 8th, and the Quanyongde Road only reached the Shishan Pier and temporarily required transshipment, which has not yet fully recovered. The flooding this time was particularly severe in Zhangzhou. The sugarcane planted in the northern district of Longxi County was mostly destroyed. The rice fields along the banks of the North and West Creeks, which were about to ripen in the autumn, were particularly severely affected. The loss of autumn rice and fruit is estimated to be no less than one million yuan. Longshan, a village and town where the Wu, Chen, and Lin families lived together, was completely swept away and almost became a ruin. Mo Songfu, the magistrate of Longxi County, is currently conducting investigations in the countryside and preparing to report to the provincial government. The road losses were only on the Zhanglong Road, where the Baolin Stone Bridge and the Hexi Concrete Bridge were washed away, as well as more than ten native bridges and more than ten sections of collapsed roadbed, with a total loss of 100,000 yuan. It has not yet been reopened. Xiamen County in Quanzhou was also flooded, but the extent of the damage is unknown. The loss of crops in Yongchun is estimated to be about 100,000 yuan. This year, southern Fujian originally reported a bumper harvest, with an expected harvest of more than 90% in various places, so the rice prices in Quanzhou had already fallen back at the beginning of the month. It is a pity that this unexpected natural disaster occurred. Fortunately, only Longxi County in Zhangzhou and Huian and Yongchun counties in Quanzhou are not large areas (October 14th).

### Salt Merchant Li Yiru Destroys His Home to Relieve National Crisis

Selling All Property to Buy National Salvation Bonds

Zhenjiang Communication: Li Yiru, a member of the Zhenjiang Lizhi Society, has recently valued and sold all 170 rooms of his estate located in the Fanchuan Town boundary between Jiangdu and Taixian counties, including a garden, Taihu stone corridor, and 49 shops outside the gate, with a construction cost of more than 70,000 yuan, together with land worth about 100,000 yuan, and is willing to buy national salvation bonds in full. Yesterday, he asked the director of the Lizhi Society, Dang Yinquan, to bring the house base drawings to the Jiangsu Provincial National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee to contact them. The committee received him and, in addition to expressing their appreciation for Mr. Li's patriotic spirit, also promised to send a letter to the Jiangdu branch to conduct a survey and valuation before issuing an official receipt. It is heard that Mr. Li's family has lived in Yangzhou for generations, and his father was one of the eight major salt merchants in Weiyang. Now his family has declined, and because he has no children, he leads all his efforts to save the country.

The Jiangsu Provincial Food and Fuel Regulation Office decided that the excess of Zhenjiang's sugar price over the standard price should be used to purchase national salvation bonds, and approved sugar merchants to purchase 50,000 yuan in bonds at one time, with the bonds kept in the custody of the Chamber of Commerce for local public welfare projects. The sugar merchants have complied with this decision and have remitted the funds to the Jiangsu Bank for purchase.

### Important News on the Yangtze River Transportation

Jiangbei Commerce Gradually Recovers, Enemy Ships Spy Along the River

Nantong Communication: After the Shanghai war broke out, the navigational aids and lights on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were removed and navigation was blocked, causing Jiangbei native products, such as fresh pork, chicken, and ducks, to accumulate in urban and rural areas due to the inability to transport them to the Shanghai market, and the prices were extremely low. Moreover, due to the interruption of the source of goods, there were prices but no goods to sell. Since the opening of the river route between Shanghai and Tongzhou, the long-depressed Jiangbei commerce has gradually shown vitality. However, since Nantong and Changshu have been communicating, Ling sandboats go to various ports in Changyinsha and then transfer to Luyuan and other places. Since enemy ships and seaplanes have been stationed on the Tongzhou river, they have been firing machine guns and cannons at ferries. In order to avoid danger, sandboats have stopped sailing.

Enemy ships on the Nantong Langshan river come and go from time to time, with a total of four or five ships at any given time. Outside the Twelve Polder Port of Changyinsha, the enemy has set up buoys, fearing that they will be destroyed by us again, and has dispatched a seaplane to anchor outside the port. At night, the enemy ships use searchlights to spy on the shore. During the high tide, the ships take advantage of the tide to sail close to the north and south banks, repeatedly firing cannons to probe our reality. Our army is calmly responding.

### A Record of Killing Enemies at Donglin Temple

— Xue Xianwei

Donglin Temple (an ancient temple) is located west of Luodian, on relatively high ground. Two rivers flow to the northeast, forming the protruding part of our army's position and a key area that the enemy must seize. One company of our battalion was ordered to defend this place on September 24th. On the 28th, the Japanese invaders attacked us several times with a small force, but were all repelled. From daybreak on the 29th, the enemy, realizing it would be difficult to succeed, advanced their rear troops forward, launching waves of attacks. The officers and soldiers of our First Company were almost entirely killed or wounded, so the Third Company was sent as reinforcements. The fighting intensified until the 30th. The enemy first bombed us with planes and artillery, causing much of the temple's walls and tiles to collapse. Then, they attacked from three sides, and the enemy reached the foot of the walls. Soldiers reported that many of the light machine guns could not fire (because the barrels had burst from firing too much). Battalion Adjutant Zhao Ququan said, "Use hand grenades to strike them!" and personally threw dozens of hand grenades. Before long, the hand grenades were also exhausted. Soldiers again reported that the hand grenades were all gone, what should they do? Adjutant Zhao said, "Use stones and bricks to strike them!" Thus, through persistent resistance, the stubborn enemy was unable to succeed. They then built fortifications in the rice paddies surrounding Donglin Temple. Our resupply of ammunition relied solely on a narrow trench to the south. On the morning of October 1st, Japanese Lieutenant Tomita Yoshi led his team into the temple, wielding a katana and slashing two of our soldiers. When he raised his sword, Company Adjutant Hu Yuzheng struck him with a cross-hoe with all his might, hitting him squarely in the eye and knocking him down. He cried out several times and then stopped. They seized his katana, a pistol, official documents, maps, and other items. Another ensign slashed at our squad leader, Xu Aisheng, who seized the enemy's katana. Because the blade was sharp, both his hands were cut open. He turned the blade and slashed the ensign's head, killing two enemy soldiers and capturing a light machine gun. Private Liu Yishan, wounded by several cuts, still fought on, enduring the pain. He stabbed three enemy soldiers to death and seized two guns. From September 28th to October 2nd, the Japanese invaders attacked day and night, resulting in the deaths of over three hundred officers and soldiers. The entire First Battalion of their 43rd Regiment was almost wiped out, their corpses piled up and weapons scattered everywhere. This was a major blow to the Japanese invaders and a moment of great satisfaction since the Battle of Xuzhou. Of the soldiers who participated in the battle, only a dozen or so remained. The officers were all killed or wounded. I am ashamed to have survived unharmed. Alas, the officers and soldiers fought the enemy hand-to-hand, engaging in fierce combat and regarding death as a return home. Their spirit is truly commendable, so I record it with my clumsy pen to provide my compatriots with information about the situation at that time.

Deep in the night, I turn my head and remember Donglin Temple, sitting alone under a dim lamp, unable to sleep. Heaven pities the loyal and steadfast, frequently shedding tears, a mournful wind and bitter rain grieve for the heroic souls.

### Enemy Goods, Fruit, Fill the Market

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the source of fruit has been lacking and prices have skyrocketed. However, recently fruit has suddenly gathered, especially apples and pears, filling shops and peddlers hawking along the streets. These apples are bright red and green, and the pears have a rough skin and are larger than Tianjin pears. The price is very cheap, and citizens are competing to buy them because of the low price. Little do they know that these fruits are all shipped from enemy countries. At this time when a strong neighbor is pressing on our borders, resisting enemy goods is the best passive method. We hope citizens will pay attention to this.

### People Can Submit Applications to the Military for Establishing Civilian Wound Hospitals
