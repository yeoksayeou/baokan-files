### General Headquarters Announces Retreat to New Defense Line is Not Abandonment of Shanghai

We still firmly defend the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and Pudong, deeply understanding the significance of retreating, and morale remains high.

General Headquarters yesterday announced the reasons and process of our army's retreat from Zhabei and Jiangwan to the new defense line, as follows: In early October, the positions of our army in Shanghai and the Yangtze River region, when viewed on a map, resembled two vertical lines connected by a horizontal line. The first zone was a vertical line, connecting the Yangtze River with the Yunzaobang near Jiading and Nanxiang. The second zone was a horizontal line, along the south bank of the Yunzaobang estuary, until it connected with the third zone near Jiangwan. This formed another vertical line, with Zhabei as its end point. The enemy repeatedly failed in attacks on the first and third zones, and only in early this month did they manage to stealthily breach the Yunzaobang and break into the second zone, resulting in fierce and bloody battles. In the area around Liuhang Xingda Chang alone, the enemy suffered as many as 20,000 casualties, and our army also suffered heroic sacrifices. By the beginning of this week, the enemy advanced towards Dachang, cutting off the Nanxiang-Dachang highway. At that time, our highest military authority had already decided to order the troops to retreat from the third zone, because the enemy's actions threatened to block the exit between the town and the Public Concession, and encircle our army in Jiangwan and Zhabei. Therefore, on the evening of the 25th, our army ordered a counter-attack, under which cover our protruding troops safely retreated without any loss. Our army's current new deployment forms a straight line from the Yangtze River to the Suzhou Creek. The retreat of the protruding troops in Jiangwan and Zhabei has greatly shortened our army's defense line and moved it far away from the range of enemy naval guns in the Huangpu River. Foreign military observers and journalists have repeatedly raised the question of why our army did not take this kind of military action earlier, but our entire country is determined to make the invaders pay a huge price for every inch of land they invade in Shanghai, so it was delayed. Currently, our army's retreat to the new defense line cannot be regarded as abandoning Shanghai, as the entire area south of the Suzhou Creek, including Nanshi, and Pudong, are firmly defended by our army. Our soldiers deeply understand the meaning of this decision to retreat to the new defense line, so morale remains extremely high.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th, Reuters: The Chinese military authorities here are not alarmed by the development of the Shanghai front, and say that the retreat of the Chinese army to the Taicang-Nanxiang line was expected. The fact that the Chinese army was able to hold out for more than two months before retreating was beyond the expectations of the people and worthy of surprise. Troops had been deployed on the new line before the withdrawal of the main force on the front, so there is no fear of the Japanese army breaking through. Furthermore, there are many solid defense lines behind the new defense line. If the Japanese army continues to advance westward or southward, the Chinese army will resolutely resist them step by step, it is said. A reporter from the Central News Agency's accompanying troops reported the following points at midnight on the 27th: The reporter should solemnly report to the compatriots of the country: ㊀ Our army's retreat to the new defense line due to strategic considerations should not be regarded as a military defeat. Some foreign military strategists believe that it would have been beneficial for our army to retreat to the new defense line earlier to fight the enemy, but our army adopted a strategy of attrition. In the past 75 days of resistance, we have held firm to the determination that the enemy must pay a price for every inch of land they advance. The enemy has exhausted all its strength after six reinforcements and five general offensives, and has suffered more than 100,000 casualties, which has exceeded our army's predetermined goal. ㊁ The retreat from Zhabei and Jiangwan is by no means an abandonment of Shanghai, nor can it be regarded as the end of the Shanghai battle. Our army has firmly guarded the south of the Suzhou Creek and is determined to defend Nanshi with all its strength. The Zhongshan Road has already been destroyed, and the Fanhongdu Railway Bridge was also blown up at about 7 pm this month, making it difficult for the enemy to cross. The Pudong side is as solid as a rock and can be worry-free. ㊂ The new defense line has become stable. The Zhenru and Pengpu areas are still in bloody battles as of the time of reporting, and the enemy is not easy to advance. ㊃ On the left flank, only the area of ​​Shixianggong Temple Tushan has been slightly shifted backward, and there is no change in the rest. ㊄ Our army decided to withdraw according to the predetermined plan, in an orderly manner, without any chaos, and the morale is stronger than before. The people of the country should abide by the iron rule of not being arrogant in small victories and not discouraged in small defeats, and prepare for a protracted war.

### Spokesperson of the Military Headquarters on the Change of the New Defense Line of Our Army

In order to achieve the goal of a protracted war

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Military Affairs gave a statement on the 27th regarding the change of the new defense line of our army in Shanghai: Our army's position has been moved from the 9/13 line to the Jiangwan-Yunzaobang line for more than 40 days. The enemy army bombed our position day and night with artillery and aircraft. The enemy and us fought back and forth on this line no less than dozens of times. Our army made many heroic sacrifices. The enemy's massive casualties are also unprecedented. Foreign military observers judge that the enemy army has lost its status as a first-class army power. This is our goal of attrition against the enemy army on this line, which has been completely achieved. Moreover, in view of the fact that the position in the Jiangwan-Dachang area is too prominent, and the original field fortifications have been destroyed by the enemy's fierce artillery fire, in accordance with the needs of the battle, and in order to achieve the goal of a protracted war, and to reorganize the front line and reduce losses, on the evening of the 26th, the Jiangwanzhen, Dachang, and the Xinjingqiao and Baichangzhai areas to the west were automatically abandoned, and moved to the established position behind them. Currently, the positions in the Guangfu and Liuhe areas have not changed. In order to ensure more accurate consolidation for the contact between last night's change of the new defense line, the Pengpu and Jinan New Village areas are still firmly defended by our army. Therefore, our army's movement will not have any impact on our plan to fight to the end.

### Not Arrogant in Small Victories and Not Discouraged in Small Defeats, Our Army Guards the New Defense Line

The entire line is more than 30 kilometers long, and the defense is increasingly consolidated, determined to fight the enemy to the death with the spirit of resistance.

Central News Agency: According to military sources, after the first line of defense between Dachang and Nanxiang was broken through by the enemy yesterday morning, the Zhenru Radio Station also reported an emergency. The four districts of Dachang, Miaohang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei were surrounded on all sides. Our military authorities, in view of the fact that being trapped there would only result in major sacrifices, and that a protracted war is not about gains and losses in a single time and place, for the sake of preserving strength, had to make an orderly retreat in two phases yesterday morning at 9 am and 10 pm, guarding the new defense line. Along the Suzhou Creek to Fanhongdu Railway Station, then along the railway to Zhenru Nanxiang, our army's battle line has undergone drastic changes in two days, but it has absolutely no impact on the Shanghai battle situation. The soldiers on the front line all embrace the spirit of "not being arrogant in small victories and not discouraged in small defeats" and continue to fight, while the two places in the southwest of Shanghai and Nanshi are still firmly defended by our army.

The defense of the entire line is becoming more and more consolidated

Central News Agency: According to military sources, the troops stationed in the Jiangwan and Zhabei districts of our army retreated to the southwest the night before for strategic reasons. By 4:30 am yesterday morning, the new defense line had been deployed south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and north of the Suzhou Creek. The entire line is more than 30 kilometers long, starting from the vicinity of the Central Mint in western Shanghai, heading west through the two towns of Zhenru and Jiangqiao, turning northwest to Xiaonanxiang, and turning northeast to Guangfu. The Shixianggong Temple area also shifted westward, retreating to Dengqiao Town to form a vertical line with Liuhe. The defense of the entire line is becoming increasingly consolidated. If the enemy comes to attack, we will fight the enemy to the death with the spirit of resistance.

Fierce battles in two places before the retreat

Central News Agency Zhenru accompanying reporter reported at 12:30 noon on the 27th: The enemy army attacked Dachang fiercely. The first line of defense west of Dachang was broken through by them, and the enemy advanced southward. The Zhenru Wireless Radio Station immediately started a fierce battle. We sent reinforcements to the rescue on the one hand, and on the other hand, we moved back from the three districts of Dachang, Miaohang, and Jiangwan to the southwest from 9 am the day before yesterday (26th) due to the fear that the rear road would be cut off. They gathered on the second line of defense to defend Zhabei Zhenru. Then, in the evening, the Zhenru Radio Station reported another emergency, and Zhabei was also threatened. Therefore, at 10 pm, an order was issued to continue the retreat and defend the line of the North Station, Pengpu, and Jinan University. At that time, the fierce battle near the Zhenru Radio Station had not ended. At the Mengjiazhai area east of Xiaonanxiang, contact was made again. Although our army retreated with humiliation for strategic reasons, the morale was high and never discouraged. The fierce battles in both places were still going on yesterday morning (27th). As for the North Station, it also gradually retreated westward. By dawn yesterday (27th), the Zhabei stronghold, which had been firmly defended for more than 70 days, had to be abandoned with pain.

Zhabei area suffered a terrible catastrophe

When our army retreated from Jiangwan Zhabei, it was rapid and orderly, and the enemy army did not notice it. They still bombarded with artillery a lot, but did not see any movement. It was not until after dawn yesterday that they groped and advanced under the cover of aircraft and tanks. Wherever the enemy's trace went, they still fired guns at the defensive fortifications left by our army, and searched house by house to drive out the residents, either killing them or arresting them. They then set fire to burn them. Therefore, after 8 am yesterday morning, dozens of places caught fire from Jiangwan to Maigen Road Station. The miserable smoke condensed for several miles. After nightfall, the fire was as bright as day. The prosperous area of ​​Zhabei was completely destroyed, which is very sad. The residents of the Tanziwan area of ​​Zhabei could not withstand the enemy's pursuit and fled to western Shanghai, gathering along the Suzhou Creek. The volunteer army and British army stationed on the south bank of that area were enthusiastic about rescuing them, but the enemy aircraft continued to drop bombs, causing many casualties and injuries, which was very tragic. In the Xujiahui area, there were also many refugees, crowding outside the iron gates of the French Concession, and had not dispersed by evening.

### Fire in the Black Night of Zhabei

### Our Army Fiercely Fought the Enemy Near the International Radio Station

Enemy army killed by us 1,500 people

Central News Agency Zhenru accompanying reporter reported at 1:20 am on the 28th: The right wing of our army's new line of defense, with Pengpu as the center, west to Jinan New Village, and southeast to Tanziwan, has become stable. The enemy who advanced to the Zhenru International Radio Station attempted to continue to the south along Taopu starting yesterday morning, but was intercepted by our large army at Xujiaqiao and Wujia Ku Houjigangzhai, etc. south of the radio station, resulting in fierce battles. The invading enemy had three regiments, led by 13 tanks. By 2 pm, the battle became more intense. Our army fought bravely and relentlessly, with no retreat. In the fierce battle until about 4 pm, the enemy suffered as many as 1,500 casualties. Our army's casualties also reached 1,000. After this fierce battle, the enemy's fierce flame was killed, and they retreated immediately. According to the above-mentioned places, it is about 1 kilometer away from Jinan New Village and about 2 kilometers away from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Also, on the line from Pengpu to Tanziwan, we also guarded with fresh troops. The enemy attacked from the northeast end of Zhongshan Road yesterday morning and engaged in street fighting several times. More than 300 people were killed by us. By 4 pm, the battle became more intense and was still in a fierce battle at the time of reporting. The enemy army seemed to be attacking with all its strength, but it has not succeeded.

### Tragic and Heroic, Worthy of Praise, Our Isolated Army Vows to Resist Japan to the Death

In order to win the great personality of our country, we are willing to give the last drop of blood and not return alive.

Although the majority of our army in Zhabei safely retreated before dawn yesterday morning, this does not mean that there are no traces of our army in Zhabei. More than 800 loyal and brave soldiers above the battalion of our 88th Division, led by Regiment Commander Xie Qingyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu, are still in the midst of the flames surrounding the enemy army, using their last drop of blood and last bullet to demand the price they should pay to the enemy army. They are staging a magnificent battle that shocks the heavens and earth, makes the ghosts and gods cry, and will be forever recorded in history. This battalion of loyal and brave soldiers was ordered to guard the key points and cover the retreat of the main force. After the main force retreated safely, there was sufficient time to withdraw completely, because our North Station troops had completed the withdrawal at about 4 am yesterday morning, and the enemy army did not advance until about 6 am. However, this battalion of loyal and brave soldiers was determined to sacrifice, willing to give the last drop of blood to win the great personality of our country, promote the magnificent spirit of the nation, and unwilling to return alive. After they left the key points they were guarding, they divided a small number of soldiers to live in the major buildings on the north of Xinlaji Bridge, while the majority of the soldiers were majestically based in the seven-story building of the Sihang Savings Bank warehouse west of the bridge. They lived on each floor and guarded firmly by the windows. At that time, the British garrison in the concession of Tibet Road, seeing that they were in a dangerous situation of being surrounded, was inspired by human sympathy and asked them to disarm and pass through the concession, but our loyal and brave soldiers firmly refused the British army's kindness, preferring to die rather than go. In a short while, the enemy troops came one after another, but the scattered gunshots rang out, and the enemy troops fell one after another, because at this time, they cherished the bullets far more than their lives and dared not shoot without aiming. Yesterday at noon, the reporter personally went to a certain place on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek to inspect the situation on the opposite bank. He saw three enemy soldiers, each holding two of our civilians, walking arrogantly near the Wuzhen Road Bridge. Suddenly, one of our soldiers jumped out and shot dead the two enemy soldiers in front. Another enemy soldier pushed away the two civilians he was holding and rushed forward with a gun, but was bravely stopped by the two civilians and was instantly killed by our army. He also saw an enemy soldier lurking in a tall building, raising his gun to shoot at our soldiers passing by the area, but our army in another building had already fired accurate bullets and knocked the enemy soldier down. From noon to 3 pm, the enemy army launched a large-scale attack on the Sihang Savings Bank warehouse, with people surging like a tide, trying to break in. At this time, our army fired machine guns and threw hand grenades, and the enemy army killed reached 60 or 70 people. From then on, the enemy army took a surrounding shape and dared not move forward lightly. The reporter witnessed this magnificent situation and could not help but be moved to tears. According to the reporter's investigation, the loyal and brave soldiers trapped in the building still have sufficient weapons and ammunition to kill the enemy, but the supply is cut off, which is really worrying. At about 6 pm, Regiment Commander Xie and Battalion Commander Yang issued a heroic appeal, requesting to supply 500 pounds of sugar and salt each, and 50,000 sesame cakes. Then our entire battalion of loyal men and soldiers can fight to the death with the enemy for a week, and die without regret.

The English Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that a number of Chinese soldiers in Zhabei were unwilling to obey the order to retreat. This afternoon (27th), they were in the midst of flames on all sides, and the road to retreat was cut off by the Japanese army, so their position was extremely dangerous. Several observers said that there were 4,000 Chinese soldiers who would rather die in Zhabei than retreat before the enemy's attack. There are many fires in Zhabei, and it is now believed that they were set by Japanese soldiers in the hope of forcing out the Chinese soldiers hiding in the mountains. The British anti-aircraft gunners defending the border of the Public Concession shot down several Japanese aircraft that flew into their defense zone today, and several of them were proud of hitting the target with their shells. Several Japanese aircraft shook after the British soldiers opened fire. The British soldiers were deeply afraid that the Japanese soldiers would continue to harass them, so they all took off their coats today, sweating profusely, and busy putting sandbags to strengthen their defenses. The military police on the western border of the French Concession have made special preparations, but no special incident has occurred as of noon today. It is said that no Chinese soldiers or refugees hope to force their way into the concession. The Japanese army is now continuing to press on Zhenru, so observers predict that the Chinese army on the section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway from Zhongshan Road to Zhenru will continue to retreat to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. At 2 am this morning, several landmines exploded in Zhabei, and the area on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek felt the shock.

A small team of Chinese soldiers is still holding several houses on the north bank of Suzhou Road, just west of the Xizang Road Bridge, at noon today (27th). Japanese soldiers are cautiously advancing from the rubble in the hope of driving these people away, but they encountered fierce machine-gun fire. The retreat of these Chinese soldiers has been cut off, and it is clear that they are determined to die there. The bodies of the dead Japanese soldiers are piled up and can be seen from across the bank. Japanese soldiers are dragging their dead and wounded soldiers away in the streets. There are also some Chinese soldiers fighting back against the Japanese soldiers behind small sandbag shelters on the bank of the Suzhou Creek in Zhabei. The Japanese soldiers surrounded them on all sides and fired machine guns from the roof of a large nearby warehouse. There are many Chinese and foreigners watching this magnificent battle from convenient locations in the concession. Although the police dissuaded them, the crowd did not disperse, and some foreigners carried cameras in the hope of capturing the actions of the Japanese soldiers. Japanese soldiers on the opposite bank raised their guns and posed as if to shoot, so the photographers were all frightened and fled. Now only Japanese soldiers can be seen on the opposite bank. These Chinese soldiers are either daredevils or they saw that their comrades who did not resist this morning were all killed by Japanese soldiers, so they would rather fight the Japanese soldiers. Some foreigners have witnessed Japanese soldiers forcing Chinese soldiers who were captured to dig a hole and then shooting them and throwing their bodies into the hole. There were several people who were forced to suffer this fate, and foreigners did not witness them one by one, so they could not list the numbers, but judging from the situation this morning, there must be very few Chinese soldiers captured in Zhabei. A shed with barbed wire around it has been built opposite the British barracks today to accommodate Chinese soldiers who disarm and enter the concession, but there are very few people entering at present. Several other soldiers swam across the river because their retreat had been cut off and have been handed over to the police station for custody. According to reports from the British defense positions in the western district, although a large number of Chinese soldiers passed through the British defense line this morning, they did not attempt to enter the defense area. Many wounded Chinese soldiers were released into the concession by British soldiers and sent to the hospital by trucks. The British soldiers also assisted in this humanitarian work. The rumor that there was a conflict between British soldiers and Chinese soldiers is completely unfounded.

### The Rumor that All British Nationals in Shanghai are Being Evacuated is Not True

Central News Agency London 27th Havas: The rumor that the British authorities in Shanghai have ordered all British nationals currently in the Public Concession in Shanghai to evacuate has been denied by official sources, who said that the British authorities have taken various measures to protect the lives and property of British nationals.

### Enemy Planes Rampaged, Three Were Shot Down Yesterday

One was hit by British troops

At 8 am yesterday morning, a large number of enemy planes rampaged and bombed both sides of the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai. One bomb fell about 100 yards from the British military defense area on Kaixuan Road. The British troops stationed there immediately opened machine guns to fight back, and one was hit by them. It swayed in the air and was about to fall. Another enemy plane crashed near Maigen Road. The British said that this plane was shot down by our army. At about 3 pm, two more teams of enemy planes dropped bombs in the Zhoujiaqiao area west of Kaixuan Road. When the enemy planes were wreaking havoc, one plane dived straight down from high altitude, just as it was about to drop bombs, when the fuselage touched another enemy plane. The plane that was touched was immediately destroyed. The plane also swayed and was about to fall. The pilot immediately opened a parachute and descended, landing in our army's position. The plane was also destroyed.

Fast News Agency this port 27th report, between 7:30 am and 10:30 am this morning, Japanese aircraft repeatedly threw bombs near the British military defense line on Kaixuan Road and swept downwards with machine guns. British troops used anti-aircraft machine guns to fight back against the Japanese aircraft five times. In the last fight, one Japanese aircraft was hit and caught fire and crashed. According to eyewitness reports, the Japanese aircraft's brutal bombing is now even more intensified. This morning, more than 500 civilians who fled in western Shanghai were bombed to death or killed by machine guns. It is said that four British soldiers were also injured (one said two).

Central News Agency said that the local English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that the British soldiers defending the border of the concession shot at the aircraft several times yesterday (27th). Several soldiers claimed that they had hit the Japanese aircraft. When they shot, they saw the Japanese aircraft shake in the air. British soldiers yesterday built and dismantled sandbags at various defense locations to consolidate and defend themselves. According to foreign observers, at 7:45 am yesterday morning, the British soldiers defending the border of the concession along Bailinan Road shot at the aircraft five times with machine guns because the Japanese aircraft attacked the British military defense area and its vicinity. The Japanese aircraft fled in panic after the British soldiers opened fire.

### Japanese Anti-Aircraft Shell Killed Italian Sailor

Hasegawa and Okamoto Apologize to the Italian Army

At about 2 am yesterday morning, when our air force flew to Shanghai to attack the enemy's position at night, the enemy ships in the Huangpu River fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns indiscriminately, causing many shells to fall into the Italian military defense area on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek in the concession, killing one Italian soldier, named Bo Dula. Afterwards, the Italian military authorities immediately protested to the headquarters of the Japanese Third Fleet. Hasegawa immediately sent a representative to apologize to the Italian army. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Okamoto, visited the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Nilang, yesterday afternoon, admitting that the Italian soldier was indeed killed by a stray bullet from the Japanese anti-aircraft gun, and expressed deep condolences on behalf of his government and promised to compensate the loss of the husband. The Italian Consul General immediately stated that the Japanese military authorities should take all possible measures to prevent the same incident from happening again.

### Our Army in Pudong Bombed Enemy Base Last Night

The Air Force Came to Shanghai to Assist in the Battle

At 8:30 last night, our artillery positions in Pudong once fiercely bombed the enemy's base in the eastern Shanghai area. Enemy ships in the Huangpu River also fired back immediately. For a time, the loud rumbling sound shocked the surrounding area. Due to this mutual attack, the sound of the enemy's air force coming to Shanghai for a night raid was drowned out by the sound of artillery fire. Therefore, it was not until our aircraft flew to the enemy's base in Yangshupu and dropped many bombs that the enemy ships in the Huangpu River realized that our army had already flown over their position. In a panic, they had to stop firing and used searchlights to illuminate the sky, firing anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns into the air indiscriminately. Unexpectedly, our air force's mission was over and they had already safely flown far away from the enemy's position. The enemy's position in Yangshupu caught fire immediately after being hit by several bullets from our army and burned fiercely. At 1:30 am, our aircraft came to Shanghai again and dropped many bombs on the enemy's position.

### Letter to Compatriots from the City Party Headquarters

The more we are oppressed, the more we must resist; the more we fail, the more we must strive.

The Shanghai City Party Headquarters yesterday published a letter to compatriots. The original text is as follows: Dear compatriots, our resolute and righteous war of resistance against the aggressors, for justice, dignity, survival, and self-defense, has been going on for three months now. During these three months of resistance, our brave soldiers have fought bloody battles, advancing without retreating, knowing only the survival of the country and not their own personal life or death. Their spirit is tragic and magnificent, their sacrifices are so terrible as to shock heaven and earth and move the gods. Our loyal and chivalrous people in the rear have also contributed money and effort to supply the military, enabling the soldiers at the front to receive material assistance and spiritual encouragement, and thus repeatedly defeat strong enemies and defend our territory. This spirit of military and civilian cooperation to resist the enemy and defend against humiliation is truly the greatest manifestation of the Chinese national soul, arousing international praise and winning world sympathy. It can be seen that it is by no means accidental. Now, although we have made a planned withdrawal due to strategic considerations, this is a common phenomenon in the process. Moreover, the success of our long-term resistance lies not in being able to advance, but in being able to defend; not in the present of victory, but in the future of perseverance. The events of the European War can serve as a mirror. Therefore, today we do not need to ask whether we can win, but only whether we can persevere. And to grasp this characteristic of perseverance, everything depends on the strength of our military and civilians' will, the invigoration of our spirit, the breadth of our vision, and the correctness of our thinking. We must not be arrogant in small victories or discouraged in small defeats. No matter how the environment changes, we must never shake our determination to resist to the end. The three armies can be deprived of their formations, but the common man cannot be deprived of his will. Even when besieged, even under high pressure, we will never bow our heads or bend our knees, waiting for the arrival of final victory. During the long siege of Madrid, Spain, the people of the capital were in the midst of the siege, but they continued to contribute money to save the country, beating drums to assist the war effort, without wavering or surrendering. Therefore, they were able to create a strong fighting force to wait for victory in the future. Isn't this an excellent example for us today? Dear compatriots, we must be calm and composed. The more we are oppressed, the more we must resist; the more we fail, the more we must strive. As long as we have the determination to sacrifice and the will to persevere, final victory will surely belong to us. To be arrogant before victory, to be discouraged before defeat, to waver at the slightest setback – these are the inferior characteristics of a lowly nation. We must not be like that. Let us strive, my dear compatriots.

In addition, the Anti-Enemy Support Propaganda Committee also issued a letter to the people yesterday. The wording is lengthy, so it is omitted.

[Fuzhou] According to a report from the Fujian Provincial Government, three enemy warships were anchored near Jinmen (where Wu Island outside Xiamen Port has a county seat). Their marines once forcibly landed, but were bravely repelled by our troops. They then attacked again and were still repelled by us. At dawn on the 26th, the enemy continuously fired hundreds of rounds of intense artillery fire at Jinmen, and simultaneously carried out large-scale bombing with airplanes. Although we tried our best to resist, we were ultimately outnumbered, and Jinmen County City fell. We are currently dispatching troops to recapture it. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

Therefore, enemy aircraft have not attacked Guangdong for two days. Enemy aircraft previously bombed the Ningyang Railway and took the opportunity to send troops to land at Yamen. We saw through their conspiracy. Enemy warships once sent troops to land on the Yinzhou River, but they were discovered and repelled by our garrison troops. The enemy warships from the ports of Haikou and Beihai have all sailed away and are reportedly concentrated at Hebao Island. (Special dispatch on the 27th)

### Li Zongren Returns to Nanjing from the Front and Expresses His Views on the War of Resistance

Organizing the People is the Top Priority; Although the Enemy is Stubborn, Victory Ultimately Belongs to Us

[Nanjing] Li Zongren, who recently returned from the front, expressed his views on the war of resistance to reporters. Li first said that the invasion of our country by the violent Japanese, with their carefully planned and deliberate intent, is to destroy the entire China. We must resist to the death in order to defend our territory. Observing our brave soldiers on the front lines, fighting bloody battles, it is truly shocking to heaven and earth and moving to gods. Our country has this wall of flesh and blood, and we are even more confident that we can achieve final victory. I believe that during this period of resistance, the whole country should urgently "mobilize its spirit, organize the people, and train the people," which is the top priority. He believes that the government must become one with the people in order to generate great strength. He advocates that university students, in addition to science and engineering students who should focus on the manufacture of military supplies, the remaining liberal arts students should go deep into the countryside to undertake the work of training the people. Regarding general propaganda methods, Li said that in addition to newspapers and magazines, drama and lectures are especially important. When reporters asked about the situation of the Guangxi army's expedition, Li smiled and said, "I feel deeply ashamed that I was unable to quickly dispatch troops this time, but it was also due to inconvenient transportation." When the standing army of Guangxi Province received the conscription order, several regiments were stationed in Guilin and Binzhou, and the rest were engaged in mining and road construction. After receiving the order, all were excited and enthusiastic. When fathers and brothers learned that their children were going on an expedition, they regarded it as the highest honor. Even peasant women showed no reluctance at the time of parting, but repeatedly instructed their husbands to swear to kill the enemy. Li then said to reporters that Guangxi has been training young men for years and can now mobilize more than two million. Although the enemy is stubborn, our sincere and united will is enough to sweep away its fierce flames. Recently, enemy planes have been wantonly bombing various places, which has further strengthened our people's determination to hate the enemy and share the same hatred. Soldiers are fighting bloody battles on the battlefield and sacrificing their lives to defend the motherland, which is truly called dying in the right place. As a soldier, I will soon return to the front and vow to fight to the death with the Japanese." Li's attitude was extremely firm when he spoke. He talked for about an hour before leaving.

### The Most Cruel and Barbaric Enemy Forces Bomb From the Sky

150 Enemy Planes Drop Heavy Bombs; Their Cruelty Has Never Been Seen Even During the World War; Zhenru Town and the Railway Station Are Razed to the Ground

The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 26th) morning and afternoon, Japanese planes carried out the most cruel, barbaric, and unrestrained aerial bombardment in world history at Dachang and Nanxiang. Dozens of Japanese navy and army bombers, with no resistance in the sky, dropped hundreds of heavy bombs on the Chinese army, who were bravely resisting the advance of the Japanese mechanized infantry. According to foreign observers, the total number of Japanese planes was over 150, consisting of various types of army and navy bombers. They advanced in batches from airfields less than 15 miles away. Observers counted as many as 50 bombers in the sky at one time, each dropping six to eight bombs. Such fierce aerial bombardment has never been seen in the World War. At the Alidi and Bellre Forest, there were once 80 German planes flying over the two locations at dawn, but the number of bombers was always less than 20, with the rest being fighter planes used to defend against enemy planes. In that case, the number of enemy planes in the sky was also large. In this type of attack, German planes often lost 10 to 15 planes and often failed to drop all the bombs they were carrying in order to bomb enemy troops and their positions. Often they had been driven away before they could even fly over. During the World War, aerial bombing activities were not widely applied to enemy military positions, or at least not as fiercely as yesterday at Dachang and Nanxiang. Moreover, the bombs used by bombers in the World War were far smaller than those carried by bombers today, and the focus was on the enemy's accumulation of ammunition and military supplies, with enemy military positions being secondary. Yesterday, the Japanese planes concentrated all their bombing on the Chinese military positions, and the number of heavy bombs they dropped was countless, only that the quantity was extremely large. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese naval spokesman, when meeting with news reporters, admitted that army and navy planes yesterday had co-operated and bombed these two locations.

The English Great America Evening News reported that a large squadron of Japanese planes, numbering about 150, dropped bombs and bombed Zhenru this morning (the 27th), Zhenru Town and the railway station have been razed to the ground.

They also helped the British soldiers lift sandbags to increase the height of the defenses. Although the Chinese soldiers appeared exhausted, they showed no signs of discouragement, and their attitude towards the British soldiers was very friendly.

### Japan Formally Submits Reply Refusing to Participate in Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Denies League of Nations' Condemnation of Aggression, Claims Self-Defense; Believes Convening the Conference Will Only Increase Complications

[Tokyo] The Japanese Cabinet today refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference scheduled to be convened in Brussels in November. Foreign Minister Hirota met with Belgian Ambassador Baron de Bassompierre at 6:40 PM today and personally delivered Japan's reply refusing to participate. The reply, approximately eight hundred words in length, begins by denying the League of Nations' declaration of the 6th of this month condemning Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty. It then reiterates that "all actions taken by Japan in China are solely self-defense measures in response to China's forceful anti-Japanese policies, especially China's acts of provocation involving the use of force. Therefore, Japan's actions are not within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty." The reply further states that since the League of Nations has previously guaranteed moral assistance to China and advocated that member states should avoid any actions that could reduce China's ability to resist, "the Imperial Government cannot help but believe that the convening of this conference is linked to the League of Nations' resolution, and feels that open discussions with the aim of achieving a fair and realistic resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict are impossible." It also states, "The Imperial Government deeply believes that the participating countries in the conference have varying degrees of interests in East Asia, and some have no interests to speak of. If they gather together, the result will only increase the complications of the situation and obstruct a fair and appropriate resolution. For the above reasons, the Empire deeply regrets its inability to participate." The Japanese reply further states that the urgent task to be resolved today is for the Chinese government to realize that China and Japan have a shared responsibility for the stability of East Asia, and to change its attitude and policy so that the two countries can engage in cooperation. The Japanese reply also requests that all countries deeply understand this need. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo Authorities' Declaration

[Tokyo] Regarding Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Japanese authorities today issued a lengthy declaration of two thousand words, stating, "Japan, with a tolerant attitude, has strived to promote goodwill in China. Unexpectedly, China lacked the ability to appreciate this and instead engaged in provocative behavior against Japan, forcing Japan to resort to war for self-defense." The declaration also condemns the League of Nations' actions after the Manchurian Incident, stating that they fueled China's anti-Japanese policies, and claiming that it is repeating its mistakes today. The declaration continues, stating that it is foreseeable that the majority of the countries participating in the conference will be bound by the League of Nations' resolution, and therefore Japan had no choice but to decide to refuse to participate in this conference. "If all countries could understand Japan's true intentions earlier and take appropriate steps to make the Nanjing government change its attitude and policy, then a path could be opened between Japan and other countries to seek a resolution to the current situation."

### US Representative to Brussels Conference Arrives in Paris

[London] Norman Davis arrived in Plymouth today and told a Reuters reporter, "I dare not predict the outcome of the Brussels Conference. I hope Japan can join this meeting to study whether we can find a constructive solution to the very difficult problems in the Far East." It is heard that the issue of inviting Germany and the Soviet Union to join the conference will be decided soon. Some countries have not yet expressed their agreement, so a decision must wait until their agreement is obtained. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] During the debate in the House of Lords yesterday on the address in reply to the King's Speech, the Lord Privy Seal, Viscount Halifax, responding to a question from a Member of Parliament, said that the policy that Britain intends to pursue in the Nine-Power Conference is nothing more than to end the Sino-Japanese conflict on a basis that is acceptable to world moral sentiment. This will be a foundation for contributing to lasting hope and a basis on which all parties can participate to seek China's development. The government had previously stated in Parliament that the people should know the policy and objectives of the government's attendance at the Brussels Conference, but beyond that, he could not say much at this time. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters dispatch) ⊙Brussels: The Belgian Foreign Ministry will issue a statement tomorrow regarding whether to invite Russia and Germany to send representatives to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference.

### British House of Commons Debates Foreign Policy

Labor Party Accuses Government of Weakness and Procrastination; Liberal Party Insists on Cooperation Between Britain and the United States

[London] The House of Commons began debating the address in reply to the King's Speech today. Labor Party leader Clement Attlee spoke, asking the government to express its Far East policy slightly, saying that the government has repeatedly said that it will continue to work with other governments to reduce the suffering caused by the Sino-Japanese conflict and to bring the Sino-Japanese conflict to an end. These words are good, but the important point is what kind of ending? Liberal Party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair spoke of the hope of achieving a peaceful outcome from the Brussels Conference, saying, what kind of peace is this? This is a question that makes people uneasy. Are those who are loudly calling for peace Japan? Or are there other countries that are demanding peace on behalf of Japan, based on Japan's occupation of several provinces of China? The mover of the address in reply to the King's Speech was Conservative MP Mr. Balfour, and the seconder was Liberal MP Mr. Mallinson. Mr. Mallinson said that what the British people can consider most satisfactory is the US government's participation in the Nine-Power Conference. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon then spoke, outlining the trade cycle and the dangerous situation of plummeting prices, saying that there is no reason to say that British trade is gradually declining. The Labor Party stated that it will propose an amendment to the address, believing that the government's foreign policy is weak and procrastinating, and that it has no fundamental construction measures internally to improve the people's living standards and promote permanent economic prosperity, and has therefore lost the trust of the House of Commons, which is regrettable. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)

Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, then spoke, reiterating the views he expressed on the 21st of this month, and insisted that Britain and the United States must cooperate. In addition, many other members of parliament spoke successively. The meeting had not adjourned by the time of the dispatch. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas dispatch)

### Churchill Condemns Japanese Aggression

[London] Radical Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill recently gave a speech in Loughton, Essex, condemning Japan's aggression against China, advocating that Britain should act in concert with other countries that are determined to jointly deal with aggressor nations, and urgently demanding that the government expand the air force as much as possible. He said, "Japan has now fallen into the hands of warlords, who disregard the wishes of the people and experienced politicians and attack China in the hope of seizing the territory of this old country, and use its newly built air force to indiscriminately bomb large areas inhabited by Chinese civilians in the most cruel way, as a means of intimidation. Under these circumstances, Britain must cooperate with the United States and the League of Nations to deal with this, and should expand its armaments as much as possible, especially its air force."

### Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee Drafts Resolution

Abandoning Symbolic Withdrawal of Volunteers; Soviet Representative Expresses Strong Stance

[London] The Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee met for five hours yesterday, chaired by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, and made considerable progress, resolving to abandon the proposal for the symbolic withdrawal of volunteers, directing the chairman and secretary to draft the terms of reference, and opening a list of two committees to be sent to Spain. The resolution drafted at the previous meeting regarding the method of withdrawal, granting belligerent rights to both sides, and reimposing land and sea surveillance was slightly revised and submitted to the governments. All representatives except the Soviet representative Maisky supported the resolution. The subcommittee will convene tomorrow morning to discuss the final form of the resolution. Maisky stated that the Soviet Union believes that the members of the committee should, without prior self-restraint, accept the individuals nominated to be sent to the committee in Spain as a basis. Maisky commented on the Italian government's official announcement that there are 40,000 Italian volunteers in Spain, saying that this should be rejected with a very firm attitude and can only be regarded as an attempt to put pressure on the committee. Maisky also said that the Soviet Union is prepared to do its utmost to unconditionally support the policy of immediately and completely withdrawing foreign fighters from Spain. However, he said that the replies from Italy and Germany are vague and that Italian reinforcements are still arriving at General Franco's side. Three legions landed in Cadiz a few days ago. The Soviet Union cannot change its opinion on the issue of linking the granting of belligerent rights to both sides with the withdrawal of foreign fighters. The Soviet Union must wait until the foreign fighters have completely withdrawn before it can consider the issue of belligerent rights. If most of the foreign fighters have withdrawn, and reinforcements are no longer arriving to support the rebels, and the governments are truly sincere in ceasing all interference in Spanish affairs, then the Soviet Union may agree to consider the issue of granting belligerent rights. However, the Soviet Union reserves the right to decide when it can make this consideration. The Soviet Union reiterated its opinion that monitoring the Spanish land and sea borders is interdependent and should be the entire problem. The Soviet Union believes that restoring and consolidating the monitoring of the Spanish borders should be carried out simultaneously with consolidating maritime monitoring.

### Soviet Union Resolves to Fully Defend Its Far Eastern Territories

Border Defenses Solid Enough to Resist Enemy Invasion; Nationwide Celebration of the Anniversary of the Recovery of Vladivostok

[Moscow] Fifteen years ago, on this day, the People's Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic occupied Vladivostok, drove out the Japanese interventionist forces and White Guards, and completely liberated the Soviet Maritime Province. Today, all newspapers have published articles to commemorate this event, including essays and memoirs. The editorial of Izvestia stated, "In the autumn of 1922, the fully armed interventionists were attempting to maintain the Maritime Province and prolong the civil war. However, after the final bloody battle, the People's Revolutionary Army finally dealt them a fatal blow. Under the command of General Blucher, the Revolutionary Army valiantly defended the country, crushed the last remnants of the White Guards, and forced the Japanese army to withdraw from the Maritime Province, withdrawing from Vladivostok without a fight. Three years later, it drove the Japanese imperialists out of Kuye Island and Kamchatka, laying the foundation for the revival of the Far East and the development of its great productive forces. Since 1931, after occupying Manchuria, the Japanese warlords have constantly openly threatened the Soviet Far Eastern region, dreaming of occupying its abundant natural resources. At the same time, the German and Japanese fascist running dogs, the Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and Bukharinites, have colluded with the enemy, attempting to carve up the Far Eastern region and destroy its economic and cultural facilities. However, this kind of obstruction cannot limit the victorious construction work on the Pacific coast and the Amur River. Under the command of the same Marshal Blucher, the glorious Far Eastern Red Banner Army has severely punished all interventionist wreckers. The people have used cement and steel to make the Far Eastern border an impregnable wall, which no enemy can invade. All spies and sabotage teams operating in that area cannot escape our eyes and ears and will be captured and eliminated. The Far Eastern region is an indivisible part of our country, and we will never give up a single bit. The entire country, the entire party, and its Central Committee and Stalin himself pay close attention to the prosperity and development of the Far Eastern region. The vast desolate area has now seen the rise of amazing cities such as Komsomolsk, and old towns such as Khabarovsk and Vladivostok have been completely transformed after construction. The fish produced in the Far East is enough to supply the entire country, and the gold produced occupies an important position in the country. The border area, which had no industry at all in the Tsarist era, now produces large quantities of oil, coal, zinc, copper, wood, and builds ships, machine tools, etc. Tens of thousands of tractors and combine harvesters are working on collective and state farms. Dozens of different ethnic groups in the region have been liberated from oppression and are participating in the development of the region, advancing towards the realm of socialist culture. The Red Army and the people, united, will do their best to defend its entire border, and no matter where the enemy comes from, whether it be land, sea, or air, there is no hope of invading our territory."

### Interview from the Front Lines (Continued)

Western Railway Station Employees Remain Calm; Iron Manure Cart Serves as a Makeshift Tank

Due to the movement of our military's right flank—from Zhabei, Jiangwan, Miaohang, and up to Dachang—one cannot help but notice the western part of Shanghai. Yesterday around noon, this reporter, along with colleagues Mr. Jin and Mr. Zhang, drove directly to the railway bridgehead at the western end of the extraterritorial road, Jessfield Road. To the west of the railway was the avenue leading directly to Beixinjing. To the east of the road, numerous British army personnel and detective constables were stationed. Upon our arrival, we saw a large number of refugees, carrying boxes and luggage, supporting the elderly and leading the young, fleeing south from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek toward the railway bridge. The scene of misery was truly a picture of people displaced on the road. However, the most admirable sight at that time was the British army personnel stationed there, who were doing their utmost to protect and rescue all the refugees. Among them, especially, Chinese constable No. 1222, a British sergeant acting as a search party leader, and a large man in plain clothes, went back and forth across the 40-odd-meter railway bridge, carrying women, children, the elderly, and the weak to the south side of the bridge, doing so more than a hundred times. Such great spirit almost moved one to tears. Upon inquiring about their names, it was learned that the Chinese constable was named Yan Bingheng, and the large man in plain clothes was Wang Jinsheng, a detective from the constabulary. At that time, approximately forty enemy aircraft were soaring over the western part of Shanghai and the northern bank of the Suzhou Creek, reconnoitering and bombing at will.

At 1:20 PM, near the railway line about 300 meters north of the bridge, dense machine gun and mortar fire suddenly erupted. It was clear that the enemy's pursuing troops had made contact with our army. At this time, because the reporter was on the south bank and the sounds of gunfire and explosions were coming from the northern bank, it was assumed that the front line must be facing off on the east and west sides near the railway line. With the exception of stray bullets, there should be no other danger, so I could not bear to leave immediately. Instead, I rushed to the Fanwangdu Railway Station to report to the office via telephone. At that time, the stationmaster and staff were calm and working as usual. Simultaneously, five enemy aircraft had flown over the station. The stationmaster pointed to the reporter and said, "This place is a target for enemy aircraft. Aren't you afraid of the danger?" The reporter replied, "You are here all day long. Aren't you in danger?" The stationmaster said, "We are responsible for our duties, and we cannot leave without authorization." The reporter said, "I am also here because of my duties. How can I not come?" They then laughed together and parted ways. Fortunately, the enemy aircraft did not drop bombs at that time. The reporter then returned to the railway bridgehead and stood on the side of Kaixuan Road. It was already 2:10 PM.

Kaixuan Road was only thirty meters from the railway bridge, running parallel to the railway line. The reporter was gazing north when, in less than five minutes, intense machine gun fire suddenly erupted near the north of the bridge, and bullets flew straight towards the south of Zhabei like locusts. At the same time, the sound of light machine gun fire returning fire came from the weeds on the west side of Kaixuan Road, just a few feet away from the reporter. At this time, the British soldiers stationed on the south side of the bridge and the Chinese and foreigners standing on the side of the road all lay prone in the nearby ditches or sought refuge under cars. The reporter hurriedly took refuge behind a sanitation bureau manure cart on the side of the road. The manure cart was made of iron and served as a temporary shield, functioning much like a tank, albeit with a slightly unpleasant odor.

The gunfire grew denser and closer. Bullets whizzed past overhead, and a cream-colored car nearby could be heard being hit with a "thud."

The driver, Afang, also knew the danger and was so frightened that his face turned ashen. He lay prone in a ditch near the reporter. The reporter hurriedly called him to get in the car and start the engine. The reporter then fearlessly jumped onto the running board and fled south at full speed. When the car reached the vicinity of the West Railway Station (about a hundred meters from the northern end of Kaixuan Road to the West Railway Station), the reporter thought of Mr. Jin and Mr. Zhang, who were still trapped in the center of the firing line. If I escaped alone and something unfortunate happened to them, I would feel guilty. So I ordered the car to turn around. Unexpectedly, just as the car turned north, a bullet whizzed past the upper left corner of the car with a "zing" sound, as if telling me, "Since you have escaped, why do you want to go back to seek death?" Afang then turned the car around and headed south and east, stopping temporarily at the intersection of Yuyuan Road.

In less than a quarter of an hour, Mr. Jin arrived in a car driven by a foreigner. At that moment, the crowd on the side of the road suddenly began to applaud towards the western sky. Mr. Jin and I turned around to look, and haha, two of the enemy's aircraft had been hit by our anti-aircraft guns. One caught fire and fell, and the two pilots jumped out with parachutes. The other did not catch fire but somersaulted several times irregularly in the air and fell vertically. Presumably, it was putting on one last performance. Before long, Mr. Zhang also arrived. Then, a friend in a suit who had been standing on the south side of the railway bridge also arrived. He said that just now, two women on the side of the road had been struck, one dead and one injured. The three of us looked at each other in stunned silence and then got into the car and returned to the office.

It is common for news reporters to go to the front lines to report on news, hear artillery fire, and encounter aircraft. However, being caught in the middle of a machine gun crossfire between two sides is probably not very common.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Three Representatives to Pay Attention to the Fact that the Japanese Violated the Treaty

Not Only Focus on Current Facts, But Also Seek the Effective Implementation of the Nine-Power Treaty

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the three Chinese representatives attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Gu, Guo, and Qian, yesterday, saying, "To representatives Gu, Guo, and Qian of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference: The Japanese have been destroying the Nine-Power Treaty for six years. This conference should focus on the consistent drama of treaty violations over the past six years and seek ways to remedy the situation. It should not only focus on the current events and should also request effective measures to ensure the effective implementation of the Nine-Power Treaty, so as to avoid empty words being of no help. You are all senior members of the diplomatic arena, and the people of the country are looking up to you. We humbly offer these suggestions and ask that you adopt them."

### The Tide of Economic Severance Rises Sharply

India Publishes a Special Issue; Citizens Continue Their Efforts

The Shanghai Local Self-Government Association recently received a letter from the editor of Pro'amitra in Madras, India, translated as follows: "The people of India, in view of Japan's concentrated aggression in China, although its power is strong and fierce, express immeasurable admiration for your country's heroic resistance. We are willing to do everything in our power to help your country fight for freedom. We believe that there is no other way than to boycott Japanese goods. Therefore, Mr. Jwhaslal Nehru, the speaker of our parliament, has given us leadership in order to seek the support of the masses for the boycott plan. Our published weekly intends to publish a special issue on the 26th. We would be very grateful if you could provide us with news, which would allow people here to realize our obligations to your country and all mankind. Therefore, we urgently hope to receive some news from airmail or telegrams before the 24th."

Sever All Relations with the Enemy

The Municipal National Economic Severance Committee with Japan issued a notice to all organizations yesterday stating that, according to the resolution of the committee's first executive committee meeting, all organizations in the city were requested to inform their members not to work for enemy commercial and industrial institutions or families, not to use enemy warehouses, not to use enemy ships, and not to use enemy currency or have any economic relations with enemy banks. Correspondingly, they were requested to comply accordingly.

Strictly Enforce the Exposure of Enemy Goods

The Citizens' United Association of the Second Special District of this city has stipulated four points for cracking down on enemy goods and has made recommendations to the Economic Severance Committee. The recommended measures of the association are recorded as follows: (1) First-tier merchants and trading houses are prohibited from importing enemy goods in the future. All existing inventory must be registered with the Economic Severance Committee immediately and sold off. (2) All industries in the same trade should provide joint guarantees not to import enemy goods. If anyone is found to be privately importing enemy goods and is not reported, the guarantors must be jointly responsible. (3) If employees in the industry discover that the owner or manager is privately importing enemy goods after registration, they may report it at any time. The confidentiality of the reporter will be maintained. (4) All private imports of enemy goods by second-tier and third-tier merchants must be handled in the same way as stipulated above.

### Chamber of Commerce Requests Pawnbrokers to Exchange Gold and Silver for Legal Tender

Since Pawned Items Must Be Sold, It is Better to Directly Exchange Them for Cash

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Pawnbrokers' Association yesterday stating that since full-term gold and silver jewelry must be sold by pawnbrokers anyway, it is better to exchange them directly for legal tender at national banks, which is simpler and more convenient. Please take note and handle accordingly.

### Citizens are Actively Planning to Promote the Solicitation of Public Bonds

Women's Groups and the Social Affairs Bureau Collaborate to Promote and Advocate

The National Salvation Public Bond is not only a concentration of national financial resources, but most importantly, it has a great educational significance in making the national public aware of the meaning of the National Salvation Public Bond and their concern for the long-term war of resistance. Therefore, the women's group specially requested the Social Affairs Bureau to order all principals to lead publicity and solicitation, so that every child can understand and publicize to every family. It is heard that the women's group and the Social Affairs Bureau have agreed on mutual promotion methods and have scheduled to invite all principals for the first discussion tomorrow.

Machinery and Dyeing Industry Acknowledges 200,000 Yuan

Since the Shanghai Machinery and Dyeing Industry Association began soliciting National Salvation Public Bonds, its work has been quite diligent. The amount subscribed by the industry has been around 100,000 yuan. As of the 26th of this month, the actual collected amount was 77,328 yuan.

Tenants Implement the Purchase of Public Bonds

Since the issuance of National Salvation Public Bonds, the tenants of Juyuanfang on Fujian Road in this port believe that the number of bonds solicited should be centered on Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai Solicitation General and Sub-Teams place a heavy burden on the commercial bourgeoisie. At the beginning of the month, it was reported that the tenants would pay one month's rent to obtain a receipt from the bank receiving the National Salvation Public Bond to offset the rent. This method is now being implemented in order. Due to the impact of the war, many tenants in this neighborhood have accumulated arrears in rent. With the previous arrears not yet cleared, it is now difficult to ask each tenant to use one month's rent to urge the landlord to purchase bonds. However, the country has decided that matters related to the national salvation fund should take precedence over private matters. Each tenant must first use one month's rent to purchase National Salvation Public Bonds and use the receipt to offset the rent. As for previous arrears, the tenants will settle them with the landlords themselves.

### The Public Concession is Not Affected by the War Situation

Statement by the Chairman of the Municipal Council: Urging Residents Not to Lightly Believe Rumors

The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday (the 27th) afternoon, "Although there have been changes in the war situation in this city, the area of the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek and east of the railway line is not affected in the slightest. The maintenance of law and order and the administration of the Concession are also not hindered. The Concession authorities have already taken measures to prevent anything that might interfere with the administration of the Concession. At present, there are many rumors, and we earnestly hope that the residents of the Concession will not lightly believe them."

### Closely Monitor Various Donations

The Second Special District United Association Sends Letters to Various Public Organizations

The Citizens' United Association of the Second Special District of this city sent letters to various public organizations yesterday, saying, "According to the suggestion of Committee Member Qu Zhenhua of this association, we are requesting that the government promptly formulate emergency laws for the punishment of crimes during this extraordinary period. If anyone involved in the solicitation of national salvation donations, relief donations, comfort donations, medical donations, and all other donations, including fundraisers, staff members, and various fundraising organizations, is found to have engaged in embezzlement, misappropriation of donations, or directly or indirectly engaged in activities to come to terms with the enemy, they must be sentenced to death once discovered. All accomplices involved in the collusion must also be jointly responsible and punished with the same penalties in order to deter others and uphold the law. After discussion, the association believes that embezzlement of donations not only damages the country's financial resources but also provides excellent material for enemy propaganda, which has a very large impact on the future of the war of resistance. In addition to forwarding the proposed measures to the government for consideration and implementation, we correspondingly request your association to closely monitor fundraising organizations and donation solicitors in order to prevent malpractices. We extend our public friendship."

### Guo Moruo, Tian Han, and Others Extend Regards to the Troops

A Certain Army Commander Acknowledges the Front Line; Withdrawal Does Not Affect the Overall Situation

Guo Moruo, Tian Han, and others went to the front lines on the 24th to extend regards to the troops and returned yesterday. Mr. Guo and others met with General ×××, the commander of the ××th Army, in ××, the front line. They conveyed the condolences and respect of the people in the rear. According to Mr. Guo, the officers and soldiers on the front lines were extremely excited and had the same determination to sacrifice themselves to kill the enemy and save the country. The × Army Commander believes that the retreat on our front line does not affect the overall situation.

### Nine-Year-Old Girl Donates Binoculars

The Shanghai Comfort Association received a donation yesterday from Ms. Wei Guo, the nine-year-old daughter of Mr. Pu Qiting, through the China & South Sea Bank. She was taught by her parents and teachers to use more than 300 yuan of her savings over the years to purchase three military binoculars, which she presented to General Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and Feng Yuxiang to help them kill the enemy and recover the country's territory. The association has now forwarded the binoculars.

### The Mongol Road Rescue Team Sheds Tears as it Withdraws from Zhabei

In the Future, We Will Continue to Uphold the Spirit of the Past and Reorganize to Continue Our Work

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, Mr. Xu Junjie, the principal of the Gongyi Primary School in the Gongyi Li neighborhood of Mongol Road in Zhabei, contacted the local people to organize the Mongol Road Rescue Team, which specializes in entering and exiting the fire lines of Zhabei and Jiangwan to rescue wounded soldiers. They have been working diligently in a dedicated spirit. Up to now, they have rescued more than ××× wounded soldiers. The school building has been used as an emergency station, and the Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Society has allocated medicines and assisted with the transportation work. I did not believe it the night before, until I rescued six wounded soldiers at 10 PM. At 1 AM yesterday morning, I rescued another wounded soldier, and the Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Society sent a car to transport him with great effort. It was not until 7 AM yesterday morning that they were forced to withdraw. All documents and record books were not carried. They withdrew to a Red Cross stationed team site somewhere. According to Mr. Xu, the team leader, the team members have entered and exited the hail of bullets hundreds of times. Fortunately, since the start of the work, no one has been injured or killed. Only a team member surnamed Wang was injured in the leg by falling debris from a bombed house while on duty. What remains as a memorial now is only a handful of injury tickets and three receipts from the Municipal Branch of the Red Cross Society. After this disaster, we will uphold the spirit of the past, reorganize, and plan to work in the rear.

### The International Red Cross Society Establishes a Wounded Soldiers' Hospital

Twelve Wounded Soldiers' Hospitals Rescue Refugees in Western Shanghai

The International Red Cross Society, organized by Chinese and foreign philanthropists and consuls from various countries, has been working hard since its establishment with the task of rescuing wounded soldiers and accommodating Chinese and foreign refugees. For convenience, it has used the Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglinqiao to form two hospitals, the First and Second Wounded Soldiers' and Refugees' Hospitals, with Todd as the director of the First Hospital and Parsons as the director of the Second Hospital. The doctors and nurses in between are mostly foreigners and Catholic women. They have already accommodated many wounded soldiers and Chinese and Western poor and sick refugees. Mr. Col Dewatteollle, the representative of the International Red Cross Society in Geneva, notified the military bureaus of both China and Japan to pay special attention. A meeting was held at the International Hotel yesterday to discuss the funding and relief issues, and it was proposed to request a large sum of money from the Ministry of Finance for advocacy. They are also starting to organize refugee shelters to accommodate local and foreign refugees in Shanghai, with special attention to Russian penniless poor people.

After our army shifted westward due to strategic reasons yesterday, refugees in Zhabei and western Shanghai moved to the Caojiadu area. The scene of supporting the elderly and leading the young on the way was tragic and unbearable. Mr. Cai Futang, the chairman of the 12th Wounded Soldiers' Hospital, personally went to the western district police station to coordinate relief efforts. The authorities expressed deep sympathy and, along with an Italian interpreter, negotiated with the Italian military headquarters and obtained their permission. Mr. Cai then, along with his colleagues Jiang Baochu and Ge Baohua, rescued more than a thousand men and women and sent them to various shelters for relief.

The Red Swastika Society's rescue team, as the front-line war was pressing, still increased vehicles and the whole team set out in separate routes the night before. In Zhongshan Road and Zhoujiaqiao, they rescued a total of 106 wounded soldiers and sent them to various hospitals for treatment.

### The Yuchiaqing Road Bridge Was Closed Off Yesterday Morning

Vehicles, Horses, and Pedestrians Are Not Allowed to Pass

Starting at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the Yuchiaqing Road Bridge was closed off. All vehicles, horses, pedestrians, and firefighters were not allowed to pass.

### Huang Ren Zhi Leaves Shanghai for Suzhou

Returns to Suzhou After a Week

Mr. Huang Ren Zhi of the Shanghai Local Self-Government Association left for Suzhou by car late last night (the 27th) due to official business. After a brief stay, he will depart from Suzhou to travel directly to the capital for further discussions. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai after a week.

### Hoping for Prompt Donations of Urgently Needed Supplies for the Front Lines

In the full-scale war of resistance, there is a huge need for gauze bandages, barbed wire, and bicycles. In addition, the weather is getting colder, and cotton vests are urgently needed. Although the medical first-aid kits have been donated by various parties, they are still insufficient after being claimed by various military branches. It is necessary to request that all sectors donate more. For the style of cotton vests, you can obtain them from the Shanghai Local Self-Government Association of the Comfort Association or the general and branch stores of the China & West Drug Store. First-aid kits can also be purchased from pharmacies, costing one dime per kit. Reception points for comfort items: Yuchiaqing Road Municipal Chamber of Commerce Comfort Association, Local Self-Government Association in the China & South Sea Bank Building, Lintuh An Shujin Li Cotton Cloth Association on Guling Road, East Silk Crepe Association on Shiludong Beijing Road.

### Two Scouts Are Still Missing

Martyred Drivers and Laborers Will Be Given Pensions to Their Families

Scouts Chen Xingsun and others were injured while rescuing wounded soldiers at the front lines the day before yesterday. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Chen Xingsun is recovering quite well from treatment. However, the two scouts who were with him, Chen Yingqian and Xu Jianlai, are still missing and are feared dead. Among those who were killed by the bombing at the time were the driver Cao Huifeng and the laborer Weng Fugen. It is reported that the rescue committee has already provided the families of each of the deceased with 150 yuan for funeral expenses and will provide each with a pension of 500 yuan.

### Maternity Hospital for Refugees Seeks Donations of Infant Clothing

The Refugee Maternity Hospital, organized by the China Hospital at the entrance of Yiyuan Lane, Xinzha Road, and the Hongkou People's Maternity Hospital, is completely non-profit. All refugee mothers are admitted to the hospital and provided with medical care free of charge. However, the newborn infants of refugee mothers often lack small clothes and diapers. The hospital's funding does not come from external sources, so it has not been able to prepare adequately. It is hoped that kind-hearted people will see this and generously donate to help the refugee infants. The infants of the refugees will be greatly grateful.

### Report from the Fire Brigade of the Municipal Council

Most Incidents Occur in Western Shanghai; Fire Engines Have Been Dispatched Eight Times

The lookouts of the Fire Brigade of the Municipal Council reported seventeen fires yesterday (the 26th), all of which occurred in the war zone. Ambulances were dispatched twenty times, taking a total of twenty patients and injured to various hospitals, seven of whom were injured by stray bullets. Most of the incidents occurred near Zhaofeng Garden in western Shanghai. Fire engines were dispatched eight times, the highest number in recent days.

### Eternally Unforgettable Ferry Crossing at the Brahma Temple

— Zhang Changren

The Honorable British Soldiers

Following the southward withdrawal of our army from Dazhang, the defending troops of Jiangwan and Zhabei received orders last night at ten o'clock to retreat, moving the entire division towards western Shanghai under the cover of a single attack. Is this the result of our main force being defeated on the battlefield? No! I believe that anyone with a basic understanding of warfare will know that this is merely to adapt to a certain strategy during the overall war of resistance, avoiding unnecessary and significant sacrifices. Some believe that our army will abandon Greater Shanghai, but that is an unfounded worry. Our army will not allow the entire Greater Shanghai to fall into enemy hands unless it is absolutely necessary to abandon it. Military authorities have expressed their determination to secure western Shanghai and the southern city.

To understand the actual situation in western Shanghai, yesterday afternoon at around one o'clock, after inspecting the situation on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and gazing at the entire Zhabei area, which resembled a large furnace spewing fierce flames, with black smoke and tongues of fire angrily licking the blue autumn sky, I headed west through the bustling civilian market of Caojiadu to inspect the area around the Brahma Temple ferry crossing.

Caojiadu was guarded by troops from Germany. The sandbag fortifications along the road were neatly stacked, as if sculpted, lying beautifully on the ground. Squads of soldiers moved through the crowds. However, the city police still maintained order and directed traffic on the streets. The only difference was that the relatively stable city situation, which had been gradually stabilizing for more than a month, seemed slightly more chaotic; the most noticeable change was the line of refugees coming towards us.

The car stopped at the northern end of Avenue Joffre. I walked along the quiet Suzhou Creek, through the barbed wire placed on the road, towards the Brahma Temple iron bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. The gate at the railway crossing was managed by several British soldiers, who continuously allowed refugees seeking to enter the road construction zone outside the concession to squeeze through the gaps in the gate. Although they held whips, they used them to direct traffic. Three or four foreign photographers, some using box cameras and others using motion picture cameras, were outside the gate capturing the tragic scene of refugees supporting the old and leading the young, carrying burdens on their shoulders, and wandering about in disorder.

These refugees were mostly residents of villages in the triangular area between Dazhang, Zhabei, and Zhenru, survivors of over seventy days of enemy air raids. Perhaps it was too unexpected, or perhaps the scene ahead was too terrifying, that whether they had walked seven miles or one or two miles, they all appeared extremely exhausted, their clothes disheveled, and their faces pale. Most of them were walking with difficulty, stumbling along the way. Their faces were pale, and their eyes had lost their spirit, the peaceful and simple light that was usually present in the eyes of the Chinese people.

I walked onto the pedestrian walkway on the east side of the iron bridge (now the northern end is blocked) and looked out over the undulating fields north of the Suzhou Creek. The autumn sun was as bright and warm as the spring sun, and the suburban scenery remained the same. However, on every village road leading to the iron bridge, there was only a dense black line of compatriots fleeing to safety, crawling south like ants. At this time, sporadic gunfire could be heard in the distance, occasionally accompanied by the explosion of one or two small artillery shells. Enemy planes flew low in the not-so-distant sky in groups, their flying posture seemingly boasting that this time, our army's voluntary temporary retreat would be recorded in their book of achievements.

Most refugees seemed about to faint as they reached the northern end of the iron bridge, but they still struggled to step over the railway ties with great difficulty. The steps of the elderly women and children were not long enough to span the distance between the ties, so they fell, crawled, shouted, and cried, which could be described as the epitome of human suffering. Any human being, except for the cold-blooded "executioners" of Japan, namely the Japanese air force that bombed civilians and undefended cities, would naturally feel sympathy.

Ah! I have never felt such goodwill towards British soldiers. They rolled up their sleeves and used their strong, hairy arms to carry one or two frightened, crying children and support or carry frail old women or women unable to walk across the bridge from the other side, time after time. They carried loads of clothing or rice for the refugees across the bridge. They sweated and worked tirelessly, and during the two hours I was there, they always helped the refugees as sincerely as if they were their own families. I personally saw refugees shedding tears of gratitude towards them, and I personally heard the refugees express their heartfelt thanks. I know that although they did not understand the words, they were not hoping for expressions of gratitude. For the first time, I saw true "humanity" - their spirit of prioritizing helping others was truly admirable!

Police Constable Number 1222 (later I learned his name was Yan Bingheng) was also one of the most helpful, and he was the only Chinese person on the bridge. He devoted almost all his strength to helping the refugees. He said, "I don't have money to donate to the country, but I should use my strength to help others." He was a young, strong man from the north. I shook his hand, with the same respect I had for the British soldiers.

After crossing the iron bridge, most of the refugees went west along the Suzhou Creek. I don't know where their destination was. Perhaps they were seeking a safer place in the future battlefield, or perhaps they were going south along the railway line. However, I could not advise every refugee.

The Japanese air force continued to bomb the refugees. I bandaged the wound of a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old girl. A large piece of her upper arm had been cut away by shrapnel. She only wanted to escape and forgot about the pain, forgetting to stop the bleeding. I couldn't find a bandage for a moment, but the wife of a foreign photographer next to me generously offered a clean, ginger-scented handkerchief, which I used my common sense to tie tightly to stop the bleeding. Another elderly man in his fifties had been shot in the forehead by a Japanese soldier, and an American soldier helped him into his ambulance and drove away.

At this moment, the battle at the Brahma Temple ferry crossing began. Behind a high ground not far north of the railway bridge, the crisp, continuous sound of automatic rifles suddenly rang out. The target was aimed at us – the British soldiers, the Chinese constable, and the refugees – on the south bank. This surprised the British soldiers on the bridge. We disregarded the many men, women, old, and young refugees who were paralyzed and sitting on the ground, and first hurriedly sought a hiding place. However, there were fields all around us, so we, two British soldiers, and the photographer's wife all fell into the ditch by the side of the road. It was very shallow, so we had to press our chests and faces tightly against the slope of the ditch. The British soldiers also loaded their rifles, ready to fire if necessary. The other side of the railway on the north bank immediately retaliated with the same gunfire. We were caught in the center of the line of fire.

The enemy's bullets "flew—" "flew—" over our heads. Perhaps they were too high, or perhaps I didn't hold up my target well enough, but I was lucky enough not to be "stimulated." However, I had to leave; I couldn't determine how long this battle would last. Eventually, I had to take advantage of a pause in the enemy's gunfire and flee towards the Brahma Temple station, seeking cover along the way. As I hid on the side of a cream-colored car, I felt that the car had taken several bullets. If it weren't for that car, perhaps the enemy's two bullets wouldn't have been wasted?

The first cover I found was at most two or three hundred meters from the other side. It wasn't until I reached Yuyuan Road that I felt a little safer.

On the way back (at 2:45), I was fortunate enough to see two enemy planes shot down alive. One fell completely to the ground, landing in our army's position in the direction of Beixinjing. The other fell completely to the ground, one exploded in the sky, the fuselage shattered, and the pilot slowly descended with a parachute into our army's position. If he didn't die, he might be a guest in Nanjing for a while!

### From the First Line to the Second Line

— Jin Zhonghua

Our army on the Shanghai-Songhu front retreated from the first line of defense to the second line the night before last. This retreat was mainly due to the destruction of the fortifications in Dazhang, leaving our frontline soldiers with no fortifications to defend, and the enemy forces advancing south from Zoumatang directly towards Zhenru posed a danger of cutting off the rear of our Jiangwan and Zhabei right-wing troops. Therefore, this was a strategic retreat, which cannot be said to be a serious defeat for our army, nor is it sufficient to affect the overall situation of our war of resistance. However, for two weeks, the general public has been closely concerned about the battle situation in Dazhang, and now suddenly hearing the news of the retreat, there must be those who cannot restrain their grief and indignation in terms of emotion; especially those who hope for victory too eagerly, suddenly heard yesterday that our army had moved west, and saw the flames of Zhabei soaring into the sky, perhaps in addition to grief and indignation, they could not help but feel a slight sense of disappointment. But we should point out that this feeling is absolutely impermissible. The war on the first line of Shanghai-Songhu for seventy-five days is the greatest success in the history of our country's war of resistance. We used a mere army to resist the enemy's four forces of sea, land, air, and mechanized troops, on a riverbank about ten kilometers deep and tens of kilometers long, containing more than a hundred enemy ships, 200,000 troops, and 350 naval and land aircraft for as long as two and a half months; no military strategist from any standpoint can fail to be amazed by the bravery of our soldiers! We believe that with this incomparably brave spirit, resisting the war on the second, third, or any line of defense, the result will inevitably be a greater success.

Moreover, from the perspective of the current overall battle situation, our main front of resistance is in North China, not in Shanghai. Shanghai is a place where our army and the enemy are engaged in attrition warfare. On this front, our biggest goal is to contain the enemy's massive military force and consume the enemy's unlimited ammunition, so that they are exhausted by fatigue; but in the war to achieve this goal, we should also have a certain limit, that is, our own military force cannot be contained here too much, and our manpower and material resources cannot be consumed too much here, so as not to affect the situation of the main resistance in North China. Therefore, when our army retreated from Baoshan, Wusong, and the city center to the first line of defense, foreign military experts considered it a necessary strategic retreat. Now, from September 11 to October 26, our army's resistance on the first line has lasted for a month and a half: most of our fortifications have been destroyed, and the enemy's consumption of military force has also been very huge, so it is completely necessary to retreat to the second line of defense at present in terms of strategy.

However, one point must be pointed out now: the movement of the line of defense is by no means abandonment, and it does not mean that the war of resistance in this area can be terminated for the defense of Shanghai. Shanghai is the center of our country's finance, industry, and culture. We must not easily let it fall into the enemy's encirclement when we can defend it; at the same time, Shanghai is densely covered with railways and highways, and it is also a necessary place for conducting positional warfare. Once we abandon it, the enemy's mechanized troops will take advantage of the convenience of transportation and quickly seize important locations in our Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas. Therefore, at present, although our line of defense has been partially moved, we should still take defending Shanghai as the main goal on this front. West of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the Suzhou Creek is a natural trench; south of this river, our fortifications have already been completed; in the future, on the one hand, we will resist the enemy's offensive south from Zhenru, and on the other hand, we will launch the flank counterattack of Guangfu and Shixianggong Temple, which can make the second line of defense a solid wall to stop the enemy's aggression.

Finally, we believe that our compatriots in Shanghai should have a clear understanding at present. This war of resistance against the invaders is by no means a matter of temporary pleasure, but a difficult task that requires long-term support. Temporary victory is not enough to be happy about, and temporary retreat is not enough to be afraid of. We have already had the experience of the most dangerous war of resistance for seventy-five days, and we should use this important experience to support the long-term war of resistance in the future. Shanghai is an important source of manpower and material resources in our country. We must work together with one heart and never waver, and combine this source of power with the war of resistance, until the final victory of our national liberation. Therefore, when our war of resistance moves from the first line to the second line, we cannot have any emotional wavering, but should prepare for more calm efforts with greater determination.

### British Accept Japanese Apology for Killing British Soldier in Shanghai

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th (Reuters) - The case of the Japanese aircraft machine-gunning and killing British soldier McGowan on Avenue Joffre on October 22 in Shanghai can now be considered closed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a letter from the British Embassy today, stating that the British government has accepted the official document issued by Foreign Minister Hirota on Sunday afternoon, expressing the Japanese government's apology.

### Sun Tonggang's Escape Story

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th - On October 12th, our brave flying generals, piloting six aircraft, were ordered to set off to bomb the enemy's base in Tanggu, but only five reached their destination. The aircraft piloted by our Squadron Leader Sun Tonggang, because the propeller of the aircraft suddenly fell off in mid-air, could not continue flying, so he had to signal to his companions with his hand and then land. At that time, everyone thought that Squadron Leader Sun had made a heroic sacrifice, so the newspapers published news of the martyrdom of our bravest flying general one after another. We were saddened by this unfortunate news, but unexpectedly Squadron Leader Sun returned safely on the 18th, which is exactly the kind of thing that makes people turn from tears to laughter and is a pleasant surprise. Although Squadron Leader Sun did not return in his original aircraft, he brought back a brave little dog and a story that was both heroic and brave.

The truth is that when the propeller of Squadron Leader Sun's aircraft fell off, he and a bomb aimer could have jumped down with parachutes, but he wanted to preserve his aircraft, and even in the most dangerous moment, he was unwilling to sacrifice this valuable national tool, so he signaled to his five companions with his hand, indicating that everything was fine, and instructed them to continue flying to their destination and complete their great mission, without worrying about his personal safety, and then he used his wonderful piloting skills to land completely by gliding. Although he lost the propeller this time, it was the smoothest landing he had ever encountered in his life.

When the aircraft was about to land, he and his companion hurriedly took out their pistols from their sides, because they were prepared to fight the enemy to the death if they landed in the enemy's position, until there was only the last bullet left in the gun, and then commit suicide to make a heroic sacrifice. The aircraft landed, and they saw two farmers and several fishermen. The farmers and fishermen looked at the flying general coming down from the sky with surprised eyes. They could not tell whether the people on the aircraft were their brave soldiers or their public enemy - the Japanese, so the two sides began to argue. The farmers initially did not believe that Chinese people would wear such strange clothes, but after Squadron Leader Sun's repeated explanations and telling them his name, sure enough, the three words "Sun Tonggang" had considerable effect. These three words seemed to be deeply imprinted in their minds, knowing that Sun Tonggang was a nationally famous aviator.

At this time, Squadron Leader Sun suddenly saw a team of soldiers wearing yellow uniforms coming from a distance. At first, he felt very surprised, but later he realized that they were soldiers guarding the coast. There were 200 of them, led by a captain. They had been forced to retreat because their position had been occupied by the enemy. Their leader had surrendered to the enemy, but they were unwilling to be slaves of the enemy and be driven by the enemy. They were still followed by a dog, which was said to be unwilling to follow its master - their general - to surrender to Japan. They were still wearing summer uniforms, enduring hunger and cold, waiting for an opportunity to kill the enemy again.

This group of loyal and brave soldiers really made Squadron Leader Sun extremely excited. This time, he got another ironclad proof of the loyalty and bravery of our country's soldiers in resisting the war, which is how worthy of joy! He talked to them and learned that they had no plans, only knowing that they were unwilling to surrender to the Japanese. So Squadron Leader Sun readily agreed to temporarily command them, and promised to find them work and provide them with food and clothing after returning to Shandong. At this time, more and more people gathered in the village, all happily welcoming Squadron Leader Sun and this group of iron-blooded men. "Friends, please take good care of this aircraft for me," Squadron Leader Sun exhorted this group of villagers with a kindly attitude. "If the enemy comes, burn it quickly. If the enemy doesn't come, wait for me to have the opportunity to send someone or come in person to take it back," Squadron Leader Sun added a sentence before leaving. He looked reluctant to part with the aircraft, because that aircraft was still as good as new except for the propeller, but he finally reluctantly led this group of brothers away from that village.

At this time, the sky was already covered with dark clouds, and heavy rain poured down. Squadron Leader Sun and his group had extreme difficulty moving on the muddy road. At night, the searchlights on forty enemy warships shone indiscriminately on the shore. They did not even dare to smoke cigarettes. During the day, they had to avoid the enemy's plainclothes teams. But they mustered their courage, braved the danger, disregarded hunger and cold, and full of hope, groped forward in the dark of night. Fortunately, there was that loyal and brave little dog leading the way. They walked for twenty-four hours and finally returned safely to the border of Shandong Province.

After arriving at their destination, Squadron Leader Sun immediately went to see the authorities and reported everything that had happened. The authorities praised him greatly, and gave the group of brothers winter uniforms, woolen socks, and cotton shoes, and incorporated them into the front-line troops. They were extremely grateful at the time. They were not grateful for getting warm clothes and enough to eat, but for regaining the opportunity to kill the enemy.

Only then did Squadron Leader Sun rush to the railway station, but the train he was riding on was bombed by four enemy aircraft again. At that time, two passenger cars were destroyed by the bombing, but fortunately the locomotive was unharmed and continued to drive forward.

"After arriving at a certain airfield, enemy aircraft came to drop bombs again, as if welcoming Squadron Leader Sun. To be honest, we have long put life and death out of our minds," Squadron Leader Sun replied excitedly to the reporter's question. "I haven't taken a bath or rested for several days, please forgive me for not being able to talk more," he said, and then shook hands with the reporter happily and said goodbye. The reporter watched the brave flying general walk away slowly with the little dog, and felt infinite relief for his escape.

### Tenth Aspect of Wartime Japan

㊉ Wartime Japanese Theater and Film

In Japan, where thought and speech are under extreme oppression from the military clique, drama and film, as parts of culture, are inevitably subjected to the iron hammer of the military authorities. Let us first discuss theater.

Japanese theater can be broadly divided into commercial theater troupes and artistic theater troupes. Commercial theater troupes include Kabuki, a purely classical drama, and Shinpa-geki, similar to Chinese "civilized drama." Stimulated by the current situation, commercial theater troupes are competing to perform so-called "military works," which the Japanese call "Sai-mono" (affairs of the moment), which can be loosely translated into Chinese as "speculation." These are hastily produced plays that bring news reports of the Sino-Japanese War to the stage, exaggerating how loyal and brave Japanese men are, how enthusiastically the home front (called "after the gun" in Japanese) is making contributions, or how tragedies occur in families due to the conscription of young men. They also put Chinese people on stage as clowns, performing all kinds of ugly behaviors or being insulted by Japanese people, to please the minds of low-class audiences. This kind of low-level military work has flooded various commercial theaters, and has flooded into remote mountain areas far from the metropolis. The Japanese themselves are frowning upon this. Hideo Nagata criticized in the September issue of the theater magazine "La Théâtre": "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the people have been extremely excited, and theaters and cinemas have frequently staged and screened war-related works. However, no matter which one you watch, it has almost become a stereotype. There has been no progress since the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. As for the vulgar mass drama of commercialism, it is naturally impossible to expect works with a high level of thought. It is unnecessary to say such untimely things now, but at least I hope to stage works that are commensurate with the current cultural level of the Japanese people... During this period, theaters and cinemas perform such anachronistic dramas and films. It is really a national shame." There were also readers' letters in the Asahi Shimbun saying that some military dramas were chilling. For example, what was performed by a certain theater troupe traveling around was inconsistent from the beginning of the story, and the performance was absurd and unrealistic.

As for artistic theater troupes, they have been very active in recent years. In addition to the Shintsukiji and Shinkyō theater troupes, which are based in the Tsukiji Little Theater, the Zenza Theater of Zenza Ichikawa, which has been preparing since last year, will hold its first performance in October. The Bungakuza, with Kyosuke Tomoda as its technical center, and with the participation of Kunio Kishida, Toyoo Iwata, and Mantaro Kubo, will also use the auditorium of the Bunka Gakuin as its base and perform once every other month.

However, the military authorities are determined not to sit idly by and watch the activities of these relatively progressive elements. As a result, Shintsukiji first ran into trouble. Shintsukiji was originally scheduled to perform Gogol's "The Inspector General" (that is, "The Government Inspector" that the Shanghai amateur actors had performed) at the Hibiya Public Hall on September 25. Due to the current situation, the review was not passed, and the Osaka performance in September was also temporarily canceled.

The Shinkigeki troupe had no choice but to disband due to the ripples thrown by the current situation, and Kyosuke Tomoda, the technical center of the Bungakuza, was conscripted by the military clique to the Shanghai front and died in battle. The impact of the military clique on the artistic theater troupes can be imagined. The organizers of the artistic theater troupes still seem to be struggling to survive under the suffocating Japanese situation. The Shinkyō theater troupe performed Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina," adapted by the Soviet N.D. Gorkov, at the Tsukiji Little Theater starting on September 20. Shintsukiji, on the other hand, entered the large commercial theater, performing "Letters of Laughter" at the Shinjuku Daiichi Theater. This play used sound film and was very similar to the Shinpa-geki's serial drama, but because the organizers were progressive elements, critics regarded it as a meaningful attempt.

Next, let's talk about Japanese films. Japanese films have also been washed away by the huge torrent of the Sino-Japanese War. Military films, patriotic films, and original films make the audience feel like they are at a meeting. The most noteworthy phenomenon is the proliferation of newsreels. Due to the expansion of the Sino-Japanese War, the audience is eager to understand the current situation on the battlefield, so they love to watch newsreels. The military authorities also took advantage of this point, with the government-designated news agency Domei News Agency supplying war newsreels to various cinemas. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Osaka Asahi Shimbun, and Yomuri Shimbun each sent special correspondents to the North China and Shanghai fronts to shoot newsreels and distribute them to various cinemas for propaganda purposes. As a result, before the audience can watch the films they want to watch, they have to watch more than 30 minutes of newsreels, whether they want to or not. Japanese newsreels are really dry and tasteless. Apart from taking a few pictures of artillery fire or marching behind the Japanese army, there is no material from the Chinese side at all. Moreover, under the extremely strict review of the military authorities, any place that is unfavorable to Japan cannot be shown on the screen at all. Even photos of wounded soldiers and shelled houses are also detained. How can this kind of simple thing depict the atmosphere of war?

In addition to newsreels, there are still crudely made military films and shallow love films. There are almost no films with a sense of the times and social significance like the Chinese "Song of the Fishermen," "The Lost Lamb," and "Hearts United in Life and Death." Due to the current situation, soft love films are not very popular either. As a result, the Japanese people can only watch films with militaristic, counter-constructivist colors and superficial corruption. For today's Japanese people, especially those with some knowledge, culture, and education, these days are not easy to live.

Postscript: There is still a lot of material to write about the various aspects of wartime Japan, such as the wartime Japanese economy, the wartime Japanese publishing industry, and the wartime Japanese press. Due to space limitations, there will only be other opportunities to write about them. (Postscript by the author of this article, Lulan) (End)

### Ten-Person National Salvation Corps Donates Funds to Save the Country

The Shanghai Ten-Person National Salvation Corps Federation was founded during the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic of China and was one of the earliest anti-Japanese organizations in Shanghai. In recent years, due to environmental factors, it has rarely engaged in national salvation work, but it has continued to work hard in the field of education, such as establishing free schools and promoting literacy education. Recently, since our country's war of resistance against Japan, the government and the people have been of one mind in resisting foreign aggression. The comrades of the association, as the name suggests, should express themselves. Therefore, the responsible personnel decided to donate all of the 7,000 yuan in funds stored in the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China to the government to replenish military needs and resolutely fight. It is planned to donate in installments. The first and second installments have been remitted to the Military Affairs Commission and have been received by the association. It is now heard that the association yesterday remitted the third and fourth installments of 2,000 yuan through the Bank of Communications.

### Strictly Prohibit Rice Sellers from Raising Market Prices

Once Discovered, Severe Punishment Will Be Imposed

Since its establishment, the Municipal Food Regulation Committee has been extremely concerned about the food regulation of the citizens of Shanghai. It has dredged up sources and set prices, and has completed the task of controlling food during wartime. In order to strictly prohibit rice sellers from taking the opportunity to raise market prices and affecting people's food, the committee issued General Notice No. 10, which stated: "The city's rice and grain have been transported through the efforts of this committee, and the source is increasing day by day. The market price has been reduced successively, and it has been announced to the public in newspapers. It is now found that the city's rice and grain is sufficient, and there is no shortage of food for the people. The highest grade of white japonica rice is still 13 yuan and 6 jiao per shi, and the price of middle and inferior grades is reduced accordingly. If any rice sellers in the city fail to comply with the market price stipulated by this committee, once discovered or reported, they will be submitted to the competent authorities for severe punishment and will never be tolerated. Therefore, it is urgently notified to the public."

### Ten Days of Bloody Battle at Chenjiahang (Part 1)

— Cheng

The reporter returned to Shanghai from a certain place in the countryside some days ago. Since there was no convenient vehicle to take at that time, I walked eastward for an hour and felt quite tired. I rested briefly in the shed. When I walked into the shed, I met a wounded young military officer who was waiting for a stretcher there. We told each other our origins, and sat together on the edge of a turntable. I shyly handed the military officer a cigarette, and took one myself to smoke. After we calmed down, we started talking. I hoped to get some more accurate information from this chance encounter, and the wounded young military officer was also willing to tell me about their experience on the battlefield. He was from Shandong, and was courteous and polite to people. I respected him very much. Although we only exchanged a few words, we were very fond of each other, and we began to talk confidentially.

"Comrade, which division are you from? Where were you wounded? Can you tell me about the general situation of your unit's fighting these days?"

After I asked this question, he showed a look of victory and sighs mixed together, and told me in a very calm and tragic tone about the eight-day and night bloody battle of their entire commander and loyal soldiers. The record is as follows.

"We participated in the bloody battle with the enemy for seven days and nights in Liuhang, Yongan Bridge, and Xiaozhuzhai in mid-September. Four battalion commanders, Yang, Chen, Geng, and Yang, died loyally. That time, our division fought against the main force of the enemy's entire division. Although the enemy's equipment was stronger than ours, we finally repelled them with a spirit of great fearlessness, and the front line stood firm. The detailed situation has been published in major newspapers. If you mention it, sir, you will definitely remember it."

"Because the superiors took into account the fatigue of the soldiers, we were replaced to rest and replenish on September 20. In a short period of time, we completed the replenishment, and the morale of the officers and soldiers recovered. At that time, many patriotic groups and celebrities from all walks of life in Shanghai gave our division many items that were beneficial to combat. Mrs. Liao Zhongkai and others raised a lot of medicines and masks for us, and various groups and individuals donated many miscellaneous items. This is what our superiors told us. We have received and applied all of the above items, and all the officers and soldiers of our division are very grateful to the various groups and gentlemen who helped us."

"Because of the national crisis, our own responsibilities, the encouragement of our superiors, and the enthusiastic love and assistance of our compatriots from all walks of life, all the officers and soldiers of our division are willing to go to the front line early to replace friendly troops and continue fighting, so that they can also come back to rest and replenish. Because this kind of fierce battle makes it impossible for a unit to fight against the enemy for a long time, everyone must take turns to fight."

"Our division commander, brigade commander, regimental commander, and battalion commander are all young generals with knowledge, experience, and fearlessness. They can't stand their temper in the rear. The division commander often tells us, 'Fight for the survival of the country and the nation, and we will never be discouraged even if one soldier is sacrificed.' This sentence has become the firm belief of our officers and soldiers, so after we have replenished our personal supplies and ammunition, our division commander led our more than 10,000 bloody soldiers to Chenjiahang Duntusi on the left wing of the Wenzaobang River on the eve of National Day to replace the friendly troops and join the battle."

"The day we joined the battle for the second time, it was raining heavily, and the enemy's planes could not come, so it gave us a good opportunity to charge and kill during the day. On the afternoon of October 9, the Duntusi Bridge Pavilion house was in danger. The enemy's artillery broke through two points and concentrated firepower to bombard a corner of our Duntusi Temple. Because the friendly troops had fought hard for more than a month, the strength of the troops was more seriously damaged, and the position was slightly shaken. The enemy took the opportunity to invade more than 3,000 people. At that time, our division commander immediately ordered Regimental Commander Pan Taowan to lead two battalions to counterattack in the rain during the day. Because Regimental Commander Pan and Battalion Commanders Xiao Guangcan and Zhao Fengchuan have always been the bravest, after half an hour of hand-to-hand combat between the enemy and us, two-thirds of the more than 300 enemies who invaded the rear of our position were killed by our bayonets and hand grenades, and less than 100 people escaped back. The enemy's corpses were lying in the cotton field, and it was impossible to check clearly. Their plaster flags and military equipment were sent to us. This gave the enemy a major shock, and the position was completely restored by these two battalions."

"That night—the eve of National Day—our entire division took over the three- or four-mile-long position from Chenjiahang to Qiaotingzhai. We worked hard all night to strengthen our position, holding bombs in our hands and loading bullets into our guns, waiting for the Japanese invaders to attack. Because the enemy suffered a great loss from us, they did not dare to invade that night, only seeing them using ropes to pull their dead devils to the back."

"On the morning of National Day, we heard the frantic calls of all walks of life in Shanghai to sever economic ties with Japan from the radio. At the same time, the enemy's artillery fired at our position again, but we were not polite either. Their shells came, and our shells went, at a ratio of ten to one, and the enemy and our positions became a cloud of black smoke. We saw the soldiers clapping and shouting when our shells hit, but the devils suffered a lot. They were curled up in the cotton field wiping their tears, calling for their mothers, and chanting Amitabha, but none of it worked."

### Enemy Planes Bomb Cotton Mills and Vegetable Markets, Over 300 Casualties

Broken Arms and Legs, Too Horrible to Look At

At about 9:30 yesterday morning, twelve enemy planes flew to Baili South Road, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, and dropped more than ten bombs. The first to bear the brunt were the spinning workshop of the Shenxin First Factory and the Minsheng Spinning Factory. The furnace rooms and cotton rooms of both factories caught fire and burned, and the internal machinery, cotton, and living materials were destroyed. Only the outer corridors and buildings remained. It is estimated that about 200 male workers were killed or injured in the two factories. Several bombs fell on the triangular vegetable market. There were many residents selling vegetables at the market. After the bombing, more than 100 people, including vegetable buyers and vendors, were killed or injured on the spot, with broken arms and legs, burnt heads and faces, and groaning on the roadside. It was too horrible to look at, and the order was chaotic. The authorities of the Chinese Concession of the French Concession quickly ordered a large number of detectives to rush to maintain order, and notified the Red Cross Rescue Team to risk going to the rescue, burying the dead one by one and carrying the wounded to various hospitals for treatment. Among them, five people were seriously injured, and their names were sent to Renji Hospital by Hua Bu No. 142 as follows: Zhou Jinzu, 38 years old, Zhou Da Mimei, 14 years old, Zhang Zheng, 63 years old, Zhang Yongzhang, 43 years old, and a certain Pan, about 30 years old.

It is heard that the association is still continuing to register female workers in spinning factories. If they are skilled, they can register at the association's office at Chengd坊, Changping Road, Gordon Road.

Current Events Commentary

### The Shanghai Battle Enters a New Phase

— Appropriate

Our army in Zhabei and Jiangwan, since August 13th, has consistently displayed unparalleled bravery, preventing the enemy from daring to directly seize our positions. Only the night before last, due to strategic considerations, did they retreat in an orderly manner. Thus, the Shanghai war has entered a new phase.

During the past two and a half months of war, the enemy's casualties were no fewer than our own, and the amount of ammunition consumed was many times greater than ours. The result is that tens of square miles of land have been temporarily occupied by the enemy. This land has been baptized by artillery fire and has become scorched earth. The enemy must continue to pay a great price to set up defenses in order to prevent our army's counterattack.

On the other hand, our army's achievements in the past two and a half months have won unparalleled glory for the nation. International sympathy for our country is clearly very different from before the war. Not only that, but the spirit of national unity and solidarity has been further consolidated due to such great achievements. Now, the compatriots throughout the country already believe that a long-term war of resistance is the only way for our nation to survive.

Such is the significance of the first phase of the Shanghai war. In the future, our army will move to new defense lines to fight, and there will be more favorable military conditions. Of course, the future can be even more optimistic.

### Fierce Fighting Near Zhoujiaqiao in Western Shanghai, Our Army Holds the South Bank of the Suzhou River

Enemy heavy artillery bombarded the north of Xinjing all night without stopping. Fierce battles were fought in both Zhenru and Jiangqiao. Our isolated army in Zhabei still defends the Sihang Warehouse.

Since our army retreated to the new defense line, morale has remained high and defenses have become more consolidated. This morning, our reporter inspected along the north of the Suzhou River to Caojiadu, then to the end of Avenue du President Doumer, the Fahuazhen Station, the end of Haig Road, and Xujiahui. The remnants of the battle in Zhabei have not yet subsided. The loyal and brave soldiers of our isolated army who are defending the Sihang Savings Society Warehouse are still fighting desperately against the enemy's attacks, which have been repeatedly launched, with great sacrifices. Starting this morning, the enemy changed to an encirclement strategy and dared not advance lightly. Traffic on the New Rubbish Bridge has been cut off. The area near the north of the bridge is closed to pedestrians and guarded by the Municipal Council detectives. However, the general situation is relatively quiet. On the western part of Shanghai, along Zhongshan Road, the enemy has occupied Datong University. We destroyed the Zhongshan Road Bridge to stop the enemy's advance and built solid fortifications along the south bank of the Suzhou River, relying on the dangerous terrain to hold the line. This morning, enemy planes circled and bombed the Xinjing area in northwestern Shanghai in batches, causing many casualties among refugees. Several Municipal Council ambulances were parked at the end of Avenue du President Doumer, going back and forth for rescue. From last night until this morning, the enemy's heavy artillery was concentrated on bombarding the north of Xinjing, without stopping all night. There was also intense artillery fire in the Nanxiang area, where the enemy and us are still in a stalemate near Xiaonanxiang. The war situation north of Guangfu is quiet. As for the Zhenru town, the enemy launched a fierce attack from three directions. Our army calmly resisted. Although outnumbered, they have been surrounded. But our loyal and brave soldiers would rather die than surrender. The fierce battle is still continuing this morning. At the same time, to the west of Zhenru town, south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, Jiangqiao town north of the Suzhou River, also saw a fierce battle. The enemy attempted to break through a bloody path and continue to attack south, but was closely blocked by our army. In addition to breaking through our Nanxiang railway line, the enemy also appears to be dividing its forces to sneak across the Suzhou River from the Zhenbei Highway, spying on our Xinjing in the north and threatening our Nanshi (South City). We have heavy troops defending this line, and the Zhenbei Bridge has also been destroyed to prevent the enemy's advance. We will definitely give the invading enemy a head-on blow.

### Eyewitness Account of the Isolated Army in Zhabei Resisting the Enemy

Three attacks were repelled. An American soldier laughed as he was beckoned by our troops. The people admired them as auspicious stars and clouds.

The eight hundred or so men of the 88th Division Xie Jinyuan Regiment, who are preparing to make a heroic sacrifice and defend the Sihang Warehouse north of the Suzhou River, refusing to withdraw from Zhabei, are still holding their original position today. The warehouse is only separated from the Suzhou River by a river. It can be seen from the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road. Today, since dawn, our residents in the concession, admiring the bravery and heroism of the army, gathered there, craning their necks to watch, as if they were admiring auspicious stars and clouds. According to a shop owner, his shop happened to be on the south bank of the Suzhou River. Looking at the north bank from the window of the upper floor, even the beards and eyebrows could be clearly distinguished. According to him, yesterday the enemy army tried to break into the Sihang Warehouse three times but failed, and he witnessed the deaths and injuries of more than a dozen enemy soldiers. He was very excited. According to him, each time the enemy charged in, there were more than a dozen people. Before they reached the steps, four or five of them were hit by our army's machine gun bullets. The rest of the enemy hurriedly dragged the corpses away. The last time, because our army threw hand grenades from the roof, there were more deaths and injuries, totaling no less than a dozen people. Moreover, our army was quite humorous while bravely killing the enemy. When the enemy fled for the last time, our army reached out from the window to beckon. Seeing this, the enemy fled even faster. The American soldiers stationed on the south bank could not help but laugh.

### Our Army Is Still Defending Zhenru Town

The town has been surrounded by enemy troops. Enemy planes bombed the whole town indiscriminately, inevitably turning it into scorched earth.

After our army in Jiangwan and Zhabei moved southwest for strategic reasons, the area south of the Zhenru Railway Station and north of the Suzhou River became the center of the war. After the enemy occupied the Zhenru Railway Station, they attacked our Zhenru town along the Zhenru Big Field Highway. Dozens of enemy planes bombed Zhenru town wildly last night, inevitably turning the whole town into scorched earth. Although the defending army of our army has been surrounded by enemy troops on all sides, they still bravely fought, firmly defended, and refused to retreat. Although the enemy troops have crossed the town and attacked south, the defending army of our army has vowed to coexist with the town. As of noon today, our army is still fighting hard. Looking from afar, the whole town has flames soaring into the sky and is burning fiercely.

A reporter from the Central News Agency, who was with the army, reported at 12:45 pm on the 28th that north of Jinan New Village, a part of our army is still fighting a desperate battle with the enemy. Since 9:30 pm last night, they have been advancing towards Changbang and have formed a solid line with Zhujiang Alley, Hengjing Alley, East Hengjing Alley, Meng Alley, Houjia Alley, and Pengpu Town, confronting the enemy. The battle is extremely fierce. Our army is fighting bravely, with each soldier acting as a hundred men. As of 5:00 am this morning, the enemy's casualties were over 700.

### Fierce Fighting on the North Bank of Xinjing

The enemy's artillery fire was concentrated and then stopped.

The enemy troops crossed Zhenru town and continued to attack the position of our army on the north bank of Xinjing along the Zhenbei Highway. This morning, there was a fierce war on the north bank of Zhoujiaqiao Xinjing. Our army relies on the south of the Suzhou River to defend it, which is extremely solid. The enemy troops decided it was difficult to attack. Since last night, the enemy's artillery fire has been concentrated on bombarding the area around Xinjing and Zhoujiaqiao on the north of our army. It has not stopped this morning. Our army's position has not been damaged. Enemy planes are unusually active in the sky above the area.

### The Enemy's Fierce Attack on Jiangqiao Has Been Repelled

The northeast of the town is in fierce battle.

In Jiangqiao town, which is about two kilometers south of the middle section of the Zhenru Nanxiang railway line northwest of Xinjing, our army has deployed extremely strong fortifications. Since last night, the enemy army has launched a fierce attack on our army's position in the town. The artillery fire was concentrated on the town, and enemy planes also bombed it extensively. Under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy troops charged several times, but our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, and all were repelled by our army. This morning, the northeast of the town is still in fierce battle.

### Enemy Artillery Bombards the Entire Line of Guangfu

A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Guangfu reported at 10:00 am on the 28th that the war situation on the entire line north of Guangfu has been quiet since last night until this morning. However, enemy artillery and planes are still carrying out their destructive violence, bombing our entire line of positions, and the planes are especially disturbing. Our army is calmly dealing with it and is closely vigilant, he said.

### The Enemy Attempts to Cross the River at Zhoujiaqiao

Our army used machine guns to strafe the enemy, and the enemy did not succeed.

The Central News Agency reported that our army moved southwest from Zhabei Jiangwan and was ready to be deployed according to the planned program early yesterday, and then moved south in an orderly manner after vigilance. The point of Kun advancing into the concession business district has abandoned Datong University and safely withdrew from the south bank of the Suzhou River. After the enemy marines occupied the area, they moved to the edge of the river on both sides of the bridge at the family bridge yesterday. The army calmly responded under the artillery fire and fired with machine guns, and finally failed.

### Enemy Troops Occupy Datong University

Our army firmly defends the south bank of Zhongshan Road Bridge

The enemy troops occupying Zhabei advanced south along Zhongshan Road last night and attacked our army. A battle took place between the two armies west of the Central Mint and north of Datong University. The enemy army came fiercely. Our army bravely resisted and fought hard for several hours. Finally, because there was no danger to defend, they moved to the south bank of the Suzhou River. When the Zhongshan Road Bridge was blown up, solid fortifications were arranged on the south side of the Zhongshan Road Bridge. Datong University north of the bridge was occupied by enemy troops last night.

### The Situation in Pudong Was Relatively Quiet Yesterday

There was artillery fire between the two sides until 10:00 last night.

After our army in the Zhabei Jiangwan area moved to the new defense line, the Pudong area was as calm as usual because of the solid defense. At 8:15 pm last night, the powerful artillery team in the rear launched a joint attack on the enemy's position again, triggering a fierce artillery battle. The enemy ships fired more densely at first, but after 8:45 pm, they gradually became sparse, and after 10:00 pm, the entire line became quiet. There was no movement until dawn. The reporter inspected various places this morning. The streets and markets were still unusually lively, and the shops were half-open, no different from the previous few days. There were many pedestrians on Pudong Avenue, with calm expressions, as if they did not know there was a war. After crossing the avenue and entering the countryside, although the villagers have been frightened by the enemy planes, they have recently learned how to avoid them and have become calm. The innocent children, in groups of three or five, were skipping rope in the warm sunshine, with no fear at all. The reporter ran into several friends on the way. These people knew that the new strategy in Zhabei was a necessary path in the process of resistance, and there was nothing to be surprised about. They also said that they were not prepared to move elsewhere, because our army and police regiment were able to do their duty, and there was no concern about the security in the war zone. Being in it, they were still satisfied both spiritually and materially, they said.

In Pudong, this morning, there were still two or three enemy planes circling around, constantly scouting, again and again, sometimes high into the clouds, sometimes flying very low. The mission they were carrying seemed to be scouting our positions and artillery positions, he said.

### No Change in the Northern Position of Nanxiang

The enemy bombarded the Nanxiang area yesterday. Our army's position was not damaged.

North of the railway line, our army is still firmly defending its original position. Except for the line of Shi Xiang Gong Temple, which was withdrawn to Dengqiao Town, there is no change in Xiaonanxiang Guangfu and other places. Since last night, the enemy army has concentrated its artillery fire on the area around Xiaonanxiang and Nanxiang, where our army is stationed. It has not stopped this morning. Our army's fortifications have not been damaged at all.

### Jiading Is Being Bombed Everywhere

Farmers in the countryside have been killed. The local order is still very well.

According to a guest from Jiading this morning, the county seat and various towns such as Nanxiang, Waigang, Fangtai, Huangdu, Jiyu, Xuhang, and Malu have been bombed by the enemy, destroying thousands of houses and killing thousands of people. This has been reported in the press many times. Recently, due to the fierce war in the front, enemy planes are increasingly rampant in the rear. In addition to the continuous bombing of the aforementioned cities and towns, as well as trains, cars, and ships related to transportation and the front line, enemy planes are also flying low and circling in the sky over various villages all day long. When they see places where people gather, they drop bombs. At Zhonggou in the west of Fangtai Town, eleven people were bombed to death the other day. At Shiziwei, one mile north of the town, more than 20 bombs were dropped on the 25th, killing more than 20 people. Other farmers who were harvesting rice and planting wheat in the fields were shot and wounded by machine guns, which could be heard everywhere. At night, they still fly around with illuminating bombs, but the local order is still very well. All sectors are working tirelessly in their respective positions to meet the purpose of long-term resistance.

### Enemy Ships Continue to Transport Wounded Soldiers Back to Japan

Yesterday morning (the 27th), the enemy transport ship Murndo, which was carrying small motorboats to Shanghai, and the transport ship Nachisan Maru, which was converted from a merchant ship, docked at the Qujiang Wharf. After unloading the motorboats, they drove inland to the Huishan Wharf. More than 2,000 wounded enemy soldiers were transported back to Japan.

### Our Army on the Pinghan Line Reaches Xingtai

The Enemy in the Zhang River Is Surrounded

[Zhengzhou] Our army on the Pinghan Line has made continuous progress, reaching Xingtai on the 27th. The enemy in the Zhang River retreated to the north of Baoding, with a force of about two divisions in the middle, and has been surrounded by us. The enemy in eastern Jin is also collapsing towards Pinghan (Special Telegram on the 27th).

### Enemy Ships on the Yangtze River Are in Action

(Changshu Correspondence) It is now the turn of autumn and winter, and the tide of the Yangtze River is in its usual small flood, so recently, the enemy often travels back and forth between the ports along the Yangtze River here, but the water level is low and shallow, and there is nowhere to apply its skills, so the Yangtze River is as calm as usual. However, there are often enemy ships anchored in the heart of the river, about six or seven miles outside the port of Hupu, seemingly preparing to wait for an opportunity to move. However, our river defense is solid, and it is difficult for the enemy to succeed. On the 22nd, three ships were berthed outside the port, and they left that night. The next morning, there was a heavy fog. Suddenly, two enemy ships approached the riverbank and fired five or six shots. Judging from the situation, it seemed that they were spying on our military situation. After we fired back, they retreated. On the morning of the 25th, another yellow ship was replaced and berthed in the same place, but there was no movement. Now, the residents along the river have become accustomed to this and are not afraid, he said.

### We Should Make Every Effort to Mediate Based on the Explicit Provisions of the Covenant

Wang Jie'an Cables Chairman Chiang

Wang Jie'an, a member of the National Economic Construction Commission, cabled Chairman Chiang in Nanjing yesterday, stating that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is about to be held. We should, based on the explicit provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Treaty, that "the Chinese Government undertakes to refrain from seeking special rights from foreign governments or nationals, or from establishing spheres of influence or acquiring superior rights in any designated area in China," instruct the three representatives, Gu, Guo, and Qian, to make every effort to mediate. In particular, we should sternly refute the Japanese side's distortion of the facts and deception of the international community, so as to value national integrity and safeguard sovereignty, he said.

### Belgium Invites Germany and Russia to Participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Japan's refusal to participate was expected. The conference work can be carried out quickly.

⊙ Brussels The Belgian government has decided to send invitations today to Germany and the Soviet Union, inviting them to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be held here on November 3. It is reported that this move is based on the consent of other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. It is widely believed that the postponement of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not delay the progress of the conference, because according to the original plan, the first meeting to be held on October 30 was only a formality, to decide to send invitations to Germany and the Soviet Union. After that, there will be a three-day recess to await replies from Russia and Germany. It is widely expected that when the conference officially opens on November 3, representatives of Germany and the Soviet Union will be able to attend. Japan's refusal to participate was expected, so it did not cause real disappointment. According to general opinion, if Italy, Germany and Portugal do not defend Japan and hinder the progress of the conference, then Japan's absence will enable the conference to carry out its work more quickly. As for the League of Nations Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue, which was originally scheduled to meet on November 5, it has now been indefinitely postponed and will be convened again after the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is over. (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram on the 28th)

[Washington] It is widely believed that President Roosevelt's announcement that the purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict, is now, because of Japan's refusal to participate in the conference, even if it is not impossible, it is in an extremely difficult position to achieve. The American isolationists originally did not approve of participating in foreign affairs, but after hearing President Roosevelt's statement that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was convened for the purpose of reconciliation, they no longer insisted on dissent. Now that the situation has changed, the United States may be drawn into the whirlpool and there is a risk of adopting a threatening plan. Seeing this situation, the isolationists may repeat the high-profile statement of rejecting foreign affairs. This is also what the US President is worried about. In fact, what steps are there other than reconciliation? This has not been considered, or it is expected that a kind of peaceful condemnation will be proposed in the future, such as recalling ambassadors. However, judging from the phenomenon, it is assumed that the government has not used such a policy of prior consideration to tie the hands of the US delegation (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram on the 28th).

### British House of Commons Debates the Case of Japanese Planes Killing British Soldiers

The British MP welcome retaliation. Pay attention to Japan fulfilling its promises.

[London] Conservative Party member Wardel first inquired in the House of Commons today about the case of British soldier McGovern being killed by a Japanese plane in Shanghai. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that at 3:30 pm on October 24, several British and American expatriates were walking outside the Public Concession, but the place was within the boundary defended by British soldiers. Suddenly, a Japanese plane opened fire on them with machine guns. They rushed to avoid the British soldier defense post within the defense line. Unexpectedly, the Japanese plane flew around for a week and then directly attacked the British soldier defense post with machine guns, three times. British soldier McGovern was injured and died shortly after. Three horses were also lost. Fortunately, the foreigners were unharmed. After that, the Japanese plane continued to strafe three other British soldier defense posts along the defense line, but there were no deaths or injuries. After the first attack, the British soldier defense post returned fire at the Japanese plane (the House of Commons cheered loudly upon hearing this). The British Commander-in-Chief immediately notified the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai of this inexcusable attack. The Japanese government subsequently took three steps: ㊀ Apologized to the British Ambassador to Japan, ㊁ Undertook to impose appropriate sanctions on those responsible after the investigation is completed, ㊂ Agreed to compensate for the losses of the victims. British Ambassador to Japan Craig has accepted the Japanese government's apology and declared to it that the British government believes that the British soldiers' retaliation was completely reasonable. In the future, if the same incident occurs, it will still be dealt with in this way (the crowd cheered), he said. Wardel also asked whether the compensation given to the family members of McGovern by the Japanese government was as appropriate as the British authorities considered. Eden replied that he thought so. Labor Party member Thorne inquired about the caliber of the guns used by the British soldiers. Eden replied that the British soldiers used light machine guns to return fire. Conservative Party member Ginstone asked the Foreign Secretary whether it was possible to investigate whether the Japanese government had punished those responsible. The Foreign Secretary replied that the steps taken by the Japanese government to fulfill its promise to appropriately punish those responsible have not yet been reported. He thought that Congress did not want him to continue to make statements about this matter at this time. In short, the British government certainly wanted to know and study the steps taken by the Japanese government, he said (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram on the 27th).

[London] The British Cabinet met yesterday for three and a half hours, chaired by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. According to well-informed sources, most of the time was spent discussing the situation in the Far East (Haitong Telegram on the 27th).

### The Chamber of Commerce Issues Certificates Free of Charge

More than 1,600 copies have been issued.

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issues certificates for commercial goods in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law to facilitate transportation. Since it was submitted to and approved by the Commander, all industries have felt it very convenient. Now, several hundred certificates are issued every day. From the start of the Shanghai war to the 27th of this month, 1,693 certificates have been issued. This certificate can be issued as long as the chairman of the relevant trade association guarantees that there are no smuggled goods or contraband goods. No fees are charged for member stores of the trade association. The procedures are extremely fast and there is no delay.

### Ships in the Suzhou River Are Moving West

Since our army announced the blockade of the north bank of the Suzhou River and the concession authorities warned the south bank, the number of ships in the river has decreased. Yesterday morning, we abandoned Dachang Zhabei, and the Suzhou River was inevitably controlled by the enemy army. Yesterday morning, all ships moved west, retreating to the whole Fanwangdu. Except for some tugboats and sampans owned by foreign merchants, those of our people's ships that could not sail out have all changed to berth on the south bank.

### Trivial Commentary

— Appearance

Japan has formally submitted a reply rejecting participation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. I had long expected that they would not participate. If they did participate and were severely condemned by representatives from many countries, even if you had the skill of Zhuge Liang debating the Confucian scholars, you would only turn red and leave. Therefore, the enemy authorities expressed their views in the form of a declaration. The wonderful sentence was "Japan promotes China's goodwill with a tolerant attitude. Unexpectedly, China lacks the ability to appreciate and has made provocative acts against Japan, causing Japan to have to defend itself and fight." After the people of the world listened to this, wouldn't they laugh their teeth off? Japan's acts of aggression since the September 18th Incident have been approaching step by step. The various crimes are countless. It also says that it promotes China's goodwill. We really dare not accept this kind of goodwill. Non-special countries with the best patience like me cannot appreciate it. I am afraid that no country can appreciate it. The enemy closed their eyes and can publish such words to the world. They are really shameless.

### The Front and the Rear (1)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shudi

㊀ Mr. Chen Duxiu in a Humble Alley

More than a month ago, Mr. Chen Duxiu, who was granted amnesty and released from prison with the eight characters "Deeply Patriotic, Profoundly Aware of Humiliation," soon arrived in Wuhan.

Although he was once the leader of the second-largest political party in China; although he represented the Communist Party ten years ago and issued a joint declaration with the Kuomintang leader; however, compared to practical political activities, his theoretical and academic stance is more likely to evoke deep memories and fervent attention from people across the country. From a political life perspective, it could be said that it was interrupted long before he went to prison, even within the political party to which he belonged. However, viewed as a theorist and thinker, even today, in the face of major events like China's War of Resistance against Japan, there is a need to listen to his arguments. Thinking this, the reporter, along with two gentlemen from this newspaper, boarded a ferry to Wuchang at a wharf in Hankou, heading on the road to visit him.

According to the agreed time from the previous day, we arrived in front of his residence. This place can be described as a kind of humble alley. The narrow alley was filled with a pungent, fishy odor, and the houses on both sides even had doors leaning precariously, exposing some tattered furniture inside to passersby. Number 26 was a relatively tidy Shikumen (stone-framed gate) which was also open. Entering the gate, there was a courtyard planted with some flowers and plants. A gravel path stretched out under our feet. Several doors were lined up along the side, and there wasn't a single person in the courtyard, which made the reporter hesitate. I had to shout loudly:

"Is anyone there? Is anyone there?"

It was unknown which door it was from, seemingly through several walls, a low, hoarse woman's voice came: "Who are you looking for? Who are you looking for?" — From the word "麼," it was known to be a local accent.

"Does Mr. Chen live here?"

"Someone named Chen? The one named Chen lives in the westernmost door."

Walking a few steps west along the gravel path, we immediately discovered that on the westernmost end of the road, there was a sign pasted on a door, with the words "Chen Residence," exactly what we were looking for.

The double doors were covered with green paint, without Spring Festival couplets. Instead, four rows of crimson-colored phrases resembling maxims were inlaid: "Speak good words," "Be a good person," "Do good deeds," "Read good books." Judging from the paint, these phrases seemed to have been there for a long time. However, it is meaningful that someone with an experience like Mr. Chen is now living in this house.

While knocking on the door, I held the business card with the address personally written by Mr. Chen in my hand, prepared to deal with the doorman or someone who might open the door. According to the reporter's experience, for the doorman of a celebrity, pulling out a business card with something written by his master can at least avoid him saying, "I'll go take a look for you," or even flatly saying, "He's not home."

The door opened quickly. To my surprise, it was Mr. Chen himself who opened the door. He was wearing a gray cloth long gown, standing hunched over by the door, constantly smiling and saying, "Please come in, please come in." His scholarly, half-bald head only had some gray hair on the back of his head; high eyebrows covering bright eyes, a slightly upturned short mustache, and most noticeably, his broad forehead, which revealed wisdom. — All of this presented the visitor with the unmistakable presence of an extraordinary person in an instant.

Stepping through the door, there was a small, rectangular courtyard, no more than three or four zhang (about 10-13 meters) long and only one zhang (about 3 meters) wide. It seemed to be covered with a large awning, making everything appear very dark, and with the drizzle, it became even more gloomy. One side of the courtyard was the front door we entered; one side was a wall; one side was a house with fan doors; and the westernmost side was Mr. Chen's reception room where he received us. Upon entering such a cramped, narrow, and damp place, we immediately felt as if we were being suffocated. As we walked towards the reception room, the two gentlemen from this newspaper who came with me reported their names to Mr. Chen. Walk, walk, walk... However, in just a few steps, we found ourselves already inside the reception room.

The reception room was also rectangular, with the door opening on a corner, and one window facing the dark courtyard. Although it was noon, I never clearly saw the face of the gentleman sitting with his back to the window. I can't remember if there were couplets or other decorations on the wall. Several chairs were placed haphazardly. Although a thick carpet was laid on the floor, its moldy condition immediately made one think of a storage room for old objects.

In addition to the three of us from the newspaper, there were three other gentlemen present with Mr. Chen. After taking our seats, I first asked: "Mr. Chen, do you have important matters to attend to?"

"No, just casual conversation."

Thinking about Mr. Chen's current situation, and considering our identities as news reporters, it was natural that Mr. Chen would have various concerns. I tried to restrain myself, thinking it best not to talk about overly specific issues, so as not to make Mr. Chen feel difficult to speak freely.

Because I heard Mr. Chen's speech the previous day, on the topic of "Significance of the War of Resistance," he told more than a thousand listeners: This war of resistance against Japan is by no means a simple venting of hatred towards Japan; rather, it is a war that the Chinese nation inevitably encounters on its path to building a modern nation. If China wants to build a free and equal modern nation, it must first liberate itself from its semi-colonial status, and the first thing it encounters is a decisive battle against imperialism. Therefore, he said, there are only two possible futures: If we win, the entire Chinese nation will be liberated and embark on the broad road to nation-building; if we lose, all 450 million compatriots will, without exception, become slaves of the imperialists.

Weeping in Despair with Nowhere to Go

Yesterday, from dawn until late evening, refugees were crowded along the north bank of the Suzhou River from Xiaoshadu to Fanwangdu, hoping to cross the river and reach the south bank. However, ferries were nowhere to be seen, and the garrison troops of the concession guarding the south bank did not allow them to cross. Countless refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, wept and wandered around, at a loss. With the special permission of the Italian military at the Fanwangdu Iron Bridge, no fewer than several thousand refugees from the north bank of the Huai River were able to cross the bridge and leave that bank. Refugees from Beixinjing, Zhoujiaqiao, Xuejiaku, Sanjingmiao, Gongjiazai, Chenjiadu, etc., fled along Bailinan Road towards the concession, the number of people so large that the road was blocked. Because the garrison troops of the concession did not allow refugees to enter the concession, men, women, old, and young stood crying, while others went south, hoping to find another way in. By late evening, tens of thousands of people stood at the crossroads. The people of western Shanghai had nowhere to go, no place to stand, and enemy planes flying overhead, machine guns firing everywhere. Looking up, they wept in despair.

War of Resistance Youth, Issue 24

### The Most Brilliant Victory Under All-Out War of Resistance

— Zhao Weizu

China has begun an all-out war of resistance against Japan to stop the insatiable desires of the violent Japanese. In history, China has been a nation that yearns for peace. Even before the incident broke out, we still hoped for peace. Chairman Chiang said, "...Peace has not reached despair, and we will never give up on peace..." But Japan's atrocities can no longer be discussed in terms of peace." Leaving aside the past, just from the "September 18th" incident to now, it has been a full six years. We surrendered the land of the four northeastern provinces with our hands tied and did not use force to deal with it, but only used diplomatic means to recover the lost territory. This kind of patience can be said to fully demonstrate the painstaking effort to seek peace. But the Japanese warlords cannot understand China's magnanimity and are becoming more and more aggressive. Not only have they occupied Tianjin and Peiping, but they also want to sweep across the entire North China. Everyone: They have already taken the four northeastern provinces, and now they want Peiping and Tianjin, and even North China. Of course, they want Central China, South China, and even the entire land of China. Could it be that I will easily surrender the entire China? Is it possible that an ancient power with five thousand years of culture, accounting for one-twelfth of the world's land, will be ruined in the hands of a small Japan? In fact, it will never happen. There are people of conscience, there is justice, and there is natural law. Therefore, China's prelude to the war of resistance against Japan began with the "August 13th" incident. We believe that as long as we can support the government, obey the leader, engage in all-out war of resistance, and persevere to the end, the final victory will surely be ours. In the past, people generally held the mistaken "fear of Japan" disease, believing that China could not go to war with Japan, and that China's military preparations were far inferior to those of Japan. Before the war in Shanghai, people speculated that Japanese planes would definitely pose a huge threat unrestrainedly in Shanghai's airspace. But as a result, not only did both sides' air forces confront each other, but China's flight technology was far superior to Japan's, completely changing international perceptions. The progress of the air force after six years of hard work is so great, and the other developments can be imagined. We prove, based on observations from all aspects, that under the all-out war of resistance, the final victory will definitely belong to us.

First, in terms of diplomacy, China occupies an absolute advantage. In the newspapers and magazines of various countries, general public opinion is sympathetic to China and condemns the Japanese warlords for their aggression. Furthermore, observing all of Japan's actions, they are detrimental to various countries, because as a result of Japan's aggression against China, the trade of various countries with China will suffer great losses. This time, Japan used warships to blockade Chinese seaports, which has no harm to China, but the commerce of foreigners with China has been greatly affected. Under such circumstances, Japan's diplomacy is bound to be isolated, but the international community values ​​power and profit and does not uphold justice. The United States is the country that we believe is most sympathetic, and this time its ban on arms exports can be said to be completely beneficial to Japan. The other countries can be imagined. Of course, we must rely on ourselves and not on others. We seek to have one less enemy, not to rely on others. This war of resistance has at least gained the sympathy of world public opinion and aroused resentment against Japan's cruel and inhumane behavior. In this regard, we have achieved the greatest victory in terms of national character and national prestige.

Second, in terms of economy, Japan feels even more dangerous. If we assume that their annual military expenditure is 2 million yuan, then Japan may not be able to sustain it for a year. Their country itself does not have sufficient reserves, and their national economic capacity relies entirely on trade with China. If this continues to increase, it will inevitably lead to internal collapse. At that time, they will have to resort to borrowing foreign debt, but they have no collateral, no credit, and no country is willing to lend unsecured funds. Therefore, their economic threat is a fatal wound. (To be continued)
