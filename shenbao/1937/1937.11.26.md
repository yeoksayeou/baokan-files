### Important Speech by Chairman Chiang

China Determined to Maintain the Policy of Resistance to the End, Hoping to Obtain Assistance Within the League of Nations Framework; First Requirement for Discussing Peace is Japanese Awareness

[Nanjing] When Chairman Chiang met with foreign journalists tonight, he stated, "We firmly believe that justice will ultimately triumph over might, and we will resist to the end, down to the last inch of land and the last man. This is our fixed policy." Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, entered the reception room with an air of confidence and determination, showing no sign of defeat or dejection. Chairman Chiang continued, "China intends to maintain its policy of determined resistance. We will defend Nanjing, but from a distance. The lives and property of foreigners will be protected. Rumors that Nanjing will be put to the torch if it is in danger of falling into enemy hands are just that: rumors." Regarding the possibility of a ceasefire, Chairman Chiang said that this was up to the Japanese side. Later, Chairman Chiang mentioned a box recently dropped by Japanese planes containing a letter. He said that the letter was unsigned and expressed a desire for an early ceasefire, stating that Japan did not want to impose harsh conditions but only sought China's cooperation in anti-communism. Such claims are contrary to the facts. When asked how peace talks could begin, Chairman Chiang said that it was not yet the time to discuss this. First, Japan must become aware [of the situation]. When asked whether he hoped for Soviet assistance, Chairman Chiang replied that he hoped for assistance as stipulated within the framework of the League of Nations. When the reporter further inquired whether China could hope for assistance from other sources, given that the Nine-Power Conference had not helped China, Chairman Chiang replied that he was confident that the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty would assist China. Without such assistance, all treaties would be rendered invalid, and actions that violate treaties would be rewarded. (Reuters, 25th)

### International Committee Proposes Establishing Nanjing Safety Zone

Boundaries Have Been Drawn; No Military Institutions to Be Established Within the Zone; Requesting Understanding and Cooperation from Chinese and Japanese Authorities in Protecting Refugees

[Nanjing] The official news regarding the Nanjing Safety Zone is as follows: The International Committee, composed of Danish, German, British, and American residents, has recently suggested to the Chinese and Japanese authorities the establishment of a Safety Zone to provide refuge for civilians in Nanjing and its vicinity during hostilities. The Committee will undertake to seek guarantees from the Chinese and Japanese authorities that no military institutions (including transportation) will be established within the Safety Zone, that no troops will be stationed there (except for police carrying pistols), and that no soldiers or officers will pass through. The Committee will inspect the Safety Zone and monitor the implementation of the aforementioned guarantees. The Committee proposes the following boundaries for the Safety Zone, which are deemed appropriate for the care of refugees. This zone is located within the western section of Nanjing, which Japanese planes have carefully respected during bombings. The boundaries of the zone are proposed as follows: The eastern boundary will be North Zhongshan Road, starting from Xin Jie Kou and ending at Shanxi Road; the northern boundary will be the line from Shanxi Road to Xikang Road; the western boundary will be Xikang Road to Hankou Road, then turning into Shanghai Road to the intersection of Hanzhong Road; the southern boundary will be Hanzhong Road, starting from the intersection of Shanghai Road and ending at the original starting point of Xin Jie Kou. These boundaries will be marked with white flags. The Safety Zone will take effect from the date the Committee notifies both authorities that their understanding has been reached and the preparations have been completed. The Committee hopes that the Japanese authorities, for humanitarian reasons, will respect the civilian nature of the Safety Zone. In order to complete the necessary negotiations with the Chinese authorities in the shortest possible time and to make full preparations for the resettlement of refugees, the Committee urges the Japanese authorities to respond promptly to this proposal and earnestly hopes that this request will receive satisfactory consideration. The above proposal was submitted to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai via the U.S. Embassy radio station on Monday night. The Chairman of the International Committee is Mr. Rabe, representative of the German firm Siemens. If the Safety Zone can be realized, the Committee is prepared to organize an office to handle the protection of refugees, estimated to number between 150,000 and 200,000. From a military point of view, the above location is the only acceptable one. (Reuters, 25th)

### Opinions in Japanese Newspapers

[Tokyo] The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun stated today that if a Safety Zone is established in Nanjing, it will greatly hinder the Japanese army's attack on Nanjing. There are fewer than 50 foreigners in Nanjing, and the proposed Safety Zone is adjacent to batteries and military installations. It is impossible for the Japanese army to attack Nanjing without affecting the Safety Zone. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the Nanjing Safety Zone is completely different from the Shanghai Nanshi Refugee Zone, and this matter must be decided by the Japanese military authorities attacking Nanjing.

### Unsettling Situation in Kinmen

Prices Soaring, Food Scarcity; Chinese Language to Be Abolished, Japanese Schools to Be Established; Residents of the County Fleeing Overseas

Xiamen Telegram: After the islands of Jinmen, Dadou, and Lieyu were occupied by the Japanese army, Jinmen County still has the two small islands of Dadeng and Xiaodeng under our control. The Jinmen County government was moved to Dadeng. Now, County Magistrate Kuang Han has been dismissed, detained, and investigated. The provincial government has appointed Zhou Bingyi to succeed him. Zhou arrived in Dadeng on the 15th to take office. In the past, there were no regular troops stationed in Jinmen County, only a small number of county security police and one team of guards. Now, a team from a certain division has been dispatched to Dadeng for deployment, which is very strict. The security team has been transferred to Xiaoti for training. The Jinmen Pseudo-Local Public Security Maintenance Association is currently managed by Wang Tingzhi, former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Xu Xingeng, Zhou Yong'an, Zhou Yongyuan, Chen Taiyi, and others, with Wang as the head. A local patrol team of twenty pseudo-police and a water patrol team of twenty fishing boats have been established to maintain public order. Later, Shi Tingzhi convened a meeting of the village chiefs, but only a few attended. Jinmen Island was divided into five zones each in the front and rear, and all have begun operations. Major Komura of the Japanese Marine Corps convened a meeting of the village chiefs at Houpu on the 11th, requiring the village chiefs to each provide two strong men to form a patrol team. He also declared on the spot that the Chinese language would be abolished and Japanese schools would be established in the short term. All boys and girls aged six to eight must attend school. In Jinmen, forced labor is used for construction projects without pay. Two thousand piculs of salt stored in the Jinmen Salt Bureau are distributed as compensation.

Jinmen is an island, and has no production. Everything relies on external supply. Even rice is insufficient and relies on external assistance. After the fall, traffic with Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou was blocked, and the source of supply was cut off. Prices soared, especially for rice and daily necessities. Rice rose from one dollar and twenty cents to one dollar and seventy or eighty cents per dou (old scale of fifteen and a half catties). The Japanese army announced that it would suppress prices and said that it would transport goods from Taiwan for assistance. However, only 3,000 bags of rice (three dou and two sheng per bag) were transported on the 10th. Since then, no other goods have been transported. Daily necessities are still surprisingly expensive and are becoming more expensive. It is often several times the original price and there is nowhere to buy them. Therefore, the people of Jinmen are constantly complaining.

From Jinmen, those who fled to Xiamen and Tongan numbered ten thousands and thousands, but the number has decreased greatly recently, only dozens of people a day. Generally, those who were able to raise money or had relatives to rely on have fled. There are still more than 30,000 people left, mostly farmers, workers, and fishermen. As for the refugees who fled to Xiamen and Tongan, 3,000 to 4,000 have gone to Nanyang in the past two weeks. The rest have relied on relatives in Xiamen and Tongan or have set up their own homes. As of recently, among the refugees who have been received and registered, there are still 3,300 in Xiamen and 547 in Tongan waiting to be settled. Plans are being made to move them to other counties for relief. However, among these, only more than 130 are so poor that they need the relief society to provide daily meals. Overseas Chinese from Jinmen in Nanyang have raised more than 30,000 yuan to help refugees from their hometown. There are millions of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, and most of them are from southern Fujian. Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen in southern Fujian are the hometowns of overseas Chinese. Therefore, since August, many people from southern Fujian have fled to Nanyang to avoid the war. In May, only dozens or hundreds of people returned to the country on each ship from Nanyang, at most twelve people. Now, each ship often carries 400 to 500 people, at most 700 people. In October, only 1,413 people returned from Nanyang, while 6,217 people went to Nanyang. After the Jinmen incident, more people have been going overseas in November. Up to now, each ship has more than 600 people, even those passing through Xiamen have more than 400. There are still more than 3,500 people waiting for ships in Xiamen, although Fujian has restricted the departure of strong men, the number has not decreased, and the price of tickets has soared. The price of third-class tickets to British-controlled areas, which was originally limited to 76 yuan, has risen to 140 to 150 yuan, with the most expensive reaching 170 to 180 yuan. Old passengers also pay 50 to 60 yuan. (November 19)

### Sharp Decrease in Trade at Xiamen Customs

Import and Export Taxes Decrease from 500,000 to 130,000

Xiamen Telegram: The average monthly customs revenue of Xiamen Customs in recent years has been more than 500,000 yuan. From January to July of this year, this average was maintained. After the full-scale Anti-Japanese War broke out, imports decreased sharply. In August, it was still more than 320,000 yuan, but in September it decreased sharply to more than 132,000 yuan. In October, a ten-cargo transit tax was levied. According to the customs announcement, the import and export tax revenue in October was 130,280 yuan and 95 cents, a decrease of more than 1,000 yuan compared to September. The import tax was 104,745 yuan and 42 cents, the export tax was 8,217 yuan and 51 cents, and the rest was additional taxes. The transit tax totaled 91,193 yuan and 67 cents. Therefore, the total tax revenue in October was 221,575 yuan and 62 cents. Xiamen is the largest import-surplus port in the country, and for nearly 70 years, it has been an import surplus. The largest import surplus was in 1930, with more than 29 million customs taels of imports and more than 4 million taels of exports, resulting in an import surplus of 25 million taels. Since then, trade has gradually declined, but in recent years, it has still maintained an annual import of 30 million yuan and an export of 4 million yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 26 million yuan. Therefore, although tax revenue has decreased sharply in the past two months, the actual decrease in imports is that the outflow of cash has decreased by 2 to 3 million yuan per month. (November 19)

### Water Level in Yichang Continues to Fall, Navigation Becomes Increasingly Difficult

Sunken Ship Discovered in Dongting Lake; Reduced Water Depth in Tianjin

The report of Shanghai shipping to Tianjin with increased shallow water surcharge etc. has already been published. A reporter from Datong News Agency now explores the conditions of reduced water depth in Tianjin and various places along the Yangtze River as follows.

Current Situation of Shallow Water in Tianjin

According to inquiries with the Tianjin Maritime Customs Service, the water volume of Tianjin Port was still 14 feet last month. However, ships longer than 300 feet have been banned from entering the port. Now, as the winter shallow water season has arrived, the water depth has been further reduced. Ships must use barges for loading and unloading. The increased shallow water surcharge by foreign shipping companies is a common practice in winter.

Drastic Drop in Middle Reaches of Yangtze River

The water volume of the Yangtze River has also decreased sharply recently, especially in the middle reaches. According to the report received by the Maritime Customs Service yesterday, the water level in Yichang has fallen to within 10 feet. The water level scale is only 9 feet and 8 inches, so navigation upstream from Hankou is quite difficult. In the lower reaches below Hankou, the water level has fallen more slowly and has not had any impact.

Sunken Ship Discovered in Dongting Lake

At the same time, in the section from Yuezhou to Changsha in the middle reaches, the Maritime Customs Service reported that a sunken civilian ship was discovered in Dongting Lake. Its location is near the No. 20 patrol ship in Dongting Lake, in a due west direction, and one chain away. It is hoped that various ships traveling in this section of the waterway will pay attention to avoiding it to prevent accidents.

### Our Wuxing Front Lines Shifted Backward; Fierce Fighting in Jiangyin and Wuxi

Zhoujingxiang Defense Line Has Been Saved; Our Reinforcements Advance from Changxing; Stalemate on Shanghai-Hangzhou Line in Xiashi

Due to clear weather yesterday, the front-line fighting became fiercer. The focus remained on the south bank of Taihu Lake and the left and right wings of the Jinpu Railway front lines. Our military defense in Jiangyin and Wuxi lines are unusually strong. On the railway front line, we still hold the Zhoujingxiang position east of Wuxi. Although it was fiercely attacked by the Japanese army yesterday and was once in a critical situation, it has been saved after reinforcements arrived. The artillery battle at Jiangyin Fortress was extremely fierce. After our army abandoned the Fushan Fort, a large number of Japanese warships concentrated on the river surface there, intensively bombarding the fortress, attempting to destroy our blockade line. Our army, defending the fortress, also returned fire. Our army's positions along the riverbank remained unmoved. Extremely fierce battles broke out in the suburbs of Wuxing (Huzhou) on the south bank of Taihu Lake yesterday. The main intention of the Japanese army was to capture Wuxing and then go straight to Changxing, threatening the rear of Wuxi and Jiangyin, and cutting off the Jinpu Railway and blocking the highway. The Japanese Marine Corps in Pingwang and Nanxun attacked our Jiapu Town in Changxing via the Taihu Lake waterway the day before. After a fierce attack by our army, many Japanese motorboats were hit by our artillery fire and sank into Taihu Lake. However, the Japanese army continued to send reinforcements, and the two sides were still fighting fiercely in Jiapu. Our army in Wuxing met the Japanese army advancing along the highway in the suburbs and fought fiercely. Our army bravely resisted without retreating. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but due to the fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army, the suburban position was once invaded. At the same time, due to the attack of the Japanese Marine Corps in Jiapu Town in the rear, our army retreated slightly from Wuxing. Although the county seat was breached, our army still held the near suburbs of the western city and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army. Our reinforcements have advanced from Changxing to assist in a counterattack towards Wuxing. Our military positions from the town of Xiashi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to the sea monitoring station of Zhapu have not changed. Yesterday, Japanese planes were very active due to the clear weather.

### Our Army Firmly Defends Jiangyin Fortress

[Nanjing] According to reliable sources, the line from Jiangyin Fortress to Wuxi is still firmly defended by the Chinese army. The rumor that the Japanese army has broken through this line is unreliable. It is said that many Japanese planes continuously bombed this line on a large scale on the 24th and bombed Jiangyin and Wuxi five or six times, but the Chinese army's positions remained unmoved. (Express News Agency, 25th)

The fighting in Jiangyin has been extremely fierce in recent days. The Japanese have launched a full-scale invasion with their naval, land, and air forces. Their naval fleet has entered straight into the sea from Fushan Port, with no less than sixty or seventy ships, concentrating their firepower to bombard Duanshan, east of Jiangyin, and firing on the Changyinsha coast. That sand is isolated in the river, shaped like an island. Our military has prepared long ago with deep trenches and high fortresses. The Jiangyin blockade line is also unusually strong. Japanese planes have bombed extensively for days, but our works have not been heavily damaged. A portion of the Japanese troops launched from Changshu to attack the front of Jiangyin. Our military has used the mountains to its advantage and defended the position relying on the rugged terrain. It can be fought for a long time.

### Wuxi Position is Gradually Stabilizing

Wuxi is one of the important strongholds on our left wing and is extremely important. Our defense line there is gradually stabilizing. Zhoujingxiang, east of Wuxi Station, was once broken through by the Japanese army, but has now been recovered by our reinforcements' brave attack. Moreover, our elite troops have arrived one after another, strengthening the position and advancing towards the Xicheng Highway. The Japanese mechanized troops were originally operating extensively in the highway area east of Wuxi, but since Zhoujingxiang was recovered by us, the Japanese army has been cautious and dare not rush around.

[Hankou] According to reliable Chinese sources, the Chinese army is currently preparing to resolutely resist on the banks of Taihu Lake. Large armies are currently gathering on both the north and south banks of Taihu Lake. (Reuters, 25th)

[Nanjing] According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army near Wuxing on the south bank of Taihu Lake has received a large number of reinforcements and has launched a fierce counterattack towards Wuxing, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. The Japanese army, which landed on the west bank of Taihu Lake in an attempt to invade Yixing, has retreated after being bravely resisted by the Chinese army. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting near Xiashi. (Express News Agency, 24th)

### Fierce Battle Unfolds Near Tongxiang

After occupying Jiaxing, the Japanese army advanced on multiple routes. Its main force not only attacked Wuxing along the Jiahu Highway but also advanced along the canal embankment, attempting to break through our line at Chongde and Shimen. Although our troops at Puyuan retreated slightly, they are currently holding their ground near Tongxiang, engaging in fierce battles. Shuanglin, in the Huzhou area, remains in our hands. On the Shanghai-Zhuji Road front, the Japanese army still does not dare to advance lightly. The outposts of the two armies are currently located between Xiaoshi and Wangdian railway stations. Regarding the battles along the Hangzhou Bay seawall on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, although there are rumors of Pinghu's fall, they have not been verified. Japanese warships in Hangzhou Bay have continuously shelled the Zhapu Fortress and Haiyan city, but our positions remain firm. The highway between Zhapu and Haiyan is also under our control, maintaining close contact with Xiaoshi and Tongxiang.

### Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Head to the Front Lines

A Japanese aircraft carrier carrying more than eighty seaplanes, which sailed from Japan to Shanghai, entered the Wusong Port at around 7:00 AM yesterday and berthed in front of the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. Some of the planes from the carrier took off yesterday to participate in the battle and bombing at the front. At around 5:00 PM, the planes returned to Yangshupu in groups. Yesterday, seven Japanese transport ships, including the Taiyuan Maru No. 3, Meiko Maru, Miyu Maru, Banko Maru, and Hamaue Maru, arrived in Shanghai one after another before 9:00 AM and berthed at Osaka Wharf, Beizhan, Huazhan, and Huangpu Wharf. They also transported 1,500 reinforcements, along with a large quantity of bombs, ammunition, food, and medical supplies, which are currently being unloaded. At around 10:00 AM, four transport ships refitted from Japanese merchant ships, fully loaded with approximately 7,000 to 8,000 reinforcements, sailed out of Shanghai, passing through the blockade line in the Nanshi area via the Huangpu River, heading towards Songjiang, apparently joining the front lines of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Road operation.

At around 4:00 PM yesterday, three Japanese planes flew very low over the Caowan ferry in western Shanghai. Within the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, Japanese steamships and towed civilian boats were busily transporting military supplies.

### Amidst World Peace and National Disappointment, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Announces Adjournment

Passing a Declaration Confirming Various International Principles - Our Representative Issues a Statement Recognizing it as an Annex to the Declaration - US, British, and French Representatives State They Remain Attentive to the Sino-Japanese War

Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference last night, amidst an atmosphere of disappointment, passed a report and declaration, advocating that China and Japan should cease hostile actions and adopt peaceful methods to seek a solution. It then adjourned indefinitely. Italy was the only country that still opposed it. Although Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, tried his best before the meeting to have the conference adopt amendments with active action, he ultimately felt it was futile. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference has only temporarily adjourned, but there is unlikely to be a prospect of reopening. The Italian representative, Macardi, said that this report has a hostile theory, so he expressed his opposition and said, "This meeting has failed, I said it long ago, and now it has indeed happened. We should disband it, not adjourn it." US Chief Representative Davis stated that, in terms of a fuller understanding of the difficulties and possibilities of the situation, the outcome of this meeting was gainful and without loss. "Today's adjournment does not mean that the difficult problems we have discussed will be put aside, nor does it mean that our attention to resolving the Far Eastern conflict will be lessened. Instead, it will make our continued active efforts to end hostilities and establish a constructive solution even more important." British representative Cranborne spoke, agreeing with Davis's argument, saying that the British government will have extremely close contact with other governments during the adjournment period in order to utilize any opportunity to achieve the purpose of convening this meeting. "We are not unaware of the situation that the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, has clearly and realistically stated to this conference, but I believe that the Chinese delegation will be able to understand the difficulties encountered by this conference," he said. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed its second declaration at 5:20 PM today and decided to postpone the meeting indefinitely. Representatives of the relevant countries had previously met twice for very short periods of time. At that time, Chinese Chief Representative Gu Weijun had not yet received instructions from his government. Most of the other countries' representatives wanted to postpone the meeting as soon as possible, so they strongly urged Mr. Gu to accept the declaration. Mr. Gu finally expressed his agreement in the name of the Chinese government, and the postponement was decided.

The French representative, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tedeschi, said, "As the US representative said, this meeting is difficult to declare postponed, but the governments of the participating countries should still consult each other in order to find the most effective procedures to restore peace in the Far East. We have deep sympathy for the tragedies that China has encountered and hope that it will get out of this situation in a short period of time. France is happy to participate in any steps that can lead to a solution to the current dispute."

New Zealand representative Jordan and Conference Chairman Spaak spoke successively, all saying that the compromise spirit of the Chinese delegation was particularly commendable. Chinese representative Gu Weijun immediately replied that the declaration should be copied and sent to the member states of the League of Nations. Spaak then delivered a speech and announced the indefinite postponement of the meeting. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

### General Assembly Issues Declaration

Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference has just passed a document today called the "Report of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference." The report is divided into two parts, about sixty pages in length. The first part summarizes the progress of the conference and reiterates the main principles and resolutions previously passed. The second part is the declaration, which is divided into twelve paragraphs, with the main points as follows:

(1) Among the various international treaties, the Nine-Power Treaty is extremely important, containing several principles and limitations used to define the mutual relations between the signatory countries. In accordance with these principles and limitations, all signatory countries solemnly promised to respect the sovereignty of other countries, not to surpass other countries politically or economically, and not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

(2) This treaty has already formed a mechanism that can be used to maintain international peace and security without the use of force. The mutual relations between nations must be based on this mechanism in order to achieve trust and mutual benefit in commerce and finance.

(3) If countries violate the above-mentioned principles, then the entire international organization based on current treaty obligations will inevitably be destroyed, and countries will have no choice but to expand their armaments in order to seek security. As a result, there will inevitably be a general feeling of unease among nations. In particular, these principles are the foundation of civilizational progress, which no one can deny, and their effectiveness cannot be destroyed by force. This can be asserted.

(4) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference, as stated in the invitations from various governments, was convened in accordance with the above-mentioned principles. Its purpose is to discuss the situation in the Far East in accordance with Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty and to seek a solution to the regrettable current dispute in a friendly manner.

(5) Since the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 3rd of this month, it has made continuous efforts to promote mediation work and has tried to invite the Japanese government to cooperate in order to stop the war and reach an agreement.

(6) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is convinced that no international dispute can achieve a fair and lasting solution through the use of force. Regarding the dispute between China and Japan, the countries concerned have proposed mediation to both parties in order to quickly stop the war and establish a general and lasting solution. The conference still believes that it is in the interests of both parties to accept this proposal. As for direct negotiations between the two parties, it is difficult to establish a satisfactory solution. On the contrary, only after mutual consultation with the major countries concerned can a fair and lasting agreement be established and accepted by both parties.

(7) The principles contained in the Nine-Power Treaty are basic principles that must be respected in order to maintain world peace and promote an orderly national and international life. This level should be reaffirmed.

(8) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference believes that if the war between China and Japan can be stopped quickly, it will not only be in the real interests of those countries, but also beneficial to all countries in the world. On the contrary, if the war continues for one day, the difficulty of resolving the dispute will increase.

(9) Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference earnestly suggests to both parties to stop the war and switch to peaceful procedures.

(10) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference also believes that all peaceful and fair solutions should not be ignored or omitted.

(11) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference adheres to the above-mentioned principles. However, in order for the governments of the participating countries to have sufficient time to exchange opinions and continue to seek peaceful solutions, it believes that temporarily adjourning the meeting is a wise move. In particular, the participating countries or the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, or those who have special interests in the Far East, or are directly affected by the current situation and developments there, should still pay attention to the current dispute. Among them, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, in accordance with the terms contained in the treaty, especially Articles 1 and 7, have clearly accepted a policy of stabilizing the situation in the Far East, and are currently still under this obligation.

(12) After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is postponed, the chairman or two member states may convene the meeting again if they believe that continuing the meeting is beneficial. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

### Our Representative's Statement

Brussels: After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed the declaration today, Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Gu Weijun immediately read a statement accepting the declaration. The statement said that several points in the original text of the declaration have been revised or rectified, which the Chinese delegation will record. The revised draft of the declaration and the original text can both reaffirm some general principles that China has always accepted, which is a matter of course. However, in terms of the development of the Far Eastern dispute, the Chinese delegation believes that simply reaffirming these principles is not enough to cope with the serious situation, and it cannot regard the results obtained by the conference as satisfactory. In addition, the Chinese delegation had previously put forward various suggestions, especially the suggestions put forward on the 22nd of this month, hoping that the conference could take some positive and concrete measures to assist China. The conference failed to consider it, and the Chinese delegation deeply regretted it, and deeply believed that concerted action by the countries concerned was necessary to deal with Japanese aggression and restore peace in the Far East. Although it has been decided to postpone the meeting indefinitely, it is temporary in nature, so that the governments of the countries concerned can exchange opinions and, in accordance with the principles contained in the Nine-Power Treaty and the goals of the county, continue to seek all peaceful means to resolve the dispute between China and Japan. The Chinese delegation will also record this, but in order to make this new effort easier to succeed, the Chinese delegation deeply believes that the countries concerned must quickly take concerted action to actively assist China, and at the same time impose various restrictions on the aggressor country. In order to express the spirit of solidarity and unity, the Chinese delegation hereby accepts this declaration and requests the conference to record this statement and use it as an attachment to the declaration. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

### Chairman Expresses Emotion

Brussels: After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference resolved to postpone the meeting indefinitely, Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, delivered a speech, saying, "Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun told us that he felt disappointed when he left the meeting. Most of the representatives of the participating countries also felt the same way, because we failed to complete the task we undertook, which was to restore peace in the Far East in a peaceful manner, so we cannot help but feel disappointed. However, we are not discouraged by this. Looking at the speeches made by US Chief Representative Davis and French Representative Tedeschi a while ago, it is enough to prove that no one has given up their efforts, and hundreds of millions of people around the world have also agreed to reaffirm and decided to adhere to certain important principles, such as the love of peace and respect for treaties. In my personal opinion, I have always believed that these principles will win the final victory." (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

Brussels: The content of the report of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has been slightly revised. Australian representative Bruce proposed that the government's declaration should be included in the report. Our representative Gu Weijun requested that, in order to show impartiality, the Chinese government's declaration of November 6 should also be included. It was then decided that the name of the report would be "Report of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on November 24." Before returning to their posts, representatives Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, Qian Tai, and others will visit representatives of various countries separately tomorrow to discuss the future of the conference. Gu Weijun and Chen Gongbo will go to Paris tomorrow, Guo Taiqi will return to London on the evening of the 25th, and Hu Shize will return to Geneva on the morning of the 25th. (Special dispatch on the 24th)

Brussels: The Chinese representative Gu Weijun and his party are preparing to pack their luggage today and return to their post in Paris. The representatives of various countries admire Ambassador Gu for fighting for justice without being humble or arrogant, and shake hands with him to pay their respects. (National Telegraph on the 25th)

[Hankou] People from all walks of life in China here are quite disappointed to hear that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has adjourned without any results. The Chinese government did not have much hope for this conference, but at this time there is a rumor that the United Kingdom and the United States have failed to reach a consensus on the issue of cooperation in the Far East, which is particularly disappointing. Public opinion generally believes that external assistance is impossible, and China can only gather all its strength to cope with a protracted war. At the same time, the wartime government is gradually taking shape, and only important personnel are left in various government agencies to handle important official matters.

### Difficult Situation in the Shanghai Concession

British and American Governments Assist the Municipal Council in Negotiations - Japanese Demands for Negotiations Have Not Yet Yielded Results

[London] The House of Commons met yesterday, and many members questioned Foreign Secretary Eden about the recent situation in the Shanghai International Settlement. The Foreign Secretary replied, "It is a definite and unpleasant fact that the International Settlement is in a very difficult situation today." The Foreign Secretary said that he had heard that the Japanese authorities were discussing with the Municipal Council authorities matters such as curbing anti-Japanese activities in the Settlement and disbanding Chinese government agencies. This discussion is still in progress, and the results cannot be said yet. British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and the British authorities in Shanghai have repeatedly reported to the Japanese government, which has promised to respect the rights of foreigners in China and will continue to do so for as long as the situation requires. Conservative Party member Morley asked whether the British government intends to do its best to help the Shanghai Municipal Council resist the Japanese demands. The Foreign Secretary replied, "Yes, the government has already helped." Communist Party member Gallacher then asked, "Does the Foreign Secretary's previous answer mean that Japan is now continuing to break its promises?" The Foreign Secretary replied that Gallacher could draw any conclusions he liked. Labour Party member Fletcher asked whether the International Settlement was land belonging to the Chinese government and the governments concerned, or whether it was ceded, or whether it was only under international administration in fact. The Foreign Secretary replied that this question was completely different from the written question. Labour Party member Wedgwood then spoke, saying that the matter was quite urgent because the Japanese authorities were now forcibly preventing the British from entering their own properties in and around Shanghai. He also asked whether the Foreign Secretary would inform the House in detail of the above situation this Friday. The Foreign Secretary replied that he was willing to answer any written questions raised by the members at any time. The Foreign Secretary then answered Morley's question, saying that on November 1, the Japanese authorities replied to the joint note submitted by the Consuls-General of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Germany in Shanghai, allowing nationals to freely enter the parts of the Settlement occupied by the Japanese army to inspect their own properties and promising to eliminate various restrictions as soon as possible. However, according to recent news, British merchants in Shanghai have not yet regained the freedom to enter their warehouses and other properties in Hongkou and Yangshupu. It is heard that the Japanese military authorities have stated that the two districts are not yet safe, so the British government has negotiated with the Japanese government on this matter and will continue to do so. Labour Party member Noel-Baker asked, "Do we know that the Japanese army occupied Shanghai without us making any protests?" The Foreign Secretary replied, "Mr. Noel-Baker does not know this. When the war broke out, the Japanese army was on the same footing as the troops of other countries in the Settlement. As far as he knew, the Japanese army did not pass through the Settlement south of the Suzhou Creek." The Foreign Secretary concluded by saying, "The International Settlement is not only in the interests of the United Kingdom, and the International Settlement is in a very difficult situation today, which is a definite and unpleasant fact." (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)

[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Japan Craigie spoke with Foreign Minister Hirota for half an hour today. It is heard that it was related to the situation in Shanghai, but the details are unknown. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

### Various Countries Supply China with Arms

British Foreign Secretary Says the Method is Proper, But it is Not Necessary to Announce it

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden said in the House of Commons today that the methods of supplying China with arms by various countries will not be announced. Liberal Party member Mond asked whether it was appropriate for the member states of the League of Nations to supply China with arms at this time in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on October 6. Eden replied, "Of course it is appropriate." (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### British House of Commons Inquires About North China Customs Duties

Temporarily Stored in Yokohama Specie Bank

[London] Labour Party member Henderson asked in the House of Commons today whether the Japanese authorities are still retaining the customs duties of North China. To what extent are the funds collected by the Japanese authorities used to pay foreign debt obligations? Foreign Secretary Eden replied that, as far as he knew, the customs duties collected in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao were deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank in the name of the Inspector General of Customs. Although there were payments, they were not on time and were insufficient. Although Eden mentioned the Japanese seizure of customs patrol boats for military use, the government had issued instructions to the ambassador to Japan because of this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden answered a question from Labour Party member McEntee in the House of Commons today, saying that as far as he knew, the Japanese side had not requested the issuance of Manchurian reclamation loans in the United Kingdom, and he had no knowledge of the attitude of other countries on this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### Random Notes from Lieshan

— Feng Lieshan

British Newspapers and German Newspapers

Mr. Lockner, the Berlin bureau chief of the Associated Press of America, is a prominent figure among the reporters stationed in Germany. One day, the German "Journalists' Association" invited him to give a speech on the topic of how foreign correspondents gather news. A large number of people attended that day, and some of them were important figures in the National Socialist Party. Before he gave his speech, he told reporters in private that he did not want to miss this opportunity and planned to say a few words he wanted to say. Sure enough, there was such a passage in his speech: "...We, as foreign correspondents, are busy in our daily lives. However, we are much more comfortable now as reporters in Germany than before. In the past, we had to read one or two dozen newspapers every day to be able to report on the news of the day. Now, one newspaper a day can handle it. As a result, we have saved a lot of time..." When he said this, the audience responded with knowing smiles. Naturally, only foreign reporters dared to say such public witticisms. If a German reporter was ignorant of current affairs and made some kind of criticism of Propaganda Minister Goebbels' masterpiece—making German newspapers uniform—he would be just asking for trouble.

Half a year ago, an acquaintance saw my room full of British newspapers and found it a bit strange, because in the past, when I was in Germany, my room was always kept very clean. I said, "This is easy to explain. Since the source of news in Germany is not in the newspapers, we save the time we spend reading newspapers and do other things. For example, more contact with the German people can also help us understand the current situation in Germany. The situation in England is different. The British have a habit of not talking, and some people think this is a sign of their profundity, while others think it is precisely because they have nothing to say. In short, it seems to take some effort to get some news out of the British. However, things are so coincidental that the things that British people usually don't want to say are published in British newspapers every day. From the most right-wing Morning Post to the most left-wing Daily Worker, it covers everything. As long as we read one or two dozen British newspapers every day and synthesize the arguments from all sides, it is not difficult to guess some of the inside story... Reading newspapers in England is a happy thing, but at the same time, it is a bit of a "last resort"!..."

Logically speaking, British reporters are British, so why are there such exceptions? On the one hand, it is due to the development of the British news industry. On the other hand, it is said that it is because British reporters are generally good at drinking. Articles in British newspapers are almost all products of their drinking glasses. In the eyes of the British, British reporters almost all have the demeanor of the Chinese poet Li Bai. I remember once at a banquet, just because I drank a little less wine, it aroused the curiosity of several British reporters. At that time, I explained, "This is to be excused, because I am not a British reporter"!

When Will the Japanese Tell the Truth?

Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, a reporter from a certain country specifically went to visit the Japanese military attaché in that country to inquire about the situation in the Far East. The central question of the conversation was whether war would break out between China and Japan in the near future. The military attaché replied: "What? Japan is preparing for war? The Japanese want war? That's just a set of rumors! We have always been a peace-loving nation. Isn't war the most meaningless thing?..."

The reporter found it funny at the time and asked, "After your country obtained Manchuria, what methods do you intend to use to protect it?"

The military attaché said: "By peaceful means. The Far East issue is fundamentally an economic issue. Japan has never advocated a policy of force and only hopes to survive... How terrible is war! We Japanese have never thought about this! War, 'no'! A thousand 'no's'..."

When this reporter described this, he asked the people present, when will the Japanese tell the truth?

The following is another reporter's story about his encounters with a Japanese reporter.

According to him, he met a Japanese reporter in London two years ago. They had a close relationship, and they met two or three times a week. When this Japanese reporter came to see him, he would sit for two or three hours. This Japanese reporter did not like to talk much, and most of the time he sat on the "sofa" chair and read his newspapers and magazines alone. However, he admitted that this Japanese reporter was a good person, so they got along well. One day, the London Foreign Correspondents Association had a banquet, and he took an acquaintance girl with him. At the banquet, he introduced the girl to the Japanese reporter as usual. A few minutes later, the Japanese reporter, probably drunk, praised the girl in front of everyone, saying that she was really cute. Then he asked her for her address and phone number. Finally, he even asked her to go out to dinner with him, saying that he had his own car, which finally made the girl blush, and even the people present felt embarrassed.

The next morning, the Japanese reporter felt that something had happened and ran to apologize to his friend, saying that he had made a fool of himself because he was drunk. "Normally," the Japanese reporter said, "I don't say what I think in my heart, and what I say is not what I think. Last night, I drank a little too much, so I unknowingly revealed the truth." The Japanese reporter's apology did not seem to get the other party's sympathy. Europeans are Europeans after all. The reporter believed that the Japanese reporter had deceived his friendship, and had never told him the truth in the past.

"So," he said, "at least the Japanese will tell the truth after drinking."

Chinese and Japanese

In Europe, we are often mistaken for Japanese. Europeans have a very simple way of distinguishing between Chinese and Japanese people, that is, people who are dressed neatly are Japanese, and the opposite is Chinese. This convenient method naturally causes them to make mistakes often. After we explain, they always come up with a stock apology: I really can't tell the difference, please don't take offense. Naturally, when the average European can really tell the difference between who is Chinese and who is Japanese, we will probably also know who is English and who is Scottish.

What is the difference between Chinese and Japanese people? Some people say that Japanese people are shorter. However, this standard is also difficult for Europeans to see, because many overseas South Chinese are not much taller than Japanese people in terms of height.

According to an acquaintance's usual explanation to Europeans, he put forward two points: first, Japanese people have yellower skin than Chinese people. Japanese women wearing makeup are naturally an exception. Second, Japanese people's legs are short and a little curved because they don't use chairs and "sit cross-legged" every day. Of course, their posture is not as natural as Chinese or Europeans when walking on the street. His statement seems to have helped Europeans a lot. It is said that someone has adopted his identification method, and the results have been quite satisfactory.

A German doctor once asked a Japanese doctor about this question. According to the Japanese doctor's reply, it is easy to distinguish between Chinese and Japanese people. He said: The first characteristic is that Japanese people usually wear glasses, but Chinese people don't. The second characteristic is that most Japanese people carry a camera with them, but Chinese people don't. As for the third characteristic, when Japanese people meet people, the first question they ask is: Where is the toilet?...

This is what the Japanese doctor said. The results of the experiment are naturally impossible to verify. However, we believe that there will be Chinese people who wear glasses, and there will be Chinese people who carry cameras, but there will probably be no Chinese people who ask: Where is the toilet? as the first thing they say to people.

If this Japanese doctor's observation is correct, perhaps Europeans can save a lot of trouble when they encounter us in the future.

### The London Times Comments that Failure May Be Temporary

[London] The Times said in an editorial today that the report passed by the League of Nations' Committee of Twenty-Three on October 5 at least gave hope that League of Nations member states might each assist China. The declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has dashed this hope. The Chinese representative expressed disappointment at the pitiful result of this international conference, which is sincere. However, we do not see that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference could have achieved anything else. What we must recognize is that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference had more prospects for failure than success from the beginning. The opening of the conference coincided with the echo of US President Roosevelt's great speech in Chicago not yet fading. Expectations were very high at that time, but the result is so disappointing. Each country looks at each other, and none feels that it can take the lead in launching a slightly more active policy. In this environment, each country is bound by harsh realities. However, this kind of constraint may ultimately be beneficial, because it did not pass a resolution to close the door to mediation while Japan was in its current state of arrogance. The first joint attempt to promote peace in the Far East has now failed. This may be temporary, but the British government can have a clear conscience about this failure. The British government is prepared to actively pursue constructive proposals with other countries to achieve its goals. However, past experience has clearly shown that it is useless to initiate the maintenance of international treaties with empty words of support without concrete guarantees. Without such guarantees, the British government can never allow its country to adopt actions that will ultimately become farcical. Regardless, the British government will continue to consult with like-minded countries to seek the early realization of peace in the Far East. (Reuters, 25th)

[London] The Times also said that Japan is said to be willing to have Britain, America, or Germany mediate. Therefore, the moderate attitude adopted by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference may not be bad. In short, the declaration passed by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference does not hinder the continuation of mediation by a committee with a smaller scope of organization among the related countries. (Central News Agency, Havas, 25th)

### The Grand Meeting in the Belgian Capital is Over, and Diplomatic Activities in Europe and America are Frequent

The American Ambassador to Russia Returns Home for Christmas; The Content of the British Lord Privy Seal's Visit to Germany is Confidential; Czechoslovakia Expresses Satisfaction with Talks with Britain and France

[Moscow] The American Ambassador to Russia, Davies, announced today that he intends to return home for a visit, and is scheduled to return to his post in January of next year. Aside from returning home to reunite with his family and celebrate Christmas, there is no other purpose. Rumors that he will succeed Bingham as the Ambassador to Britain are also inaccurate. (25th National Telegram)

[London] Regarding the rumor that the American representative, Davies, will come to England at the end of this week, although it has not been confirmed by the local authorities, political figures believe that the American representative will come to England in a private capacity, hoping to learn the truth about the talks between the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax and Hitler, and report it to President Roosevelt. The American Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, is currently in the United States due to illness. (25th Haitong Telegram)

⊙Brussels  Britain invited diplomats from the United States and France to hold a meeting in London on November 29th and 30th. The United States specially appointed Ambassador Davies, who has now declined to attend due to "personal matters" requiring him to return home. (24th National Telegram)

⊙Brussels It is rumored that after the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is indefinitely postponed, the chief American representative, Davies, will go to London and then take a ship back home on the 2nd of next month. Members of the American delegation have denied this, saying that before returning home, Davies may go to Paris, but it will be in a private capacity. (24th Havas Telegram)

[Washington] Authoritative observers stated today that the failure of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will temporarily suspend the United States' mobilization of world opinion and its diplomatic policies toward aggressor nations. The people mostly maintain a neutral attitude, fearing involvement in war, so the authorities will also have to slightly change their policies. Congress previously believed that the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty could eliminate the disputes in the Far East, but by the time the Brussels Conference opened, Congress was very indifferent. At the same time, domestic public opinion was not as enthusiastic as when President Roosevelt gave his Chicago speech. After Congress held a special meeting, it criticized the Nine-Power Conference and further demanded a continuation of the isolationist policy. Now, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull still advocate international cooperation, and in order to implement this proposal, they plan to widely promote it to educate the public. (24th National Telegram)

[London] Regarding the British Lord Privy Seal Lord Halifax's trip to Berlin, Prime Minister Chamberlain recently declared in the House of Commons that the Lord's trip was purely private in nature, but it was agreed in advance to go to Berchtesgaden on the 19th of this month to meet with the German leader Hitler. As for the results of the talks between Lord Halifax and the German authorities, because both parties have agreed to keep them secret, the French government has not yet been notified. (24th Havas Telegram)

[Berlin] The political figures here welcomed the British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons regarding the Lord Privy Seal Halifax. It is said that the Prime Minister stated that the British newspapers' comments on this trip were quite erroneous. It is claimed that the meeting between Halifax and Hitler was only an exchange of views, and both sides maintained a reserved attitude, so there were absolutely no concrete results. German policy has already been seen in Hitler's speech, and there will be no change. (25th Haitong Telegram)

[London] Liberal Party member Mandel stated in the House of Commons today that it is rumored that the British government is now considering allowing Germany to act freely in Austria and Czechoslovakia, in exchange for Germany agreeing not to make any colonial demands within six years. If this statement has no basis, the Foreign Secretary should make a clear statement. However, Mandel's move was dissuaded by the Speaker. (24th Reuters Telegram)

[London] Regarding the content of the talks between the Lord Privy Seal Halifax and the German authorities, since Prime Minister Chamberlain refused to explain it to the House of Commons, opposition Liberal Party, Labour Party, and even some members of the Conservative Party have expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the demands made by Germany are unknown to the outside world. European countries may gradually have the impression that Germany has ambitions for Central Europe, and Britain may also agree to it. Therefore, the general public hopes that the truth will be revealed after the French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos come to London on the 28th of this month. Also, when the House of Commons met yesterday, Liberal Party member Mandel advocated starting a debate. Although the Labour Party members agreed, they ultimately agreed to postpone the discussion until after the French Prime Minister Chautemps and his party came to England. In short, Prime Minister Chamberlain's prestige has already been affected. Some Conservative Party figures have even expressed that Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden are in fact implementing a dual foreign policy, and the current diplomatic situation is already棘手(difficult to handle), and now it is even more chaotic. (25th Havas Telegram)

[Paris] The newspapers have been commenting on the matter that Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos are scheduled to go to London on the evening of the 28th of this month and hold talks with the British authorities on the 29th and 30th of this month. Among them, the right-wing Paris Echo stated, "This diplomatic talk may become the most important talk since the end of the European War. Up to now, Britain and France have been able to unite to face Germany. Even on the issue of Central Europe, Britain and France do not intend to abandon the principle of collective security. France does not intend to abandon the mutual assistance agreements it has signed with certain countries in the past sixteen years. It seems that the colonial issue will occupy an important part of the talks between the British and French authorities." The Radical Socialist Party's Business Report stated, "The British government will seek the French government's consent to determine whether the talks between Britain and Germany can continue. German leader Hitler is said to have written to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that he was not completely satisfied with the talks he had with the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax. That is, the alliance between Britain and France is also seen as strong and close. Germany will not withdraw Italy and take action. The United States, Britain and France may one day economically oppress our two countries, and we are considering how to deal with it." The Socialist Party's People's Report stated that the proposals made by Germany, "If they are as reported by the newspapers, then they are unacceptable to France. If they are the result of the talks between the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax and the German leader Hitler, then Halifax's trip can be said to have been a complete failure, and the British government can only admit it." (25th Havas Telegram)

[London] The "Yorkshire Post," known as Foreign Secretary Eden's mouthpiece, recently stated, "The issues that French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos will discuss with key British political figures after coming to England in the coming days are not only the results of the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax's visit to Germany, but also the situation in Spain, the Far East, and the Mediterranean. It is also possible that the South African issue will be discussed together. In addition, if there is time, the negotiations on the British-American trade agreement will also be discussed, because the British-American trade agreement negotiations are closely related to the joint economic action of Britain, the United States, and France. Also, French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos are scheduled to arrive here on the morning of the 29th, led by the Director of Political Affairs of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Massigli, and will immediately begin exchanging views with British politicians. At noon on the 29th, Prime Minister Chamberlain will host a banquet for the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The talks will continue in the afternoon, and in the evening, Foreign Secretary Eden will host a banquet at his residence. At noon on the 30th, the Foreign Office will host a banquet, and in the afternoon or evening, the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will depart to return home." (25th Havas Telegram)

[London] Although political figures here unanimously believe that the diplomatic situation has shown progress due to Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech and the upcoming visit of French politicians to England, newspapers here believe that it is still not appropriate to be too optimistic at this time, because the issues being discussed are very important and complex in nature, and it is initially impossible to guarantee that a solution can be reached. The Times stated that the British-French talks are a natural result of British policy, because British policy always seeks to understand the views of other countries. This kind of British policy will never consider that it has the intention of hurting the German-Italian axis. If there is such a deliberate attempt, it is a most foolish strategy and will definitely fail. Now all difficulties can only be resolved through trust and goodwill. London is fully aware of Germany's demand for equal rights and will make it the goal of negotiations. (25th Haitong Telegram)

⊙Prague Regarding the French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos' visit to London, the general public here has expressed satisfaction, believing that this is another indication of close cooperation between Britain and France, which is very beneficial to European peace. As for the news published yesterday by the British Manchester Guardian, which stated that Germany had made a request advocating that Czechoslovakia form a federal government according to the example of Switzerland, it is unbelievable and difficult to believe. In short, if Germany can guarantee Czechoslovakia's independence in its domestic and foreign affairs, Czechoslovakia is willing to establish an understanding with it. (25th Havas Telegram)

### The League of Nations Prepares to Continue Handling the Sino-Japanese Case

[Geneva] After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference declared an indefinite postponement, well-informed sources here still believe that the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem may hold a meeting around the 10th of next month to continue handling the dispute between China and Japan. People close to the League of Nations are deeply disappointed with the outcome of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, believing that this further proves that any diplomatic action taken outside the League of Nations' structure is bound to fail. The urgent task is to convene the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem as soon as possible. Regarding this point, the representatives of the major powers unanimously stated at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference that they should continue to find ways to end the war between China and Japan, meaning that all subsequent negotiations should be conducted by the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem. However, when the committee will convene a meeting will depend on the wishes of the Chinese government. Presumably, the Chinese government will consult with the British and French governments before requesting to convene a meeting. As for the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem, the Foreign Minister of Latvia, Menders, is currently in Paris holding talks with the French Foreign Minister Delbos. The Chinese Permanent Representative to the League of Nations, the Minister to Switzerland, Hu Shih-tse, is also in this country's capital. The French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos are scheduled to go to London on the evening of the 28th of this month to hold talks with the British authorities. Therefore, the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem will not be convened for a meeting before Chautemps and Delbos return home. (25th Havas Telegram)

### Britain and the United States Prepare to Resolve War Debts

Obstacles to Repaying in Installments

[London] Some figures in the financial community here recently declared that after the British-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement is established in the future, the two countries should sign an agreement to resolve the war debt issue with the United States. (25th Havas Telegram)

[London] The London Daily Mail reported today that Britain will revise the 1922 repayment plan for its war debts to the United States and then repay them in installments. It is claimed that a war debt conference will be held once the proposed British-American trade agreement is signed. The trade agreement negotiations have actually been completed, and the war debt conference will only be a formality. Presumably, the United States will initially demand full repayment, but may make slight concessions later. As for which country's currency will be used for repayment, it has not yet been decided. The two countries will not attempt to link currencies in any way, but because Britain, France, and the United States have established a tripartite currency agreement, the exchange rate between the two countries' currencies may not be affected in any way. It is claimed that this plan was generally agreed upon in mid-July of this year. (25th National Telegram)

[London] Newspapers here today reported that Britain's war debts to the United States will be adjusted together at a future business conference. According to the Daily Express, this issue has been discussed since it was raised in 1934, and after many meetings, fundamental agreement has now been reached, that is, the United States recognizes the 41.5 billion gold pounds paid by Britain from 1923 to 1924 as the principal of the war debts.

### Overseas Chinese in Malaya Dismiss Japanese Tenants

[Singapore] Overseas Chinese throughout Malaya who own real estate are now dismissing Japanese tenants, both residential and commercial. This is a scene of Chinese boycotting the Japanese. It is heard that the Japanese are currently holding a meeting to discuss countermeasures. (24th Reuters Telegram)

### Current Situation of Order in Pudong

The Pseudo-Police Hold Rattan Canes and are Stationed, and Theft Has Been Slightly Reduced; After the Ferry Service Resumed, Many People Went Home to Visit

Pseudo-Police Stationed

The pseudo-police recruited by the Japanese in Pudong, about a hundred, have now been stationed. The pseudo-police station is located in the former Pudong Police Sub-Bureau on Police Bureau Road. Because Pudong is vast and the number of police is insufficient, recruitment is still continuing. It is heard that the quota needs to be filled with 500 people, but the number of applicants is not large. These pseudo-police wear a yellow symbol on their chests and carry a rattan cane, patrolling in teams. Each team of pseudo-police is accompanied by a Japanese soldier. Pseudo-police patrols are present in areas such as Lan Ni Du, Qichangzhan, and Yangjiadu.

Prohibition of Moving Objects

Although incidents such as hooliganism and theft have not yet been suppressed, they have gradually decreased. Residents who return home to move objects are strictly questioned if they are seen, and then released. However, they are only allowed to take small valuables. If they move furniture and other items, they will be stopped. As a result, many objects are left on the road after being stopped. Those who enter and exit empty-handed are not stopped, but they must also be questioned before being allowed to pass. There are no pseudo-police or Japanese soldiers east of areas such as Yangjingmiao and Qichangzhan. There are more pedestrians in that area.

Shops Open

Vegetable vendors in Pudong were allowed to pass a few days ago, but if they are encountered by hooligans, they must pay one yuan per load. Since yesterday, because the Japanese army wanted them to sell in Pudong, some are not allowed to sell in Shanghai. Among the towns in Pudong that were bombed and burned, Yangjingzhen was the most tragic, having become a scorched earth. The houses in the Lan Ni Du area have also been completely destroyed. The towns of Tangqiao and Qichangzhan have also been almost completely destroyed. Residents have also moved away. Only the three towns of Yangjiadu, Laobaitu, and Zhangjiabang have not been completely destroyed, and some have been bombed or burned. Recently, a small number of shops have opened for business, but there are few residents in the town, and no one cares. Only a few rice shops occasionally sell rice in small quantities.

Ferries Carry Passengers

Currently, ferries to Donggou, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Qichangzhan in Pudong have resumed carrying passengers, but the schedule is irregular. The fare is thirty cents per person per trip. Recently, more Pudong residents are going back to visit their homes or retrieve small items, so the number of people coming and going at each ferry pier has gradually increased. According to reports, they returned home the day before yesterday (22nd) and left their home on Police Bureau Road this morning (25th), walking east along Dongchang Road to Qichangzhan Wharf to take the ferry to Shanghai. However, at eight o'clock yesterday morning, a small number of passengers who landed from the Quanjia Ge of the Bund were stopped by the Japanese before leaving a certain gate and returned to Shanghai.

Continued Recruitment of Police

According to reliable sources, yesterday, a certain person who previously served as an inspector in the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau recruited another 150 brothers in Nanshi yesterday morning to go to Pudong. It is heard that after a short period of training, they will continue to be dispatched to various towns in Pudong to resume their posts.

Local Peace

According to a person from Sanlin Township in Pudong yesterday, he returned home a few days ago to see the situation at home. Because most of the residents in the two towns of Sanlin and Yangsi are poor, they did not escape. Now, Cai of Sanlin and Zhang of Yangsi are allowing the area to become desolate, turning into panic. Therefore, they advise the shops in each township to operate as usual. As a result, citizens in each township have resumed their businesses one after another. Even rice and food are sold at a flat price by Cai and others. The area has become peaceful. He went from Sanlin through Yangsi, past Shichang Temple, Yanqiao, to Qijiamiao, and entered Qinci Yangdian to cross the river at Yangjing. He landed at Tongren Wharf. However, after passing through various places, such as Zhangjialou and Qinci Yangdian, he was checked by Japanese soldiers before being released.

### Losses of Shanghai Electric Power Company in the Eastern District of Shanghai

Many Electricity Meters in Fangpeng Were Destroyed, Worth Approximately 710,000 Yuan

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Eastern District of the Public Concession has suffered unusually heavy losses due to the attacks of war artillery fire. The value of the electricity meters and other equipment owned by the American Shanghai Electric Power Company in the area is approximately 710,000 yuan. The labor costs for future sorting and demolition, as well as the damage to real estate, are estimated to cost more than 10,000 yuan, not counting business losses. It is heard that the company has now prepared a detailed report form to be submitted to the American Consulate for future claims for damages. Because the company's business in the Eastern District of Shanghai accounts for half of its total business, the business losses this time are difficult to calculate.

After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, residents of the Concession paid close attention to the supply of tap water, fearing that water pipes would be bombed or other changes that would interrupt the supply. In view of this, the Waterworks Company, to prevent万一(unexpected incidents), had some enthusiastic engineers provide free assistance in planning emergency measures, planning to draw water from wells to supply residents with drinking water. Various projects were generally prepared, but because the water plant was not affected by the war, there was no need to use it. Fan Keling, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, believed that the Waterworks Company had planned carefully and benefited the residents greatly, and specially sent a letter of thanks and admiration yesterday.

In addition, the British trading company Jardine Matheson & Co. had made every effort to assist the Waterworks Company in planning the above-mentioned measures, and Fan also sent a letter of thanks.

### The Chamber of Commerce Continues to Report Losses of Destroyed Factories

Counting Xin and Ten Other Factories

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry yesterday, continuing to report the losses of destroyed factories. The telegram said, "Respectfully addressed to the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: Having received your Ministry's telegram, ordering the reporting of factories with capital of more than 200,000 yuan that suffered losses due to the Shanghai War before November 1st, etc., we have notified and investigated separately, and the first batch of 15 factories that reported has been telegraphed in advance. Now, the China Fuxin Company and other factories have submitted reports of losses. We have compiled a brief table again, telegraphing it to your Ministry for verification and handling. It is for the public good. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits the following table of losses: ㊀China Fuxin No. 4 Company, October 18th and 19th, 237,400 yuan; ㊁Dacheng Silk Factory, October 27th, 86,850 yuan; ㊂Shengyuan Silk Factory, October 27th, 84,500 yuan; Xingye Ceramic Tile Company, October 27th, 150,000 yuan; Xieyuanchang Leather Factory, September 4th, 202,700 yuan; Lide Oil Factory, October 12th to October 21st, 200,000; Hengxingtai Oil Factory, before November 3rd, 22,225 yuan; Changde Oil Factory, September 21st to October 2nd, 37,360 yuan; Dayouyu Oil Factory, October 3rd to October 14th, 1,300 yuan; Nanchang Copper Factory, mid-September, 350,000 yuan."

### The Red Cross International Committee Holds a Regular Fundraising Campaign

Since the establishment of the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, initiated by consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai and Chinese and foreign philanthropists, it has spared no effort in carrying out various relief works. However, because a large amount of funds is needed, there is a plan to raise 10 million yuan for use in the next six months. In addition to having telegraphed various charitable organizations at home and abroad to request donations, it is also scheduled to hold a Fundraising Movement Week in Shanghai from the 1st to the 8th of next month (December), sincerely requesting people from all walks of life in this city to actively donate and support this charitable cause. Preparations have now been completed, and the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 5:00 pm on December 1st at the American Women's Club on Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, former Ambassador to Soviet Russia, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, the association's board member and chairman, and Father Jacquinot, the vice-chairman, will give speeches. Dr. Baker, the secretary-general, will report on the association's status and progress, welcoming people from all walks of life in China and foreign countries to actively participate. It is also heard that the association is scheduled to hold a music concert at the Great Shanghai Theatre on December 8th, and Mrs. Tang Shixuan is currently responsible for preparing everything. At that time, famous musicians in Shanghai will perform on stage. Once the program is arranged, tickets will be sold publicly. The association has recently printed a kind of calendar for sale, prepared in both Chinese and Western languages, costing one yuan in national currency per copy. All proceeds will be used for relief. Currently, in order to promote various fundraising activities, a Sponsorship Solicitation Office has been set up at 129 Nanjing Road (telephone 28954) to facilitate inquiries and contact from all walks of life.

### British Defense Force Ukrainian Team Went to Hong Kong Yesterday Morning for Transfer to India

Defense Was Taken Over by the Douhan Team

The Ukrainian Infantry Team of the British Garrison in Shanghai was ordered to be stationed in Shanghai after the Shanghai War, and has been here for three months. It has now been ordered to transfer to India. At 11:00 am yesterday, they boarded small boats from the New Customs Wharf to Wusongkou, where they were transported to Hong Kong by the British transport ship Dilwara, and then transferred to India. Because the team had worked hard to rescue refugees in western Shanghai during its stationing in Shanghai, many people from all walks of life in this city went to the New Customs Wharf to bid farewell. The British Douhan Infantry Team, which had just arrived in Shanghai, also sent a military band to the wharf to play farewell songs. From now on, the defense left by the Ukrainian team will be taken over by the Douhan team.

### Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Organized a Repatriation Service Group

The First Batch of Sixty People Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday; The Remaining Three Batches Will Also Return Home One After Another

Since the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance, overseas Chinese in various countries have organized "Repatriation Service Groups," and more than a dozen batches have arrived in Nanjing, with various talents. The overseas Chinese living in Saigon and Annam have also established a "Vietnamese Repatriation Service Group," divided into four groups: rescue, transportation, fire fighting, and consolation. There are a total of 240 male and female youth members who have registered to voluntarily return home and will be divided into four trips to return home. The first batch of 60 people, led by Lin Luying and Zhang Lupeng, arrived in Nanjing yesterday to await the military authorities' dispatch to various front lines to participate in rescue and other work. These 60 people are divided into five small teams. When returning home, they also brought many rescue equipment. The transportation and fire fighting groups of the second and third batches will also depart from Vietnam and return home immediately. The fourth batch, the consolation group, will take longer because of the purchase of consolation items, so they will return home last. According to the returning members, overseas Chinese in various places have also fully mobilized, and have been reporting to local consulates to request to return home to serve the country, willing to contribute the professional skills they have learned to the motherland.

Current Commentary

### Discussing the People's Food Problem Again

— Liu

Currently, rice shops limit each person to one yuan's worth of rice, presumably because of limited stock, intending to meet the widespread need and achieve an even distribution. However, due to practical limitations, this might not fully achieve the intended purpose. Therefore, considering the crowded rice-buying situation and the difficulty for the elderly, weak, women, and children to obtain rice, the current purchasing method seems to need improvement. Here are a few suggestions for the rice industry gentlemen: ㊀ Limit each person to one yuan's worth to ensure widespread access and prevent people from wasting time and enduring hardship buying rice. Therefore, not only should the number of rice selling locations be increased, but the selling hours should also be extended. ㊁ Disorganized purchasing only allows the strong to get food, while the elderly, weak, women, and children crane their necks in anticipation but cannot easily buy even a scoop of rice or a dou of grain all day long. Therefore, in addition to dispatching police officers to maintain order at each rice-selling location, bamboo or wooden fences should be used. Those who arrive first should buy first, followed by others in order, with orderly entry and exit, so that everyone has an equal opportunity to purchase. ㊂ Limiting grain purchases aims for widespread access, but with Shanghai's large population, five or six sheng of rice is often not enough for a family for one night's meal (excluding restaurants). Therefore, to meet their food needs, many people are used to buy. As a result, there are more and more buyers. Even with scolding and expulsion, the chaotic grabbing cannot be avoided. Therefore, the amount of stock should be considered. Even if it is temporarily impossible to increase the limit to one dan per person, expanding the one-yuan limit to two or three yuan, or even five dou, should be done to prevent families from fearing starvation, and order can be maintained. ㊃ The food problem in Shanghai is a holistic one. It should be planned holistically by all parties in conjunction with the rice industry, not treated as a matter for a single corner or industry.

### The Third Batch of 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived and Were Unloaded Yesterday

Sufficient Rice and Grain Supply Gradually Stabilizes Public Confidence　Substantial Wheat Stocks in Warehouses, Mills Rushing to Produce Flour　Congestion at Retail Sales, Deliberations Underway to Improve Methods

After the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice and transport it to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply, rice shops have fully resumed business and are conducting retail sales. The third batch of 30,000 bags, transported by a German ship, arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Rice Shops Association has completed the registration of rice collection and paid for and picked up the goods yesterday. The details are as follows:

Unloading Completed

The rice ordered by the French company Dafa Foreign Firm from Saigon totals 115,000 bags, shipped to Shanghai in four batches. Each bag weighs 220 pounds, equivalent to one shi and two and a half dou. It is intended for the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents. The first batch of 25,000 bags, transported by the British Taikoo Company's Jiaying vessel, has been unloaded after arriving in Shanghai yesterday. All were delivered at the wharf. The second batch of 30,000 bags, transported by the British Jardine Matheson Company's Fusheng vessel, has been unloaded after arriving in Shanghai yesterday. The unloading was completed that evening, and all bags are temporarily stored in warehouses for delivery there.

Fully Restored

Three hundred member rice shops of the Rice Shops Association in the Public Concession, such as Deng Rentai, and two hundred shops in the French Concession, such as Wanchang, have fully resumed business after receiving foreign rice from the Municipal Council and conducting retail sales. Although purchases are limited to one yuan per person, the crowding is severe everywhere. Hotels and congee shops that had temporarily closed yesterday have successively reopened, and meal-packing businesses continue to pack meals for customers. A small number of residents have switched to eating noodles, causing flour prices to soar. The wholesale price of standard flour rose to four yuan and three jiao per bag yesterday, and the retail price is above four yuan and five jiao per bag.

Three Batches Arrived

The third batch of 30,000 bags, transported by a German ship, arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession. The ship is represented by the German company Melchers & Co. Unloading began at 1:00 PM yesterday, with the Rice Shops Association providing trucks for each rice shop to conduct retail sales. The above foreign rice is delivered at the wharf. The fourth batch is reported to be transported by the British Taikoo Company's Zhejiang vessel, expected to arrive in Shanghai on the evening of the 28th, also with 30,000 bags.

Payment and Rice Collection

The Rice Shops Association handled the payment collection for the member rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession, totaling 500 shops, which began yesterday morning. ㊀ Location: Bank of China at 276 Sichuan Road. ㊁ Method: Wharf delivery is 16 yuan and 1 jiao 5 fen per bag, warehouse delivery is 16 yuan and 4 jiao 5 fen per bag, plus an additional fee temporarily calculated at 2 jiao 5 fen per bag. As for the retail method, the limit is still one yuan per person, at 8 fen 5 li per market catty. The distribution method is 40 bags per shop per batch.

Flour Shipped to Tianjin

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the grain industry that the wheat stored in warehouses in Shanghai amounts to quite a lot, totaling about 800,000 bags, which is being rushedly milled into flour by the Fuxin and Fuyi flour mills. Currently, the total flour stock in Shanghai is about 300,000 bags. Furthermore, yesterday the reporter witnessed a large amount of flour being loaded onto the British Taikoo Company's Shuntian vessel for shipment to Tianjin, totaling about 2,000 bags. It is said that this is a pre-war order from Chinese merchants in that port, with the manufacturers delivering the goods in installments.

No Worry About People's Food

As for the food situation in Shanghai, since the transportation obstruction, it has relied entirely on foreign rice and flour. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice, which has arrived in Shanghai in batches. At the same time, foreign firms are also ordering foreign rice from abroad, which will be arriving continuously. Therefore, there is no concern about a shortage of food in Shanghai. The crowded conditions of residents buying rice from rice shops will soon return to normal.

Retail Situation

The retail rice shops in the Public Concession, after the Rice Shops Association delivered the first batch of Saigon rice the day before yesterday afternoon, began retail sales at around 1:00 PM yesterday. The limit remained one yuan per person, and each police station dispatched several officers to each rice shop to maintain order. However, due to the large number of people, the rice was sold out in an instant. Those who arrived later, as well as women, children, and the elderly, were unable to squeeze through and returned empty-handed, sighing helplessly. In some places, the police first instructed people to wait in line and purchase in an orderly manner. Although those in the back were unable to buy rice, the order was quite good.

It is reported that the Market West United Association stated that with the arrival of foreign rice in batches to Shanghai in recent days, rice shops have begun retail sales to the market. However, due to the limited quantity and large population, the areas in front of each rice shop are extremely crowded and disorderly. Although Chinese and foreign police officers have tried their best to maintain order, it is difficult to contain the tide. Moreover, those who are strong and powerful can squeeze forward, while others, such as the elderly, weak, women, and children, often wait all day without getting a single grain. Furthermore, cases of people fainting and falling to the ground due to being squeezed, trampled on, and injured are not uncommon, and there is even a risk of life. In view of this situation, the association believes that the retail sales method is not perfect and is not a fundamental solution. It has already appealed to the concession authorities and various groups responsible for people's food to quickly devise a safer and more reliable plan to improve retail sales and avoid accidents.

Aiding Refugees Again

The International Relief Committee was notified by the French Municipal Council the day before yesterday to allocate 800 bags of foreign rice as food for refugees in shelters run by various organizations in the French Concession, which has already been distributed. The committee received another letter from the French Municipal Council yesterday, continuing to allocate 800 bags of foreign rice to be distributed to various shelters within the concession to provide relief. The committee will notify each shelter to bring their seals to the committee to collect warehouse receipts.

Rice Stored in Nanshi

The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association, in order to regulate the food supply for the city, purchased 20,000 shi of rice, which was unloaded at warehouses in Nanshi. They were planning to transport it into the concession for retail sales when our army withdrew from Nanshi, and transportation was cut off, making it impossible to transport it out. Recently, due to the shortage of rice in the concession, the rice industry had no rice for retail sales. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association reported to the Municipal Council, which contacted the Japanese military authorities to prove that the rice in Nanshi was indeed for regulating the food supply within the concession and requested the issuance of a pass to transport it out for sale. The Municipal Council has sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese military authorities. However, the Japanese side needs to consider the transportation issue, so no progress has been made. The 20,000 shi of rice are still stored in Nanshi and cannot be transported out.

### 50,000 Refugees Beg for Assistance from All Sectors

Nanshi Refugee Area to Provide Meals　Various Parties Seek to Shelter Street Refugees

The Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Disaster Relief Association, since taking over the affairs of the former City Relief Association, has reorganized the original organization of the Relief Association into the Refugee Relief Branch of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Disaster Relief Association, with Qu Wenliu as the chairman, and Gui Yanfang and Zhang Binghui as the vice-chairmen. The association's address remains on the second floor of the Pudong Building. For the 50,000 refugees sheltered by the former Relief Association, the United Disaster Relief Association bears a heavy burden itself and cannot take care of the living expenses and other relief expenses. Therefore, the Relief Branch still bears the expenses independently. As the weather has gradually turned cold in recent days, the refugees are suffering from both cold and hunger. The provision of food and clothing is extremely urgent. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will embrace the suffering and generously donate to the Relief Branch's general affairs group on the second floor of the Pudong Building for verification and collection, so that it can be distributed and used quickly. The names of donors will be published in the newspaper once a week to promote benevolence and a record of donations will be published upon completion to show credibility.

Providing Meals

For the past ten days, various refugee shelters have been distributing noodles due to the interruption of rice supplies. Since the Jiaying vessel arrived with Saigon rice, the shelters are now gradually resuming meals with rice. In the Nanshi refugee area, Father Rao has also purchased 1,600 bags and is preparing pots and fuel. It is expected that cooking will begin in two or three days. The issue of drinking water in the refugee area is also being addressed by the office and the Red Swastika Society. The number of poor households in the area who have run out of food continues to increase. According to the Relief Association, the number has now reached 30,000.

Street Refugees

According to a reporter's investigation, there are currently over 40,000 refugees sheltered in Shanghai by the Charitable Organizations United Disaster Relief Association and approximately 50,000 sheltered by the Relief Branch of the United Disaster Relief Association. A portion are still relying on relatives and friends, but this is difficult to sustain for long. It is estimated that there are no less than 10,000 refugees sleeping on the streets and in the alleys of the two concessions. Therefore, if refugees cannot be relocated, the number will increase. Various parties, including the Shanghai Municipal United Relief Association and the United Disaster Relief Association, are seeking to shelter the homeless refugees on the streets, as this is necessary for humanitarian reasons and also benefits public security. The Shanghai Municipal United Relief Association is currently looking for suitable locations and plans to first shelter the homeless refugees within the Public Concession.

### Relocation of Refugees Temporarily Postponed

A Batch of Staff Members Depart First

In view of the expanded warfare and inconvenient transportation, the War Zone Refugee Relocation Association decided a few days ago to send 1,000 refugees to Gaochun and Liyang for reclamation. This has now been temporarily suspended, but other places are being sought as alternatives. It is reported that after the person in charge actively sought instructions from the authorities, approval has been granted. As for the staff, more than 50 qualified people have been selected. A batch departed for the interior yesterday, and the rest will be notified by letter after inspecting the situation and reporting back.

### Japanese Mail Ship Asama Maru Still Stranded in Port

Stranded by Hurricane for Two Months　Unable to Tow, Dismantling Machinery

The Asama Maru of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, a top-class mail ship sailing in the Pacific Ocean and a sister ship to the Chichibu Maru, was caught in a hurricane in September. The ship was at the mouth of Lei Yue Mun in Hong Kong when the hurricane blew the hull onto the rocky reefs on the mountainside. It has been over two months, and repeated attempts have failed to rescue it. The company has dispatched technicians and a large number of workers to Hong Kong from Tokyo and decided to dismantle and remove the ship's machinery and other items first, transport them back to Japan, leaving an empty shell of the ship, and then tow it back to Japan for reassembly. The ship is one of the three giant mail ships of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company sailing on the US-China San Francisco-Japan-Shanghai line, costing tens of millions of yuan. Unfortunately, it encountered a hurricane and was stranded, resulting in very heavy losses. It is reported that the dismantling of machinery is currently underway.

### Foreign Nationals Fleeing Hangzhou Turn to Ningbo and Shanghai

Currently About Thirty Foreign Nationals Still Residing in Hangzhou

Due to the escalating warfare, foreign nationals in the Hangzhou area were notified to leave by their respective consulates in Hangzhou. Yesterday, 40 British and American expatriates went to Ningbo and are scheduled to take a ship to Shanghai within days for temporary residence. These included those concentrated in Hangzhou and the Moganshan-Wuxing area. Currently, there are still about 30 foreign nationals residing in Hangzhou. Apart from those who voluntarily do not want to leave Hangzhou or cannot leave due to business reasons, the rest will also come to Shanghai via Ningbo.

### Detailed Record of the Pudong Compatriot Association Sheltering Distressed Compatriots

Since the beginning of the Shanghai war, Pudong was still relatively safe. Therefore, the compatriots from the war zone living in Shanghai all thought that the fields and gardens were habitable and returned to their hometowns one after another. The Pudong Compatriot Association then undertook the task of sending the compatriots back to their villages. By the beginning of October, residents along the Pudong area, either because their homes were destroyed or because they had difficulty making a living, gradually sought help from the Association to be sheltered. The Chinese Medicine Clinic was temporarily used as a shelter and sent to various shelters of the City Relief Association from time to time. The handling situation has been reported. At the end of October, the Shanghai war situation changed, and the number of compatriots who were distressed increased day by day. The 64th meeting of the board of directors resolved to expand the shelter organization and began to set up shelters. The handling situation of the Association in the past two weeks is recorded separately as follows:

Setting Up Shelters

The Association successively established six shelters, with Gao Zhiang, Huang Zanting, Yu Kun, Pan Hongqi, Ling Yongnian, and Chen Jingyu as the managers respectively, sheltering a total of 3,424 refugees. However, it was still not enough to accommodate them, so they consulted with the City Relief Association from time to time to request them to shelter and provide for them. A total of 2,443 people were sent to eight shelters of the City Relief Association and the International Shelter of Jiaotong University. Before November 7th, the Association only had the first, second (Nanjing Road), and third shelters, which were already full. The compatriots who came to the Association to register were like a tide. The City Relief Association was unable to fully accommodate them, causing all of them to crowd the Du Hall, making management difficult. It was not until the refugee area was delineated that they were able to send them in batches. The distribution situation of Pudong compatriots in the refugee area is as follows: 282 people at the Xinbeimen Miscellaneous Grain Association, 243 people at the Leyilou of the City God Temple, 415 people in the Inner Garden of the City God Temple, 150 people at the Huangjiu Association of the City God Temple, 104 people at the Xingxiu Hall of the City God Temple, 150 people at the Yingshui Lou of the City God Temple, 160 people at the Xiangxue Tang of the City God Temple, 650 people at the Cuixiu Tang of the City God Temple, 75 people at the Daxin Photo Studio of the City God Temple, 106 people at the Pearl and Jade Trade Association, 250 people in the Wrapped Garden of the City God Temple, and 150 people at the Iron Trade Association of the City God Temple, totaling 2,735 people. The refugee shelters in the refugee area are now being transferred to the National Disaster Relief Association because the Compatriot Association cannot manage them. However, the Compatriot Association has sent a large amount of food to the International Relief Committee for distribution. The Relief Committee now has sufficient food and does not need assistance. However, there is a great need for clothing and bedding.

Before November 7th, the refugees registered and sheltered by the Pudong Boy Scouts numbered about 2,500, according to the roster. The living expenses were subsidized by the Compatriot Association, in addition to donations from local people. On the late night of the 6th, due to a misunderstanding during the troop deployment of the national army, they came to Shanghai in droves on the morning of the 7th. Apart from the young and strong men who went directly to the Association, the rest were sent to various places. The team is compiling and submitting a report on the distribution situation.

Planning Production

The Pudong Compatriot Association has decided to start with female workers for the refugees' production activities, because there are still a lot of jobs available in Shanghai lace and embroidery shops. The Association has completed the investigation of the various offices in charge, with 27 people having embroidery skills, 11 people having crochet skills, 49 people having gauze skills, 16 people having cigarette rolling skills, and 4 people having velvet rope weaving skills. The Association has sent one person with embroidery skills to Sun Xiangji Factory for employment. Furthermore, the Lunchang Yarn Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, is about to resume work. The factory has sent personnel to notify the Compatriot Association and has sent letters to various reception centers in the city to inform the factory workers to register. The work skills of the compatriots in the reception centers throughout the city have also begun to be investigated in order to allocate work. As various factories in the city, such as cigarette and textile factories, have resumed work one after another, the Association has sent personnel to contact them and ask them to hire workers.

Hygiene Facilities

In addition to setting up a hospital in the Chinese Medicine Clinic, the Pudong Compatriot Association has also specially contracted with Shengsheng Hospital as a maternity hospital for refugees, and has now admitted more than 50 pregnant women. The physicians of the Association's Western Medicine Clinic also take turns to visit various shelters every day for diagnosis and treatment, and provide medicine. The hygiene facilities of various shelters have also been inspected. However, the Western Medicine Clinic does not have hospital facilities, and the number of beds in the Chinese Medicine Clinic is small, so efforts should be made to expand it.

Educational Policy

Due to the environmental conditions, the education of refugees has not been able to proceed according to the original plan and had to be changed. Staff members of the management department are stationed in various shelters of the Association to handle the organization of baojia, so that the refugees' self-government organization has a preliminary form. The future educational policy should also start from subtle influence.

Subsistence Report

At the beginning of the operation of the various shelters run by the Pudong Compatriot Association, the Association allocated living expenses. After being incorporated into the shelters of the City Relief Association, the managers directly received them from the City Relief Association, and a detailed report will be made later. The donated food from the outside world included 970 guangbing, 25,080 big biscuits, 10 bags of flour, 1 shi of white rice, 44 bags of milk cakes, 5,402 buns, 695 breads, 100 catties of green vegetables, 120 pieces of fermented bean curd, and 100 catties of pickled mustard tuber.

In terms of clothing and bedding, Chen Zixin donated 1,000 quilts, Pan Zhiwen raised 900 cotton vests, Zhang Bochu raised 300 pieces, and the Local Association transferred 10,000 pieces, of which 5,000 pieces have been taken. As for the clothes donated from the outside world, there were 2,666 pieces and 31 bolts of factory cloth. In addition to the cotton vests being distributed successively, the clothes and bedding donated by all sectors have been distributed and used.

### Fuel Sources Not Smooth, Fuel Conservation is Used

Relying Only on Hongji Coal for Supply, Prices are Difficult to Fall Back Temporarily

Due to the lack of fuel sources in the city, the selling price of fuel such as coal and coal balls is still rising. Now in winter, the weather has been cold. In the past, citizens had installed coal stoves at this time and burned them day and night for warmth, so the consumption was very large. Now, it is very difficult to meet the daily cooking needs, and everyone is trying their best to conserve. Apart from those with more complete city housing equipment with water heaters, there are not many people who install coal stoves for heating. According to people in the coal industry, the current fuel consumption of citizens is almost less than half of what it used to be. It is also said that the current fuel sources rely only on the supply of Hongji white coal dust and Kailin coal, but the amount is only about 20,000 tons per month each. Although the firewood and charcoal industry association has tried its best to dredge the supply, it is difficult to expect the goods to arrive in a short period of time. Furthermore, the coal stored in various warehouses in Pudong has not been able to be taken out in large quantities. Therefore, judging from the current situation, fuel prices are still difficult to fall back temporarily.

### A Large Amount of Cabbage Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

Shipped by Shuntian Vessel　Will Be Available in the Market in a Few Days

Recently, vegetable market prices have already fallen back due to the continuous arrival of Pudong cabbage, spinach, and golden flower vegetables to Shanghai. However, obstacles suddenly occurred from the day before yesterday, causing prices to rise slightly again. It is reported that when Taikoo Company's Shuntian vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, it carried a large amount of Shandong cabbage, which will be available in the market immediately. At the same time, the Pudong vegetable supply has been dredged through negotiations by the relevant authorities and will continue to arrive in Shanghai immediately. Therefore, prices should fall back immediately.

### The Postal Administration Calls for Collection of Pudong Mail

Specially Set Up a Place　Waiting for Collection

The Postal Administration has specially set up a place on the third floor of the General Bureau on Sichuan Road to facilitate the collection of letters, savings, and remittances from post offices in Pudong that have been removed.

### The Bank of Communications Denies Public Bonds Being Robbed

The News Reported is Inaccurate

It was reported the day before yesterday that the Bank of Communications transported two boxes of National Salvation Public Bonds, totaling one million yuan, from Shanghai to Tongzhou. Outside Wusongkou, they were intercepted and searched by the Japanese army, and the two boxes of National Salvation Public Bonds were robbed. According to a spokesman for the Bank of Communications, the bank has not transported any National Salvation Public Bonds recently. The reported events are completely untrue.

### Xu Zaochun Consults

Xu Erkang's son, Zaochun, a specialist in external injuries, used to consult in Nanshi and in the Hongkou branch. Now that these areas have become war zones, he has taken refuge in the Special District and set up a clinic at No. 8, Shudeli, Weier Meng Road, west of the Nanjing Grand Theatre on Edward Road. It is also heard that Dr. Xu, valuing this extraordinary period, treats refugees seeking consultation with the spirit of relief and does not count the rewards. Moreover, Dr. Xu's surgical skills are excellent and bring life back to spring, truly a blessing for patients seeking refuge in Shanghai.

### Chen Xiaobao and Son Consult

Famous gynecologist, Chen Xiaobao, and his son, Pan Gen Da Nian, used to live in the Sanpailou in the city. Now, for the convenience of medical treatment, they have moved to No. 616, Julai Road, Siming Village Entrance, French Concession, and consult as usual.

### Letter

To whom it may concern, We have just seen the "Wartime Affairs Agency Communication" published in your newspaper, which states that "According to news from the Hushi area in this city, our large army is gathered in Huzhou, and the terrain is dangerous, making it difficult for the enemy to attack. They have changed their strategy and used naval marines to advance towards the southwest bank of Taihu, attempting to land in Jiapu, cut off the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, enter Yixing to the north, and invade Changxing to the south, attacking the back of Wuxing." Upon investigation, our agency has not received this news. We do not know what the Wartime Affairs Agency is basing this on. Fearing that the rumors are inaccurate, in addition to sending a letter to the agency to inquire, we are specially writing to your newspaper to request a prompt correction to avoid misunderstandings. We cannot express our hopes enough. Sincerely, The Executive Committee of Hushi, November 25th.

### Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Nantong Lines Continue Uninterrupted Navigation

Shanghai-Hong Kong Route Passengers Extremely Crowded, World Liners Actively Preparing to Resume Services

The Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Nantong shipping lines have recently experienced disruptions due to the war. However, the Shanghai-Nantong line is the only transportation artery between Shanghai and the inland areas. Mail, cargo, and refugee transportation all depend on the ships on this line. The Shanghai-Ningbo line is also essential because various salted goods from Shanghai are supplied by Ningbo. At a time when vegetables are scarce, the need for this line is even greater. Moreover, there are many people from Ningbo and Shaoxing living in Shanghai, and all business and other exchanges rely on this shipping line. Therefore, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association, at the request of fellow provincials, specially sent Wu Yaqin and Li Yaoting as representatives to Ningbo to explain to the authorities the reasons for requesting the resumption of navigation. This has already been approved, but the order to suspend navigation may still be given when necessary. The two representatives, Wu and Li, returned to Shanghai by the "Deping" ship yesterday morning to report. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo line as usual. The "Deping" ship, after arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, still sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo at 3:00 PM with many passengers. As for the Shanghai-Nantong route, although the traffic above Nantong has been disrupted, it has been restored after all parties have made every effort to clear the way. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Enderby" ship is scheduled to sail through at 8:00 AM this morning. The ships of Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire companies operating on this route are also operating as usual to facilitate traffic. As for the Hong Kong-Shanghai route and world liners, in addition to some resuming services, the rest are also actively preparing to resume services on the Shanghai line. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Shanghai-Nantong Line Changed to Irregular Ships

The foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Nantong line are the five Butterfield & Swire company's ships: "Wuhu", "Wuxue", "Tonghe", "Pinghe", and "Enderby". They were originally regular liners, but now they have been changed to irregular liners. Their announcement is as follows: "Our company's Tongzhou liners are now temporarily suspended. The date of sale will be announced later. This is hereby announced." As for Jardine Matheson's "Tonghe" ship, it is scheduled to sail through today. The Italian China Navigation Company's "Enderby" ship will sail through after returning to Shanghai.

Shanghai-Taizhou Line Changed to Departure Today

Butterfield & Swire's "Shin Fuk" ship operates on the Shanghai-Dinghai-Taizhou line and is managed by the Tai Kee Business Company. Tickets had already been sold, and it was originally scheduled to sail to Taizhou yesterday, but due to weather conditions en route, it must return to Shanghai this morning. Yesterday, a special announcement was made to change the departure from Shanghai to 3:00 PM this afternoon.

Shanghai-Hong Kong Passengers Extremely Crowded

Although the Shanghai-Hong Kong route is currently clear, the number of ships traveling back and forth has decreased, so passengers are extremely crowded. According to news from the travel agency, the German ship "Godafoss", which sails to Hong Kong today, has even its steerage seats fully booked, so those in the aft cabins have no way to purchase tickets and have to postpone their departure. It is also learned that various foreign shipping companies are now planning to dispatch ships to facilitate travel, so that there will be more than two ships traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong every week.

Chinese and Foreign Trade Gradually Becomes Active

After the war shifted west, world liners from various countries actively prepared to resume services in Shanghai. Butterfield & Swire, located in Pudong, had its first ship ("Tlengarry") arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month to load goods. This was previously reported. It is now learned that the company's second ship, "Sarpadon", was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday (24th), but due to congestion of goods along the way, it was changed to today (26th) to enter the port. As for the third ship, "Deucalin", it was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th, with only 37 quintals of cargo. Now, because Hong Kong has another large shipment of 2,700 tons reported to be loaded on the ship for transportation to Shanghai, it has also been rescheduled to enter the port on the 2nd of next month. Judging from this situation, Chinese and foreign trade is gradually becoming active.

### Serial Burglaries in the International Settlement

Firearms Seized in Both Places

The home of Wang Shao-cheng, located at No. 83 Shunte Road, Shanghai, was suddenly invaded by six bandits on the 21st of this month, who robbed more than 500 yuan of property. Afterwards, the victim found a card on the ground with the name Zhao Renrong written on it. On the back was written: "Mr. Wu Yi-ping, Room 18, Ji Sheng Zhan, Fujian Road, Fuzhou Road." Based on this information, the police reported it to the detective department. Chinese detectives Jin Haibo and others investigated based on the card and successively arrested the bandits Wu Yi-ping, Wu Xu-shi, Wu Gui-zhen, Xu He-an, Fan Heshang, Zhao Renrong, Wang Zhigang, Xu Cai-xiao, Wang A-jin, Shen Hong-sheng, Wei A-rong, Ren Fu-hua, Shen Jin-lan, Wei A-xiang, and 14 men and women in total at Ji Sheng Zhan and other places. Two pistols and twelve bullets were seized and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese and Western detectives arrested six accomplices at No. 65, Lane 460, Avenue Edward VII and No. 73, Lane 162, Chengdu Road: Liu Genrong, Xu Linsheng, Zhang A-gen, Zhang Defu, Shen Ziliang, and Hu A-wei. One pistol and eight bullets were seized and taken to the New Gate Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyers Qian Xunjiu and Wang Yuetang requested detention and joint trial. The court ordered detention pending a joint hearing rescheduled for the 29th.

Also, Jing'an Temple Police Station Chinese Detective Chief Chang Su Wu Chengmo and others arrested the bandits Yu Jinsheng, Zhang Shiliang, Zhang Shenshi, Shen Shaotang, Shen Xashi, Gu Guoyue, Shen Chengjin, Fang Lizhi, Fang Zhoushi, Shen Yingzhou, Yuan Wanjin, Jiang Mengdao, Hong Jiangshi, and 13 people in total at No. 47 Putuo Road and No. 104, Lane 979, Tokyo Road. Two Mauser pistols and ninety-two bullets were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. After questioning by Judge Dai, the court ordered a further review rescheduled.

### French Concession Cracks Down on Red Pill Organization

Many Male and Female Offenders Arrested, Yesterday's Trial Postponed for Further Investigation

French Police Detective Bieye (transliteration), accompanied by Chinese detectives Mao Jinsheng and Liu Jinrong, etc., inspected pedestrians in the area of Avenue Petain at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. They saw a Suzhou woman, Qian Youshi (30 years old), whose behavior was suspicious. They immediately stopped her and searched her, finding six packages of red pills, totaling three thousand pills, and five or six packages of morphine on her person. Under questioning, she confessed that the organization was located on the third floor of No. 15 Ji An Li, Zhengjia Muqiao Street. The detectives rushed to the address and seized thirty-nine packages of red pills, half a large bowl of morphine, and many instruments and raw materials for making red pills. All were taken back to the police station. Later, they went to the second floor of No. 7 You Yi Li, Lane 58, Baliqiao Street, and arrested two accomplices, Pang Hongshi and Du Asheng. Dozens of packages of red pills and morphine, as well as smoking paraphernalia, were seized. Also, in a certain lane on Avenue Hoche, two accomplices, Lin Ajin and Xue Yongfu, were subsequently apprehended. One package of red pills and equipment for smoking red pills, such as lamps and guns, were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were all sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The Police Department lawyer Yao Zhaodi explained the case and requested a postponement for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Sun Pengxian, he ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation.

### Tragic Love Triangle

Both Man and Woman Injured

Yang Bofan, a local doctor of traditional medicine living at No. 6 Qing'an Fang, Avenue Freligny, French Concession, has a thriving practice and a wealthy family. However, Yang is naturally lustful. He previously became acquainted with Yu Bin, a woman from Songjiang, who is 29 years old this year. They lived together, and their love was deep. Yu Bin has a younger sister named Xiao Mei, who is 21 years old this year. She is slender and often visits her sister's place. Over time, she began to exchange glances with her sister's husband, and then she had physical relations with Yang Bofan. This has now been discovered by Yu Bin, who became extremely jealous and quarreled with Yang all day long. Yesterday morning, around 10:00 AM, Yu Bin suddenly took a pair of sharp scissors and stabbed Yang in the neck while he was fast asleep. Yang was startled awake by the pain and shouted loudly for help. At this point, Yu Bin, seeing that she had caused trouble, also had suicidal thoughts. She then stabbed herself twice in the neck with the sharp scissors. When the people living together heard the alarm and rushed over, they pushed open the door and went inside to check. They saw Yang and Yu lying in a pool of blood. They immediately reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. Both injured people were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Yang's injuries are very serious and may be life-threatening.

### Chamber of Commerce Explains Transit Tax

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Zhenjiang County Liquor and Sauce Industry Association, explaining the nature of the transit tax. The letter stated: "In response to your letter of the 24th of this month, asking whether it is legal for the customs to still require the payment of transit tax on imported native liquor, we have investigated the matter. According to the Ministry of Finance order, 'those who have already paid the transit tax at other ports of entry or have already paid the consolidated tax, mineral tax, or tobacco and alcohol tax will be exempted from collection.' Therefore, it is inappropriate for the Zhenjiang Customs to require the payment of transit tax on liquor that has already paid the fixed amount of native liquor tax. As for the import of native liquor in this city, no liquor merchants have yet complained about the repeated payment of transit tax. Presumably, there is no such situation. This is hereby replied for your information."

### Sun Muquan's Debt Court Approves Compromise
