[Taiyuan] Wang and Yan, accompanied by Chu Minyi, Wang Maogong, and others, flew back to Taiyuan from Suiyuan at noon today. They were welcomed by all parties as planned. Wang and others got off the plane and went straight to the Shanxi Hotel to rest. Yan returned to the Suiyuan Office. Zhao Pi'lian did not come along because he was in charge of the meeting affairs of the Mongolian Political Council. Chu Minyi and others visited Jinci Temple in the afternoon and were entertained at a banquet at Jia Jingde's private residence in the evening by Zhao Daiwen, Jia Jingde, Yang Aiyuan, Zhu Huanguang, and others. Wang did not participate due to illness. Wang held a tea party for reporters from various newspapers inside and outside the province at the hotel at 5 p.m., talking for about half an hour. Then, he went to the Suiyuan Office to visit Yan for a long conversation. It is said that they had close consultations on issues such as saving the country from disaster. Wang will still take the original plane with Chu, Wang, Lin, and others to Nanjing tomorrow. The main points of Wang's conversation with the reporters are as follows: (1) Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, recently, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly expressed its views, and the visit of the economic inspection group to China has led to renewed talk of economic cooperation between the two countries. This is what our people desire. However, the various things that have happened in the past are deeply imprinted on the minds of the people and are not easily forgotten. We are determined to act in accordance with the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, and we are always prepared for sacrifice. (2) Regarding the issue of the surrender of the Communist Party, if the Communist Party can follow the orders and resolutions of the Central Government, it can be given a path to self-renewal. This is not tolerating communism, but at a time of national resistance against Japan, the whole people should fight together under the leadership of one goal. (3) Chairman Chiang is recovering his health, although he still needs to rest temporarily, but all major policies still need to be handled by him personally. Wang also said that he was very pleased with the vitality of Shanxi and Suiyuan and hoped that the whole country would work together to carry out the arduous task of national restoration. (Special dispatch from the 17th)

Zhao Pi'lian will leave Suiyuan after the meeting, pass through Shanxi, and return to Nanjing. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)

### Wang's Speech at the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council

[Guihua] Chairman Wang's speech at the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council is as follows: Today is the anniversary of the establishment of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee. I am very happy to participate in this grand ceremony. The nationalism of the Kuomintang is to unite all ethnic groups internally, to be friendly and harmonious, and to work together to achieve freedom and equality externally. Mongolian compatriots are all descendants of Genghis Khan, and they have the blood of this hero in their bodies. They will surely be able to deeply understand and work together. Last year, I took a few months of sick leave and recuperated in Europe. I saw a country where, because people on both sides relied on strong countries, the result was that people on both sides killed each other. When I returned to China, I heard that the number of people who had killed each other had reached more than 200,000. The capital of Madrid has been shattered. This tragedy of mutual killing has not ended to this day and is getting worse. Seeing this fact, I cannot help but think of my Mongolian compatriots. Outer Mongolia is relying on a strong country, thinking that it is safe. Eastern Mongolia is also relying on another strong country, also thinking that it is safe. But they do not know that once these two strong countries clash, the compatriots of Outer Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia will be sacrificed. The tragic scene of this mutual killing is really painful to think about. Now, China is indeed in the midst of national difficulties. However, with its large territory and large population, if we are of one heart and one mind and move forward together, we will surely be able to turn danger into safety. The most important thing is to strive for self-reliance and never rely on others. We can be friends with any strong country, but we must never rely on them. We firmly believe that this is the only way to save the country and survive. It is the only guarantee. The Mongolian compatriots in Suiyuan are already connected with the Han compatriots. They are in the same territory, under the same sovereignty. Our first priority is to save ourselves. The second is to save others. That is, if we exert all our strength and strive for survival, we will not only be able to save ourselves, but also be able to inspire the compatriots of Outer Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia to escape the tragedy of relying on others and killing each other. Since the establishment of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, under the guidance of the Chief Executive, the joint efforts of Chairman Sha, Vice Chairman A, and all the committee members have achieved considerable success. The disputes between the Han and Mongolians have been resolved one by one, especially in the recent defense of the territory and resistance against Japan, which is enough to show the spirit of national restoration. The Central Government deeply admires this and will do its best to benefit the autonomy and economic life of the Mongolian compatriots in Suiyuan. I believe that this meeting will inevitably have many proposals that will make great contributions to promoting benefits and eliminating harms. I only hope that everyone will work hard to achieve them. Now, to sum it up in one sentence, we Mongolian and Han compatriots must recognize that the country and the nation depend entirely on our own strength to revive them. We also believe that Mongolian compatriots have the blood of Genghis Khan's heroes in their bodies and will be able to shoulder this mission and make it a success. I would like to express my best wishes for the bright future of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee and the health of the Mongolian compatriots. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)

### Yan's Instructions to the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council

[Guihua] Yan Xishan, the Chief Executive of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council, delivered the following speech at the council's anniversary meeting on the morning of the 17th: I am very happy to be able to meet with all the Mongolian banner princes and governors at the first anniversary of the establishment of this council. In the past year, everyone has carried out the council's affairs according to the prescribed plan and has made achievements. I am ashamed that I have not been able to participate together due to other duties. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to explain two things to everyone: (1) There are many countries in the world that are composed of various ethnic groups. China is not a single ethnic nation, but is also composed of several ethnic groups. Although it is a country composed of several ethnic groups, because it lives within a common territory, the requirements of life and the guarantee of survival have common interests. Therefore, our ethnic groups are consistent externally and equal internally. Our nation is now on the path of restoration, and common efforts mean common development. (2) Autonomy is a good thing, and we cannot oppose it. However, simply knowing that autonomy is a good thing cannot achieve the actual effect of autonomy, and the people will still not be satisfied. We strive to help the Mongolian people achieve autonomy. The methods of helping are to develop education and increase production. Because to be a modern nation, without these two conditions, we cannot consolidate the foundation of self-reliance. I hope that everyone will develop autonomy from the standpoint of the common interests of the country, consolidate the ethnic united front, and improve the happiness of the Mongolian people. I am willing to work hard with you all. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)

Before Yan left on the 17th, he ordered Zhang to go to Shanxi. Zhang is preparing to leave within a few days. (Special dispatch from the 17th)

### Yan Issues Statement in Suiyuan

[Beiping] Yan said in Suiyuan that since Suiyuan was designated as a special district, the population has been growing daily, and it has recently reached two million. Everything has progressed compared to before. The war in eastern Suiyuan this time has aroused national sympathy and assistance, and the revitalization of the nation is promising. Regarding the issue of preventing communism in the Northwest, the Third Plenary Session has already had a case to eradicate the Red disaster. However, the issue in eastern Suiyuan has not affected the prevention of communism. I have no plans to go to Nanjing in the short term. The candidate for the successor to the Qingxiang Superintendent of Shanxi has not yet been decided. Xu Yongchang will return to Shanxi and then discuss it again. There are more than 20 factories in Shanxi Province, with a capital of about 20 million. Shanxi Province plans to complete 5,000 miles of highways within a considerable period of time. The Datong-Puzhou Railway is scheduled to be completed in August this year, and it is also planned to build the Shuoxian-Suiyuan Railway. The capital is set at 6 million, and it is planned to use the Datong-Puzhou Railway as collateral to borrow money from the bank. The Shuosui Railway is about 400 miles long, and surveying has already begun. (Special dispatch from the 17th)

### Xiong Cheng and Others Have Arrived in Ping from Suiyuan

[Beiping] General Representative Xiong Bin and He's Representative Yan Kuan, who went to Suiyuan to participate in the memorial service, returned to Ping today and are scheduled to return to Nanjing on the morning of the 18th to report back. (Special dispatch from the 17th)

[Guihua] Xiong Bin left Suiyuan for Ping and returned to Nanjing on the evening of the 16th because the memorial service and military parade had ended. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)

### Wang's Speech at the Welcome Meeting

[Guihua] Chairman Wang's speech at the welcome meeting of all circles in Suiyuan on the afternoon of the 16th is as follows: I was ordered by the Central Government to come to Suiyuan to pay respects to the military and civilians who died in the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan, and to pay tribute to all comrades and compatriots who have worked hard for the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan. I am afraid that my words are simple and clumsy and cannot fully convey the intentions of the Central Government, but I am really unworthy of such a welcome from everyone. Suiyuan is the forefront of national defense, and you are comrades and compatriots who are working hard at the forefront of national defense. How much the Central Government values the forefront of national defense, how much it cares about and pays attention to the comrades and compatriots who are working hard at the forefront of national defense, I have a sincere heart, but I can't express it even to one ten-thousandth. Recalling the slogan of "uniting sincerely and working together to overcome national difficulties" since the September 18th Incident, it has not only spread to the entire party, but also to the entire country. After the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of the Great Wall passes, we deeply feel that there are various shortcomings in organization and material construction.

We cannot save the country and survive without making a painful decision and working hard. Therefore, on July 28, 1933, Chairman Chiang and I sent a joint telegram, explaining today's priorities. In terms of foreign affairs, we should determine the minimum limit and the most necessary determination to sacrifice. In terms of domestic affairs, there is nothing more urgent than to eliminate the Communist bandits, and there is nothing more fundamental than to promote production and construction. Since then, Chairman Chiang has worked hard, leading comrades and working hard. In terms of suppressing bandits, from Jiangxi to Hunan, to Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan, and even to the Northwest, it is almost clear. Suddenly, there was the incident of December 12th last year, which almost shook the foundation. Fortunately, it turned danger into safety, and with proper handling, the bandit suppression work can probably be concluded in the near future. In terms of production and construction, we have also done some work in the past few years. The details are too numerous to mention. However, these results are not satisfactory. Not only are they not satisfactory, but they have revealed a great crisis. What is this crisis? That is, although we have done some work in material construction, there has been a great setback in the spiritual aspect. Because the national crisis is getting closer and closer, people with conscience and enthusiasm are heartbroken by the current situation and cannot fully understand the meaning of working hard. As a result, some are disappointed, and some are so激angerous that they make hasty decisions. This is already very regrettable. As for those who have no conscience or enthusiasm, they simply give in to inertia, thinking that they can steal safety and get by. The most despicable ones openly think that it is wise to be a traitor. This crisis reached an extremely critical juncture in the months of June, July, August, and September of 1935. During this period, Chairman Chiang, who was concerned about the safety of the party and the country, saw this point clearly and flew back to Nanjing from Sichuan to preside over the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee. At the same time, Director Yan, who was concerned about the safety of the party and the country, also saw this point clearly and flew to Nanjing from Taiyuan to jointly preside over the major plans of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee and the Fifth National Congress. Since then, Chairman Chiang has been in charge of the central structure, and Director Yan has been responsible for the great task of safeguarding Shanxi and Suiyuan, working together to save the greatest crisis of the country and the nation. During this period, I was suffering from illness and injury. I neither died nor worked, which makes me feel really sad. When the resistance against Japan in Suiyuan had factual manifestations, this crisis was saved. In other words, the spirit of the existence of the country and the nation was revived from decline. The greatest significance of the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan in Suiyuan for the country and the nation lies in this. Just now, I heard the chairman's words that he is not satisfied with the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan. This not only shows the chairman's humility, but also shows the chairman's foresight. Because our current national crisis has not been resolved, and it may become more serious in the future. We must still work hard and continue to move forward vigorously in production and construction in order to enrich the people's strength and enhance the country's strength. Not to mention the whole country, even in Suiyuan, if the people's livelihood is not free from suffering and social economy is not greatly improved, even if there is enthusiasm, we cannot shoulder greater responsibilities. The financial difficulties and the failure to realize various constructions are also what the military and political authorities are worried about. Therefore, production and construction are necessary conditions for us to seek self-reliance internally and co-existence externally. We will never miss the opportunity, and we will inevitably work tirelessly. However, our minimum limit and most necessary sacrifices will not be abandoned because of this. In other words, we will use every moment of our lives for production and construction. However, when the minimum limit requires the most necessary sacrifice, we will inevitably throw away all the accumulation of production and construction over the years, as well as our lives, for the country and the nation, without any reluctance. If someone wants a piece of our territory, they must know that this piece of territory must be dripping with our blood and must not be easily stepped over, nor can it be stepped over. Yesterday, we saw the graves of the martyrs who died in the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan. We will never let them die alone, while we live. We live to continue their legacy of defending the territory and resisting Japan. We die to continue their legacy of defending the territory and resisting Japan. We only have two destinations: one is that everyone dies for the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan, making the Republic of China a public tomb for 400 million people; the other is that the Republic of China embarks on the road of freedom and equality, and our descendants share a paradise-like happiness.

### Wang and Yan's Speeches at the Suiyuan Military Parade

[Guihua] Chairman Wang's speech at the military parade on the morning of the 16th is as follows: Director Yan, Chairman Fu, all officials, all armed comrades, and people from all walks of life, this time I was ordered by the Central Government to come to Suiyuan to express my utmost respect and love to the military and civilians who are defending the territory and resisting Japan. Yesterday, I participated in the solemn memorial service and saw the graves filled with the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country. Today, I participated in the enthusiastic military parade and saw the spirit of your struggle. I also saw the wounded soldiers and the common people who deeply understand righteousness and are not threatened by power or tempted by profit. My heart is filled with respect and love, and I really cannot express it. Recalling that since last autumn, the bandits and puppet troops invaded Suiyuan, the sovereignty of the country's territory was in danger. Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission presided over the central hub, and Director Yan shouldered the great responsibility of defending the local area. Chairman Chuan and all the officers and soldiers fought bravely and resisted, not afraid of hardship or danger. This spirit has been unanimously supported by all sectors of the country, and the military and civilians in all provinces regard it as one body, sharing weal and woe. The Mongolian princes were especially able to deeply understand righteousness and do their best to support. After several months of resistance, the lost territory was recovered, and the territory that had not been lost was preserved intact. This is really a great road to national revival in a critical and precarious situation, giving 400 million people bright hope for the future of the Republic of China. We must know that the significance of this resistance is of great importance in history and in the current situation. Because in history, when we encounter foreign insults, it is often not just the foreign insults that lead us to destruction. The greatest cause of our destruction is actually internal traitors. Chinese people destroying China is the most heartbreaking stain in our history. If this stain is not washed clean, the disaster of national subjugation will be unavoidable. The greatest significance of this resistance is to break the historical legacy of Chinese people destroying China. It is to use the patriotic blood of our compatriots to wash away these stains. This blood is the most precious and the most pure. Relying on this blood, we can not only wash away the previous stains, but also awaken the current national soul. We recall the spirit of Zhang Ziqing, a commoner in the eastern Suiyuan campaign, who rejected bribes, lured the enemy, and bravely defended the country. If every person and every commoner can take this as an example, then who in the world can alienate our compatriots? Who else would dare to invade our territory again? From now on, within the Republic of China, everyone will be of one heart and one mind, and we will move forward bravely. We will surely break this precarious situation and enable China to revive and achieve the road of freedom and equality. Now, the blood of the soldiers and civilians who resisted Japan has already been shed, and their lives have already been dedicated to the country and the nation. However, their spirit will always exist in the hearts of the generals and people who have shared weal and woe since the beginning of the resistance, and it will also exist in the hearts of the generals and people of the whole country. Their pure blood is sprinkled on the Guangda territory, so that the enemy dare not step into one inch. If all our soldiers and all our people can prepare to sprinkle pure blood on our territory, then not only will the unlost territory be permanently preserved, but the lost territory will surely be recovered piece by piece as our blood is sprinkled. This is the great significance of the Suiyuan resistance, and it is also the great significance of our commemorating the soldiers and civilians who died in the battle. The martyrs' cemetery we saw yesterday, every cup of soil, is the foundation for the revival of the country and the nation. The blood shed by our armed comrades and our people for the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan, as well as the painstaking efforts we have made, every bit and drop has seeped into the foundation of the revival of the country and the nation, making it solidified into iron. Last year's glorious victory in the defense of the territory has proved that our sacrifices and efforts have not been in vain. Today, we want to let the people of the whole country know that sacrifices must be made in unison, and we must not let the military and civilians in one part of Suiyuan sacrifice alone. Although our sacrifices are first and last, we continue to go on this road. The painstaking efforts we put in during our lifetime and the blood we shed at the time of our death, bit by bit, form the foundation for the revival of the country and the nation. From today onwards, the country and the nation will face greater suffering and deeper crises. However, we firmly believe that as long as the compatriots who have not died can continue the legacy of the martyrs for the country and the nation, and with the determination to live and die together, and work tirelessly, then the time when we die for the country may be first, but our spirit and our purpose are exactly the same. In this way, the spirit of the soldiers and civilians who died in the battle will not die, and it is this spirit that has formed the foundation for the revival of the country and the nation. Finally, I would like to express my utmost respect to the martyrs who died in the battle and to the military and civilians who defended the territory and resisted Japan on behalf of the Central Government. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

[Guihua] Vice Chairman Yan's speech at the military parade is as follows: Let's think about it carefully. Has today's defense of the territory and resistance against Japan been successful? Can Suiyuan live a peaceful life from now on? All the soldiers, I don't think so, I believe you don't think so either, I hope you don't think so. When the enemy's artillery fire hits our doorsteps, we should defend our territory. This is not a matter of weighing the pros and cons. Fortunately, since August of last year, thanks to the spirit of loyalty and bravery in resisting Japan, we won victories in the battles of Tumurtai, Honggetu, Bailingmiao, and Damiao, thus enabling the people of Suiyuan to live a relatively peaceful life today. Soldiers, but we must not forget the lessons since the September 18th Incident, and we must be determined to defend the territory and resist Japan. We must work harder and prepare our strength to defend our territory. Soldiers, more than 400 military and civilians sacrificed their lives in this resistance, but their deaths brought peace to Suiyuan and consolidated the first line of national defense. Dear soldiers, we must protect the legacy left by the military and civilians who died in the battle and continue their great cause, so that it can flourish and grow. Otherwise, how can we be worthy of the heroes who died in the battle, and how can we be worthy of the warm expectations of our 400 million compatriots? Dear soldiers, the heroes who died in the battle have sown the seeds of self-reliance and national salvation for us. We must cultivate it, irrigate it, and make it germinate, blossom, and bear fruit. We must be worthy of the heroes who died in the battle and the warm expectations of our 400 million compatriots. We can only invigorate our military courage, continue the spirit of the fallen soldiers, work hard to prepare, and strive for the country. Finally, I will lead you to shout two slogans: (1) Prepare the strength to kill the enemy and win victory, and sacrifice to save the country. (2) Continue the spirit of the fallen soldiers, defend the territory and resist Japan. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

[Nanjing] Regarding the matter of repairing the dikes and blocking breaches in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan, people from Hubei are coming to Beijing one after another to express their opinions. On the 17th, the reporter visited Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, to inquire about the situation. According to him, the Commission has already sent a letter to the Executive Yuan, requesting that relevant agencies be convened as soon as possible to discuss and find appropriate solutions. It also ordered the Hunan Provincial Government to suspend the project until a solution is reached. As for the rumor that the Dongting Lake dike repair and breach blocking is a central plan, the Economic Commission has not made such a suggestion or opinion. In short, this problem should be easily resolved. The Executive Yuan has decided to convene representatives from the National Economic Commission, Hunan and Hubei Provincial Governments, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance on the 19th to discuss and decide on a fair and appropriate solution to fundamentally resolve the issue. The reporter then inquired about the progress of the remote dike project. Qin replied that the Zhongxiang remote dike is being taken over by the Shan He Engineering Commission to speed up the construction and closure. The remaining repair work, according to Director Fan Xijun, who came to Beijing on the 17th, has also been fully completed the day before. The Commission will immediately send personnel to Hubei Province for joint inspection and acceptance. (Central News Agency telegram on the 17th)

[Tianjin] On the 17th, customs officers in Tianjin seized a large quantity of smuggled goods from the Ruifuxiang Department Store on Gu Yi Street. All of them were transported to the customs for detention. The method of punishment is under review. Both stores have a history of more than fifty years in Tianjin. On the 17th, Hou Yuming, an inspector from Tianjin Customs, discovered Yin Pei, a clerk from the Tongji Guan store in the Japanese concession in the South City, transporting several packages of smuggled sugar and handing them over to a certain number in the Chinese territory. Hou attempted to intercept them but was beaten and injured. With the assistance of the police, Yin was captured. Ruifuxiang was found to have more than a thousand pieces of smuggled cloth.

Current Commentary

### Elucidation of the Meaning of "Cherishing Benevolence and Befriending Neighbors"

— Du

After the Japanese Economic Observation Group, led by Kodama Kenji, arrived in Beijing, they received warm hospitality from all parties. Premier Chiang, in the capacity of the leader of the Party and the nation, welcomed the distinguished guests and delivered a sincere and earnest speech at a banquet. In his speech, he mentioned that Japanese Viscount Shibusawa had quoted the saying from the Analects, "Do not do unto others what you do not want done unto you," and considered it to be a characteristic of the Eastern spirit. He hoped that everyone present could understand this idea well, just like the Viscount. Finally, he presented Kodama with the phrase "Cherishing benevolence is a treasure" and concluded by calling for a joint effort to cherish benevolence and befriend neighbors. The unsaid implications were expressed in a tactful way. The host can be said to be skilled in rhetoric, and the listeners could not help but be moved. We, being insensitive, would like to further elucidate the four words "Cherishing benevolence and befriending neighbors."

In today's world of rapid advancement in civilization, the condemnation of war has taken deep root in people's hearts. Although there are one or two advocates of militarism who are stirring up a murderous atmosphere, the majority of countries are constantly striving to eliminate violence and maintain a peaceful situation. The meaning of benevolence is of utmost importance in this regard. As for China and Japan, two countries that are adjacent to each other and have close magnetic ties of mutual concern, the need to seek the way of good neighborliness is something that both sides have long been familiar with. Unfortunately, past events have been too bizarre, going in opposite directions, making it impossible to follow. After suffering from deep wounds, we still uphold friendship and practice self-restraint out of consideration for cherishing benevolence, which has made it difficult for our neighbors to be kind. The depth of guilt lies only in this. The mission of Kodama and his group is to promote the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, they must be willing to accept Chiang's advice. As for what is called a joint effort, some may think that we have reached the point where we can no longer cherish benevolence or befriend neighbors. Now we can only expect the other side to act diligently, and there is no room for us to make further efforts. However, under this circumstance, the estrangement is deepening. Even if Kodama and others can have an understanding of "Cherishing benevolence is a treasure" and know how to promote the characteristics of the Eastern spirit, whether their advocacy of cherishing benevolence and befriending neighbors can avoid being constrained by powerful forces is still a big question. How to eliminate this obstacle in order to see the coordination of true good neighborliness still depends on our efforts. The so-called joint effort will be on their side, not on ours.

We firmly believe that there are many people of insight in Japan who know that aggression is not a good strategy. However, they are intimidated by the tyrannical will of a small group of people, and they sigh and dare not make any claims. The formation of this tyrannical will is due to the ease with which they have illegally seized things in the past, leading them to believe that they can take whatever they want now. They do not realize that times have changed and the situation is different. When things become unbearable, they will inevitably end up in a state of mutual destruction. Therefore, we must clearly express our firm attitude today and not make any more concessions. We must prepare to sacrifice everything and make a desperate gamble, so that Kodama and others can declare this in their country and awaken the delusional dreams of those who have consistently invaded. We must seek peace amidst full armament and maintain friendship under a strong will. Only in this way can we gradually embark on the right path of improving relations between the two countries. Only in this way can we promote the realization of cherishing benevolence and befriending neighbors on both sides.

### British House of Commons Re-Discussed Smuggling in North China

[London] The smuggling incident in northern China has been raised for discussion twice in the British House of Commons in February. Today, in the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Cranborne, in response to a question from Conservative Member of Parliament Smylles, stated that the British Ambassador has repeatedly urged the Japanese government to pay attention to the smuggling incident in northern China, and said that the detailed measures for relief are best handled by the relevant authorities themselves. The most important point is that the customs officers in China must have the freedom to actively exercise their powers. This point has been repeatedly stated to the Japanese government by the British Ambassador to Japan. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 16th)

### Japan Insists on Quality over Quantity in Naval Restrictions

Unwilling to Join Treaty on Gun Caliber, Britain Prepares to Build 50,000-Ton Battleships

[Tokyo] The Japanese government had previously refused to participate in the new London Treaty established in 1936. However, the British government intended to request Japan's participation in the qualitative provision that forms the core of the treaty, limiting the main gun caliber of battleships to 14 inches, and to negotiate with Japan. As the deadline for the Japanese government's response on April 1st gradually approached, after careful consideration, it was decided to issue a response to the British government within days. The Japanese government believes that an agreement with only qualitative restrictions and no quantitative restrictions goes against the spirit of disarmament. Therefore, the content of the response seems to indicate a refusal to participate in the treaty restricting gun caliber. According to the new London Treaty, if one of the signatories of the Washington Treaty does not participate, the gun caliber of battleships (35,000 tons) with 14-inch guns can be expanded to 16 inches. Therefore, if Japan does not participate, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy will inevitably strengthen their battleships and, depending on the shipbuilding plans of other countries, may invoke automatic escalation clauses to build battleships equipped with massive guns exceeding 16 inches. From this perspective, the new London Treaty merely stipulates mutual notification of shipbuilding plans among countries and loses its nature as a disarmament treaty. (16th, Domei News Agency)

[London] The British naval community is greatly disappointed by the Japanese government's decision to reject the proposal to limit the maximum gun caliber to 14 inches. It is now widely expected that Britain will build 50,000-ton battleships. British naval officials initially hoped that the recent changes in the Japanese cabinet would lead to a more moderate stance than that expressed by the Japanese delegation at the 1935 London Naval Conference. However, they did not expect Japan to remain steadfastly unchanged. It is reported that France and Italy welcome the 14-inch gun caliber limit, and the Soviet Union and Germany are also quite willing to endorse this proposal, awaiting Japan's decision to determine their course of action. The United States has been unwilling to accept this proposal from the outset. Now that Japan has announced its opposition, it is widely believed that the two battleships that the United States will begin building in July of this year will be equipped with 16-inch guns. The United States firmly believes that 35,000-ton warships can also mount 16-inch guns without sacrificing the armor of their hulls. However, British naval experts, based on their experience with the Rottalesque and Hood-class warships, strongly disagree. Therefore, an increase in the tonnage of British battleships may ultimately be unavoidable. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

[London] It has been learned that the Soviet Union is now requesting Britain to convene a naval conference so that naval powers that have not signed the London Naval Treaty (i.e., the one signed by Britain, France, and the United States on March 25, 1936) can reach an agreement. Since the establishment of the London Naval Treaty, Britain has been negotiating separately with the Soviet Union, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries, hoping to reach bilateral agreements and persuade these countries to accept the qualitative restrictions contained in the London Naval Treaty. As a result of these talks, agreements have been reached in principle with the Soviet Union and Germany. Britain still insists on conducting separate talks with each naval power and believes that the procedure proposed by the Soviet Union is inappropriate, and intends to politely persuade the country to abandon this proposal.

### Soviet Cultural Circles Issue a Strong Appeal

Fascism Incites War; Hope for Global Effort to Avert It

[Moscow] The Izvestia newspaper published a letter from Soviet cultural circles to progressive and advanced individuals worldwide, stating: "Twenty-three years ago, a single shot in the Balkans ignited the powder keg of Europe. Within four years, the entire world was shaken by slaughter and destruction. Today, the blood and tears have dried, but the memories linger. Humanity has exhausted its efforts to establish world peace, but the sound of new gunfire is already ringing in our ears.

"What is currently taking place in Spain is not the suppression of a rebellion, nor is it an internal conflict. The countries at war with Spain are Germany and Italy, and General Franco is merely their puppet. The armies of these two fascist states have invaded Spain and are waging war. The conduct of the war, apart from its unprecedented barbarity and cruelty, is no different from any war in imperialist history.

"War is now underway in Europe; war is currently taking place. And the League of Nations covenant states: 'Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League.' The bloodthirsty beast has become increasingly savage and rampant, dominating the world, plundering people, and occupying land. All of this is the aim of fascism: organized national banditry, shamelessly flaunted before the world. We must, on behalf of thinking humanity, declare to the world: Enough! We can no longer tolerate the evil deeds and banditry of these fascist psychopaths, allowing them to attempt to drown the twenty million heroic people of Spain in a sea of blood. We can no longer sit idly by as the structures built by the people to preserve peace in Europe are destroyed. We can no longer tolerate the shameful clamor of the so-called Non-Intervention Committee, allowing it to carry out behind the scenes a conspiracy to sell out the women and children of Spain, and to strive to delay time under the diplomatic charade of challengers.

"Enough! Cultural figures, we demand that you declare resolutely to your governments. We expect you to voice your firm protests against what is currently taking place, and the voices of you and all sane humanity. If we do not force these scoundrels to regain their sanity, then the criminal acts that will follow will be unavoidable. War has already begun. The fascist governments have decided to force history to replay the nightmare of world massacres. Stop their evil now; it is now or never." (16th, TASS)

Death of Lady Rothermere

### Death of Former British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain

Suffered from Heart Disease, Medicine Ineffective, Passed Away at the Age of Seventy-Four; Dedicated His Life to European Peace and Was Known for His Pro-French Stance

[London] Sir Austen Chamberlain, Conservative Member of Parliament for the British House of Commons, passed away at his private residence in London at 6:00 PM today due to heart disease, at the age of seventy-four. He had been ill for only a few days. Austen Chamberlain was born in 1863, graduated from Cambridge University, and first entered the House of Commons as a representative for East Worcestershire. After his father's death, he succeeded his father as the representative for West Birmingham. He successively held important positions such as Civil Lord of the Admiralty, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and Postmaster General. From 1903 to 1905, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1915, he served as Secretary of State for India in the coalition cabinet formed until 1917. In the Baldwin cabinet, he served as Foreign Secretary. In 1925, he received the highest honor from the British monarch for his contribution to the promotion of the Locarno Treaties, and also served as Lord Privy Seal for a time.

Austen Chamberlain's father was also a great politician, and the father and son were often referred to together. However, the father was known for his strong and vigorous hand, while Austen was modest, restrained, and quietly contemplative, differing from his father. From a young age, born into a gentry family, his movements, words, and actions displayed a solemn and respectful demeanor. Even with his classmates, he was cautious and self-disciplined, rarely smiling.

Austen Chamberlain's true political career began when he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1903. In 1912, when Conservative Party leader Balfour was waning, Austen had high hopes of being promoted to leader, but was thwarted by Walter Long, and the leadership position ultimately went to Bonar Law. It is said that Austen's birth into an aristocratic family was both his fortune and his misfortune. Superficial commentators often said that Austen owed his prominence to his father's influence, but in reality, Austen possessed his own unique talent and could have become a great politician even without his father's help. However, Austen lacked political ambition. It is said that he could only be a conscientious and meticulous official, serving with the demeanor of a great minister, but lacking the special talent for political construction.

Austen was a powerful administrator, eloquent, and when the Conservative Party was in opposition for the past decade, Austen's influence in Parliament grew. In his later years, he was particularly known for his invincible eloquence. He had no close friends, but was loved by his colleagues for his kindness and approachability. After the European War, he devoted himself to the cause of European peace and was known for his pro-French stance. It was said that Austen loved France as a man loves a woman, but Austen himself said that the Anglo-French friendship was the foundation of true peace, and that he was not so infatuated with a woman as to forget his obligation to treat others with impartiality.

After the failure of the Geneva Agreement, Austen sought to build peace on another foundation, so that Germany and its former enemy countries could enter into treaties to maintain the situation in Western Europe, while the borders of Eastern Europe could not be altered by means of war. In 1925, the Locarno Treaties were concluded, with Germany, France, and Belgium agreeing not to attack each other, and Britain and Italy serving as guarantors of the treaty. Germany also agreed with Poland and Czechoslovakia to maintain peace in the East, and through Austen's mediation, Germany joined the League of Nations as a member. Afterwards, the British monarch awarded Austen the highest honor for his contribution to the achievement of peace, and in the same year, Austen and U.S. Vice President Charles Dawes jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize.

### Paris Mourns the Loss

[Paris] The news of the death of former British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain has been received with widespread mourning in France. Foreign Minister Delbos told a reporter from this agency that Sir Austen Chamberlain's achievements were outstanding, and the people of France have the utmost respect and admiration for him. The cause of peace is the noblest of ideals, and Sir Austen Chamberlain, with this ideal in mind and a pragmatic spirit, was not only a believer in peace but also worthy of being called a pragmatist. This is comparable to his friend, the late French Foreign Minister Briand. Many of the League of Nations' great achievements were accomplished by Austen Chamberlain and Briand in Geneva and Locarno. All peace-loving nations will praise their virtues, and the names of these two sages will be immortal. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas)

### Heavy Rains Continue in Southern England

River Levels Continue to Rise, Dam Breaks Feared

[London] In the past twenty-four hours, heavy rains have continued in the Fenlands of southern England, and river levels have risen further. The dikes are in imminent danger. If they collapse, hundreds of square miles of land will be flooded. Last night, radio stations issued warnings, ordering residents to be prepared to evacuate at any time. Personnel reinforcing the dikes have been working tirelessly for three days and nights and are feeling very tired. This morning, several areas appeared to be slightly more secure, allowing for a brief rest. However, the rainfall has intensified, and river levels in many areas are now higher than the surrounding fields. If the dikes do not contain the rising water, the surrounding fields will be flooded. A landslide has occurred between Folkestone and Dover, endangering the railway, causing trains to be suspended. Huge cracks have appeared in the ground, and further subsidence is feared. According to weather forecasts, there is no expectation of an immediate cessation of the heavy rains. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)

### Tragic Mine Fire in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan

Poisonous Gas Prevents Rescue Efforts; Fifty-Four Miners Feared Dead

⊙Shizuoka Following the tragic fire at the Osawa Mine in Mount Hakuyetsu on the 15th, authorities made every effort to conduct rescue operations. Forty-one individuals who entered the mine shaft to fight the fire were surrounded and suffocated by poisonous gas. Seventeen miners then ventured into the void twice to rescue them, but none returned alive. Authorities dispatched three suicide squads with gas masks at 4:00 PM, 6:00 PM, and 7:00 PM, but due to the excessive poisonous gas and the imperfection of the masks, they were unsuccessful. They are now awaiting the assistance of the army's anti-gas unit. At midnight, a fourth suicide squad entered the shaft to investigate the internal situation. According to their report, all fifty-four miners had died of asphyxiation, with no hope of survival. At 10:30 AM on the 16th, Major Akiyama of the Narashino Flight School arrived with his troops and immediately prepared for rescue. At 1:00 AM on the 17th, after the poisonous gas had dissipated, they entered the shaft with masks and began to remove the bodies. As of 5:00 AM this morning, a total of thirty-six bodies had been removed. However, around 6:00 AM, the poisonous gas reappeared, forcing them to stop working. Families of the miners who perished came to the scene and wept, and the situation was quite tragic. (17th, Domei News Agency)

### Two Thousand German Antique Books Donated to the University of London

University Students Hold Banners to Protest to the German Ambassador

[London] The German government recently donated two thousand antique books to the Institute of Historical Research here. The German Ambassador, Ribbentrop, personally presented them to the Institute. A group of university students staged a demonstration, expressing their animosity towards Ribbentrop. It was raining heavily at the time, and the students stood in the rain in front of the Institute, holding banners with the words "German University Students Imprisoned," "We Demand Freedom for the Victims of German Intellectual Suppression," etc. When Ribbentrop descended from his vehicle, the students surrounded him, shouting slogans such as "Down with Fascism" and "Fascism Destroys Culture." Ribbentrop, observing this situation, remained calm, pushed through the crowd, and entered the Institute. The protesters then dispersed. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)

### U.S. Reciprocal Trade Agreement Policy Extends to the Far East

Preparing to Negotiate with Japan

[Washington] Government officials today began to study the possibility of extending the reciprocal trade agreement policy to countries in the Far East. It is reported that Japan may be selected first for negotiations, as trade relations between Japan and the United States have been fraught with disputes recently, and the volume of trade between the two countries is particularly large. Japanese officials here have expressed interest in this agreement in private conversations, but formal negotiations have not yet begun. (16th, Kokumin News Agency)

### British Army Budget Totals £60 Million

£7 Million Increase Compared to Last Year; Infantry and Artillery to Be Mechanized

[London] Secretary of State for War Cooper presented the Army Estimates in the House of Commons today, with total expenditures for the Army for the coming year amounting to £63,120,000, an increase of £7,239,000 compared to 1936. In addition, certain expenditures of £19,054,000 will be allocated from the National Defence Public Debt Fund. Cooper stated that it is necessary to maintain an efficient, sufficient, and readily deployable expeditionary force at all times. Regarding the mechanization of the army, the Italian experience in Abyssinia can be learned from. The success of military operations there depended entirely on agility. The progress of British army mechanization is currently satisfactory. The government has decided that a mechanized brigade should consist of a fully mechanized infantry regiment and two light tank regiments. New armored vehicles have recently been manufactured and will be distributed to various units for use this year. The Army authorities are very satisfied with the new light tanks, but the status of medium and heavy tanks is not as well-established. However, research is underway, and a decision on how to design them is expected soon. The mechanization of the artillery regiment is expected to be completed by the end of this year. In recent years, there has been little funding for military equipment, so that the great capacity of British factories to manufacture munitions at the end of the European War has almost disappeared. Therefore, it is now necessary to restore this capacity from scratch. Much progress has been made in a short period of time in the work of re-equipping the entire army. This work is expected to be completed in one or two years. Recruitment for the Territorial Army is very smooth and is now showing improvement. However, recruitment for the Regular Army is less successful because the British people prefer to serve in the Navy and Air Force. Various preferential measures are currently being implemented to encourage enlistment in the Army, such as establishing new training centers for veterans and abolishing the Indian government's system of increasing the service period of British soldiers stationed in India by one year. In the future, soldiers will have four meals a day instead of three, and the deduction from military uniforms will also be abolished. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

### French Communist Party Members Demonstrate Against Fascism

Stones and Bricks Fly in Serious Conflict; Five Dead, Over Two Hundred Seriously and Slightly Wounded; Mobile Squad Forced to Open Fire; Workers Strike in Protest

[Paris] The Parti Social Français, reorganized from the fascist Croix-de-Feu league, held a meeting this evening at the Olympic Cinema near the Clichy Town Hall in the suburbs. A large number of anti-fascist protesters held a counter-demonstration in front of the cinema, and serious clashes soon broke out between the two sides. Mobile squads were dispatched to intervene, and both sides threw stones and glass bottles at the mobile squads. The members of the squads then used their rifle butts to strike back, eventually driving away the crowd. Several gunshots were also heard amidst the disturbances. The conflict ceased at 11:15 PM. Currently, over a hundred vehicles carrying mobile squads are patrolling the streets near the Olympic Cinema and the Clichy Town Hall, and ambulances are also patrolling the city to rescue the wounded. Citizens are talking about the incident in groups of three or five, and everyone is extremely excited. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)

[Paris] Thousands of Communist Party members, each holding bricks, bottles, sticks, etc., gathered in the Clichy district today, intending to disrupt a Fascist Party meeting. Serious clashes broke out between the two sides. According to a police announcement, five people were killed, eighty seriously injured and hospitalized, and two hundred and twenty slightly injured. One hundred and forty police officers and mobile squad members were also injured. Eighteen protesters were arrested. Blum's secretary, Blumel, was hit by a bullet. A mobile squad leader, a city councillor, and several police officers were also among the injured. Prime Minister Blum, accompanied by his secretary, went to the scene of the incident to inspect, and fortunately was unharmed. The crowd also threw bricks and stones at the mobile squad members, who then charged at the rioting crowd and opened fire. The crowd then scattered and fled. The Prime Minister's official residence is now guarded by mobile squad members. Left-wing party members were very angry when they heard that the mobile squad had opened fire. Seven or eight thousand construction workers at the Exposition site declared a one-hour strike in protest. Soon, 1,200 workers at the Ravalet hardware factory also staged a sit-down strike to express their dissatisfaction. The cabinet, fearing that this bloody incident would lead to a serious situation, immediately planned to discuss measures to ban political gatherings. (16th, Kokumin News Agency)

### Details of the Conflict

[Paris] Following the clashes between members of the fascist Parti Social Français and Communist Party protesters in the Clichy suburb last night, it has been learned that a total of six people were killed at the time, including four protesters and two police officers. More than two hundred people were injured, mostly right-wingers. The details of the incident are as follows:

The Parti Social Français held a private meeting at the Olympic Cinema to watch the film "War" (a film based on the Russo-Japanese War). The Communist Party planned to storm the cinema. At 7:00 PM, members of the Parti Social Français left the cinema one after another under police protection. At that time, many workers belonging to the Communist Party gathered in front of the cinema, numbering about three thousand. The authorities had to mobilize a large team of Republican Guards, 500 police officers, and four special armed police squads to suppress the protesters, so that the members of the Parti Social Français could safely disperse. The Communists then demolished the nearby street surfaces and set up obstacles. Bricks and stones flew like rain, and the police charged at the Communists three times, immediately resulting in clashes. Several gunshots were also heard. Police officers then issued a warning, ordering the crowd to disperse, but the crowd ignored it, eventually leading to a serious conflict. At that time, Interior Minister Dormois and Paris Police Commissioner Langellon arrived at the scene after hearing the alert, along with Cabinet Secretary-General Blumel. Blumel was hit by a stray bullet in the armpit and also injured his right leg. He was immediately taken to the nearby Beaujon Hospital for treatment. Prime Minister Blum then personally went to the hospital to express his condolences. After the doctors treated Blumel's wounds, he returned to his residence to recuperate. In addition, Clichy Mayor Auffray was also seriously injured. Finally, all the Communists on the streets were dispersed by the North African Guards, and the police arrested twenty extreme left-wingers, eight of whom were immediately sent to prison and detained. The Ministry of the Interior then issued a statement stating that the authorities are now investigating the cause of the incident and that residents must remain calm.

The Communist Party's organ, L'Humanité, published news of the incident on the front page, in five columns. Two phrases were included: one said "brutal act of provocation" and the other said "conspiracy against public opinion." It also asked, "Who ordered the police to open fire?" "Colonel de la Rocque (leader of the Parti Social Français, who did not attend the meeting today) should be arrested immediately." "The Parti Social Français meeting should have been banned in advance." "Fascist groups should be seriously disbanded." (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)

[Paris] Following the incident in the suburb of Clichy, the number of dead and injured has now been confirmed. Five protesters were killed and eighty injured, some of whom were seriously injured. One hundred and fifty-seven police officers were injured, three of whom were seriously injured, and the rest were slightly injured. Eighty-four detectives and Republican Guards were injured, three of whom were seriously injured, and the rest were slightly injured. In addition, a total of eighteen protesters were arrested, eleven of whom have been released, while the rest are still in detention. State Secretary-General Blumel's gunshot wound is not serious. It is reported that the government will soon issue an order banning all demonstrations that are likely to cause disturbances. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)

### Cabinet Meeting Discusses Aftermath

[Paris] Following yesterday's clash between the fascist French Social Problems Study Party and anti-fascist masses in the suburb of Clichy, the cabinet has scheduled a meeting for 6 PM today to discuss the aftermath. Furthermore, it is learned that approximately 500 people participated in the French Social Problems Study Party's rally yesterday, while the communist demonstration numbered around 10,000. Newspapers have provided detailed accounts of the conflict, but refrained from extensive commentary. Le Petit Parisien reported that upon hearing of the French Social Problems Study Party members' rally at the Olympic Cinema, communist members began to gather near the cinema from 6 PM onwards, with numbers increasing. They threw bricks at the police. Local authorities, recognizing the dangerous situation, urgently dispatched half a battalion of riot police and 300 policemen to suppress the unrest and protect the French Social Problems Study Party members' safe exit from the cinema. The disturbance was finally quelled by 10:30 PM. The right-wing newspaper L'Action Française reported that the secretary-general of the Communist Party, Doriot, arrived at the scene of the incident in Clichy at 10 PM last night. The demonstrating crowds cheered him loudly, but Doriot declined to give a speech. Instead, another leader of the party advised the members to disperse and return home to avoid further complications. The socialist newspaper Le Populaire stated that during the incident, there was no shortage of troublemakers and agitators mixed in with the protesting crowd.

### Western European Four-Power Pact Issue

Britain and France Consult on Germany's Opinions

[London] Germany submitted its response to Britain regarding the new Locarno Pact on the 13th of this month, which has further hardened the differing opinions between Germany and Britain and France on the form of the new Western European pact. Germany's note contains two specific proposals as follows:

㊀ The neutrality of this country should be guaranteed by the four Western powers, namely Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. ㊁ Germany and France should conclude a non-aggression treaty, with Britain and Italy as guarantors and arbiters, so as to determine which is the aggressor in the event of a conflict. It is noted that Germany did not use the term "neutrality" when referring to Belgium's neutrality in its note, but rather used a vague diplomatic expression, the meaning of which is equivalent to neutrality. Germany's plan includes the following points: ㊀ The four powers should provide the same guarantees to Belgium. ㊁ Staff consultations should not be held unless the four powers participate. ㊂ France should not have the right to transport troops through Belgium. ㊃ Belgium should not assist France or any other country under the League of Nations Covenant. Germany insists that the Franco-German non-aggression treaty should be effective under any circumstances. In other words, Germany does not recognize the exceptions specifically permitted by the old Locarno Treaty, which stipulates that actions under Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant are legal. Germany's proposal to have Britain and Italy act as joint arbiters to judge acts of aggression was already rejected by Britain in Germany's previous note regarding the Locarno Pact. The current German note rejects the entire principle of Western mutual assistance, and particularly does not accept Britain's statement that Britain is a guarantor of France and Belgium and must also guarantee its own security. In general, the wording of the German note is relatively modest and does not specifically mention the Franco-Soviet Pact. However, previous difficulties remain undiminished. Germany still wants to freeze and immobilize all Western actions under the League of Nations Covenant, so that it can act freely in the East. This claim is unlikely to be accepted by Britain and France. The only way forward at present is to deal with the Belgian neutrality issue separately and seek a solution without involving Western or general agreements.

### Belgian King to Visit London

To Consult on Belgium's Neutral Status

[London] According to reliable sources, King Leopold III of Belgium will come here for an informal visit in early next week under the guise of participating in golf, to consult with British authorities on the issue of his country's neutral status. According to reports, discussions between Britain and Belgium regarding the King's visit have been ongoing for two weeks. The British government originally intended to invite Belgian Prime Minister Janson or Foreign Minister Spaak to visit, or to send British Foreign Secretary Eden to the Belgian capital while attending the International Chamber of Commerce conference. However, it is generally believed that since the Belgian King delivered a speech in parliament in October last year advocating for his country's return to neutral status, it would be more beneficial for the King himself to personally discuss the matter.

### Work of the London Adjustment Committee Suffers Another Setback

The West Government's Overseas Gold Reserves Issue; Russian Representative Declares Refusal to Discuss

[London] Today, during the meeting of the non-intervention committee subcommittee to discuss the issue of financial assistance to the Spanish warring parties, a dispute arose, leading to a standstill. Prior to the meeting, the Soviet Union sent a letter to the chairman, Lord Plymouth, stating that the Soviet Union was willing to discuss the issue of financial aid to Spain in principle, but did not agree to negotiations affecting the assets of the Spanish government and the gold reserves of the Spanish bank. Later, there was a heated debate on this matter at the meeting, but no solution was reached. With the representatives of Germany and Italy halting this matter, they expressed their unwillingness to continue discussions on other issues such as the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] At today's meeting of the subcommittee of the London Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Conflict, various methods for preventing indirect intervention were examined. The Soviet representative immediately issued a solemn statement refusing to discuss the "neutralization" of the Spanish Republican government's gold reserves stored abroad. Representatives from Italy and Germany replied that since the Soviet Union had adopted this stance, their respective countries would also refuse to discuss other items on the agenda, including the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from various countries. It is generally believed that the subcommittee is currently unwilling to oppose the Soviet representative and will refer the gold reserve "neutralization" issue to a committee of legal experts for study. If that happens, the Soviet Union may refuse to discuss the issue of withdrawing volunteer soldiers in retaliation. However, since the Spanish Republican government has already accepted the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers, with the sole condition that the Nationalist side can do the same, the subcommittee can still resolve this matter even if the Soviet Union refuses to discuss it.

France Urges Britain to Pay Attention

[London] The French government, having learned that 35,000 Italian troops recently landed in Spain, has reportedly contacted the British government, urging it to pay attention and requesting the Adjustment Committee to take action to address the situation. The British government immediately replied, "The information received in London has not confirmed the above news, but instructions have been given to the British Navy at the Port of Gibraltar to conduct an investigation. Once a report is received, a decision will be made on how to proceed." According to well-informed sources, the initial reports from Spain regarding the recent Italian troop landing were of a negative nature. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas dispatch)

### Mussolini Inspects North Africa

Arrives in Tripoli; Presides Over Market Opening

⊙Tripoli The tour of Libyan by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini reached its climax today, as he presided over the opening ceremony of the Tripoli market. The scene was unprecedented. Mussolini, riding a white horse and leading local cavalry, entered the city with a victorious air. He then proceeded to the unveiling ceremony in front of the Colossus of Caesar. At that time, many Italian military planes flew in formation overhead, creating a spectacular sight. Mussolini then went to the market for a tour. He was very interested in the German exhibits. Thousands of people from all over came to participate in the exhibition, including those who traveled hundreds of miles or overcame hardships to cross the Sahara. Mussolini delivered a speech to them, first expressing his admiration for the various achievements made in the eleven years since his last inspection of Libya. He then asked overseas colonial compatriots and Arab people to strive to maintain peace under the protection of the Italian tricolor flag, and assured them that their customs, traditions, and religious beliefs would be respected. Mussolini affirmed that the newly built coastal highway is a clear sign of the progress of the Italian Empire. Mussolini not only did not deny the ambitions of Italian imperialism, but even admitted to it. He stated that his tour was sufficient to show that Italy was determined to maintain and develop its empire, which was consistent with the spirit of a "masculine" nation. When Mussolini mentioned the foreign press, he said that many foreign newspapers used his trip to Libya as a basis for spreading rumors, so sensational rumors have spread everywhere, and the result is only to destroy the mutual trust and peace among nations. Mussolini finally affirmed that Italy is willing to live in peace and cooperate with all countries that share the same ideas. (17th, National Telegram)

### Atrocities Committed by Italian Troops in Abyssinia

Archbishop of Canterbury Asks Government to Pay Attention

[London] The Archbishop of Canterbury today asked the authorities in the House of Lords to pay attention to the atrocities in Addis Ababa, saying that after the attempted assassination of Abyssinian Governor-General Graziani, Italian authorities seemed to instigate or allow Italian soldiers and Blackshirt militias to take retaliatory measures. February 19 and the following two days can rightly be called days of great slaughter. Blackshirts carrying bombs, arson tools, rifles and pistols rampaged among the local people. Local people within the governor's attacked zone and those who possessed weapons were shot on the spot. Italian soldiers roamed around setting fire to houses, and those who tried to escape were killed. It is believed that the number of deaths was between two thousand and six thousand. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Plymouth replied that the government's reports on the matter were very simple, and that Foreign Office Under-Secretary Cranborne's answer to questions from MPs on March 8 could be used for reference.

### Wang Jingwei Arrives in Taiyuan from Nanjing

Accompanies Yan on Flight to Suiyuan to Pay Respects to Soldiers and Civilians Killed Defending the Territory

Taiyuan dispatch. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council, representing the Central Government to participate in the memorial service for the soldiers and civilians killed in Suiyuan in the Republic of China's 25th year defending the territory and resisting the enemy, passed through Taiyuan and met with Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, and Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government. This afternoon (13th), he departed from Nanjing at noon on the Eurasia Aviation Company's No. 18 chartered plane, accompanied by Chu Minyi, Wang Maogong, Lin Baisheng, and secretaries Chen Guoqi, Chen Changtao, and 11 followers. At 4:10 PM, they arrived in Taiyuan. Yan, Zhao, and various military and political officials, civilian officials above the section chief level, military officers above the department head level, as well as representatives from various schools and organizations, and military and political personnel in training, totaling about 2,000 to 3,000 people, were lined up to welcome them at the airport outside the North Gate or the railway station outside the North Gate. From the airport to the city, soldiers and police were stationed along the streets, and security was extremely tight. The temporary residence was set up in the Shanxi Grand Hotel. After Wang alighted from the plane, he exchanged brief greetings with those who welcomed him and then took a car with Yan directly to the hotel. Soon after, Zhao Daiwen, Zhao Pilian, Yang Aiyuan, Zhu Shuguang, Jia Jingde, Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, Zhou Dai, and Rong Hongjie arrived at the hotel in succession, and they held a joyful meeting in the grand living room. Wang reported to Yan in detail the circumstances of the journey. After a dozen or so minutes, Yan excused himself, and the rest of the people also left. Only Zhao Pilian returned to discuss with Wang the itinerary for leaving Taiyuan for Suiyuan tomorrow (14th). Wang decided to depart on the same plane as Yan. If the plane was too crowded, it would fly back and forth between Suiyuan and Taiyuan twice to pick up and drop off passengers.

After Yan took his leave, reporters from various newspapers submitted their name cards to pay their respects. Wang sent Chu Minyi to meet with them on his behalf. Chu briefly discussed the course of Wang's trip and said that Wang would fly to Suiyuan tomorrow (14th) afternoon and attend the memorial service for the soldiers and civilians killed in action the day after tomorrow, representing the Central Government in paying his respects. He would then leave Suiyuan immediately. Whether he would return to Taiyuan for another stay was still undecided. He also said that Wang's liver and diabetes were not completely cured, and the bullet from his assassination attempt had not yet been removed from his back, but it did not matter. He was in good spirits now.

That evening at 7 PM, Yan and Zhao, representing the military and political circles of Shanxi Province, hosted a banquet at the Suiyuan Headquarters to welcome Wang and his party, inviting Meng Bingyue, Mao Kan, and military and political personnel Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, Jia Jingde, Zhu Shuguang, Zhao Pilian, Wang Jingguo, and members of the provincial government to accompany them. During the banquet, Wang and Yan had a very pleasant conversation about the international situation and the problems in the Northwest. They ended the joyful gathering at around 9 PM. Afterwards, Wang and Yan opened up another room and talked for an hour. Wang then returned to the hotel. Because Wang's health had not yet recovered, he politely declined to thank the others in addition to Yan and Zhao's banquet.

The military, political, academic, business, and women's circles of Taiyuan City decided to hold a welcome meeting tomorrow (14th) morning at 10 AM at the Great Self-Reflection Hall of the Suiyuan Headquarters, inviting Wang to attend and give a speech. Wang has already nodded in agreement. The two Suiyuan Headquarters notified all circles this (13th) evening to participate at the appointed time.

Yan decided when meeting with Wang this (13th) evening to fly to Suiyuan on the same plane tomorrow (14th) afternoon. Those travelling with him include Guo Fu representative Zhao Pilian, provincial government chairman Zhao Daiwen, as well as Chu Minyi, Wang Maogong, Suiyuan Headquarters Foreign Affairs Section Chief Xue Chongxi, etc. Other personnel and sacrificial items will be transported to Suiyuan by special military transport tomorrow morning.

Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi telegraphed this (13th) afternoon, saying that Chairman Wang's and Vice Chairman Yan's headquarters have been prepared, welcoming them to come to Suiyuan. A portion of Yan's entourage departed by car this (13th) to Datong and then to Suiyuan.

He also intends to draft "An Announcement to the Officers and Soldiers for Thoroughly Implementing the Military Parade for Defending the Territory and Resisting the Enemy," with the contents: Do not forget the lessons since September 18th. We should be determined, prepare the power to kill the enemy to achieve results, sacrifice and save the country, and continue the spirit of the fallen soldiers, defend the territory, and resist the enemy. Both are scheduled to be distributed when they arrive in Suiyuan. (13th)

### Anhui and Henan Salt Merchants Compete Fiercely to Pay Taxes

Official Offices Collect More Than 14 Million in Guarantee Money; Banks and Salt Merchants Plan to Request Refund of Excess Guarantee Money

Banpu dispatch. In the case of recruiting merchants to contract for the 26th year Anhui and Henan bank additional transport and storage salt, because the competition among the salt merchants was very fierce, in two days, a total of 6.7 million dan was recognized, and the guarantee money collected by the Central Bank reached more than 14 million yuan in national currency. This is an unprecedented record since the opening of Anhui and Henan bank. Considering that the strength of the salt merchants is limited, they all entrusted the local banks in Xinpu and Banpu to pay on their behalf. Now, regarding the excess money, it is heard that the banks and salt merchants intend to demand that the official offices refund the excess guarantee money. However, it is learned that the opinions of the salt merchants are not unified, and whether it can be done is doubtful. Recently, several dozen recognized merchants jointly presented to the ministry, roughly stating that according to Article 1 of the new salt law, "Salt is taxed at the source, and people are free to buy and sell. No one shall be allowed to monopolize." The Anhui and Henan bank has always been a free trade zone. Merchants have always paid taxes and transported without restrictions. Since February 25th, the two Huai transport offices announced additional transport and storage salt and tax payment measures, and they were changed to recruiting merchants to recognize tenancies. At that time, a few self-proclaimed old merchants, wishing to monopolize the contract, falsely accused in the name of the transport merchants' association. As a result, the official offices saw through their intentions and did not care. This year, on February 1st, the two Huai transport offices announced revised Anhui and Henan bank additional transport and storage salt and tax payment measures, which were fair and comprehensive, and all parties were convinced, saying that they could avoid disputes from now on. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the first day, some monopolistic elements, with quick means, entrusted three or four banks in Xinpu and Banpu to pay more than 2.1 million dan in guarantee money on their behalf, and then continued to pay 800,000 dan. According to the regulations, the principal amount of 600,000 dan has reached five times the amount. Their intention is to rely on external forces to strike first and suppress other merchants from daring to recognize and pay, in order to achieve the purpose of monopolization. The recognized merchants have a considerable position in operating Beng salt, and there are still more than 200,000 dan of salt taxed in the 25th year that have not been sold. No matter how these people oppress them, they will never stop operating in the salt industry on the banks of the river. However, the measures stipulate that the bank must guarantee, so they immediately issued a list of names entrusting other local banks to recognize and pay on their behalf, so as to continue the operation and maintain the original business. Unexpectedly, the next day, there were several salt firms that accumulated 700,000 dan. In two days, a total of more than 6.69 million dan was paid (including 2.48 million dan paid on behalf by China, 450,000 dan by Jiangsu, 680,000 dan by Zhejiang Xingye, 1.8 million dan by Jiaotong, 1.2 million dan by Shanghai, 50,000 dan by Guomin, and 30,000 dan by Jincheng), exceeding the principal amount by more than eleven times. These people, because their plan was not sold, intentionally disrupted it, separately telegraphed accusations, and even implicated one or two tax-releasing banks. The recognized merchants are all existing salt merchants, operating in the salt industry in the free zone, which is not contrary in the slightest. As for entrusting the bank to pay the guarantee money and adding slander, it is even more unreasonable. Because all the households that recognized and paid this time were paid on behalf by the bank, the facts are all there and can be reviewed. Please uphold justice, etc. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has instructed the two Huai transport envoys to investigate the case and recover it.

### Jehol Opium Secretly Planned to be Transported to Xiamen

The First Batch of Goods Has Already Been Distributed; Japanese Arrive in Fujian in an Endless Stream

Xiamen dispatch. The pseudo-"Manchukuo" recently sent Yang Song, a Taiwanese senior official of the Colonization Bureau, to Fujian to negotiate the dumping of goods from the Northeast. After negotiating with the famous opium king Ye, they decided to organize the "South China Trade Company" with a capital of 400,000 yuan. The main business, in addition to soybean cake, flour, fertilizer, cement, and Japanese cotton yarn produced in the Northeast, it is said that they also plan to concurrently operate Yanshi produced in Rehe, smuggling it to Xiamen for sale. The transportation procedures are to first transport it from the Northeast to Tianjin, transfer it to Taiwan, and then transfer it from Taiwan to Xiamen. The first batch of goods has already been distributed. The company plans to send Su to Taiwan to transport Yanshi to Xiamen within days.

Taiwanese agricultural and forestry expert Japanese Taguchi Takashi, and Taiwanese calcium cyanamide fertilizer manufacturing technician Zheng Yaoxi, recently arrived in Xiamen, and accompanied by Yu Junhe, an employee of the Xiamen Mitsui Trading Company, went to Zhangzhou on the 13th to inspect agriculture in Longxi and Changtai counties and promote fertilizer. They returned to Xiamen on the 14th. According to Taguchi, the soil in Longxi and Changqin counties is extremely fertile and does not require fertilizer. It is also very suitable for planting sugarcane and tung. On the 15th, Taguchi again accompanied Takeemura Eisho, the head of Mitsui Xiamen, to visit the Heshan Farm, also to promote fertilizer. They left samples. Recently, the Japanese have been paying close attention to the rural areas of Fujian Province. At the end of February, Dr. Iso Eikichi's delegation of the Taiwan Agricultural and Forestry Inspection Team toured the various prefectures of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua, and is still staying in Fuzhou. This time, Taguchi Takashi came again. Furthermore, according to a Quanzhou report, on the 12th, Japanese Taguchi Hide accompanied Taiwanese Zheng Wanghui from the province to Quanzhou, saying that they would go to various places to sell medicines. On the 13th, they went to Anhai and Shishi. Recently, there have been foreigners of unknown origin coming and going in Quanzhou. (March 17)

### Consul-General to Singapore Petitions for Repair of Wan Qing Yuan

—The Garden is a Revolutionary Site—

Singapore Dispatch. Wan Qing Yuan at No. 12, Teochew Bridge Road, Singapore, was the Singapore alliance site of the early Kuomintang organization, the Revive China Society, and also the Prime Minister's residence in the early days of his planning of the revolution in Singapore. At that time, this garden was rented from a Cantonese house owner by Singapore comrades. Now, the garden has been in disrepair for a long time, and all the roofs are almost completely decayed, and the wooden walls have also been broken. It is truly a wasteland of weeds, broken tiles, and ruined walls. However, the appearance still stands tall. The owner is about to order craftsmen to demolish the garden, which has been abandoned for a long time, and sell the broken tiles. Upon hearing the news, Gao Lingbai, the Consul-General to Singapore, thought that it was a revolutionary site, and how could it be demolished. He invited Zhang Rinnan and others, old comrades who had planned the revolution with the Prime Minister in the garden at that time, to get together. Zhang and others looked back on the past, and all of them were moved to tears and were willing to donate money to buy it. They immediately raised 5,100 yuan in national currency and bought it back from the owner. Now Consul-General Gao has telegraphed President Lin and Chairman Chiang of the National Government, requesting funds for repairs, and it will soon be completely renovated.

### Qingdao City Experiences Citywide Water Shortage

City Government Urgently Seeks Relief Measures, and Has Determined Fundamental Steps

Qingdao Correspondence: Due to prolonged drought in Qingdao, water sources have dried up, and the city's drinking water supply is already struggling to meet demand. If this continues, it will become a serious problem. Mayor Shen Honglie previously ordered the waterworks and water source areas to quickly find emergency remedies. He also inspected the water source areas recently. Due to the lack of rain, the water shortage is increasingly severe, causing widespread panic among citizens. Shen, accompanied by Sun Bin, head of the waterworks, and Wang Zhaochen, the plant's chief engineer, went to inspect the various water source areas around 1 PM on the 13th to seek divine remedies. According to Shen, "During this time of year, rainfall has never been plentiful, but this year's drought is particularly severe, a phenomenon unseen in the last thirty years. The water level of Qingdao's water sources has been declining daily, while the city's population and the number of factories have increased sharply in recent years. The city uses about 15,000 tons of water per day. The city government has a comprehensive plan to fundamentally solve the current temporary water shortage. The current relief measures are nothing more than increasing supply and reducing consumption. The way to increase supply is to increase the amount of water from various sources. Currently, in addition to using the steam engines at various water sources, we are also carrying out well-digging projects in Zhangcun River, upstream of the Licun River Water Plant. This project will be completed in about 14 days, and it can supply about 1,500 tons of water per day. The well-digging project in Xiliuzhuang is also progressing actively and will be completed in about ten days, and it can supply about 1,000 tons of water per day. The Huangbu to Baisha River water source area will also start construction today, and although tomorrow is a Sunday holiday, we will still recruit workers to carry out the project. It is expected to be completed in early April. The water volume there is greater than the other two places, and it can supply about 5,000 tons of water per day. It is estimated that the current shortage in the city is about 1,000 tons. After the completion of the above three projects, there should be no shortage of drinking water in the city. As for the method of reducing consumption, the competent authorities are now consulting with various factories and businesses to save as much as possible. At the same time, it is also hoped that users will not waste drinking water, which will also help in reducing consumption."

Regarding the cause of the water shortage, the person in charge of the waterworks said, "Since a heavy rain fell at the end of July last year, more than eight months have passed without heavy rain, causing the water source to dry up and causing panic. In the past, the average daily output was more than 17,000 tons, but now it is only more than 15,000 tons, which is more than 2,000 tons less than in the past. This is the main reason for the water shortage. In recent years, large-scale factories in the city have been expanding, and the number of newly established factories is also very large. According to current calculations, the large factories in the urban area, such as Suzuki, Gongda, Toyota, Tongyu, Huaxin, and other twenty factories, account for about 50% of the total water consumption in the city. This is also one of the reasons for the water shortage. Other reasons, such as the continuous increase in the number of users and the increasing consumption, are also related."

As for the relief measures, the following have been decided: ㊀ The city's water sources originally had five locations: the east and west Licun plants, Haibo River, Baisha River, and Machang. We have tried our best to store water to meet emergency needs. We are also collecting water flow and digging wells for emergency relief in Xiliuzhuang, Zhangcun River, and other places. This project can be completed in a few days. These two places can produce about 3,500 tons of water per day, which can make up for the current shortage. ㊁ The largest consumers of water in the city are the major factories. The Social Affairs Bureau and the Waterworks have convened responsible persons from various factories to discuss relief measures. From now on, within the possible range, all factories should save as much as possible. ㊂ From now on, all ships sailing from this port to Dalian are not allowed to load water in the city. ㊃ The Waterworks has ordered all water spigots in the city to be fully opened, and people can draw water freely every day. It also notified citizens to try their best to save water and not to waste it.

The city's waterworks feels that the amount of water from the existing water sources is not enough for the city's supply. It originally planned to build a dam at Yuezikou to store water as a fundamental plan. However, the entire construction cost of this dam project is about more than 6 million yuan, which is a large amount. The financial resources are temporarily insufficient, so a step-by-step approach is proposed. The first step is to drill wells and set up a factory in Huangbu, which is close to Yuezikou. The Huangbu will set up a water tower and pipe to Sifang Beiling. A reservoir will be built in Beiling to distribute the water volume. According to statistics, this plan includes ㊀ drilling 40 wells, ㊁ 5,000 meters of water intake pipes in the river, ㊂ building an office and dormitory, four water pumps, water meters, and other equipment, ㊄ adding 20,000 meters of 650 mm diameter water pipes, ㊅ a reservoir, ㊆ water distribution pipes: 3,000 meters in Zhan Shan, 5,000 meters in Taitung Town, 4,000 meters in the Sifang dangerous industrial zone, and 3,000 meters in Cangkou. The above items require a total of more than 2 million yuan. After the completion of this project, it can increase the water supply by more than 10,000 tons per day. In the future, after the completion of the second step of the dam construction project, it can increase the water volume by more than 10,000 tons per day.

### Taicang

Household Registration Police Harass Good Citizens

Gui Gang, a household registration police officer in the third district of this county, suddenly went to the district to arrest Wang Dusheng, a villager, under the pretext of collecting taxes. He beat him severely and escorted him to the Pailou Market before showing a warrant for Wang Zengye and Duji, who owed taxes from the 22nd capital and eighth figure in the 23rd year. Wang said that the land tax had been paid at the designated Second District Office and held the Tai character No. 69 receipt. He went to the county government to exchange it for a new receipt but had not received it. The police then released Wang Dusheng. Wang was unwilling to be beaten and humiliated, so he presented the photo taken when he was insulted to the provincial government. The provincial government asked why the land tax had been paid but the receipt had not been exchanged. They asked the county to investigate whether there was any double taxation.

### Kunshan

Thoroughly Register Private Schools

According to the investigation, there are quite a few private schools in this county.

The principals and education committees of nearby elementary schools will also be designated to guide and improve teaching methods. Those with excellent results will be given bonuses by the Education Bureau. After this registration, if unregistered schools are found, they will be ordered to close down and will not be tolerated.

### Changshu

West Section of Huan Shan Road to be Built Slowly

The Huan Shan Road is being built in this county. Currently, the road base from Hanbeidou, Jingdianfu, Sanfeng, Ludian to Jiaoxiang has been completed by the Zhaiciguteng and Yuzhen laborers. Now, the section close to the west mountain has many ancient tombs, including those of Qian Muqi, Wang Shigu, Huang Dachi, Weng Tonghe, and national hero Wang Tie. Moreover, the destruction of farmland and houses is also a great sacrifice. After the request of local people, it was decided to change the road and widen the original mountain road. The conscription of laborers will be carried out along the mountain. The Zhuangding of Shangqian Town are all bricklayers and carpenters. If they are conscripted to build roads, the road widening and house building projects in the city will inevitably be delayed. Therefore, the Construction Committee has decided to extend the construction period of the West Mountain Road by one month.

### Kang Ti Tennis Club Seeks Sponsorship Members This Season

In Order to Achieve Economic Stability

Organizing the Courts and Preparing to Open

The Kang Ti Road grass tennis court in this port has improved its club affairs and achieved remarkable results since the Sports Association and the Chinese Sports Association jointly took over it last year. The tennis season is approaching, and the authorities discussed the matter a few days ago and decided to reorganize the organization and management this season to make the court the only complete grass tennis court for Shanghai people. The details are described below:

Last Year's Financial Situation

It was found that the Sports Association and the Chinese Sports Association took over the court last year because they could not bear to see it abandoned. Each allocated 1,000 yuan as a takeover fee. After a year of operation, although the court has been completely renovated and the club affairs are booming, the financial situation is extremely difficult. In total, during the past year, due to the payment of construction and land rent and other fees, in addition to the takeover fee of 2,000 yuan, all of it has been used up, and there is a deficit of several hundred yuan. If it continues to be run this year, the persons concerned feel quite courageous.

Seeking Sponsorship Members

In the past, the economic source of the court was entirely based on the membership fees paid by the members to maintain it. However, due to the small income, it was felt that it was not enough. Therefore, if no other way is found, it will be difficult to continue to maintain it. For this reason, this season, special sponsorship members have been added, and it is planned to have enthusiastic sports people from all walks of life to take on the role. It is estimated that each sponsorship member will pay a fee of 100 yuan, in order to use this income to inject funds, so that the foundation of the court can be stabilized and there is no risk of interruption.

The Courts are Heavily Reorganized

It is learned that Sun Yaodong, an old member of the association, is very concerned about the situation in the association and will rise up to sponsor and will also recruit sponsorship members on his behalf. The persons in charge of the two associations are also proceeding separately. It is hoped that enthusiastic sports people from all walks of life will act bravely and enthusiastically sponsor, so that the court can continue to be maintained. It is also heard that the court will greatly reorganize the court affairs and management methods, and the detailed situation will be announced later.

### Zhejiang Education Department Rewards Excellent Private Schools with Improved Practices Throughout the Province

Regulations Change to Standards of Substitute Elementary Schools

The Zhejiang Education Department believes that improving private school facilities and enriching private school content is sufficient to make up for the shortcomings of school education and promote the completion of compulsory education. The central government has regarded this work as an important task. The department has previously issued various measures for improving private schools and ordered compliance. So far, after examining the general situation of private schools in the past, due to little guidance and lack of funding, most have not actively improved. However, there are indeed many who have worked hard to innovate and have achieved excellent results. These excellent private schools should be shown standards and evaluated, so as to move into the normal track of school education. At the same time, subsidize their expenses to make the content more perfect. As for private schools that are not well-managed, they should be actively guided first and should not be banned hastily.

### Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting No Fault-Finding with Schools

Considering Facts and Law

The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "Sir, according to a letter from the Daozhong Girls' Middle School, our school recently received two letters from the Public Works Department, stating that for fire safety reasons, we are required to immediately rebuild properly enclosed standard staircases or install two new staircases within two months, and remove all the other six staircases, and also ordered to submit drawings for approval before implementation, otherwise subsidies will be permanently cancelled, etc. Such unwarranted fault-finding forgets the established facts and acts as if interfering with retroactive laws, disregarding the difficulties of school operators and the motivation of the Public Works Department in providing subsidies. We truly do not understand the intention of the fire personnel, which is truly profound and unfathomable. From our research, all fault-finding can be disguised with plausible theories to deceive people. Therefore, the British people strongly oppose retroactive laws, and in law, there is an iron principle of non-retroactivity. Although the Public Works Department fire personnel are aware of this, we do not wish to discuss legal principles and established facts. However, for the sake of education and the assumed good intentions of the fire personnel, the estimated cost of reconstruction is about four thousand yuan (previously estimated at one to two thousand yuan, but according to current engineers, the required funds are as stated above). If the Public Works Department provides a subsidy, we would be happy to do so, and it would show that the Public Works Department truly values education." The matter has been reported to the Association, and we hereby write to your department, requesting that you consider the facts and legal principles to avoid deviating from the motivation for subsidies.

### Social Bureau Notifies Middle and Primary Schools to Pay Hygiene Fees by Deadline

Payment Due by the End of This Month

The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued an order to municipal middle and primary schools, stating: "It has been found that the Shanghai Municipal Health Education Committee previously sent a letter requesting that all schools uniformly collect hygiene fees starting from this semester, and this Bureau has already forwarded instructions for compliance. It is now found that two months have passed since the start of this semester, and the hygiene fees have not been reported and paid, which is highly inappropriate. In addition to separate orders, we hereby order the schools to comply and remit the hygiene fees collected, including those already collected from the last semester, to the Bureau by the end of March without delay. This order is hereby issued."

### Vice President Kong Invited Mingxian School Directors to a Meeting Yesterday

### Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association Holds Its 4th Annual Meeting

On the 28th of This Month at the YMCA

The Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association has been established for four years and has made outstanding achievements in promoting educational films in the city, such as screening educational films in schools on a rotating basis each semester.

### Ministry of Education Orders Normal Schools to Emphasize Statistics

Preparing to Improve Education Statistics Work

The Ministry of Education issued a notice to the education bureaus of all provinces and cities on the 16th, stating: "Investigating how education can be improved depends on the representation of statistical figures. Therefore, statistical work is extremely important. Considering the current educational statistical work, the most difficult part is the local education departments in counties and cities. Although there are those who conscientiously handle it, the majority are perfunctory. The reason is that most educators have not fully recognized the significance of statistical work and understood the methods of handling statistics. To improve this situation, in addition to providing guidance by educational administrative organs at any time and place, we should also fundamentally seek remedial measures. Normal schools are places for training primary school teachers and local education administrators. To improve local education statistical work in the future, we must first provide sufficient and appropriate training to current normal school students of all types. All types of normal schools have subjects such as primary school administration, education testing, and statistics. When teachers teach these subjects, they should not only explain the theory of statistics but also practice practical matters. This practice should not only be about applying various formulas but also about registering and organizing basic materials. It is necessary to ensure that all handled matters are first registered and organized in detail before various formulas can be used to indicate various relationships; otherwise, errors will inevitably occur. Students must also first develop the habit of accurately registering materials so that they can be competent and happy when serving. To achieve this goal, the following two measures are specifically formulated: 1. When teaching statistics, more emphasis should be placed on practice. The statistical work of each normal school should be guided by teachers to allow students to participate or assist as much as possible within the scope of possibility. Those with affiliated primary schools should make full use of opportunities to verify and become proficient. 2. When teaching statistics, matters that should be handled or reported in the primary school regulations promulgated by the Ministry and the Statistics Law and its Implementation Rules promulgated by the National Government should be explained in detail so that they have a deep understanding of the system of current statistical work and the important matters of education statistics. The above two items are related to the future of local education administration and are extremely important. Please instruct all types of normal schools under your jurisdiction to strictly comply to achieve results. This order."

### Private School Association Held Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting Yesterday

Refuting the Public Works Department's Letter

Holding a General Meeting in the Shortest Possible Time

The Shanghai First Special District Private School Association held its sixth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the association's office at 4 PM yesterday. The attendees included Cui Jianwu, Hu Shuyi, Chen Jicheng, Feng Yixian, Zhang Lingfei, Sun Yucai, Ge Youren, Lin Zhengong, Feng Dafu, Tang Zengyun, Li Guixiong, Yu Shenzhai, Qi Juechen, and Wang Baochang, among others. Feng Yixian chaired the meeting, and Sun Yucai recorded the minutes. The chairman first reported on the association's affairs, stating that the work in the association is intense and it is planned to hire one Chinese and one Western secretary each starting next week to facilitate the work. Subsequently, the following resolutions were passed: (1) To convene a general meeting in the shortest possible time to report on the association's affairs and discuss future plans; (2) To set the regular meeting time from 5 to 6 PM every day, extending it by a maximum of one hour; (3) The Public Works Department's deadline for renovation was refuted because the reasons were not justified. It is now learned that the original letter is as follows:

Refuting the Original Letter: Sir, according to reports from various members, the Public Works Department sent a letter dated February 9th, signed by Director He De Kui, stating, "It has been found that most schools subsidized by this Bureau are in unsuitable buildings that are prone to fire hazards. After consideration, this Bureau has formulated measures, instructing the schools to quickly improve within three months after receiving the letter, otherwise subsidies will be permanently cancelled. This is hereby notified." According to the association, before the subsidies began, the facilities of each subsidized school had been deemed satisfactory by the Public Works Department. Now, they are suddenly referred to as prone to fire hazards, which is intentionally demanding. As for the measures of quickly improving within three months, otherwise subsidies will be permanently cancelled, it is even more difficult to accept and cannot be acknowledged. We hope that you will negotiate to cancel these measures. According to this, after investigating, the facilities of all schools under this association were indeed surveyed by your bureau multiple times before the subsidies began and were deemed satisfactory. The schools have been safe and sound, and no accidents have occurred. Now that the number of students in each school remains the same and the facilities remain the same, your bureau suddenly deems them prone to fire hazards and threatens to permanently cancel subsidies, which is truly perplexing. If the buildings are truly prone to fire hazards and cannot be subsidized, then your bureau's past subsidies were a mistake. If they can be applied, then the formulated measures are demanding. One of the two must be true. We ask your bureau to clarify. Furthermore, Chinese and foreign laws are not retroactive. Therefore, this association considers this notification from your bureau to be "retroactive law" and difficult to acknowledge. We hope that you will cancel it immediately."

### This Year's Puppet Binjiang Province Expands Enslavement Education

### Kodama and Others Arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday Morning

Banquet Held at International Hotel Last Night, China-Japan Trade Association to Hold General Meeting Today

A Central News Agency report states that Kodama Kenji and others from Japan, who are here to attend the first general meeting of the China-Japan Trade Association, arrived in Shanghai on the 14th.

Chairman Delivers Speech During the banquet, Chairman Zhou Zuomin delivered a welcome speech, saying, "It is a great honor tonight to have Chairman Kodama, Ambassador Xu, Mayor Wu, and leaders from various political, business, educational, and personal connections from China and Japan present. On behalf of all members of this association, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and welcome. Especially to Chairman Kodama and all the members who have come from afar, we are very fortunate. However, due to the short notice and the large number of guests, there may be some shortcomings in the arrangements, and the food and wine may not be exquisite enough, or the seating may not be appropriate. We apologize deeply and ask for your forgiveness. The year before last, the Chinese Economic Delegation visited Japan and received warm hospitality from the Japanese government and people. We have not forgotten this to this day. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to express my gratitude to Chairman Kodama and the Japanese members. Since the beginning of this new year, we have been pleased to hear many opinions from the Japanese government and people regarding the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations. Recently, the diplomatic authorities of both countries have also solemnly declared that relations between the two countries should be based on the principle of mutual equality and mutual benefit. Chairman Kodama and the Japanese members have prestige and power in the economic circles of friendly countries, and it is fitting that they should come to China at this time, which is a harbinger of the improvement of relations between the two countries. This is a matter of great joy to our association and should be a cause for comfort to the people of your country. The aim of our association is to promote the development of trade between the two countries. The development of trade between the two countries depends on the development of the economies of both countries and the harmony of the feelings of the people of both countries. Today, I would like to express my feelings, and I hope you will correct me. China and Japan have close geographical, historical, racial, and cultural ties. These relationships are all natural and cannot be created by human power. Therefore, the people of the two countries should have feelings like those of brothers. The economies of the two countries should also have considerable development based on this natural relationship. However, the actual situation is not as we imagined, and the feelings of the people are not harmonious, and the economic development is not smooth. The facts are clear and cannot be denied. The root cause is that political obstacles occur from time to time. To break this deadlock, we must first find ways to eliminate these obstacles before there is a path to follow. Politics and economics are closely linked. In the current political environment, the two countries have made efforts in economic cooperation, and there have been many discussions on all sides, believing that the development of the economies of the two countries is mutually beneficial. This insightful view is often shared by people of insight on both sides. However, some say that the maintenance and acquisition of economic rights and interests should be backed by strength, or that cooperation can be used as a means, or that economic cooperation should be based on the premise that its main body can survive. These arguments are based on different positions and different interests, so there are inconsistent views. We firmly believe that if we want to achieve true economic cooperation between the two countries today, the people of both countries must first have a far-sighted new understanding. If this new understanding can become a reflection of public opinion and national policy in both countries, then the permanent foundation of cooperation can be established. The far-sighted new understanding we are talking about is whether the people of both countries should carefully examine the current world situation and the national conditions of both countries and their respective positions, and mutually recognize the national consciousness of the other party. To put it bluntly, the phrase 'coexistence and co-prosperity' has long become a cliché, but in the current period, the meaning of coexistence and co-prosperity needs to be examined more deeply. That is, whether the happiness of the two countries depends on the stability of East Asia, and whether the stability of East Asia depends on the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries. If a part of the people insist on their own survival and prosperity, can it be enough for the permanent happiness of their nation? If not, then the conditions for mutual survival and prosperity must be respected, and the realization of these conditions must be understood and assisted. All past and present situations should be reviewed based on new understandings, and corrections should be made within the necessary range. Only then can the knots between the two major ethnic groups be completely harmonized, and true cooperation can be achieved here. This is what we firmly believe. If the people of both countries share this belief, we deeply hope that we will work together to realize it. Chairman Kodama and his colleagues are extremely concerned about the relationship between the two countries. Especially Chairman Kodama's recent remarks are extremely precise, and we deeply admire them. The results of your inspection this time will surely benefit the relations between the two countries and the feelings of the people. Recalling that since the establishment of this association, due to the poor environment, we have made no progress and are extremely ashamed. This first general meeting is honored by the presence of Chairman Kodama and the members, and we should seize this opportunity to open our hearts and discuss practically how to help eliminate the obstacles between the two countries, how to harmonize the feelings of the people of the two countries, and how to develop trade to fulfill the mission of this association and live up to the expectations of all parties in both countries. All of you present tonight are the most authoritative people in all circles of the two countries. We earnestly hope that you will give this association as much guidance as possible so that we can act as a guide. With this humble wine, I would like to express my respect and wish you all good health."

Kodama's Reply Chairman Kodama then delivered a reply, saying, "We arrived in Shanghai on the 14th and went to Nanjing, and returned here this afternoon. We are deeply grateful to Chairman Chiang and the government authorities in Nanjing for their cordial reception. Today, the China-Japan Trade Association is hosting such a grand banquet for our group and giving us the opportunity to meet with local influential people. We are especially grateful. We have made considerable efforts to increase the friendship between China and Japan and to strengthen the economic interdependence between the two countries. The organization of a trade association last year with the cooperation of influential people in the economic circles of your country was also the first step towards realizing this expectation. However, as Chairman Zhou has stated, if relations between the two countries cannot be developed, and if the feelings of the people are not cautious, there may be a tendency towards confrontation. It is regrettable that our efforts cannot achieve the desired effect. This time, the Trade Association is holding its first general meeting in Shanghai, and we are very pleased to be able to meet with old friends and other influential people in the financial world. We are even more pleased that this opportunity will allow us to exchange opinions frankly, increase mutual understanding, and strengthen the foundation of economic cooperation. We sincerely hope that the unpleasant state of affairs in the two countries will clear up immediately and that the relations between the two countries will be stabilized again. We firmly believe that this is a matter of urgency. To promote friendly relations between the two countries, we must first communicate the will of the people of both countries and make them blend together. Secondly, all confrontational, suspicious, and antagonistic concepts should be eliminated. We must respect each other and trust each other. We firmly believe that this is very important. What we hope for, as Chairman Zhou has just said, is that the two countries will maintain friendly relations as good neighbors and brothers, cooperate with each other, and achieve peace and prosperity in the East. Economically speaking, under the principle of mutual benefit and equality, we should have relevance and make the relationship of mutual dependence increasingly close. On the one hand, if we forcibly sacrifice the interests of the other party to carry out economic cooperation, we believe that it should be thoroughly rejected. If there are any misunderstandings about the above points, we hope that they can be fundamentally eliminated, and we also hope that all influential people will work together to do so. In recent years, there have been many political problems between the two countries, and even times when diplomatic relations have been in danger. This phenomenon is of course not easy to solve, but we believe that it lacks the spirit of 'loyalty and forgiveness,' and we think that there is a need for reflection. If we can understand and trust each other at this time, eliminate the misunderstandings of the past, respect each other, and work together to achieve peace and prosperity in the East, and fulfill the fundamental mission of the two countries, this is the responsibility of the people of both countries. Recently, your country has made obvious progress in politics and economy, which is very gratifying. We would like to express our deep respect for these efforts. We will not hesitate to provide assistance to your country's efforts. I dare to tell you this. We are very grateful for your warm hospitality. I would like to offer a toast to your health." Finally, the Chinese band played music to add to the fun. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at about 10:00 PM.

Today's General Meeting The first general meeting of the China-Japan Trade Association is scheduled to be held today at 3:00 PM at the grand hall of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the Tianhou Palace. Members from both China and Japan will attend. The agenda of the general meeting is as follows: (1) Opening of the general meeting; (2) Chairman's report on the purpose and affairs of the association; (3) Chairman's welcome speech; (4) Discussion of the association's charter; (5) Discussion of motions; (6) Photo session and adjournment. In addition to attending the meeting, Japanese members will also attend a symposium at Zhou Zuomin's residence in the morning at Zhou Zuomin's invitation, and have lunch at Zhou's residence.

Our traditional Chinese medicine community has specially united to hold the third commemoration meeting. It is a great honor to have you all here.

I can only say a few simple words: First, we must unite; second, we must strive forward. Although this is old news, if we want to revive traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals, we must start here. Due to time constraints, I will have to ask representatives from party and government agencies and guests from various sectors to speak. Please forgive me, and I hope you will all understand."

Party and Government Speeches Following the Chairman's report, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech, briefly stating, "I have attended previous grand meetings held by your industry and have always seen a thriving atmosphere. This meeting is particularly enthusiastic. This is truly a good phenomenon for the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries, and it is the glory of the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries. The spirit of struggle of your colleagues over the years is deeply admirable. Not only has it made the government pay more attention to your esteemed industry, but it has also gained the sympathy of the general public. I hope that your colleagues will work harder to promote the quintessence of Chinese culture." Then, Tao Ji'an, representative of the Municipal Health Bureau, delivered a speech, briefly stating, "I am very pleased to attend the third National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day commemoration meeting held by your industry today. Traditional Chinese medicine has its own strengths and has a deep relationship with the nation and the people. Therefore, I hope that the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries will be able to learn from the strengths of others, make up for their own shortcomings, and strive for progress based on the spirit of modern science, so that they can benefit society in no small way."

Chairman's Reply Finally, Chairman Shen Zhongfang delivered a reply, briefly stating, "Today, the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries have jointly held the National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day commemoration meeting. We are deeply grateful for the encouragement from representatives of party and government agencies and guests from all sectors. I hereby give this reply." The meeting was then adjourned.

Donations for Commemoration The traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical colleagues in Shanghai, in order to celebrate National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day and consolidate the foundation of the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industry, donated a percentage of their entire day's business income and consultation fees to the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Museum for the construction of the museum's buildings and the strengthening of its internal equipment.

Director Jiao's Speech Zhang Zhongyu, representative of Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Museum, delivered a speech, briefly stating, "It is a great honor for me to represent Director Jiao at your meeting today. In recent years, the efforts of colleagues in the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries have allowed traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to be treated equally. The passage of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations by the Legislative Yuan has provided a solid legal basis for the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries. In the future, in order to improve itself, the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries should establish traditional Chinese medicine schools and strive to improve the traditional Chinese medicine industry. It is also hoped that the government will add traditional Chinese medicine to medical and health institutions. The recent establishment of a traditional Chinese medicine committee in the Ministry of Health is of great importance to the future of traditional Chinese medicine. In the future, under the guidance of the government, China's medical community will be able to make greater progress. I recall that in recent years, advanced countries have paid attention to the traditional Chinese medicine industry. For example, the Heath Belt and circulation invented in France are based on the same principles as acupuncture in Chinese medicine. The American newspaper in San Francisco reported that in the United States, there are very dangerous diseases that have been cured by traditional Chinese medicine, so it praised traditional Chinese medicine in particular. The Soviet Union has now established the Oriental Medicine Research Association, which specializes in the study of the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. Japan has established a Chinese medicine lecture and has Imai Kyoun, President of the Ohone Kampo Medical College, and Hiki Okisaburo, Professor of the Great Emperor of Japan, specially come to China to investigate the traditional Chinese medicine industry. All of this proves that traditional Chinese medicine has an indelible value. In other places such as North Borneo, the Philippines, Siam, Annam, the United States, San Francisco, Batavia, and Surabaya, the traditional Chinese medicine industry is very prosperous. Therefore, I deeply hope that the Chinese medical and pharmaceutical communities will rise up and strive to bring glory to the industry and seek happiness for mankind."

### The Yugu Village Case Was Resolved Yesterday

Temporarily Under the Guise of Remuneration Fees; Resolving the Issue Through Re-Negotiation; All Obstacles Were Removed Yesterday

Regarding the dispute arising from the refusal of residents of Yugu Village to pay property taxes, the solution has been agreed upon by Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government and President Feiyi of the Public Works Bureau. Details were reported yesterday. Secretary-General Lun met with representatives of the homeowners yesterday and continued negotiations with President Feiyi. When the board of directors of the Public Works Bureau held a meeting, the Chinese director also raised questions. Ye Shaoying, a resident of the village, also filed a lawsuit with the consular corps. From 4:00 PM yesterday, the Public Works Bureau began to remove various obstacles, and the issue came to an end. The details are recorded below:

Yu Called on Representatives of Property Owners: In order to quickly resolve the issue, Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government specially summoned Lu Dingkui, a lawyer representing the owners of Yugu Village, at noon yesterday to inquire about his opinions on the matter, and informed him that the Municipal Government was extremely concerned about the case and should resolve it quickly. Lawyer Lu explained the course of the case and the current opposition of most tenants to the Public Works Bureau's collection of police tax, and requested that the Municipal Government directly collect the property tax from the tenants, which could be resolved smoothly.

Continued Negotiations to Re-Establish Measures: Secretary-General Yu, upon the instruction of Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon, continued negotiations with Arnold, the Director-General, and Feixin, the President, of the Public Works Bureau, and re-established the following measures: ㊀ The Public Works Bureau will remove the obstacles and connect the ditches, sewers, etc. within a time limit to restore the original state. ㊁ The Municipal Government guarantees that the residents of Yugu Village, having enjoyed the benefits of roads, ditches, sewers, etc. laid by the Public Works Bureau, will pay the Public Works Bureau a remuneration fee equal to the amount of property tax in the spring of this year in the future. ㊂ The Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau will immediately negotiate the issue of road construction beyond the boundary, and if necessary, find a reasonable partial solution to the property tax issue first. ㊃ If the negotiations yield results, the remuneration fee guaranteed by the Municipal Government to be paid by the residents of Yugu Village will be handled in accordance with the method agreed upon in the future. If the negotiations break down, the Municipal Government will pay the remuneration fee to the Public Works Bureau in accordance with Article 2 of this method.

Chinese Director Raised Strict Questions: At the regular meeting of the board of directors of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, the issue was reported by the Director-General. After the report was completed, Chinese Director Xi Yushu raised questions, stating that this kind of disposal lacked legal basis and endangered the lives of the residents of the village. Xi gave an example to illustrate that if a fire broke out in the village, and the fire truck could not enter because the village gate was tightly closed, would they sit idly by and watch the village be destroyed? However, since Yu and Fei had negotiated a solution, the Director-General only stated the process of the resolved issue.

Resident Representative Filed a Complaint: Ye Shaoying, a lawyer and resident of the village, had previously filed a lawsuit with the consular corps, requesting that the consular corps immediately correct this erroneous act of the Public Works Bureau and ensure that similar incidents would not occur in the future. At the same time, Ye stated in the complaint that he reserved the right to claim compensation from the Public Works Bureau for all losses incurred as a result of this incident.

All Obstacles Were Removed Yesterday: This case had been delayed for a week. Through the negotiations between Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government and the authorities of the Public Works Bureau, as well as protests and opposition from various parties, the Public Works Bureau ordered workers to go to the village at 4:00 PM yesterday and completely remove all obstacles to the iron gates leading to Difeng Road, Daxilu Road, and Yuyuan Road, and open up the ditches and sewers to restore the original state. The case can be said to have come to an end.

### The Municipal Land Administration Bureau Was Reorganized and Established

Seal of Office Put Into Use Today

Since receiving the order to promulgate the Land Law and the Outline of Land Administration Procedures for Various Provinces and Cities, the Municipal Land Bureau has been preparing for the reorganization of the Land Administration Bureau in compliance with the order. All procedures have been completed, and a request has been submitted for the issuance of the Land Administration Bureau's seal of office in order to reorganize and put it into use on a regular basis. It is now heard that the new seal of the bureau has been issued and will be put into use on the 18th of this month.

### Handicrafts Will Be Shipped to Beijing for Exhibition Early Next Month

Industrial and Commercial Circles Should Send Them to the Collection Point as Soon as Possible

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received orders to collect various handicrafts from the industrial and commercial circles in this city to participate in the National Handicraft Exhibition held in Beijing. However, since the collection began, the number of applicants has not been enthusiastic. According to Wu Huanru, the chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the National Handicraft Exhibition held in Beijing this time will feature the finest products selected from all over the country. Although China's industry has gradually made progress towards mechanization, the domestic handicraft industry is still very developed and enjoys a great reputation. For example, the lacquerware of Fujian, the pottery of Yixing in Jiangsu, the porcelain of Jiangxi, and the embroidery of Hunan are all extremely precious. Therefore, there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time. Although this city is an industrial center, most of its products are machine-made, and it seems to be inferior to other places in terms of handicrafts. Therefore, since the collection began, the number of applicants from all parties has not been enthusiastic. However, the scope of this collection is extremely broad. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to contact various parties to select various handicrafts with greater value, and plans to collect and send them to Beijing early next month. It is also hoped that various handicraft manufacturers can send various products to the collection point for shipment to Beijing as soon as possible for publicity.

### The Disaster Situation in Sichuan Is Becoming Increasingly Serious

Fellow Villagers' Representatives Petition in Beijing

Since autumn last year, Sichuan has not had rain for more than half a year, and the disaster situation is becoming increasingly serious. According to a telegram from the Sichuan Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan, in addition to the 38 counties affected by floods in the summer, as many as 93 counties have been affected by drought. Sichuan has a total of 148 counties, and only more than 10 counties have not been affected. Currently, the ponds and dams are dry, and drinking water is difficult to obtain. The disaster victims in the most severely affected counties have nothing to eat, not even the bark and roots of trees, and can only dig up white mud (commonly known as "fairy rice") to prolong their lives. Moreover, the spring famine has already formed, and rice is difficult to plant. Even this year's autumn harvest is hopeless. Tens of millions of disaster victims are wailing in the ravines, urgently hoping that the authorities will save their dying lives. A month ago, the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association here sent three representatives, Lü Yifeng, Mei Xinru, and Li Qingfan, to Beijing to petition. Now, the association has reconvened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and still sent the same three representatives on the 19th to Beijing for the second time to present a petition to the Central Government in conjunction with the Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing.

### Workers at the China Underwear Factory Accepted Advice

Resumed Work This Morning

Xin Sheng She reports that more than 200 workers at the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory on Route Kahnaut in Shanghai, who went on strike seeking improved treatment, have resumed work in the factory this morning after being persuaded by Du Liang, a staff member sent by the Social Affairs Bureau. It is heard that the bureau has scheduled a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th to convene both labor and management for mediation in accordance with the law.

### Party and Government Organs Jointly Issued a Notice Yesterday Strictly Prohibiting Silk Weaving Workers From Striking

Workers at Various Factories Resumed Work One After Another

Xin Sheng Zhi reports: The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued a notice: It has been found that workers have arbitrarily gone on strike and slowed down work, and this committee and bureau have jointly issued notices strictly prohibiting such actions on record. However, recently, workers in various silk weaving factories in this city have successively gone on strike under the pretext of demanding improved treatment, which is extremely inappropriate. At a time when the government is advocating economic construction, the recovery of industry and commerce has just begun to sprout. Workers should share the same boat and make extra efforts with a spirit of mutual assistance, so that production can be increased and the foundation can be consolidated. If the silk weaving workers have legitimate demands, they should negotiate frankly or apply to this bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. Such acts of coercion with strikes must have bad elements inciting them. It must be understood that the labor-management relationship is as close as lips and teeth, and the principle of a strong foundation and prosperous branches is very clear. If they delay and do not resume work, both sides will be hurt. In addition to investigating the leaders and severely punishing them, this notice is jointly issued earnestly, and the silk weaving workers are hereby ordered to comply, resume work as soon as possible, work with peace of mind, and do not lightly believe in rumors or fall into the legal net. This is extremely important.

The Hengfeng Silk Factory Solved the Conditions: The workers at the Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory on Haizhou Road in Shanghai West, who went on strike, resumed work at 11:00 AM yesterday after being persuaded by Zhu Guilin and Ren Jimo, sent by the Social Affairs Bureau. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a mediation was convened, chaired by Ren Jimo and recorded by Jiang Shifu. Both labor and management agreed to sign the following solutions: ㊀ The ruler shall be measured according to the metric system. ㊁ Wages shall be increased by category, with an average of less than 50%. ㊂ Those who wait more than one day for the order shall receive a subsidy of 30 cents per person per day. Those who transform their equipment for more than three days shall receive a subsidy of 30 cents per person per day. ㊃ The night snacks for the employees of the staff department shall be 5 cents per person, and the miscellaneous department shall be 10 cents per person. ㊄ Working hours shall not exceed 11 hours. ㊅ Two days of leave per month shall be given, on the 1st and 16th of each month, and the wages of miscellaneous workers shall be paid as usual. ㊆ The wages of miscellaneous workers shall be increased twice a year, at least by one cent. ㊇ The wages of miscellaneous workers shall be increased by 3 cents per person per day. ㊈ The factory shall not dismiss workers without reason. ㊉ Union members shall be given priority for employment. ㊉㊀ If this contract encounters another unified method of the same industry association and the union, both parties shall apply for revision.

Workers at the Meiya Factory Resumed Work This Morning: The labor-management disputes at the Meiya Tenth Factory at Baziqiao in Zhabei were resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday, and it was stipulated that work would resume yesterday morning. Due to the All-City Silk Weaving Workers Congress, they asked the factory for one day of leave. All the workers held a congress at the May 30th Cemetery, and it was decided that all would participate in the congress at Caojiadu. The workers of the factory have accepted the resolutions of the congress and are allowed to resume work in the factory this morning. Regarding the conditions for improved treatment, they are waiting for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate in accordance with the law. As for the workers of the Meiya Second Factory on Jiaotong Road, it is also decided to resume work this morning and request the Social Affairs Bureau to quickly mediate the treatment conditions proposed by the workers.

Workers at Yumin and Other Factories Resumed Work: After the Silk Weaving Workers Congress passed the resolution to resume work first, the workers of factories such as Shihua Fuxing Meida, etc., who temporarily stopped work yesterday to participate in the congress, all returned to work at 6:00 PM last night. As for the factories that had already gone on strike, such as Yumin Qin Feng Yulun Xieji, etc., the workers also resumed work at 6:00 PM last night. However, the workers of Yuyuan Risheng and other factories resumed work this morning because they were not prepared in time.

### Recent Six-Month Statistics on China's Cotton Industry

The China Cotton Mill Association officially released the following statistics on China's cotton industry for the past six months (July 1, 25th year to the end of December):

Spindles: In the past six months, the total number of spindles in the country was 5,071,122. At the end of June, 25th year, there were 5,010,039. In the second half of the 24th year, there were 4,952,826.

Shutdown Situation: ㊀ Number of shutdown spindles: 1,596,224 in the second half of the 25th year, 1,555,010 in the first half of the year, and 1,360,273 in the second half of the 24th year. ㊁ Average shutdown hours per spindle: 1,699 in the second half of the 25th year, 2,153 in the first half of the year, and 2,443 in the second half of the 24th year. ㊂ Total number of spindles shutdown weeks in half a year: 4.05 weeks in the second half of the 25th year, 5.06 weeks in the first half of the year, and 5.08 weeks in the second half of the 24th year. The shutdown rate of textile mills nationwide has gradually declined since reaching its highest number in the second half of the 24th year. It has decreased sharply by one week in the most recent six months. This is because the yarn sales were strong in the winter of the 25th year, and factories that had reduced or stopped work have resumed operations one after another.

Factory Use of Cotton: ㊀ Chinese cotton: 1,187,548 large bales in the second half of the 25th year (each bale weighs 500 pounds net, same below), 1,072,107 bales in the first half of the year, and 1,062,169 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊁ American cotton: 38,256 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 38,722 bales in the first half of the year, and 69,446 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊂ Indian cotton: 43,468 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 30,589 bales in the first half of the year, and 39,296 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊃ Egyptian cotton: 14,776 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 12,650 bales in the first half of the year, and 12,286 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊄ Other cotton: 9,352 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 1,279 bales in the first half of the year, and 2,036 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊅ Total: 1,293,400 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 1,155,347 bales in the first half of the year, and 1,185,233 bales in the second half of the 24th year. The total number of cotton sales and the number of Chinese cotton sales in textile mills in the most recent six months are the highest records in the past. This is due to the increase in spinning spindles, the small reduction in work rate, and the large increase in domestic cotton production. American cotton has been decreasing year by year since reaching its highest number in the 25th year. The sales volume in the most recent six months has almost approached the lowest number. Egyptian cotton has been increasing year by year. Due to the increasing number of fine yarn spinning, the sales cost of finer raw cotton has also increased. This kind of cotton is still lacking domestically.

Factory Cotton Stock: ㊀ Chinese cotton: 581,873 bales on January 1, 26th year, 343,472 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 332,574 bales on January 1. ㊁ American cotton: 10,121 bales on January 1, 26th year, 18,562 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 18,157 bales on January 1. ㊂ Indian cotton: 1,655 bales on January 1, 26th year, 24,240 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 4,858 bales on January 1. ㊃ Egyptian cotton: 4,930 bales on January 1, 26th year, 4,850 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 3,242 bales on January 1. ㊄ Other cotton: 1,706 bales on January 2, 26th year, 995 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 45 bales on January 1. ㊅ Total: 600,285 bales on January 1, 26th year, 392,127 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 358,876 bales on January 1. The factory stock of Chinese cotton has increased greatly recently due to the bumper domestic cotton production in the previous year and the increase in the number of factories opening.

### The Daughter-in-Law of the American Tobacco King's Honeymoon Trip Is About to Arrive in Shanghai

The Times reports from the Foreign News Agency that Mrs. Duke, the world's richest bride and beauty, and her seventeen-year-old husband will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. The Duke couple just married a few months ago, which caused a sensation in the social circles of the East Coast of the United States, and newspapers reported more. The groom's father is a tobacco king. At the time of the marriage, the groom's family strongly opposed it because the bride was only seventeen and the groom was not of marriageable age. Later, the groom insisted and finally held it as scheduled. At the same time, he temporarily suspended his studies at Harvard University and will probably continue to attend school around September of this year. The newlyweds have traveled to Hawaii and Japan and are now in Beiping and will come to Shanghai soon. They plan to go to Annam in the future, and there are many hunting equipment in their luggage, hoping to capture one or two tigers during the trip. They are accompanied by two loyal old servants.

### The Case of Refusing to Accept Deposit Receipt Was Found to Be Forged

Plaintiff Chen Zhonghuang Becomes Defendant, Police File Charges of Forging Documents

Chen Zhonghuang, a native of Ningbo, 55 years old, lives at No. 4, East Seward Road. He used to be a sailor foreman on the Wanxiang ship of the Shanghai Erbei Company (the ship specializes in opening up Fujian, round trip once every seven days). Last winter, he extended his lawyer to sue Han Maotang, a native of Shaoxing (i.e., the former owner of Nanyang Wine Shop at No. 435, East Seward Road), in the civil court of the First Special District Court for two deposit receipts that were not accepted, ㊀ 3,000 yuan due on December 20 last year, ㊁ 1,500 yuan due on January 10 this year. During the hearing, it was because Han Maotang

Nanyang Wine Shop Sold the Shop to His Cousin Han Maosheng. Han himself lived in Shaoxing and had not been to Shanghai for a long time, so he was notified by public notice. On February 7 of this year, the trial continued. Han Maotang arrived in court with Lawyer Ding Shiba to review the case and observed that the seal on the receipt did not match the original seal and was a forged seal and denied having such a deposit. He requested the court to allow the two receipts to be taken to the fingerprint room of the Hongkou Police to take photos, enlarge them, and study them. After determining whether the upper and lower seals were the same, they would still be

Returned to File. As a result, the judge ruled that the court would not accept the case because the defendant Han Maotang refused to appear in court and transferred it to the Shaoxing Local Court for trial. Unexpectedly, the police took photos of the two receipts and notified Lawyer Ding after finding that the Nanyang Wine Shop seal and the handwriting of Han Maotang signed above and below were inconsistent and were forged. Ding went to Shaoxing to accompany Han Maotang to Shanghai and turned themselves in to the police station. Chinese detective Zhu Jiqiang and Western detective went to No. 4, East Seward Road to arrest Chen Zhonghuang without success. According to his son,

Now Goes to America Or Java, No Date for Return Home. Later, it was found that the Wanxiang ship had returned to Shanghai from Fujian and was docked at Dongjiadu Wharf in Nanshi. Therefore, at about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, they boarded the ship with members of the water patrol police detective team, arrested him, brought him back to the police station for detention, and sent him to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court this morning. Judge Xiao Xiufen attended the court to examine the case. The lawyer of the Public Works Bureau, Zhang Tianyin, described the case and filed a public prosecution for

Forging Documents in Accordance with Articles ○1, 200, and 27 of the Criminal Law. According to Han Maotang, 59 years old, the Nanyang Hotel on East Seward Road was set up by me for as long as seven or eight years. In September last year, it was sold to my cousin Maosheng for more than 1,400 yuan. I did not know the defendant and did not give him a deposit of 4,500 yuan as stated in the two receipts. When questioned the defendant, he claimed that Han Maotang personally gave me the two deposit receipts and there was no forgery. Judge Xiao ruled to remand the defendant and change the date to summon witnesses and re-verify the two receipts after suspending the case.

### The Monsoon Suddenly Changed the Climate

As if a Season Changed Overnight, The Wind Has Not Settled Down Since Yesterday

The monsoon in this port suddenly broke out the night before, and it was very violent, causing a sudden change in the weather. The situation is recorded below:

Monsoon Breaks Out: Since the 14th, the weather in this port has suddenly turned warm, especially the day before yesterday, when it was extremely hot. The temperature at noon rose to over 72 degrees, as if it were the early summer season. Laborers easily wore single brown clothes. There were still people who called for heat. By the time it got late, a tight monsoon suddenly broke out with violent force. The wind blew past the eaves, making a rustling sound.

The Weather Suddenly Turned Cold: Although the heavy rain and strong wind had slightly subsided by midnight, they had not stopped. The wind was still extremely tight yesterday, and the temperature dropped sharply. Compared with the day before yesterday, the season seemed to have changed. Moreover, clouds were floating all day long, and the weather was extremely unstable. Furthermore, due to the northeast wind, the tide level of the Huangpu River was very high.

### Aboard the Desheng Steamer, a Passenger Dies While a Monkey Mourns

His worldly possessions were few, a monkey his companion;
His heart failed, and his life was lost.

On the Jardine Matheson's Desheng steamer, scheduled to depart from Pier Nos. 2 and 3 yesterday for Qingdao, a passenger was suddenly found dead in steerage before the ship was due to leave. A monkey was beside him, mourning. The ship's crew, hearing the sound of the monkey's cries, went to investigate. The deceased was about forty years old, dressed in a blue cloth short coat, with no other possessions except the monkey as his companion. They reported the matter to the customs, who sent a doctor to determine that the deceased had died of heart failure. As per regulations, a court inquest and funeral arrangements were required, so the water police station was notified, and Detective Xu Yaonian was instructed to transport the body to the South Bund Lifesaving Bureau. The monkey was taken to the local court, and a request was made for an examination and disposition. Prosecutor Wang left the monkey in the hospital outside the court and, along with the inspectors, conducted an examination and instructed the hall to handle the funeral arrangements.

### Yellow Head Competition

Mu Ouchu, President of the Shanghai Shicun Society, Vice Presidents Jiang Futian and Wang Dayong, etc., issued a brief announcement to initiate a yellow head competition: "Lamenting that viperous snakes rage and are about to be completely sealed off to the east, and that the Hu horses are forming groups and still spying on the northern borders, we are already forced into a state of being swallowed whole and cannot bear to become rotten fish. If we can be vigilant with ten thousandth of the means, why fear violating the law? Observing and learning to transform customs, we are willing to ask the group. Therefore, we aspire to be Wu Guan in the swamp, emulating the frogs' anger by the roadside, and we keep in mind the chickens' sounds in the middle of the night during the Jin Dynasty dance. Emotive feelings often arise from objects. In Guangdong, there are small yellow-headed birds with tight feathers, protruding heels, and lively glances. They call their companions and firmly fortify their fences together. Although they are only the size of a fist, they possess the courage of ten thousand men. If foreign tribes invade, they will not hesitate to resist with their entire group. When they march high and soar, the masses are not the bird's platform; they ride the wind to compete and surpass with the vigor of a Peng bird spreading its wings. They rely on claws and beaks as spears and shields, and wear feathers as armor. Even if they are disemboweled, they will not return defeated. How often have they had their feathers broken and their heads lowered, dragging their weapons and fleeing? We, the people, lament the quail's return to the case, and with shared hatred, we look forward to the return of the frogs' shade to Lu, so that martial virtue can be promoted. Taking advantage of the rich spring, we are happy to see that the strong servants are healthy. We will hold a competition to see whose magnificent wings soar into the sky, touching the sun with ambition. Hopefully, some cowards will stand up. Alas, it is difficult to fill the sea of hatred. The great wind has risen. We dot the dragon's eyes on the book wall, and we will eventually see it ascend to heaven. We buy a horse's bones at the Golden Platform and eventually recover lost ground. The meeting has a special loss of ambition; why ever express sympathy? We only hope to attend the appointment. The date is the 25th day of the fourth month of the 26th year (that is, the 15th day of the third month in the old calendar), Sunday. The location is Bansong Garden in the southern part of Shanghai. The prizes are flower decorations. Comrades from all regions who wish to come to Shanghai to participate in the competition must immediately request a registration form from Suo Jinglai, lest they miss out. The address is Mu Ouchu, 260 Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai."

### Throwing Manure at the Buddha's Head

The Jade Buddha Temple's Monk Suffers Insult, Two Manure-Throwers Caught on the Spot

The abbot Zeng Chenzhen of the Jade Buddha Temple at No. 280, Fourth Pinlang Road, one of the city's four major monastic forests, was riding in a taxi numbered 10469, driven by Dong Zhaorong, at 10:20 AM the day before yesterday, intending to go to Haining Road. When passing Gordon Road near Haifang Road, a man suddenly stepped forward and blocked the way. At the same time, two men came forward, one holding a hatbox filled with yellow and white substances, and violently threw it at Monk Chenzhen, causing the monk's entire body to be stained with fecal matter. The three men, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled. Monk Chenzhen and his driver Dong Zhaorong called out and, with the help of Chinese Constable No. 1028 and Japanese Constable No. 12, chased after them and arrested Yao Jinhe and Ji Yujun from Jiangbei. One person escaped. Yao and Ji were taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei and Detective Xu Guirong, they were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated the previous circumstances and filed charges under Article 309 of the Criminal Law. Monk Chenzhen and Dong Zhaorong testified that Yao Jinhe threw the manure and Ji was also present at the scene. When questioned, Yao confessed that a monk named Fachen had ordered my brother Yao Jintang to do this. The day before, the monk led my brothers and me to the gate of the Jade Buddha Temple to identify Chenzhen's appearance before we took action yesterday. When questioned, Ji Yujun completely denied it. Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the confessions and ordered that the case be adjourned for one week for further questioning.

### Robbery on Tongjiazu Road

Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the relevant police station, requesting an investigation.

### Wang Fengnian Sues His Mother and Brother Again

Requesting Division into Three Parts, All for Money; His Brother Appears in Court to Respond, Denying Everything

Wang Yinting, the owner of Wanshunfeng Paint Store in Ningbo, married Yang as his wife and had six sons: Wang Fengnian, Wang Shijun, Wang Shangfen, Wang Zhengxuan, Wang Zhengfang, and Wang Zhengxi. Wang Yinting passed away in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), and all his property, estimated to be worth tens of thousands, was managed by Yang. Later, Wang Fengnian, due to the fact that his father's inheritance had not been divided, which lead to financial difficulties, sued Yang in the First Special District Court, requesting payment for living expenses. The court ruled that Wang Fengnian should receive 6,000 yuan per year in living expenses before the inheritance was divided, which was already decided.

Enforcement of Judgment

Now, Wang Fengnian has sued his mother, Wang Yangshi, his brothers Wang Shijun, Wang Zhengfen, Wang Zhengxuan, Wang Zhengfang, and Wang Zhengxi, as well as the China Reclamation Bank and Yongfeng Qianzhuang, in the First Special District Court. His requests are divided into three parts: (1) Because the first to sixth defendants have not paid his annual living expenses of 6,000 yuan for three years, he requests that they be ordered to pay a total of 18,000 yuan for the living expenses of the 23rd, 24th, and 25th years of the Republic. (2) According to the draft distribution document drawn up by Yinting in the 13th year of the Republic, the plaintiff and his son, Chuidiao, should receive a fee for the eldest son and eldest grandson, totaling 10,000 yuan. Except for the 5,000 yuan that the plaintiff has already received, Chuidiao has died and his coffin is placed at the Siming Guild Hall, so the 5,000 yuan he should have received has not yet been received. Because it is urgently needed for burial, he also asks the court to order the payment of this amount. (3) The plaintiff and the defendant have 30,000 yuan in shares in the China Reclamation Bank (under the name Wang Fucheng), and the plaintiff also has 10,000 yuan in shares under his own name. He requests confirmation of his priority rights and that the shares be used exclusively for the plaintiff's personal

Debt Repayment

He also requests a preliminary execution for the living expenses. The case was heard by Judge Luo Shuo in the Fourth Civil Court yesterday afternoon. Only the defendant Wang Shijun appeared in court to argue that the plaintiff's request for living expenses should only be enjoyed before the inheritance is divided, but the court has already ruled on the division of the father's inheritance, and the execution has been completed, and there is a certificate of property division. Since the property has already been divided, there is no reason to request living expenses again. As for the eldest grandson's fee, he does not know anything about it and the draft distribution document has never been seen, so it cannot be paid. As for the 40,000 yuan in shares in the Reclamation Bank, they all belong to the common property. Later, because the plaintiff, Wang Fengnian, served as the chief auditor of the bank, 10,000 yuan was allocated as a guarantee, so it also belongs to the common property. Therefore, the plaintiff's request should be rejected. Yongfeng Qianzhuang also sent a lawyer to court to respond. Judge Luo reviewed the confessions and ordered that the case be adjourned for further investigation.

### Lin Gendi, a Key Figure in the Box Corpse Case, Arrested Again

Using a Toy Gun to Rob a Schoolgirl of Her Wool Coat; Detained and Sent to Court for Interrogation

Lin Gendi, an 18-year-old Ningbo woman residing at No. 33, Lane 412, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, was previously arrested by the Hongkou Police Station on suspicion of involvement in the sensational box corpse case and prosecuted for murder in the First Special District Court. In the first instance, Lin was acquitted. The police station, dissatisfied, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but the police station's appeal was rejected, and they gave up the third instance appeal. Lin Gendi was released on February 10th of this year. However, Lin did not repent and was arrested again yesterday. On the morning of the 1st of this month at 9:45 AM, Lin Gendi entered Taihe Primary School at No. 47, Lane 58, Huade Road, alone. Under the pretext of needing to use the lavatory, she saw an eleven-year-old schoolgirl, Wu Baolin, inside. She had a bad thought, thinking that Wu was young and easily deceived. She falsely claimed to Wu that her mother had instructed her to come and take a wool coat. Wu, not recognizing Lin, refused to hand it over. Lin forcibly took off Wu's wool coat, worth five yuan, and fled. Wu went home and learned that her mother had not sent anyone, realizing she had been deceived, and reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, requesting an investigation. The day before yesterday, Lin Gendi went to the school again to use the lavatory and was seen by Wu and her teacher, who reported it to the police station. Detective Wang Yongjun was dispatched to arrest Lin Gendi and take her to the police station. A search for the original stolen item was unsuccessful, and she was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Tenth Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted her for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law and presented the case. Wu Baolin testified that she was eleven years old, from Huzhou, and studying at Taihe Primary School. On the morning of the 1st of March, after class was dismissed at 9:45 AM, I went to the lavatory and saw the defendant inside. She said that my mother had instructed her to come and take the coat. I refused, and the defendant forcibly took it and fled. When questioned, Lin Gendi denied the charges, saying that she had not been to Taihe Primary School on March 1st. Yesterday, while walking on Huade Road, she felt an urgent need to use the lavatory and went to the nearby Taihe Primary School's lavatory, where she was arrested. She did not steal the wool coat. The confession she made yesterday at the police station was forced. Judge Ye Shengchao reviewed the confessions and ordered Lin Gendi to be detained and investigated for seven days before further questioning.

### Ministry of Finance Reduces Saltpeter Tax Rate

Two Cents Per Dan

The Ministry of Finance has instructed the Changlu Transport Commissioner to approve the case of the Heji Chemical Alum Industry Company's reduction of the saltpeter tax rate and has specifically ordered the Salt Affairs Audit General Office to instruct the Changlu Audit Branch Office to comply with the original order. The case concerns the Heji Chemical Industry Company's purchase of saltpeter from the Changlu Lutai field, which has historically been taxed at two cents per dan. The Changlu Transport Commissioner forwarded a request from the company, stating that the production cost of the product is high, and that the market is currently flooded with foreign goods from North China. Reducing costs is necessary to compete in sales. The company requested that the saltpeter tax rate be reduced to two cents per dan, following the precedent of the Bohai Company. After review, the Ministry determined that the reasons stated were not unreasonable and instructed the Changlu Transport Commissioner to approve the request. This order is issued to the General Office for notification and to instruct the Changlu Audit Branch Office to comply. This order is issued by Minister Kong Xiangxi.

### The Tang Youren Assassination Case Continues with Both Defendants Recanting

Previously Claiming Confessions Were Obtained Through Torture; The Case Still Awaits Investigation and Further Interrogation

In the case of the assassination of Tang Youren, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, who was shot and killed by thugs in front of his private residence in Gan Village, Gansidong Road, French Concession, at 5:00 PM on December 25th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the perpetrators, Liu Zhennan from Hubei and Mai Jiyu from Shaoxing, were arrested successively by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Public Concession Police and brought back by the French Police to be handed over to the Second Special District Court. The lawyer from the French Police Department filed a public prosecution on charges of murder.

During the court hearing by the former Chief Judge of the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, Mr. Wang Gangxu, both defendants confessed to the murder of Tang without denying it. However, after the new Chief Judge Liao Lu took over and repeatedly held hearings, because the defendants had been transferred to the detention center, they unanimously overturned their previous confessions and denied the assassination. The situation of being ordered to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation has been reported in the previous newspapers many times. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, Liao Lu, came to the First Criminal Court to continue the hearing and ordered the two defendants to be brought to the case, announcing

A Renewed Trial

After questioning the defendants about their ages and origins, the lawyer from the Police Department, Gu Shouxi, presented the case and the relevant articles of law. Then, he questioned Liu Zhennan about how he knew Yang Yousheng. Liu replied, "I was previously sentenced to five years in prison by the Mixed Court for a crime. In the 24th year of the Republic, the court added two months to my sentence. I met Yang Yousheng in prison. Yang was imprisoned for forgery. I was released on April 16th. After Yang was released on May 1st, he sent a letter inviting me to Junyi Lane, Beile Road, to

Meet with Xiao Jia

On January 2nd of the previous year, I went to Hong Kong at Yang's invitation. We never discussed assassinating Tang Youren." He was asked, "How did you originally confess in the Public Security Bureau, the French Police Station, and in this court about how you planned and shot Tang to death? You spoke very clearly. Why are you now being evasive?" He replied, "I was severely tortured in the Public Security Bureau and the French Police Station. I confessed in court because I was afraid of being returned to the police station and suffering more. Therefore, I confessed according to the confession prepared by the Public Security Bureau and the police station

Only Seeking a Quick Death

In fact, I am truly innocent. I beg the Chief Judge to be aware of this." Qiu Jiyu also vehemently protested his innocence and recanted his confession. Finally, the French Police Detective of Gan Village testified that on the day of the incident, he only heard gunshots. The assailant was wearing a coat and cotton robe, and only saw his back. He fled south towards the wasteland. At this point, the court determined that the case still required detailed investigation and announced that it would be adjourned until April 14th for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to detention.

### French Police Detective Kidnapped by Bandits

Robbed of His Gun, Then Returned; Bandits' True Target Possibly Someone Else

At around midnight yesterday morning, an incident occurred on Avenue Foch in the French Concession in which a French police detective was forced into a car by bandits. The bandits stole the gun he carried and the coat he was wearing. Eventually, the bandits returned the detective to his original location in the same car. After investigation, it was learned that the car used by the bandits was stolen from Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession. It is speculated by the police that the kidnapping of the French police detective was a case of mistaken identity. The true target of the bandits was likely someone else. The details are as follows:

A Newly Appointed Detective

Gao Amao from Jiangbei, a newly appointed detective with the French Police, number 179, has been on duty for just over three months. On the night before last, Gao was dispatched to patrol the area within the borders of Western Shanghai. At around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, while Gao was patrolling at the corner of Avenue Foch and Pinfang Teahouse, four bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and forced Gao into a black car parked nearby. The car's concession number was 5144, and the city registration number was 34.

Kidnapped and Returned

After the four bandits forced Gao into the car, they drove away at high speed, heading directly to the area of Rue Massenet. The bandits searched him and robbed him of his gun, coat, detective's license, etc. After more than an hour, the bandits returned Gao to Avenue Foch in the same car and pushed him out.

Suspected Mistaken Identity

After getting out of the car, Gao regained his composure and reported the incident to the police chief. The incident was bizarre, and the kidnapping of a police detective was unprecedented. After investigation by the entire police force, it was concluded that the bandits had other plans, and Gao's kidnapping was a case of mistaken identity. The true target was likely someone else.

Origin of the Car

The French police immediately notified the police stations in the Public Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau of the car's number, instructing them to be on the lookout for it. Eventually, the Laozha Police Station learned that the car was stolen from Li Ningxiang, an engineer residing at No. 197 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM the night before last.

Details of the Car Theft

Li parked his car between Yu Qiaqing Road and Beihai Road. When he returned, the car was gone. He reported the theft to the Laozha Police Station. It was then learned that the car used by the bandits was stolen from Li. The police are conducting a thorough investigation.

### Huang Hongjun and His Wife Return to Shanghai After Two Years Abroad

Successful Publicity Results

Mr. Huang Hongjun and his wife, the General Manager of the China Underwear Company, returned to Shanghai last month after spending the past two years in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, dedicated to promoting Chinese industry, plugging loopholes in the economy, and achieving economic salvation. They also expanded the company's efforts to encourage overseas Chinese to return to China, develop industries, and encourage overseas Chinese children to return to their homeland for education in order to prepare for future employment and advancement, avoiding the suffering of being treated harshly by foreign races. According to Mr. Huang, the publicity work had four goals: (1) The value of goods imported into China each year exceeds one trillion yuan. More than six or seven million overseas Chinese live abroad. The silver coins remitted back to China each year are only about 140 to 150 million yuan. If overseas Chinese jointly invest these funds to develop treasures and establish more factories, the leakage of revenue can be recovered, and foreign goods can be eliminated. Overseas Chinese can live and work in peace in China, which is better than being exploited by others. (2) Although overseas Chinese children study abroad and even graduate from universities, they often do not understand the national conditions or speak the national language. It is already extremely difficult to find employment, let alone develop. (3) Foreign governments heavily tax the purchase of buildings and properties abroad. Even without tenants, the owner must pay taxes. Therefore, the real estate industry is generally depressed, and most people are unable to pay taxes and the properties are taken back by the foreign government and sold publicly. As a result, some overseas Chinese who were once millionaires have suddenly become commoners. In China, there is no such tragedy of taxing and publicly selling houses. This is clear evidence that overseas Chinese should return to China to do business. (4) Overseas Chinese do not know how to remit silver back to Shanghai for savings to benefit industry. Foreign banks offer weekly interest rates of only 1.5% to 3%, while Shanghai banks offer interest rates of 8% or 9%. Why not use hard-earned money to generate profits? When Mr. Huang first arrived in a major port, he distributed a plan for living and working in peace. As soon as it was published in the newspaper, more than 100 people requested copies every day. Most overseas Chinese, after reading it, praised its perfection and completeness, calling it a compass for overseas Chinese. Therefore, Mr. Huang and his wife were well received by overseas Chinese in major cities. They were frequently invited to banquets. When Mr. Huang was in a major port, he organized an "Association to Assist Overseas Chinese in Returning to China to Develop Industries." Branches were also established in various ports as a foundation for industrial salvation and to expand the underwear company. Overseas Chinese in various foreign countries subscribed to about one million yuan in shares. However, due to the increasingly urgent foreign aggression in the motherland and the tense situation, overseas Chinese were uneasy. Therefore, the funds will be remitted to Shanghai successively after the situation has calmed down.

### Relief Efforts After Fire in Wu Family Hall, Pudong

Shen Xingyuan and Guan Lin Donate Rice

The thatched sheds in the Wu Family Hall area, east of the Yangjiazhai area in Pudong, suddenly suffered a fire at noon on the 13th of this month, destroying seventy or eighty thatched sheds and causing heavy losses. Details were previously published in the newspaper. It is now known that Mr. Xu Baoming, the head of the Yangjing District Defense Corps in the area, seeing that the many victims were homeless and in a very miserable situation, could not bear to sit idly by. He sent a letter to Mr. Wang Yiting and Mr. Xu Qianlin, the two presidents of the Shanghai Jisheng Association, requesting relief. The association then sent personnel to the fire site to conduct an on-site investigation. A total of 65 households were registered, with 427 victims of all ages. After the registration was completed, a large batch of miscellaneous grains and clothing was prepared and distributed to the site at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The Pudong Police Sub-bureau and the Yangjing District Defense Corps strictly maintained order, which was quite good. The work was completed at 4:00 PM. It is also reported that Mr. Xia Xinqi, the director of the Pudong District Chamber of Commerce, also joined with local gentry Shen Xingyuan and Li Guanlin to donate dozens of dan of white rice for distribution to the victims as a form of relief.

### Further Details on the Murder Case of Tao Wenhai, Hacked to Death with an Axe on Jinling Road

Motive Revealed as Adultery; Adulterer and Adulteress Both Apprehended

On the morning of the 7th of this month, at the intersection of Jinling Road and Huakang Road in Zhabei, a pedestrian named Tao Wenhai (also known as Tao Wenkai) was hacked in the head with an axe by a thug, collapsing and dying in a pool of blood on the road. The Yangmiao Police Station of the Xinzha Sub-bureau, which had jurisdiction over the area, recovered the murder weapon, an axe, and reported the case to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation.

Following the Incident

Liu Huai, the captain of the Detective Squad, and Qian Tianxiong, the leader of the Sixth Squad, paid close attention to the case. By the 14th of this month, the squad had determined that the crime was motivated by adultery. They immediately arrested Tao Zhu, the deceased's wife, age 32, residing at No. 22 Yongqing Lane, Huakang Road; Liu Zhiheng, age 38, residing at No. 3 Tong'an Lane, Chang'an Road; Lu Er, age 46 (nicknamed "Little Yangzhou"), residing in a shed behind the Jianghuai Guild Hall at No. 70 Huta Road; and Wang Shaoyu, age 36, residing in a shed at No. 6 Liuying Road. Tao Zhu confessed to having

an Affair for Six Years

and living with her lover, Cui Zigao, in the same room. "My daughter has always called Cui her 'godfather.' On the 16th day of the first lunar month of this year, Cui wanted to kill my husband, but I refused. I don't know where Cui Zigao has gone now. You can ask Liu Hengsan for information," she stated. Liu Hengsan claimed, "Cui Zigao is my nephew. He sent me a letter on the 10th of this month, saying he was staying at No. 10 Hujiayuan in Nanjing City." Based on this information, Captain Qian immediately dispatched Liu Bingyuan, a squad leader, and detective Liu Heng at 4:00 PM that afternoon,

Accompanied by an Informant

to take a train to Nanjing. They coordinated with Cheng Hongsheng, the duty officer of the Fourth Detective Group of the Capital Police Department. They went to Hujiayuan in the city and found that the original shacks had been demolished. After inquiring around, they learned that the residents had moved to Sajiawan, near Jiancang Bridge. The informant identified Cui Zigao, and he and his companion, Shen Yingkao, were apprehended. They were brought to Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). Cui Zigao, age 38, confessed that he had been living with Tao Zhu and having an affair for six years. He had wanted to kill Tao Wenhai

Several Times

The first time was in December of last year. Zhu said that her husband often beat and scolded her, and she couldn't bear it. She urged me to find a way to kill Tao Wenhai. I refused, and she threatened to kill herself and say that I had driven her to it. Later, I entrusted someone to do the job, but they wanted 150 yuan in hush money. I negotiated it down to 100 yuan and told Zhu. She said that if it could be done, 100 yuan was fine. On the afternoon of December 28th, Zhu took out

Fifty Yuan

and gave it to me, half in advance. I delivered the money to the tea house at the northern end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge. Later, on the morning of March 7th, I saw that Tao had been hacked to death with an axe and realized that it must have been the person I entrusted. But I don't know his name or where he lives. After Tao died, I was afraid to go home. I asked my uncle, Liu Hengsan, to give me twenty yuan, and I asked Shen Yingkao to accompany me to Nanjing because I didn't know my way around. Lu Er (i.e., Little Yangzhou) claimed that the deceased, Tao Wenhai, and the others were all from

Huaiyin and Worked at the Fuxin No. 7 Flour Mill

That night, I invited Tao to my house for dinner and walked him part of the way home. That's all true, but I don't know who killed him. Shen Yingkao, age 33, residing at No. 14 Yaojia Stone Bridge, stated that he and the deceased worked at the same factory. His testimony was similar to Cui Zigao's. Wang Shaoyu claimed that he and Tao Wenhai also worked at the Fuxin No. 7 Flour Mill and were from the same hometown. That night, I ran into the deceased on the street. I don't know how he was hacked to death. After verifying the confessions, the squad transferred the adulterer, adulteress, and the other six individuals to the Xinzha Sub-bureau, which then handed them over to the Third Section of the Police Headquarters for interrogation.

### National Sugar Production and Sales Association

A Respectful Message to the Japanese Sugar Industry and the Economic Delegation Visiting China!

According to the Central News Agency, the National Sugar Production and Sales Association of China was formed last autumn by a combination of nationalized sugar factories and sugar sales merchants. The chairman of the board is Liu Weichi, and the directors are Yuan Liang, Lu Zuofu, Huang Jiangquan, etc. The Association, recognizing that the smuggling in North China in recent years has had a significant impact on the sugar industry, has taken the opportunity of the Chinese-Japanese Trade Association holding its members' conference in Shanghai to issue a "Respectful Message to the Japanese Sugar Industry and the Economic Delegation Visiting China" through the board of directors. The wording is still thorough and sincere. At a time when the national economies of China and Japan are advocating cooperation, this article is truly a representation of the genuine public opinion of a segment of our country. It is reported that the Association has printed the full text and sent it specifically to visiting envoys and members of various delegations, as well as distributing it to relevant organizations. We have extracted the original text below:

A Respectful Message to the Japanese Sugar Industry and the Economic Delegation Visiting China!

Sugar is a daily necessity for human life, and the amount consumed is always directly proportional to the progress of the nation. According to world sugar industry statistics, the United States consumes 48 kilograms of sugar per person per year, the United Kingdom consumes 49 kilograms, France and Germany each consume 26 kilograms, Japan consumes 13 kilograms, and the difference between the amount of sugar consumed by urban people and rural commoners in China is too great. Although the average statistics per person per year are not detailed, even if we calculate it at the minimum amount of 5 kilograms, then 400 million people should consume 20 million metric tons of sugar per year (each metric ton is equal to 100 kilograms). According to recent statistics from last year, China's annual sugar production is only 6.7 million metric tons. Therefore, the amount of foreign sugar that China will need to import each year in the future will be at least 13 million metric tons, worth 286 million yuan in national currency. This huge trade is the object of competition for sugar-producing countries around the world—including Japan. Japan is close to China, the distance is short, and transportation costs are low. Its refined sugar and fine cotton sand are also favored by ordinary Chinese people. Therefore, in theory, the sales of Japanese sugar in China should be in a more advantageous position than those of other countries. This is something that we would like to ask you to pay attention to first.

However, according to Chinese customs statistics last year, the amount of imported sugar was only 1.585 million metric tons (less than one-fifth of the amount in 1929), of which only more than 560,000 metric tons were imported from Japan, accounting for only one-third of the total. As we know, the amount of smuggled sugar transported from Dalian to North China last year actually reached 1,008,501 bags, equivalent to approximately 890,000 metric tons. However, because it was smuggled in and not transported openly, the customs statistics could not include it. However, China's loss of customs duties on this item has reached more than 8.7 million gold units, equivalent to approximately 20 million yuan in national currency. The amount of smuggled sugar transported from Taiwan to South China is not included. Smuggling sugar is a despicable and improper means of destroying the law and defying good faith, directly squeezing the profits of our legitimate sugar production and sales merchants, and should be jointly eliminated by sugar merchants in both countries. All Chinese sugar merchants have jointly appealed to our government to strictly stipulate anti-smuggling laws and earnestly adopt strict measures to stop the spread of smuggled sugar. However, Japanese ruffians have repeatedly incited influential people to fuel its flames, and even interfered with anti-smuggling efforts, committing murder and robbery. The evidence is clear. Your organization has always been known for its preparedness, but you have remained silent, watching the legitimate reputation of the organization tarnished internationally, and the benefits you should have received have been eroded. This is something that Chinese sugar merchants deeply regret and would like to sincerely ask you to pay attention to.

Although the tax rate on Chinese sugar customs duties is slightly higher than that on other imported goods, it is by no means an excuse for those who smuggle sugar. As Chinese merchants know, according to your country's 1935 Sugar Industry Yearbook, the amount of sugar produced in your country in 1935 (including Korea, Hokkaido, Taiwan, and the South Seas Mandated Territory) was more than 18.351 million tons, while the amount of sugar consumed by your country (including all its territories) in 1935 was more than 17.772 million tons. Adding the more than 1.27 million tons sold to the Northeast Provinces of our country, the two figures confirm each other. This shows that your country not only does not have excess sugar production to sell to China, but is also demanding more than it can supply. Then, what relationship does the height of China's sugar tax have with you? Even if you can transship and sell sugar from the Java area, the current sugar tariff rate in our country is higher than that of 80-90% of other countries. Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Germany are all clear examples (Italy and Poland's sugar tax is 6-7 times higher than China's, and Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Germany are all more than 3 times higher). Even in your own country, the standard tax is 7.4 yen per metric ton, plus a surcharge of 2.59 yen and a consumption tax of 9.5 yen, for a total of 19.49 yen, which is not lighter than our country's. Why single us out for blame? Moreover, the establishment of import tax rates is related to the prosperity of a country's trade and the integrity of a country's sovereignty. You have come here to call for respect for sovereignty, and we have heard that you want to establish the benefits of private economies on a basis of equality and mutual benefit. Surely you will not disregard reason and logic and recklessly advocate for reducing sugar taxes.

Since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, every country has used tariff barriers to protect its domestic industries. Even in your country, you have done well. Unfortunately, China has been bound by unequal treaties for 80 years, resulting in industrial backwardness. Since tariff autonomy, domestic industries have begun to make progress. You clearly know that the smuggling of ruffians should be stopped. If you instead use smuggling as leverage to demand tax cuts from our government, then you must know that this matter concerns the life and death of all of our merchants. We will resolutely explain to our people and appeal to our government the reasons why the level of sugar tax has nothing to do with your country's sugar production and that tax cuts would cut off the newborn industries of China. We must not allow you to be deceived by the ruffians and let a neighboring country of the same race and culture, as close as brothers, be trapped in a state of industrial stagnation for a long time.

The profit from sugar is very thin, as you well know. Since smuggling began, we, the sugar merchants, have toiled hard all year round but still cannot afford to eat our fill. Who is to blame for this hardship? As for those unscrupulous Chinese merchants, although they have colluded with Japanese ruffians for private gain, one denunciation can cost them their lives. In recent months, more than 200 people in the northern areas have lost their families and lives as a result. These 200-plus people were all legitimate sugar merchants, but because smuggling has become rampant, legitimate business cannot compete, so they have been forced to make this desperate gamble with their lives. Although their crime cannot be excused, their families and grandchildren, tracing back to the root of the disaster, all cry and hate, vying to become enemies of the Japanese ruffians. You have also been innocently subjected to cold looks. As a result, your other goods in China have also sown bad seeds. If this kind of psychology spreads, your industry in China will have no foothold. Therefore, just from the perspective of impropriety in the sugar trade, smuggling is harmful to the trade and the national sentiments of both countries. Furthermore, smuggling today is not limited to sugar alone. You may also think deeply about it.

China is the world's largest patron, and sugar is no exception. If you suddenly come to your senses, for the sake of your own interests and the interests of your entire Japanese business community in China, report to your government and effectively stop the ruffians who smuggle sugar, and further request that your consulates in China earnestly assist our customs in anti-smuggling efforts, then we—the national sugar producers and sellers—will be moved by your good intentions and will unite to the best of our ability to eliminate the disgrace you have suffered in the past, and will also seek the greatest possible legitimate outlet for your sugar exports to China.

At the time of this declaration, we are prepared to discuss with you a practical and beneficial plan for your legitimate trade, based on this great hope. You are all advanced leaders in the industry, and you have come from afar, so you will surely benefit our country. Moreover, you have all created businesses, assisted in restoration, experienced the difficulties of self-reliance, and tasted the hardships of economic construction. Therefore, all of us who are enduring and striving today, and moving towards self-reliance, will especially be understood and sympathized with by you. This is why we do not hesitate to tell you in detail, urging you to make a fair judgment and not to make this trip in vain. We sincerely hope that you will respond in the same voice to this sincerity of uplifting the Eastern people, cherishing, and prospering trade. Sincerely,

National Sugar Production and Sales Association of China

### The Yang Zhao Family Takes Three Young Girls to Tianjin for Fun

Separate Interrogation; Conflicting Statements

At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Lin Yongfang, an investigator from the China Relief Society for Women and Children, along with Yao Guofa, a detective from the Customs Water Police Station, inspected the Beiyang Bansheng steamer of the Yihua Company, which was about to set sail for Tianjin from Hongkou. In the steerage, they encountered a middle-aged woman leading three young girls, whose actions seemed suspicious. They immediately interrogated them. The woman claimed to be Yang Zhao, 37 years old, from Wangting, Suzhou. The three girls were her biological daughters, and they were going to Tianjin for fun. The detectives interrogated the three girls separately. One girl, named Wang Ada, 17 years old, and another girl, named Yang Zhangmei, also 17 years old, both from Wangting, said that Yang Zhao was a relative and not their biological mother. The other girl, named Yang Qiaoxian, 18 years old, admitted that the woman was her mother. All three girls said that Yang had asked them to go to Tianjin for fun and that they did not know the details. The detectives found that their statements were inconsistent and suspected that she was abducting and selling them overseas. They took all four people to the police station for further investigation.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Junshan

Furthermore, when we observe comparatively, we can see that: both group governance and leadership governance under monarchical politics have their own differences; both group governance and leadership governance under democratic politics also have distinctions. For example, both Britain and Japan are group governance under monarchical politics, but Britain is centered on political parties, which is party politics, multi-party politics; while Japan is centered on the military, and has a trend towards one-party politics. As for leadership governance under monarchical politics, because there is only one country, Italy, there is no comparison, so it will not be discussed here. Looking at democratic politics, the group governance of France and the group governance of the United States are also different. The US is democratic and centralized, while France is democratic and decentralized. There are also great differences between Russia and Germany in leadership governance under democratic politics (Russia is a Soviet federal republic and admits to being a democratic country). For example, Germany is a leadership dictatorship under democratic politics, while Russia is a personal autocracy; Russia is one class oppressing other classes, while Germany is uniting all classes against the outside world. The spirit and essence are completely different. Therefore, today's politics has two major divisions: one is group governance or leadership governance under constitutional monarchy; the other is group governance or leadership governance under democratic republic; and the essence of these two forms is also different. This point is what we must pay attention to when studying the true picture of politics today. (To be continued)

### Yarn and Thread

Yarn sales remain brisk.

Tagged Yarn prices attempt to advance but instead retreat.

Five Blessings Shepherd brand yarn is offered at a low price.

Hopes of hoarding goods are fading.

After the sharp rise in the yarn market the day before yesterday, yesterday it calmed down again. Current yarn trading remains active. Buyers from various provinces arrive in succession, especially those from Sichuan, the interior, Tianjin, and Guangdong, who are particularly eager to buy. However, prices have not risen, so people are hesitant. There are rumors in the market that if prices exceed forty yuan this month, certain gentlemen will have no intention of hoarding goods. At the same time, it is widely rumored that the Ewo Mill has offered four to five thousand bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn at increasingly lower prices, further depressing market sentiment.

The price of current month yarn drops by one yuan seventy.

The opening price of tagged yarn this morning varied across different months. However, American cotton remained strong, while Osaka's Three Grades Yarn fell back by one yuan. During the second session, the price for this month fell below the forty yuan mark. According to rumors in the market, the bulls of certain gentlemen have released large quantities of stock, and there are even rumors of them turning bearish. Forward prices followed suit, declining. By the third closing bell, it was reported that the current yarn business remained active, with buyers from all sides still purchasing around two thousand bales. As a result, short sellers covered their positions, and the market rebounded upwards. At the close of trading, the price of tagged yarn for this month fell by five jiao, while other months remained unchanged. At the opening of the afternoon session, market sentiment was sluggish, as the price of Three Grades Yarn had slightly retreated. Market rumors suggested that an English mill had offered five thousand bales of Five Blessings Shepherd yarn at particularly low prices, and there were also reports of hedging sales. Selling pressure suddenly increased, and the price for this month broke the forty yuan mark again during the second session, with forward months following suit. However, current yarn transactions still amounted to around four thousand bales. Compared to the closing prices in the afternoon session, the prices of tagged yarn for each month fell by six, seven, or eight jiao to one yuan. Sales included: Tung Foo, 1,450 bales sold, leaving 950 bales remaining; Heng Yih, 1,050 bales; Ta Fung, 1,650 bales; Yih Kee, 1,200 bales; Tai Hing, 1,250 bales; Yuan Yih, 2,050 bales; Ta Chang Cheng, 3,000 bales; Chang Fung, 3,050 bales; Ta Chang, 2,100 bales; Sheng Yuan, 1,050 bales; Hsieh Cheng, 1,000 bales. Purchases included: Yu Ta, 7,500 bales; Dah Kee, 1,000 bales; Shen Chang, 2,600 bales; Shen Ta, 1,200 bales; Shen Kee, 1,900 bales; Run Kang, 1,050 bales; Tung Ho, 2,600 bales; Tai Chang, 1,550 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.

Current Yarn Sales Reach 4,000 Bale Mark

The sales of current yarn remain good. Statistics show that various merchants purchased a total of 3,963 bales throughout the day, and the selling price is firm and stable. The purchase amounts of various merchants are listed below.

Many Profiteering Bulls Close Positions

The rising trend in cotton falters slightly.

The cotton market saw a shift towards calmness, with the rising trend from the previous day inevitably prompting some bulls to close out their positions. However, American cotton continues to advance, with the spot price reaching one jiao and five fen. The rising trend in Indian cotton is even more intense, with forward months reaching new highs, breaking through the six yuan mark. In the afternoon, profit-takers closed out their positions, and forward prices saw a slight retreat.

June once exceeded the six yuan mark.

The opening price of tagged cotton this morning showed declines across various months, as the rising trend from the previous day was deemed too drastic, prompting bulls to close their positions. However, American cotton continued to rise, with the spot price reaching one jiao and five fen. The rising trend in Indian cotton was also intense. After the second session, market rumors suggested that a Japanese economic delegation had arrived in China and proposed exporting cotton to other countries. As a result, buying interest strengthened, and prices for each month reached new highs at the close of trading, with the June contract breaking through the six yuan mark. Compared to the closing prices from the previous day, the prices of tagged cotton for each month rose by one or two jiao. At the opening of the afternoon session, market sentiment shifted towards calmness and fatigue, as the yarn market was lackluster and bulls came to close their positions again. As a result, the prices for each month fell by five fen to two jiao and a half compared to the morning session. Sales included: Ta Fung, 7,700 dan; Tung Ho, 3,300 dan; Ta Chang, 4,500 dan; Tai Hing, 4,000 dan; Tung Kee, 6,900 dan; Keng Fung, 4,800 dan; Shen Chang, 2,800 dan; Ta Chang Cheng, 4,700 dan; Hsieh Cheng, 5,100 dan; Hsin Chang, 4,600 dan; Chang Ho, 4,800 dan; Heng Chang, 2,100 dan; Fu Kang, 2,300 dan; Fung Shou, 4,200 dan. Purchases included: Chin Chang, 12,800 dan; Yu Ta, 2,400 dan; Chi Fung, 2,000 dan; Heng Yih, 8,100 dan; Dah Kee, 5,300 dan; Ho Hsing, 8,200 dan; Tai Chang, 6,600 dan; Run Kang, 2,500 dan; Hsin Cheng, 2,200 dan.

Cotton Consumption Still Sizable

The current cotton consumption is still considered substantial. The transaction volume of various factories seems to be slightly less compared to the previous day, and the source remains unchanged.

American Cotton Has Reached One Jiao and Five Fen

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with active trading. Prices for each month fluctuated from a decrease of one pound to an increase of four pounds due to buying from fellow traders and foreign merchants. Subsequently, profit-taking by bulls and local concerns about potential unrest led to a decline in prices. Near the close of trading, fellow traders and the public re-entered the market, with limited short selling, causing the market to rise again. There were forty-three delivery notices for the March contract, all with buyers. The cloth market was firm, but trading was quieter. The closing was extremely strong, with spot prices rising by fifteen pounds and futures prices rising by nine to twenty pounds. English cotton spot prices rose by four points, while futures prices fell by one point. Indian cotton short positions were covered, and Japanese merchants, Liverpool merchants, and futures traders made large purchases. Later, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and profit-taking by bulls, the market retreated. Dhollera rose by 3.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 3 to 4 rupees, and Bengal Desi rose by 3.75 to 4 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (dated 16th).

Also, according to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 17th was: Bengal Desi at 250 rupees, up 2.25 rupees; Oomra at 236.5 rupees; Dhollera at 199.25 rupees, all up by 2 rupees.

### Food

Current Month Futures Flour Plummets

All Due to Sluggish Sales of Spot Goods

Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, prices for all months initially remained flat, followed by a sharp fall in near-term contracts. Quotations for foreign wheat showed Chicago up by two or three jiao and Canada up by three, four, or six jiao. With the continuous rise in foreign wheat prices upon opening, market confidence should have been stable. Therefore, the opening price for the current month was still between nine jiao and two fen. However, the long positions for the current month were already heavily burdened and difficult to reverse. With a large number of contracts, closing them out took time. On the other hand, the majority of short positions were held by factories. With slow actual sales, covering positions was naturally difficult. As a result, after opening, prices fell sharply, reaching as low as eight jiao, eight fen, and two and a half li at the close. The April contract saw a small increase of three or four fen, while the July and August contracts saw a small increase of two or three fen. Upon opening in the afternoon, market sentiment became even more uncertain. The current month fell to a minimum of eight jiao and a half, but fortunately, factories covered their positions together, stabilizing the market slightly and recovering two fen from the lowest point. The April contract also experienced a wild decline due to sell-offs, reaching a minimum of eight jiao, eight fen, and two and a half li. The July and August contracts also rebounded slightly due to long positions being pulled in. The sharp fall in the current month was ultimately due to sluggish sales of spot goods and an excessive number of contracts, which made it impossible for long positions to resist.

New Wheat Still Able to Hold Steady

Recent Spot Wheat Prices All Retreat Slightly

Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw foreign wheat quotations rise again by two or three jiao to four or six jiao. At the opening, prices for the current month fell sharply due to its proximity to delivery and the extreme weakness of the flour market, leading to natural uncertainty. With few transactions, prices also fell sharply. The opening and closing prices for the first two sessions were both six yuan, three jiao, and a half. The April contract also saw a small decline to three jiao, four or five fen. Contracts for June and beyond were generally stable. Upon opening in the afternoon, the market fell again by two or three fen due to the large number of sell orders from retail long positions. Only the Tianjin merchant long positions remained unmoved. The new wheat market remained stable, while the spot wheat market saw a gradual decline. Prices for each type of wheat also fell by three or four fen. Open-kernel Anhui wheat was priced at six yuan, three jiao, and four fen, Jiangbei wheat at six yuan, three jiao, and three fen, with a price difference of two jiao and eight fen, Shaoxing wheat at six yuan, one jiao, and five or six fen, Tiantai wheat at six yuan, two jiao, and two fen, and Chongming wheat at six yuan, one jiao, and a half, all purchased by Shen Ta and Fu Hsin at 1,500 bags each.

River Rice Prices Remain Firm in Morning Session

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than forty merchants arrived from various provinces, bringing approximately 8,100 to 8,200 shi of goods. Due to the strong winds the night before, few boats arrived in the early morning, leading to firm market sentiment and high asking prices from sellers. However, as more boats arrived in quick succession near noon, the situation quickly stabilized. For example, the price of thick japonica rice only improved by five fen. Thin indica rice, on the other hand, had slightly more average costs. Although there were merchants from both northern and southern Jiangsu buying, the volume was only 1,500 to 1,600 bags, so the market situation remained lackluster. Du Yang pointy rice and Yin Yuan rice saw no change.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, fifteen or sixteen boats arrived from various provinces downstream. The market saw strong sales of various goods. Due to the scarcity of boats and decreasing supply from downstream, the high-quality white japonica rice prices remained firm, while medium- and lower-quality rice tightened up by several fen to one jiao. Thin indica rice from Yan Jin and Xi'an provinces was actively traded, and sales in this district were also active, leading to a strong and positive price trend. Early rice prices also remained tightly held, and Yang Du Bu pointy rice also showed signs of improvement. Customer-specific pointy rice remained steady, while white Yuan and other goods maintained stable prices.

Guangdong Merchants Resume Buying Customer's Coarse Rice

Yesterday, the arrival of customer's indica rice remained strong, with more than 10,000 bags arriving daily. However, Guangdong merchants became more active yesterday, purchasing nearly 20,000 bags of various coarse and machine-milled rice. With increased sales to Guangdong, market sentiment improved again, and cargo owners were unwilling to sell cheaply. Coarse rice was eagerly sought by Guangdong merchants, causing prices to rise by one jiao. Machine-milled rice also rose by five fen to nearly one jiao. If Guangdong sales continue to be active today and tomorrow, the market may need to increase prices again. A total of 18,250 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,250 bags of Hunan rice, 3,000 bags of sandbank coarse rice, and 1,250 bags of Nanling coarse rice were sold throughout the day.

Standard Soybean Oil Cake Shows Little Fluctuation. Standard soybean oil cake prices have been fluctuating slightly in recent days, but the changes have been minimal. Standard soybean oil has only seen increases or decreases of five fen to one or two jiao, while soybean cake has only seen changes of a few li to one fen. Yellow soybeans have also only seen increases or decreases of one, two, or three fen. In recent days, actual sales of yellow soybeans and soybean cake have been sluggish, and most merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach. Although there has been activity in covering and closing positions in standard soybean oil, new transactions have not been active. Based on current spot prices in Shanghai, standard prices need to be reduced. However, the market sentiment in Dalian is very strong, and telegrams from yesterday and the day before yesterday continued to show upward trends. As a result, trading firms are very hesitant to sell, and the market has been able to hold its ground. Yesterday, standard soybean oil prices were close to those in the distant ports, with increases and decreases of five fen each. Soybean cake sales were sluggish with merchants holding back, with small decreases of half a fen to one fen. Standard soybean prices showed no major fluctuations.

Changzhou Pu Li Factory Cake Enters the Market

Yesterday, the oil cake market saw the entry of another oil pressing factory, namely the Changzhou Pu Li Oil Pressing Factory, which entrusted Chang Yi Heng to manage its sales. It is reported that the factory has traditionally specialized in producing nine-jin small soybean cakes, selling them in various inland villages. This year, it suddenly expanded its business to compete for sales in the Nanyang region. Yesterday, sample cakes were already on display in the market. The trademark of the main brand cake is "Changzhou Pu Li," while the third brand is "Pu Li," the fourth brand is "Fat Character," and the fifth brand is "Grain Character." The weight of the cakes is the same as those produced by factories in this port. Industry insiders claim that the quality of the sample cakes is acceptable. However, since the factory is located inland, there will be delays in transportation, which will inevitably create a price difference in the market in the future. Yesterday, the soybean cake market saw a decline in sales volume, and market sentiment was mediocre. Prices were still held at the original levels, but only 2,500 pieces of goods traded in the combined sales of merchant sales and broker sales. Therefore, the future trend may not be optimistic.

### Securities

Government Bond Trading Slightly More Active

Ninety-Six Bonds Have Recovered to Their Previous Market Price

Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a relatively stable market situation. Although large holders continued to sell, the appetite of buyers gradually increased. With the impending realization of the reorganization of the Central Bank into a Preparatory Bank, the reserve requirements of various banks will increase, leading to a substantial absorption of government bonds. Therefore, the long positions for the current month are extremely stable, and the future market situation should be slightly more active. Ninety-six bonds have recovered to the horizontal line and should continue to move towards stability. Although the overall situation yesterday was still characterized by uncertainty, the trend has shown signs of slight firmness. Only the seller of fifty-four long-term Class A bonds continued to sell for three consecutive sessions, amounting to hundreds of thousands, which stopped at the close of trading. As a result, many retail long positions also sold off their holdings. Short positions are still holding on. Class A bonds have been brewing without any upward momentum for the past few months. Now that fifty-four's sales have been exhausted, there should be a rebound in the near future. As a result of the market situation, most bonds rose by five fen, one jiao, or one jiao and a half, while a few also fell slightly by five fen or one jiao. Class A bonds fell by another jiao, and ninety-six bonds retreated by two jiao. The total transaction volume was 5,345,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Finance

Gold Standard Still Faces Selling Pressure

The gold market initially rose yesterday due to rising gold prices in overseas silver markets in both England and America. The price of raw gold in London rose by half a penny. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed no change in either England or America, and the customs gold unit rose by two li. The official exchange rate for the gold standard was announced to rise to 1,157 yuan and four jiao. However, the opening price in the morning was lower, and there was a sudden surge due to a lack of supply after the opening. Spot market firms took advantage of the high prices to supply gold, but the market was still pressured by selling pressure at noon. It is feared that the trend will be difficult to reverse due to the lack of stimulus for spot prices. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.

The morning opening was at 1,155 yuan, down four jiao from the previous close. The quotes from Tung Fung Yu Qia Fung and Yung Na remained the same.

### Silk and Tea

Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise Sharply Again Yesterday

The Shanghai Silk Market is Holding its Price More Firmly

New Silk Saw Slight Sales Yesterday

Yesterday, the international silk market saw sharp price increases in both Japan and the United States. New York Standard Silk saw a recent rise of five fen and futures rose three fen. Yokohama's spot and futures prices initially rose only slightly by five yuan, but in the afternoon, prices for near and far-month contracts rose sharply by approximately 10 yuan to 20 yuan. The Shanghai silk market has been increasingly firm in the past two days. Due to the scarcity of contracts, manufacturers are holding their prices more firmly, which has led to a decrease in silk transactions. The same is true for customer silk. Yesterday, firms such as Lian Na saw slight sales of new silk. For example, the price of White Factory's seven-eight grade straight-reeled silk was 760 yuan, an increase of approximately 10 yuan compared to the previous price. A total of 90 bales were traded. Sales of silk from other Indian factories have been very quiet recently, and even if there are sales, the volume is small.

### Methods of Preparing Income Tax Returns (10)

— Pan Shihao

(4) Report Form for Withholding Second Category Salary and Remuneration Income (with List) (Continued)

(5) Monthly Payable Amount, Monthly Actual Income. The "Monthly Payable Amount" refers to the fixed amount of salary and remuneration payable for the current month. For all income in this category calculated on a quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or monthly basis, the monthly payable amount can be calculated and recorded in this list. For those calculated on a weekly basis, four weeks are considered one month. Income from short-term labor and piecework wages should also be recorded as the monthly payable amount first. The "Monthly Actual Income" refers to the actual amount of salary and remuneration paid for the current month. This applies to cases where salaries and remuneration are issued at a discount, or a portion is advanced through a loan, or a reduction is made due to leave, or an increase is received due to weekend or night work. The actual income often differs from the fixed payable amount. Therefore, the "Monthly Actual Income" column should be recorded with the actual amount paid. The total of this column must correspond to the total salary and remuneration payment for the current month in the expense ledger. According to Article 16 of the Implementing Regulations, the scope of this category of income is very broad. All monetary payments received from occupations and work are included. Furthermore, according to Article 7 of the Regulations for this category, if the income from business-related salaries and remuneration is in the form of goods or securities, it should be calculated at the market price at the time of issuance, converted into legal currency. Therefore, in the "Monthly Actual Income" column, all earned income should be recorded in monetary amounts. The so-called directors' fees, staff office expenses, and various subsidies are all considered second-category income. Although Article 4 of the Guidelines for this category stipulates that expenses incurred by civil servants on official duty are not within the scope of salaries and remuneration and are not taxed, self-employed individuals and others engaged in various businesses cannot receive the same tax-exempt treatment for their office expense subsidies or entertainment expense subsidies. Moreover, according to the Ministry of Finance's interpretation, ordinary housing and food allowances, i.e., meal and accommodation subsidies provided by employers to employees, except for workers and low-level shop assistants whose monthly salaries and remuneration are less than 30 yuan, must also be included in the salary and remuneration income and recorded in the "Monthly Actual Income" column. Taxpayers receiving such salary and remuneration income, except for those with business establishments who may deduct the appropriate expenses according to Article 17 of the Implementing Regulations, with the remaining amount being the taxable amount, all withholding income taxes listed in this list are based on the actual amount of various income for the current month as the tax withholding amount. It has no relation to the expenses controlled by the taxpayer for that income. This is the general rule of income tax adopting the source of taxation. However, according to Article 10 of the Guidelines for this category, workers' personal insurance expenses may be deducted from the salary and remuneration. This should be noted in the "Remarks" column so that it can be deducted from the actual income for the current month when calculating the income tax payable. As for those exempt from income tax for the second category of income listed in Article 2 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, they should not be included in the "Monthly Payable Amount" and "Monthly Actual Income."

(6) Income Tax Payable. The income tax payable should be calculated according to the tax rates stipulated in Article 5 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, based on the monthly payable amount. The monthly payable income amount varies, and the applicable tax rate also varies, ranging from 5 per mille for a monthly average income of 30 yuan to a progressive tax rate of up to 200 per mille. If the monthly actual income is the same as the monthly payable amount, the tax amount is calculated based on the monthly payable amount. If the monthly actual income is less than the monthly payable amount, a tax amount is first calculated based on the payable amount, and then the tax amount is converted based on the ratio of the actual income to the payable amount and recorded in the "Income Tax Payable" column. If the monthly actual income is greater than the payable amount, it seems appropriate to directly calculate the income tax payable based on the payable amount. The worker's personal insurance expenses that should be deducted according to Article 10 of the Guidelines for this category can be deducted from the monthly actual income before calculating the income tax. For each taxpayer, during each service period, i.e., within each month, if there are multiple types of income, the actual income should be totaled first, and the total income should be observed to correspond to a certain level in the tax rate of this category, and then the income tax payable should be calculated. For example, if a monthly salary and director's fee are paid to the same person, they should be added together to determine the total amount of income actually paid for the current month.

(7) Remarks. The purpose of setting up the "Remarks" column is to record matters other than the above-mentioned items for reference. Regarding this list, matters related to supplementary tax can be reported in the "Remarks" column. However, the calculation of supplementary tax is extremely complicated. It is necessary to first list the tax already paid and calculate the monthly payable amount and monthly actual income of the tax already paid. Then, the income to be added now should be listed, and the tax payable should be calculated based on the total amount of previous and current income. Only then can the monthly supplementary tax amount and the total amount of supplementary tax payable be calculated. Therefore, the "Remarks" position in this list does not seem sufficient for circulation. When other items are used to offset salaries and remuneration in the form of securities or goods, and when the difference between the monthly payable amount and the monthly actual income is too large, the reasons should also be noted in the "Remarks" column.

The above is the method of preparing the income tax withholding list for self-employed individuals and others engaged in various businesses. The procedure can be said to be complicated. As for the preparation method of the report form itself, i.e., the second category salary and remuneration income report form (Type C withholding report form), the procedure is extremely simple. First, the month, name of the withholding and reporting agency, business, and address are listed. What is filled in is the same as what is listed in the above list. Then, the total amount of salary remuneration paid by the agency this month and the total amount of income tax withheld by the agency are listed. These two amounts are carried over from the final total in the list. The intention is to report the total amount listed in the list. The detailed information of this category of income tax withholding has been seen in the list. This report form is just a summary of its total. After the totals are extracted, the tax payable is paid to the receiving agency to obtain a receipt. The date of payment, name of the receiving agency, and receipt number are filled in the report form. The withholding responsible person signs and affixes a seal, and the date of filling in the report is noted. Together with the list, it is sent to the local competent collection agency. The withholding procedure for this category of income tax is complete. Therefore, in terms of the preparation procedure, the withholding of this category of income tax should focus on the content of the list, while the report form itself is very simple.

——Resisting Enemies and Defending Against Insults – Illegality is Unacceptable——

During the Spring and Autumn Period, there was a country called Qi. When Duke Jing of Qi was in power, the national crisis was very serious because the states of Jin and Yan invaded at the same time. Jin attacked A and Zhen, and Yan invaded the area north of the river. Qi sent large armies to meet the enemy on both fronts, but because its military strength was weak, it suffered repeated defeats. Jin and Yan gradually invaded deeper, becoming more and more threatening. This worried Duke Jing of Qi, who immediately summoned his ministers to a meeting to discuss how to resist the enemy. Some ministers had no suggestions, others advocated ceding territory to stop the war, and still others … Finally, a minister named Yan Ying said to Duke Jing of Qi, “If Your Majesty wants to resist Qi, you need a capable general to lead the army.” Duke Jing asked, “Who can take on this role?” Yan Ying replied, “I know someone named Tian Rangju. He is a descendant of Tian Wan and is intelligent and capable. His conduct commands respect, and his military prowess can repel the enemy.” Duke Jing, upon hearing this, immediately ordered Tian Rangju to come to the palace to discuss military matters. Rangju, upon receiving the order, quickly went to the palace. Duke Jing said to him, “Our country is in a very bad situation right now. We have been defeated repeatedly in battles against the enemy because our military strength is weak. Therefore, I have summoned you to lead the army and appoint you as general.” Rangju, knowing that he was being asked to lead the army into battle, hurriedly kowtowed in thanks. Duke Jing then inquired about the strategy for attacking. As he was leaving the palace, Rangju said, “I have a request to make of Your Majesty.” Duke Jing asked, “What is it? Tell me quickly!” Rangju said, “My origin is very humble, and others do not respect me. Now that I have military power and have become a general, I will have no way to deal with those in the army who do not obey me. I would like Your Majesty to send a minister who is trusted by Your Majesty and respected by the people to be a supervisor. This way, the people and the soldiers will obey.” Duke Jing of Qi thought that what he said made sense, so he sent Zhuang Jia to take on this role.

Rangju left the palace and went to visit Zhuang Jia. After they met, they discussed military matters for a while and finally agreed to meet at the military camp at noon on the day of departure. Then they parted.

Time passed quickly, and the appointed day arrived. Rangju, because he had an appointment with Zhuang Jia, was afraid of being late, so he hurried to the military camp before noon to wait. At that time, there were no clocks, so Rangju specially set up a clepsydra to measure time (a clepsydra is an ancient instrument for measuring time, with water in the middle and holes that drip water, which can be used to measure time), waiting for Zhuang Jia.

On the day of departure, Zhuang Jia said goodbye to his relatives and friends, and each place prepared banquets to send him off. He thought that he was a favorite minister of Duke Jing of Qi, so it didn't matter at this time. Therefore, he did not rush and spent time with his relatives and friends. Noon had passed, and it was not until the sun was setting that he bid farewell to his relatives and friends and walked towards the military camp.

Rangju waited for Zhuang Jia in the military camp until after noon, but he still did not come. Rangju was very angry. He immediately destroyed the clepsydra and gave an encouraging speech to the soldiers in the army. Then he returned to his tent to wait for Zhuang Jia. It was not until dark that he saw Zhuang Jia slowly walking over, not caring at all. Rangju was not polite to him at all and asked directly, “Didn't we agree to meet at noon today? Why are you only coming now?” Zhuang Jia said to Rangju with a smile, “Alas, I also wanted to come earlier, but my relatives and friends thought that I was coming to the army today, so they specially prepared banquets to send me off. Therefore, I was delayed and could only come now.” Rangju said, “Our country is now facing strong enemies, and we have lost a lot of territory. Therefore, the King sent you and me to lead the army to fight. You must know that a person is very insignificant. If there is no country and he loses his support, he cannot survive alone. Therefore, everyone should love their country. When a person is ordered to serve the country, he should not take into account his personal affairs. Moreover, this matter has already made the King very anxious, and the lives of the people are tied to you. Now you have violated military discipline. What should be done?” Rangju, without waiting for him to answer, summoned the military law officer and asked, “According to military law, what should be done with those who are late for an appointment?” The military law officer replied, “They should be beheaded.” Zhuang Jia was very afraid when he heard this, so he sent someone to report to Duke Jing, asking Duke Jing to send someone to rescue him quickly. However, as soon as this person was sent away, Rangju beheaded Zhuang Jia and sent someone to carry Zhuang Jia's head to announce it throughout the military camp. When the soldiers saw it, they were all afraid and said, “We must abide by the law in the future.”

After a while, the messenger sent by Duke Jing of Qi to rescue Zhuang Jia arrived. He hurriedly rode his horse into the military camp, and when he saw Rangju, he announced Qi King's order to pardon Zhuang Jia. Rangju said, "When a general is outside, he can not accept the orders of the monarch." He turned to ask the military law officer, "In the military camp, it is not allowed to ride horses, now the king's messenger rides horses into the military camp, what should be done?" The military law officer replied, "Beheaded!" The messenger heard this, scared into a ball, begging for mercy could not say a word. Rangju pondered for a while before saying, "The king's messenger, can not be killed." So he sent someone to kill the two followers who came with the messenger, and let the messenger go back. Rangju this time also sent someone to carry the head, to show it to everyone in the military camp, to persuade the soldiers to abide by the law.

From then on, the arrogant soldiers and brave generals all obeyed military discipline and did not dare to neglect. But Rangju did not just use military law to scare people, he also understood the importance of both grace and power, so he treated people very well, and personally inquired about all the soldiers' food, clothing, shelter, etc. He also took out the food and supplies obtained by the general, and shared them equally with the soldiers, not willing to enjoy them alone, so the soldiers all thanked him and were willing to sacrifice themselves to repay the country. Even the weak soldiers asked to risk their lives to fight the enemy for the country. When the states of Jin and Yan heard this news, they were afraid that they would not be able to defeat Qi, so they hurriedly withdrew their troops. When Rangju's troops arrived at the battlefield, the enemy troops had already retreated without a trace. Thus, Rangju recovered the lost territory without any effort. On the day he returned in triumph, Duke Jing took a group of ministers to welcome him in the suburbs, and praised him. Later, the state appointed Rangju as the Grand Marshal, and later generations called him Marshal Rangju. Since then, the Tian family has occupied a very important position in the state of Qi.

—Stepping Forward When the Country is in Trouble; Calmly Returning to the Fields After Success—

Nistas, the new star, is a strong middle-aged man or older.

He had previously held various important positions in the Roman government, repeatedly holding high office; the whole country recognized him as an intelligent, upright, and capable good official. But after he retired, he did not retain any official airs, and everything was the same as the most ordinary and law-abiding farmers. He originally had a little money, but he spent a lot because he was enthusiastic about public works; finally, he only had that small plot of land not far from the city of Rome, and a sum of money just enough to maintain a simple life. He and his wife left Rome and returned to their own farm to live the life of ordinary people.

As the morning sun just showed its smiling face, Nistas, the new star, carried his hoe, raised his rake, and hummed a tune, cheerfully walking to the fields to work. No matter what position he was in, only work could make him happy, and only meaningful work could make him feel the fullness of life and imagine the fruit of life that would be formed, thus increasing his infinite hope and the power of survival, and thus making him even more energetic. He was no different from ordinary farmers, except that he had a little more spiritual gain. His wife took care of the housework with great care and was a typical virtuous wife. The couple worked together and lived a very peaceful and happy life. Although it was a small garden, it was enough to supply their simple needs.

The people of Rome had not forgotten that Nistas, the new star, was an intelligent and fair gentleman, although he was no longer a rich man. The poor people living near his farm, whenever they had any difficulties or disputes, who didn't run to him for advice? He didn't mind the trouble at all, and even the most trivial things, he tried his best to deal with them for them and solve them, as if they were all his own affairs. As long as he could do it, he was happy to help, because the more opportunities he had to contribute his own efforts, the more he felt the mutual kindness between human beings, and the more he felt that he was not a useless person.

"Is this the home of Nistas, the new star? I was sent by the Roman government, and I have something to see him about." One day, a soldier suddenly came and stood at the door asking Nistas' wife.

"That's right, but he went to the fields to work. Please wait a while, and I'll send someone to call him back."

As soon as Nistas, the new star, heard that a soldier had brought an important summons from the government, he ran home in three steps and two steps.

As soon as the soldier saw him, he said:

"Hello, Nistas, the new star? I have come here in the name of the government to ask you to go to Rome immediately."

"Quickly bring me my cloak, because I have to go right away and can't delay!" he said to his wife. She brought the clothes, and Nistas, the new star, while putting on his cloak, told her not to worry if he didn't come back at night.

He and the soldier rode their horses and flew towards the city of Rome.

When he arrived in Rome, Nistas, the new star, saw a large group of senators waiting for him to come. He guessed that something serious must have happened, and quickly jumped off his horse and walked towards the crowd, who welcomed him very warmly.

After Nistas, the new star, returned the salute, he said:

"Gentlemen senators, you sent someone to call me to Rome immediately. What is the drive?"

One of the senators spoke on behalf of everyone:

"Alas, Nistas, the new star, you know that Rome is at war with the mountain bandits. They come down from their mountain nests and advance towards Rome, burning and looting everywhere, killing many of our compatriots. We sent a brave and elite army to meet them, thinking that we could always eliminate the enemy. But yesterday we saw five people riding horses towards the city of Rome from the city walls, and only those five were able to return."

"What's going on? Can't our Roman soldiers resist the mountain bandits?" Nistas asked. He was both surprised and anxious in his heart.

The old senator frowned tightly and said sadly:

"The soldiers who returned told us that when our army was advancing along a narrow mountain path from a small mountain valley, they were suddenly attacked. They wanted to continue to advance, but found that the road had been blocked by a solid stone wall, and behind the wall was a powerful enemy army. There was no way forward, so they had no choice but to retreat, but the rear road was also blocked by the enemy using the same method, truly so-called "advancing and retreating in a dilemma". At this moment, our soldiers were violently attacked by the enemy army ambushed on the high mountains on both sides of the small path. Countless large stones rolled down from the high places towards our men and horses. Finally, more than half of the casualties had already occurred, and ten people had to risk breaking through the battle line and rushing back to Rome to ask for reinforcements. Only five of those ten people escaped with their lives."

"This situation is too serious," Nistas said, "What do you want me to do?"

"We are asking you to come because we know that within Rome, there is no one more experienced and capable in dealing with war and peace than you are now. Please lead the army we can muster to resist the enemy."

After Nistas, the new star, was ordered, he immediately prepared an attack plan. He ordered the five soldiers who had escaped to carefully and thoroughly draw out the mountain area, the battle terrain, where the small mountain valley was, where the narrow path up the mountain was, and where the stone wall blocking the mountain road was. He gathered his men and told them:

"Dear brothers, we have an army trapped in the valley ahead, and they are still fighting for the survival of the Roman people in desperation! I hope you can help to rescue those brave men from danger. Are you all willing to go?"

"Willing! Willing! This is our responsibility!" The crowd responded in unison.

So Nistas, the new star, gladly led his subordinates and chose the most remote and dangerous road that few people had traveled to advance. They held their breaths and walked cautiously, and finally climbed to a peak higher than the one occupied by the enemy, shouting loudly. Those mountain bandits suddenly looked up and saw the Roman soldiers above them, and they were immediately panicked and ran around the mountain, each fleeing for their lives. Many were killed. The rest who were blocking the road in the valley below also collapsed and retreated. The trapped Roman soldiers were fortunate to be reborn and forgot their fatigue and cheered.

After a few days, the new and old armies gathered together and followed the leading leader Nistas, the new star, back to the city of Rome. In those sixteen days, Nistas, the new star, was the only great man in all of Rome. He saved a Roman army and saved Rome itself. When he took off his helmet and changed his war robe, he felt very happy in his heart, because he had done another part of the national duty in his life. What made him even happier was that he had not died in battle this time, and he was still alive to wait for the opportunity to contribute himself, if the country needed him.

The senators and the Roman people, because of the achievements of Nistas, the new star, this time, were willing to recommend him as the leader of all of Rome. But, when they expressed their love and offered such a glorious high position, he thought in his heart, now that there is someone who can rule Rome, why should I take credit for a little bit of due diligence? My service to the country is out of love for the country, do I hope to get high officials and generous salaries? So he resolutely refused, and he said:

"I am very grateful for the kindness of my compatriots, but my only wish in my life is to return to my own farm and be a law-abiding farmer. I think you love me, and you must not force me." After he finished speaking, he smiled contentedly, jumped on his own white horse, and with the sound of hooves, he went home by himself.

The next day, as the morning sun just showed its smiling face, Nistas, the new star, again carried his hoe, raised his rake, and hummed a tune, more cheerfully walking to the fields to work.

### Lü He Fenke (1632-1723)

— Wu Bixiong

(Continued from Issue 49)

—The First Person to Know of Microorganisms—

In 1723, this scientist, who had worked diligently for seventy years, bid farewell to the world. He was already ninety-one years old. At the end of his life, he still never forgot his work, asking his old friends to translate his last two letters into Latin and send them to the Royal Society of London.

The story of the first discoverer of microorganisms thus comes to an end. Later, those who continued to study microorganisms included the radiant master Spallanzani, the thousandfold imaginative Pasteur, and Robert Kode, who brought clear efficacy to mankind by fighting against microorganisms that harm people; their names and the names of other microorganism hunters are much more well-known than Lü Fenke today; but none of them was as sincere, surprisingly accurate, and possessed as sound a mind as this Dutch tradesman, despite his lack of methods. He was the pioneer of microorganisms! He was the leader of the generally famous successors! Without him, microbiology would have taken several more decades to begin its history.

Lü Fenke's opportunity came because in his hometown, there was a biologist named Graf, who was a corresponding member of the Royal Society because of his unique research on the human ovary. This biologist appreciated Lü's research and introduced him to the Royal Society. The Royal Society was greatly astonished by the mysteries under his lens.

Many fundamental scientific discoveries seem unbelievably simple to later generations. For thousands of years, humans encountered these so-called "things right in front of their eyes" but always overlooked them. We are the same with microorganisms. Now, almost anyone can leisurely admire the movement and somersaults of microorganisms under a microscope, and first-year medical students can point out to us the spreaders of various terrible diseases. Who would have thought that Lü Fenke's discovery of this secret came from hard work! With a desire for perfection, he repeatedly made hundreds of lenses, and he examined everything like a madman with the enthusiasm of discovering novelty. But this seemingly crazy work was a necessary preparation for the memorable day he would later create!

The memorable day was when he used a fine glass tube to suck up a drop of rainwater and observed it. What he discovered that day became the opening chapter of the entire story of mythical deeds, and the theory of microorganisms—bacteriology—records this type of story. Lü Fenke had "observation madness"; only a weirdo like him would have thought of using his lens to look at such a boring and ordinary thing—a drop of rainwater, countless raindrops falling from the sky! What else could be in the water besides water?

He took a glass tube drawn into a fine thread in the flame and went into the garden, sucked up a drop of rainwater in the water tank, returned to the laboratory, and inserted the fine glass tube into the needle of the microscope... After a short while, his daughter Maria suddenly heard her father's excited voice.

"Come! Haha! There are small creatures in this drop of rainwater... They are swimming... They are moving in circles! They are a thousand times smaller than anything visible to the naked eye... Come here and see! See! What I have discovered!" (End)

Publishing World

### Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees by Chanranzi

— Zhao Jingshen

"Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees by Chanranzi" can be found in the Shuofu, Volume 32, by Ming Tao Zongyi, which includes the "Gujin Shuohai Shenji" by Ming Lu Ji. However, only eight articles are the same in both versions; the Shuofu version has sixteen articles that are not in the "Gujin Shuohai" version, all marked with "This article not seen." It seems that the engravers had once checked against "Gujin Shuohai," right? The "Gujin Shuohai" version has twenty-six articles that are not in the Shuofu version, so by piecing the two versions together, a total of fifty jokes can be obtained. The format of the two versions is also different. The Shuofu version has a separate title for each article, while the "Gujin Shuohai" version has no titles.

This book is also a compilation. The preface says: "Mr. Lü Juren of Donglai wrote the 'Xuanqu Lu,' all recording laughable events of the time. I have observed that there are many such things in various family miscellanies. During my leisure, I compiled a collection and named it 'Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees.' It not only provides a laugh for the reader but also supplements the omissions of 'Xuanqu Lu.' Written by Chanranzi on the day of the Beginning of Spring in the first year of Yanyou." It can be seen that this book is "compiled" and "collected" from "various family miscellanies."

The "Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao" believes that "Shuofu contains this book, titled 'Song Yuan Huai,'" and thus concludes that Chanranzi is the pen name of Song Yuan Huai. However, the Ming edition of Shuofu only writes Yuan □□□. What the "Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao" says may refer to the error-ridden edition compiled by Yao Antao during the Qing Shunzhi Dinghai period, right? Therefore, I believe the "Tiyao's" words are unreliable. I believe that Chanranzi should be a person from the Yuan Dynasty, or at the earliest, a person from the late Song Dynasty and early Yuan Dynasty. There are two pieces of evidence: First, the Ming edition of Shuofu titles it as written by a Yuan person. Second, the preface states the year as "the first year of Yanyou." Yanyou is the second reign title of Yuan Renzong. The first year of Yanyou is 1314; the Song Dynasty fell in 1279. The "Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees" was compiled more than thirty years after the fall of the Song Dynasty. It is certainly possible for the compiler to have witnessed the transition from Song to Yuan. As for why Song Dynasty events are not marked as Song, there is also an explanation: because Song Dynasty events are all compiled from Song Dynasty notes and written directly as they were, there is no need to add the word "Song." Moreover, as a Song Dynasty remnant, he did not consider himself a Yuan person during the Yuan Dynasty, so the word "Song" could be omitted even more.

The editor's selection perspective is quite similar to Xie Zhaozhi's "Wuzazu." For example, the second article in the Shuofu version discussing the "Analects" is the forty-fourth article in "Wuzazu," the sixteenth article about placing a hat on a monk's head is the one hundred and twenty-third article in "Wuzazu," the nineteenth article about exchanging sheep books is the ninety-third article in "Wuzazu," and the twenty-fourth article about the thief's poem is the forty-ninth article in "Wuzazu." The "Shuohai" version also has three articles that are the same as the sixteenth, one hundred and fifteenth, and one hundred and twenty-second articles in "Wuzazu." Among these seven identical articles, perhaps some were indirectly taken from "Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees" by "Wuzazu," right?

The thirteenth article of "Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees," "Bird Language," became the form of "Xuetao Xiaoshu" in the hands of Jiang Jinzhi. Here are both articles listed next to each other to examine the transformation of jokes:

"Wang Jinggong once drank with a guest and liked to extract phrases from Confucian classics to make bird language orders. The swallow said: 'To know is to know, to not know is to not know, this is knowing.' For a long time, no one could answer. Liu Gongfu suddenly said, 'May I extract words from a sentence?' He then made a pigeon order, saying: 'Sell or not sell, sell.' All the guests laughed." ("Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees") "Gongye Chang understands bird language. Once, Confucius heard a dove cooing and said, 'What is it saying?' He replied, 'It says, 'Not a wine vessel, not a wine vessel.'' He also heard a swallow speaking and said, 'What is it saying?' He replied, 'It says, 'To know is to know, to not know is to not know, this is knowing.''" ("Xuetao Xiaoshu")

Wang Jinggong and Liu Gongfu have transformed into Confucius and Gongye Chang, which is quite interesting.

### "Service and Self-Cultivation" (Continued from Issue 96)

— Li Hantian

Physical cultivation is a basic condition for youth, not only a personal issue but also related to the future of the national cause. The so-called physical cultivation, its way is also very simple, that is, from the relationship between ordinary clothing, food, housing, sports, holidays, diseases, etc., and health, that is, how to seek to reach the realm of health. For example, the purpose, material, washing style, etc., of clothing, the nutritional components of food, the location, light, air, and windows of housing, the selection of various aspects of sports and their methods, common sense of diseases, hygiene, and prevention of infectious diseases, etc., are all very important.

The third is the problem of career, career outlook, and leadership qualifications. Career issues such as job selection criteria, the difficulty of getting a job, the way to get a job, the method of trial work, research on changing jobs, the mistakes of unemployment, the method of reemployment, the key to promotion, and the study of success are all described in detail according to the actual situation of vocational services.

Those engaged in vocational work, for career as well have a life outlook, the primary thing is a consistent way of dealing with people and things. Everywhere, remember the ideas of "what," "what," and "how." What are the characters in the vocational world like? How does fate say that it is difficult for a career to progress? The differences and mutual relationships between labor, compensation, and capital, discovering the greatest happiness from the profession itself, and eliminating its suffering. What the world calls happiness and suffering is mostly false, so special attention should be paid to the basic conditions of happiness. Occupation is service, which lies in doing it practically, not just relying on talking. In the face of matters, the mind should be cold, the blood should be hot, the emotions should be hot, and there should be a sense of proportion in dealing with events and resisting. Achieve a neutral life. What is the fundamental difference between individualism and non-individualism in the vocational world? The key points of a career outlook are to first know what life is? How does the degree of change between life outlook and society? All need to have a definite understanding.

Each section on leadership qualifications is also described concisely and accurately. How to be a leader? The leader's recruitment of people, the distribution of work, the coordination of opinions, the design and leadership of the outline, the handling of emergencies, the cultivation of talents, etc., must have unique talents to be competent, so the leader's talent, knowledge, and morality must be more deeply cultivated than ordinary people.

The above is a microcosm of this book, which is not only relied on by young people in vocational supplementary schools to supplement vocational skills, but also a way to study the essentials of being a human being. Mr. He Qingru introduced this book, saying: "Service and self-cultivation can be regarded as a guide to the life of young people... If young people can follow the path indicated, adapt to their personal characteristics, and follow it earnestly, it can guarantee success in their careers and effectiveness in their lives. Even middle-aged people may as well get the same benefits from this book."

Mr. He's words are very pertinent. Although this book was aimed at young people in vocational supplementary schools at the time, it can actually be used as a textbook for practical self-cultivation citizens for ordinary people in general. This book explains principles thoroughly, selects materials innovatively, and the author uses lively words to list many practical principles regarding the above, based on his life experience and referring to the words and deeds of philosophers from ancient and modern China and abroad. Compared with reading those outdated and empty books on self-cultivation, it is really more beneficial. In short, this book has the function of improving and guiding the ideological life, knowledge, and work of young people. (End)

### Military Expansion and Destruction

— Fang

Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that the French Minister of Defense Daladier gave a speech, saying that the international expansion of armaments is sufficient to prove the necessity of France issuing national defense bonds. For example, since Germany estimated its occupation of the Rhineland region, it has trained more than one million soldiers and created armored divisions equipped with artillery for bombing tanks. Its air force and navy have also been reorganized, and the scale is grand. Italy is also making every effort to develop its air force and navy. The Soviet Union's permanent army is estimated to be more than 1.3 million. In addition, there are thousands of tanks and thousands of aircraft, and its powerful navy is under construction. Other countries such as Poland and the Little Entente are also making great efforts to increase their armaments. Switzerland recently raised national defense bonds in less than a few hours. Even the United Kingdom, which has always been most enthusiastic about reducing armaments, has recently decided to spend 16 billion francs within five years for national defense. Naturally, a country must have a large military preparation in order to stand on its own feet and exist in the world, especially when the great powers are rectifying their armies and expanding their armaments to a fever pitch, it is not enough to survive without expanding armaments.

But they want to expand their armaments, and we are expanding our armaments. They want to recover their colonies, and we want to seize new territories. Therefore, all the national power, financial resources, and material resources of the country are sacrificed in one fell swoop in the expansion of armaments. In the end, the weak will not be able to survive and will be destroyed, and the strong will meet an even stronger one and will be destroyed again. The destruction of the weak is no different from the destruction of Abyssinia or the civil war in Spain, which is an area for strong neighbors to test their military strength. The destruction of the strong is to spend another ten years of reproduction and ten years of training to wash away their national shame. In this way, it is not easy to protect the weak country, and how can the strong country be protected.

Or some are afraid that the national strength of one country is not enough to resist strong neighbors and conquer strong neighbors, so they advocate a collective security strategy, sign secret agreements with each other, and form alliances with each other. As a result, the weak are afraid of the encroachment of strong neighbors and unite with each other, and the strong are also afraid of being controlled by the weak and also unite with each other. The more solid the unity of both sides, the greater and wider the destructive power will be. Even if one side wins, the unity will be disrupted by unequal interests and mutual suspicion, and the war will last for a long time. If so, it will become a cruel world and a terrifying world, and no matter how strong or weak, it will not stop until they all perish together. Therefore, the result of military expansion must lead to destruction. This is an unavoidable truth.

However, I am also worried about those who actively expand their armaments. The main war weapons of the so-called military expansion now are aircraft, artillery, tanks, and warships. Among these, aircraft are the most cruel and powerful weapons. However, science is now developing rapidly. For example, Germany recently invented a death ray, thinking that once an aircraft encounters a death ray, all aircraft will become ineffective. This kind of weapon is probably only an ideal, and when it comes to the real invention period, so countries still regard aircraft as the only weapon and rush to manufacture them without sparing any effort. In case this thing is really invented, the aircraft will be useless. However, the current world is one of science. If there is this ideal, it will definitely become a reality. Therefore, today's scientists and military strategists should not think about rushing to make aircraft and tanks, but should think about how to prevent aircraft and tanks from doing so, so that the so-called modern war weapons will be useless, and the world may have a day of peace.

### Not Knowing the Taste of Meat

— Xing An

According to a recent survey by the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau, "In January of this year, the number of slaughters of various meats dropped sharply. Compared with the same period last year, pigs decreased by 27.36%, sheep decreased by 54.56%, and cattle decreased by 1.40%. Therefore, the work of the slaughterhouse is quite leisurely," it is said. This matter seems very ordinary, but it is worth noting! The problem is not the stagnation of meat sales itself, but the phenomenon of residents' lives reflected by it is serious.

Meat is one of the main foods. No matter how poor or rich, people always have to eat some. The reduction of meat consumption precisely illustrates the hardship of people's lives. There are many poor people living in Shanghai. But from this fact, we can understand the extent of poverty among ordinary people. At least we can see that the lives of residents are more difficult this year than last year!

The situation is probably like this. It is originally difficult for ordinary families to cope with daily necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt. Meat is difficult to make a main food, but compared with vegetables, it is inevitably more extravagant. Therefore, when it is not easy for everyone to maintain their lives, they have to start by being thrifty, giving up meat and eating vegetarian food. Two dimes of pork is only enough for three or four people to eat a meal. Two hundred pennies of vegetables can barely last a day.

Another reason is that the prices of all goods in the market have been high for a year, which has increased the living standards of the people. According to the survey, various vegetables rose about twice as much last year as the year before. And meats such as pork, sheep, and cattle have also increased in price one after another. This has greatly affected the lives of residents. Many people can't even afford vegetables, let alone meat! This has caused the number of meat slaughters to drop sharply.

It is said that there was an emperor in the past who heard that there was a famine in the local area and that the people could not get food. The emperor felt sad and worried about it and asked the people around him, "Why don't the people eat meat?" From the perspective of the emperor who did not know the people's feelings, this question could not be more reasonable. It can be said that he had good plans, but when we hear it, it is like he is joking intentionally. It is too ridiculous! If the people had meat to eat, would they be afraid of starving?

But this is only limited to the poor, and the rich are not counted. A group of masters and young masters in Shanghai don't care about a big dish costing fifty yuan, let alone pork costing more than three pounds for one yuan? Maybe they don't even want to swallow this kind of thing.

Fortunately, according to health experts, vegetarian food is very beneficial to the body. Recently, a new theory of "meat is harmful" has also been invented in Germany(?). In this way, although the poor do not have the blessing of eating meat, it is good for their health. Then everyone doesn't have to sigh "not knowing the taste of meat" anymore!

Scientific Miscellany

### A Study Comparing the Intelligence of Cats and Dogs

— Chao Xi

Are cats as intelligent as dogs? The answer obtained from empirical judgment is negative. Many scientific tests have also confirmed that dogs are more intelligent. However, science is not so credulous. The reason is that there has not been a fair study of cats, because dogs are social animals. They love their masters, make their masters happy, like to be praised, and have more opportunities to show their intelligence than cats. As for cats, their nature and habits are solitary. They are indifferent to their masters' attitudes and praises. Naturally, it is not easy to see their "intelligence."

Recently, the psychology laboratory of Columbia University is investigating the extent to which cats can be intelligent. The equipment used in the research is very ingenious, that is, the cat is locked in a cage and asked to open the door. The form of the problem is as follows: Can the cat open the door? If so, how many times will it try?

The method is as follows: three wooden round thin plates are placed on the floor, and they are connected with metal wires. Pulling one of them can make all of them move. Arranged in this way, if the animal can step on it according to the appropriate procedure, it can open the door of the food box. For example, if we arrange the boards, the hungry cat must first step on the first board, then the second board, and then the third board to get the milk in the box.

Dr. Hunt, a professor of psychology at Clark University, has done a different experiment. His purpose is to determine how much time an animal can focus on an action plan. The tool used in the experiment is a house with a population, with three food boxes in front of it. First, the animal is trained to let it know that when there is light at the opening of the box, it is the food box that can be opened. After the connection between food and light can be firmly established,

## Page 20

, the real test begins.

In this experiment, the light is first emitted. The animal sees the light through the wire mesh and prepares to run to the front of the box to find food. But now the light is turned off, and the animal is prohibited from running away and told to wait for a moment. Then, after how much time can the animal still remember the shining box? According to the results of the experiment, cats can remember for 16 to 18 seconds, while dogs can remember for 1 minute to 2 minutes.

There are also many reliable and amazing stories about the intelligence of cats. Romanes, the secretary of zoology and naturalist of the Linnaeus Society of London, once said that there was a story that a cat, whose owner had the habit of throwing broken bread to birds, would hide in the trees and suddenly jump out to catch them when the birds were eating. Once, the bread was thrown out at dusk and covered with light snow. The next morning, the owner found that the cat had opened the snow, the bread had been moved to another place, and it had been placed on the snow, and then it was hiding in the woods, waiting for the birds to come.

There is another story that a cat's back was accidentally stained with kerosene, and then it got fire on its back because it approached the stove and sparks flew on it. It immediately ran out of the house and jumped into the water tank to put out the fire.

These examples, if we admit that they are reliable, show that not only do cats have the ability to observe, but also the ability to plan, showing high intelligence.

As for the story about dogs, Romanes once said that a dog hated taking a bath very much. Its resentment became deeper day by day. Later, as long as it saw a servant bringing water to bathe it, it became very violent. So the hostess wanted to try it herself. But she couldn't succeed. She couldn't succeed in coaxing it, threatening it, beating it, or starving it. Finally, the owner decided to use the "quiet coping method." She ignored it. When she went for a walk, she no longer took it out. When she sat down to read or sew clothes, the dog ran to her, and she turned her head away. After more than ten days like this. Finally, one morning, the dog came to her and showed an attitude of repentance, so she immediately gave it a bath, and it was very tolerant. It cried happily and jumped out the door for its daily walk. The second time it was bathed, it was very stubborn at first, but as soon as the owner turned her head away, it immediately jumped into the bathtub.

From the evidence of experiments and stories, it can be seen that dogs are more intelligent than cats. However, to make a fair comparison, the significant differences between dogs and cats should be studied, so we have to study their genetics. Dogs come from a social animal (wolves), while cats come from a solitary animal (wild cats, etc.). Therefore, in the case of dogs, we should think that they are fundamentally social animals. When they attack and defend, they are united, which lays the foundation for cooperation. On the contrary, cats are solitary, and their characteristics are self-sufficiency, ingenuity, and cunning.

Although many years have passed, old habits still exist. When dogs chase their prey, they bark loudly, but cats quietly and silently walk towards their goal. Also, dogs seem to be competing with other dogs when they call for food. They eat very quickly and don't chew carefully, but cats are careful eaters, often spending a lot of time playing with their prey before killing and eating it.

Because dogs have no instinct and history of loneliness, they are very painful when abandoned. As soon as it finds its owner, it will faithfully follow him, but cats are not the same. They are not in familiar places.

From this, we can also know why dogs are very obedient and have a sense of responsibility, because they are social animals. They know what is reasonable and unreasonable, so they are willing to rely on their owners even if they are punished for their mistakes, but cats cannot accept any punishment, otherwise they will run away.

In short, there is not much difference in intelligence between cats and dogs.

### 代 Post

Mr. Zheng:

Since the supplement does not have a fixed length, the typesetting room often keeps five or six manuscripts to make up for the length when arranging the layout. Therefore, it is not surprising that a manuscript cannot be published within a few days, unless it is time-sensitive. I am afraid that this is a difficulty that Mr. "the editor you worked with" did not think of, right?

The weather is clear and the fragrance of grass is everywhere. No way to dispel sorrow but to stroll the streets. I am, by nature, a chivalrous soul, hard to subdue. Who would have thought I would marry that Yan Xijiao. I swallow my anger and try to comfort myself. Who cares about unexpected troubles? The intimate talks beside the pillow are strange and unusual. She is, like willow catkins, her nature hard to control. I must constantly, like searching for a snake in the grass, be on guard everywhere. Oh, how annoying! Oh, how annoying! Her unrestrained behavior does not invite envy. At this moment, her outward heart is revealed. Ah, Yan Xijiao, Yan Xijiao, I see that your constant arguing is not without cause. In the end, when the truth is revealed, how will you cope? My thoughts are in turmoil as I ponder. I encounter the procuress on the street. The fragrant quilt has been wasted until today. How can I comfort Yan Xijiao? She is, her eyes wet with tears, always thinking of you. She regrets it to this day, full of sorrow. You should know that marital discord is common. You should not have hardened your heart and run away elsewhere. It is truly a coincidence to meet here. I urge you to temporarily endure and return to the fragrant nest. My thoughts are muddled, and I am too lazy to lift my body. I am, suddenly hearing a shout, instantly stunned. One is, a thorn in my eye, resentment in my heart upon meeting. One is, in broad daylight, afraid that she won't come. But it is said that Lang is sitting downstairs. It makes one speechless and full of doubt. This act of infidelity will be punished. She must kneel in the courtyard and offer apologies. Perhaps then, I can appease Ping Nu's hatred.

### About "Full of Life and Vigor"

Xu Xinfu has continuously filmed two detective blockbusters, and his attempt has opened up a new path for domestic films.

This film continues his past style, but in terms of subject matter, it more accurately exposes reality, telling us about a certain mission we should have in the present with the rampant flames of bandits in the northern country and the heroic struggles of detectives.

He has put in a lot of effort, a serious attitude, and a tense emotion, and is about to complete the entire film.

In terms of performance, it is not only full of thrilling scenes, but also has the magnificent assistance of the government army in the fierce battle between the army and bandits, with officers personally participating, which is truly commendable.

The actors include the Gu Lanjun and Mei Jun sisters, Wang Zhengxin, Gong Jianong, Xie Yunqing, etc., who are all well-known stars in the film industry. Their skillful and profound acting skills have long been confirmed, and there is even more surprising progress in this film.

Audiences, this "Full of Life and Vigor" will give you a new feeling and a new excitement!

### "The General's Daughter" Premiered Last Night

"The General's Daughter" premiered at the New Light Grand Theater last night at 9:15 PM.

This is a historical episode from the Dawn era. The story tells the tragedy of a warlord's madness, tyranny, and slaughter on the eve of his downfall. The general's daughter has a classmate (who is also her lover), but he is a revolutionary youth. Because of their different positions, separation is inevitable. However, she sympathizes with the revolution, opposes her father's atrocities, and although her father loves her very much, she finally betrays him and takes a pistol, killing her father with tears in her eyes.

Li Zhuozhuo's portrayal of the general's daughter is undoubtedly successful. Although Li Qing is a newcomer, he gives us a surprising discovery here. Han Langen's little soldier is really cute. The embarrassment when he was found naked in the bathtub by the officer is a burst of laughter.

Last night, when the film premiered, the New Light Grand Theater was already packed with audiences before 8:30 PM. Many people had to leave temporarily because it was full, which shows the audience's love for Lianhua films.

He Mengfu, the director of "The General's Daughter," has a deep understanding of film and drama. The film's outstanding achievements are certainly not without reason.

### Minxin News

The "New Humanitarianism" location shooting team reports: They are still working in Qingjiangpu and have received the help of favorable weather, geography, and people, so the results are exceptionally satisfactory.

Jin Qingyu recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing to manage company affairs. Because there are still unfinished matters in Beijing, he will go to Beijing again soon and will not be able to return to Shanghai to prepare for the start of "Siblings Quarrel" until two weeks later.

Li Keng's father, Li Minwei, recently went to Qingjiangpu to visit and take care of Li and Ms. Lin Chuchu, who are filming on location in Qingjiangpu, and to observe the filming.

Xiao Ying has been hired to play the role of Police Chief in Ren Pengnian's film "Mysterious Female Detective." This kind of solemn and upright character suits Xiao's personality. His excellent performance in "Gate of Flesh and Spirit" will add a lot of color to "Mysterious Female Detective."

Wu Lizhu's previous films were most famous in Southeast Asia, so she is known as the Queen of Southeast Asia. This time, her performance in "Mysterious Female Detective" is even more enjoyable. With the addition of strongman Peng Fei and tough guy star Wen Rong assisting in the performance, they will surely achieve extraordinary results to entertain the audience.

The story of "Little Gentleman," starring Lin Chuchu and Li Keng, is taken from "Little Lord Fauntleroy," but it will be adapted by Bu Wancang to make the plot even more moving.

### Model Children's Drama Society Expanding Recruitment of Members

Children are the supporters of future society and the builders of the new world. They will continue our work and complete all the great achievements that our generation has not completed. Therefore, we should value children and pay more attention to children's education - because everything they receive in childhood is more intense and lasting, and "education" is easier than "re-education."

Drama is a new tool for creating new children and the most powerful weapon for educating children. The members of the "Model Children's Monthly" have realized this, so they have launched a "Model Children's Drama Society." Now the preparations are complete, and it has been decided to hold a formal founding meeting on March 28. The entertainment program will include two one-act children's plays, "The Thief" and "A Glimpse of Jia Bei."

In order to provide responsible guidance to children who are interested in drama, the society has hired Hong Shen, Xu Xingzhi, Zhang Min, Song Zhi, Chen Liting, Cui Wanqiu, Xu Huaisha, Li Yi, Mo Si, Lu Si, etc. as consultants. It is heard that the society plans to make large-scale school tours. Because it feels that there are not enough talents, it is openly recruiting members once. All children (whether they are students or store apprentices) and elementary school teachers who are interested in drama are sincerely welcome to participate. Those interested, please register with Mr. Zhou at 27 Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road.

Their lives are very poor, and they have no extra money to buy aviation lottery tickets, but when luck comes, gold will really fall from the sky.

Group Rice Harvesting

The Agricultural College of Anhui University has contracted 100,000 acres of official wasteland in Xihu, Huoqiu County, built embankments for rice cultivation, and achieved significant results. During the rice harvesting season last year, the water was three or four feet deep, but fortunately, the rice was five or six feet tall, so it was not harmed. The Agricultural College of Anhui University recruited more than 2,000 farmers and workers, 100 sailboats, and organized a rice harvesting team, with three district teams and fifty-four combined teams. Dean Feng Zigang of the college and all the teachers and students of the first-year agronomy department personally supervised the work, organizing daily groups for harvesting, transportation, and threshing, and holding work competitions. Those with excellent results could receive bonuses in addition to their due remuneration, and the order was excellent. The following pictures show some aspects of the work.
