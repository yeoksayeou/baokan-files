### Chen Juesheng Says the Situation in North China Is Not Special

Currently Focusing Efforts on Economic Construction; Many External Rumors Are Not Worth Believing

[Tianjin] Chen Juesheng said that recently, the general observation of the situation in North China as special is a mistake. The Hebei-Chahar authorities have been striving at all times to preserve territorial sovereignty and stabilize the people's hearts through compromise. Although minor setbacks were inevitable during the past year, the results were all resolved in accordance with this principle in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. After Song took charge, North China became increasingly prosperous, and the people's hearts turned towards stability. This is the common view of the general public. In the future, internal and external affairs will continue to be carried out in accordance with this principle. In addition, efforts are being focused on economic construction in an attempt to achieve increasing prosperity. The policy of the new Japanese cabinet also seems to be aimed at genuine promotion, and there may be no further thought of aggression. In recent times, many external rumors have been misled by hearsay. In reality, the internal and external situation is such that there should be no change in the situation. The central government has a deep understanding of the situation of the Hebei-Chahar authorities. The internal harmony of Hebei-Chahar and the effort to stabilize society and prosperity will be realized from the ideal goal. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)

### On the Need to Establish an Institution for Islamic Cultural Studies

— Bai Shouyi

Due to the general backwardness of cultural undertakings in our country, all academic research has been preempted by others. Although there are as many as 50 million Muslims in our country, there has never been an Islamic cultural research institution to conduct centralized research. As a result, knowledge about Chinese Islam has to rely on the research reports and travel notes of Europeans and Americans. In the past, everyone lived their lives in a muddled way and felt that it was only a matter of academic embarrassment, without any serious consequences. Now, the practical lessons are very severe, making us feel that the establishment of an Islamic cultural institution is not only of great benefit to pure academics, but also an indispensable research institution for solving border issues and domestic ethnic problems.

First, from a purely academic point of view: ㊀ From the perspective of world cultural history, Islamic culture is an important cultural system among the various cultures of the world. On the one hand, it absorbed Greek, Persian, and Indian cultures, achieving its own special characteristics. On the other hand, it spread to dark Europe, initiating modern European civilization. After the mid-thirteenth century, although the power of Islam on the world political stage had completely declined, the development of Islamic culture did not stop due to political reasons. Even now, apart from the approximately 50 million Chinese believers, there are also Arabs, Persians, Turks, Egyptians, Spaniards, more than 60 million Indians, and many other ethnic groups who are immersed in the circle of Islamic culture. From the perspective of world cultural history, Islamic culture is indeed a vast object that must be studied. ㊁ From the perspective of Chinese cultural history, Islam has been related to China for more than a thousand years. During the Tang and Song dynasties, due to the frequent exchanges between Muslims and countries to the East and West, there was a large amount of exchange of cultural products between Islamic countries (Arab) and China. To briefly mention the most obvious, in terms of Chinese products, there were silk, tea, and porcelain, which are daily necessities that could affect the daily life of Arabs; there were papermaking and the compass, which could promote Arab culture and develop Arab maritime commerce. In terms of Arab products, there were rhinoceros horns, ivory, and jewelry, which were ornaments purchased at great expense by the Chinese aristocracy; there were frankincense, ambergris, styrax oil, and rose water, which were fragrances commonly cherished by all levels of Chinese society; there were asafoetida, myrrh, galbanum, and castoreum, which were valuable medicines commonly used by the Chinese to protect their health. After the Yuan Dynasty ruled China, the relationship between Muslims and Chinese culture became even closer. At this time, there were many important politicians, military strategists, literary giants, poets, scholars, and painters among the Muslims. The palaces and capitals of Beijing, which are known to the world for their magnificence, were also created by the Muslim architect Yeheidie'er during the Yuan Dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty, although the cultural contributions of Muslims were not as great as in the Yuan Dynasty, the Islamic calendar and the Muslim prescriptions still occupied important positions. This shows that the study of Islamic culture is an unavoidable task in the study of Chinese cultural history. As for wanting to collate the historical materials of the Arabs in the old books of past dynasties, or wanting to conduct in-depth research on Mongolian history, it is impossible to start without a considerable study of Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and the classics of Islamic writers.

Second, from the perspective of border issues: ㊀ Now our actual borders, apart from the coastline, are in Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia in the north, Gansu and Xinjiang in the northwest, and Tibet, Xikang, and Guangxi in the southwest. In these border areas, apart from the old banners in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia provinces, most of which were Mongolians, and most of the Kang and Tibetan areas being Tibetans, the total number of Muslims in southeastern Ningxia and Gansu and Xinjiang provinces is much larger than that of the local Han Chinese. Although the number of Muslims in Yunnan is less than that in Gansu and Xinjiang, it is by no means much different from the number of Han Chinese. In Hebei and Guangxi provinces, the number of Muslims is not very large, but it also accounts for a considerable number. From the perspective of the proportion of people, Muslims can be said to be the most important component of the border compatriots. These Muslim compatriots on the border have stronger religious beliefs and stronger religious organizations than the Muslims in the interior. If they are handled well, they can become a bulwark for defending the border; if they are not handled well, they may also become an obstacle to national defense work. But if you want to handle them well, you must understand their fundamental beliefs, their thoughts and lifestyles, and the broader culture on which they rely. If you have a considerable understanding of the above points, then you can implement good laws with new meanings based on existing regulations, follow their preferences, avoid their taboos, and persevere over time, often with great results. For example, on our borders, we need the national consciousness and self-defense forces of our border compatriots. On our borders, the national consciousness of our Muslim compatriots is not necessarily universally strong, but Islam does have the teachings of loyalty to the country and fighting for justice. Saying this kind of teaching to Muslim compatriots is much more effective than talking about a set of political theories. Although the self-defense of our Muslim compatriots on the border is not necessarily strong, a mosque is often the center of the organization of the nearby believers, and a religious leader is often the leader of the organization of the believers. If, under appropriate allocation and guidance, a mosque is used as a unit of a self-defense area, and a trained religious leader is used as the leader of a self-defense area, the organization of self-defense will be much easier, and the promotion of self-defense will also be easier. These are all benefits of having Islamic knowledge. ㊁ The areas bordering our borders, from west of Xinjiang to the western border of Yunnan, all belong to a kind of Islamic zone. This area stretches westward to Africa. Although most of this vast area now has other overlords, it is the true masters of these places who are our actual neighbors. From a more distant perspective, understanding their culture is a necessary preparation for our future nation-building. Even if we set aside this point, we must also focus on the current interests of border defense and need to understand the cultural spirit and various cultural forms of these places.

Third, from the perspective of ethnic issues: The Chinese people's concept of race has always been very weak, and in fact there may not really be a distinction between the so-called five races. However, due to the implementation of the Qing Dynasty's divisive policies, many untrue racial concepts were invisibly transplanted into the hearts of most people. The most untrue of these is the view of the Hui people, and the view of the Hui people is also the one that has caused evil consequences to this day. This view, during the Qing Dynasty, caused great tragedies in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, and created countless deaths and injuries in Yunnan. Not many years ago, the Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Gansu areas also created a serious situation because of this view. Even now, many misunderstandings between the Hui and Han peoples are caused by this view. In fact, the bloodline of our Muslim compatriots is very extensive, with some originating from Arabs, some from Persians, some from Turks, some from Uyghurs, and some from Han people who changed their original beliefs, and the last source is probably the largest in number. Because if the bloodline of Chinese Muslims is mostly foreign, then there is no way to explain how foreigners can reproduce to a population of 50 million. If there is a centralized research institution, on the one hand, it can prove the close relationship between Chinese Muslims and Han Chinese from the perspective of bloodline, on the other hand, it can prove the relationship between Islam and China from the perspective of culture, and on the other hand, it can prove from the development of Islam in the world that Islam is not a narrow racial religion. Then, Muslim compatriots can recognize the past history and feel a great responsibility to the country, and should hold a more distant view of religion; non-Muslim compatriots can also recognize the importance of the status of Muslim compatriots in Chinese culture and Chinese destiny, and develop a sense of respect and love. The old, unreasonable concepts can be slowly changed, and many so-called ethnic barriers can be completely swept away.

Now, there are no shortage of enlightened and contemplative people among the Muslim compatriots, and there are also many scholars among the non-Muslim compatriots who recognize Islamic culture. I hope that everyone can unite and, with the support of the government, establish an institution for studying Islamic culture and assume the historical mission it should bear in this era.

### Japanese Four-Minister Conference Reviews China Policy

Clarifying the Far East Atmosphere, Reopening Sino-Japanese Negotiations

[Tokyo] The Hayashi Cabinet decided to base its diplomatic policy on building a friendly diplomatic relationship centered on relations with Russia. Regarding the China policy, it is also based on this fundamental policy, striving to avoid implementing policies that give the Chinese people a sense of oppression, and attempting to clarify the atmosphere between the two countries through economic and cultural cooperation between the two peoples. To study this strategy and discuss specific cases, the four ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, Navy, and Finance held the first four-ministry coordination meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 26th for about two hours. The new cabinet's China policy, as Prime Minister Hayashi stated clearly, consistently adheres to the three principles of eradicating anti-Japanese sentiment, Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo cooperation, and joint defense against communism. However, observing Sino-Japanese negotiations since the autumn of last year, there have been points that do not fully adapt to these three principles, causing China to misunderstand that Japan has only aggressive intentions. Therefore, the operation will be carefully considered to gradually transform the existing China policy. Therefore, it is planned to restart Sino-Japanese negotiations at an appropriate time in the near future, starting with pending issues that are easy to resolve, such as tariff adjustments. However, with only this kind of passive measures, it may not be possible to fully promote friendly relations between China and Japan. Therefore, it is planned to conduct active negotiations in the economic and cultural fields to promote friendly relations between the two countries. (Allied News Agency dispatch, 27th)

An article by Murobushi Takashin, "Japan and China," published in the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun on February 23rd, said that the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has ended. Although the content of the meeting has not been made public, its conclusion can be fully expressed in the speeches made by Wang Jingwei several times since his return to China. The foundation of the National Government has now been established, and the Kuomintang has an inseparable relationship with China. Under the guidance of the Kuomintang, China has embarked on the road to construction. The general trend of unification has long been clear. Especially, 400 million people have awakened and are moving towards a modern country, but there are still many difficulties hindering them.

Since the Xi'an Incident, Japan's understanding of China has suddenly changed. At the beginning of the incident, the Japanese authorities were still skeptical about China's unification and believed that the National Government was established by Chiang Kai-shek's military force. Therefore, if Chiang Kai-shek were overthrown, the entire territory of China would inevitably be fragmented. This was the Japanese authorities' understanding of China, especially that of most of those who claimed to be China experts. However, Japan's China diplomacy still stood on this understanding, and it is no wonder that China diplomacy suffered repeated defeats. When the Xi'an Incident ended, it was proof that this understanding was greatly mistaken. The Xi'an Incident was in fact undeniable proof of China's unification. Therefore, the Japanese authorities had no choice but to change their understanding of China.

To cite the best example, the observation of Suma Yakichiro, the former Consul General in Nanjing, on China, is the best example. Suma can represent the situation of China diplomacy. The arguments he made after returning to Japan this time also acknowledged the unification of China and the establishment of the foundation of the National Government, and admitted the failure of China diplomacy. Therefore, we warmly welcome the turnaround of the Japanese authorities. "It is not too late to turn around now," and we hope that the turnaround in understanding will also lead to a turnaround in diplomacy. If China is not unified, the East cannot be peaceful. Japan is not a disruptor of China, but should be a helper in unifying China. Japan's assistance to China and alliance with China must follow the kingly way. This is not only the only way to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, but also to show the greatness of Japan.

### Debates in the Japanese House of Representatives on Policy Towards China

Minister of War Also Speaks on Economic Cooperation

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 10:00 AM. After Finance Minister Yūki explained the revised budget proposal, Saito Takao of the Minseito Party and others took the floor to question him. Subsequently, Satake Haruki of the Social Mass Party and Izu Tomihito of the Kokumin Domei Party also questioned the minister. Next, Kotani Setsuo of the Seiyukai Party spoke about recent Sino-Japanese relations, stating roughly: "The Foreign Ministry is attempting to shake hands with the Chinese people and implement cooperation, aiming to clarify Sino-Japanese relations. Are there any concrete plans? This should not be limited to government diplomacy but should involve widespread mobilization to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. Does the government have this intention? The cultural project budget for China is 3.8 million yen, of which 1.7 million is for subsidies. What is the purpose of this?"

Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi replied, "Recently, with the rapid development of communication, Japanese affairs are being reported promptly throughout China. Compared to before, the Chinese people's understanding of Japan has deepened significantly. The Foreign Ministry's new cultural projects currently include establishing an industrial research institute in North China and assisting with cotton cultivation. As for widely seeking talented individuals, we certainly agree with that. The ambassador is appointed freely, so this matter should be given full consideration."

Kotani rose from his seat and said, "Although communication is developing, Chinese newspapers still do not truly understand Japan."

Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi stated, "If future relations between the two countries can be improved politically, then issues such as loans can be resolved naturally at that time."

Next, Okada, the Director of Cultural Affairs for China, listed figures to explain the content of the subsidy for cultural projects in China. Subsequently, Kotani and Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi repeatedly questioned each other regarding the issue of loans to China. Then, Kasai Shigeharu inquired about Minister of War Sugiyama's opinion on the relationship between stabilizing East Asia and cultural projects in China. He also cited examples of British and American policies towards China, questioning the Foreign Ministry authorities about concrete measures to improve cultural projects in China and requesting them to express their views. He stated roughly, "To fulfill the cultural mission, is there a possibility of establishing an English-language newspaper in Shanghai? Does the government have the will to fundamentally adjust Sino-Japanese diplomacy?"

Minister of War Sugiyama replied, "The Army will proceed in accordance with the Three Principles towards China. The government believes that Sino-Japanese friendship, no matter what, must start with economic cooperation. We are currently working hard on this." Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi stated, "If the government's finances permit, we should certainly promote cultural projects in China. We have historically established projects in natural sciences and humanities. In the future, we also intend to make further progress in practical fields. As for the function of diplomatic missions stationed in China, I am not in a position to discuss it, but I firmly believe that all my colleagues stationed there are working diligently day and night for the country."

Kasahara rose from his seat and said, "It is recognized that the diplomatic lineup in Nanjing needs to be refreshed," and so on. At this point, the questioning ended. The Alcohol Law was entrusted to a committee of eighteen members, and the Cultural Projects for China, the Accounting Amendment Law, and two other items were separately handed over to a special committee of twenty-seven members. The meeting was adjourned. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch from the 27th)

### US Government Plans to Find Ways to Stabilize the European Situation

Britain, America, and France Conduct Informal Talks; Economic and Military Preparations Will Be Explored Sequentially

[New York] According to a report from the New York Herald Tribune's Washington correspondent, it is becoming increasingly credible that the US administration will soon hold informal talks to seek cooperation in stabilizing the European economy and finances. When the new French Ambassador to the US, Pontet, presented his credentials the other day, he strongly expressed to President Roosevelt France's willingness to cooperate. It is also heard that US Ambassador to France Bullitt will return to the country in early March at President Roosevelt's invitation. At that time, various issues such as commercial agreements, currency stabilization, arms limitations, and French war debts will be informally discussed one by one. However, the authorities are unwilling to clarify whether these discussions are related to those conducted with the British government. However, it is known that the British government has recently used special envoys without formal missions to unofficially sound out the intentions of the US administration. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th, Central News Agency)

[Washington] The new French Ambassador, Pontet, recently called on President Roosevelt to present his credentials. During the presentation, he delivered a short speech, stating that both France and the United States share the same ideals: "The division of labor and cooperation among all nations is the cornerstone of human civilization. Therefore, it is necessary to restore the free trade system, which France firmly believes in." President Roosevelt replied that the progress of world peace depends on the development of liberalism, which is one of the goals pursued by the United States. (Havas dispatch from the 26th)

### Philippine President Quezon Meets with Roosevelt

Discusses US-Philippine Trade Conference; the Philippines Decides to Seek Complete Independence

[Washington] Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon arrived here from New York today. President Roosevelt immediately hosted a banquet for him at noon. Quezon then issued a statement saying that his visit was to report to President Roosevelt on the situation of the Philippine Commonwealth and to discuss the future of the Philippines with President Roosevelt at an appropriate time, but this was only a preliminary step. After the banquet, Quezon returned to his residence to rest.

When he arrived here, Philippine Commissioner to the US, Pelaez, officials from the Bureau of Insular Affairs, Major General Cox, Colonel McDonald, Commissioner Hayne of the District of Columbia, a troop of Allen Boy Scouts, and all Filipino residents of Washington welcomed him at the station. The Philippine and American flags were hung at the station. General MacArthur, the US military advisor to the Philippines, boarded the train at Baltimore station to welcome him. Quezon arrived at the Presidential Office at 1:00 PM and was invited into the President's office for a meal.

Observers indicate that Congress is unwilling to make many concessions on Philippine trade. Therefore, if Quezon wants to amend the economic clauses in the Philippine Independence Act, he will have to make long-term efforts. The concrete result of Quezon's trip may be to organize a committee to study the basis for a US-Philippine economic conference. Quezon led delegations to the United States three times before the Philippines implemented autonomy, and all returned successfully. As for the content of the conversation at today's luncheon, Quezon stated that he reported to President Roosevelt that the financial and economic situation of the Philippines was very good, the administrative efficiency was also good, and the budget surplus reached a total of 15 million pesos. Quezon denied the claim that he would establish a legitimate dictatorship, saying that he adhered to democracy and trusted the wisdom and responsiveness of the common people and the masses, but also advocated building a strong government based on the constitution. As for the defense of the Philippines, he would strive to strengthen it and would be able to train 400,000 troops within ten years, but he did not want to train a large-scale professional army. The Philippine regular army would not exceed 10,000 people. He is currently training citizens throughout the country. As for whether the United States should maintain a naval base in the Philippines, Quezon declined to comment, saying only that according to the law, this matter could only be discussed after the Philippines was completely independent.

[Washington] President Roosevelt, Philippine President Quezon, and Philippine Chief of Staff General MacArthur discussed the future of the Philippines today. Quezon is now seeking a guarantee from the United States that the United States will not leave the nascent republic unaided in the world. The Philippines needs US assistance especially in commercial matters. Philippine exports to the United States amount to US$100 million annually. The mood in the US Congress is that since the Philippines has become independent, it cannot enjoy the preferential treatment of the United States. It is now necessary to conclude a reciprocal commercial agreement with the United States according to the example of other countries. The American Scripps-Howard newspaper recently published an article by foreign policy expert Simms, stating that if the United States disregards Philippine commerce, President Quezon may agree to terms with Britain, namely that the Philippines would allow Britain to use Manila as a base for its new fleet in an emergency, and Britain would absorb the Philippines' surplus exports in return. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th, Central News Agency)

[Washington] The President of the Philippines declared today that the Philippines is determined to gain independence in accordance with current laws and regulations, and that any trade relations or neutrality agreements would not affect this. Quezon expressed support for the permanent neutralization of the Philippines, but believed that this should be initiated by President Roosevelt and that relevant countries should sign an agreement. Regarding the threat from Japan, Quezon said, "I have never doubted the goodwill of the Japanese, nor have I feared that the Japanese will occupy the Philippines." Regarding the peaceful infiltration of Japanese influence, Quezon believed that implementing the open-door policy was the most sensible, and said that the Philippines could not oppose trade with the Japanese, just as with the Germans, but preferential rights should only be enjoyed by the United States, as this was an obligation that the Filipinos owed to the United States. (National News Agency dispatch from the 36th)

[Washington] Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon's two daughters, Lieutenant Colonel Nidu, and Captain Macascardo arrived here from New York today. All twenty-six people in Quezon's party have now arrived here, while his wife is on her way to the United States. (National News Agency dispatch from the 26th)

### British Air Route Plans to Connect with the Philippines

Extend from Singapore and Hong Kong to Manila

[Manila] According to reliable sources, British Imperial Airways has begun negotiations with the Philippine government to extend its air route from Singapore and Hong Kong to Manila. It is also heard that a certain Japanese airline has also suggested to the Philippine authorities that a new air route be established between Manila and Taiwan to connect with Japan's air network in Manchukuo and Korea. It is said that both the British and Japanese proposals have been submitted to Washington for approval. Philippine President Quezon is currently in Washington. Not long ago, he promised a Dutch airline to extend its air route to the Philippines and will soon begin negotiations in Washington to establish an air route between Java and Manila. Manila is currently the terminal point of the American air route. If the air route between Java and Manila is established, Manila's aviation status in the Far East will become even more important.

### German Ambassador Visits British Foreign Secretary

Exchanged Views on Colonial Issues and Returned Home

[London] German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop visited Foreign Secretary Eden this afternoon to discuss issues between Britain and Germany. The German Ambassador's previous visit to Acting Foreign Secretary Halifax aroused interest here. It is believed that Ribbentrop will take the opportunity to notify the British Foreign Office of Germany's colonial demands. It is said that Ribbentrop will leave the UK and return to Germany tomorrow for a few days of rest, hence today's visit to Eden. (National News Agency dispatch from the 26th)

[London] German Ambassador Ribbentrop recently met with Foreign Secretary Eden today. It is generally believed that Ribbentrop did not make specific demands regarding colonies to Eden, but only explained the importance of the colonial issue to Germany, and that it was regrettable that the British authorities remained indifferent. Foreign Secretary Eden immediately replied that Britain's attitude had been decided and could not be significantly changed. He had explained this attitude in the House of Commons on July 27th of last year, namely that the British government was unwilling to consider the issue of transferring the jurisdiction of League of Nations mandates, but that the issue of re-distributing world raw materials could be discussed. In addition, the issue of Germany's demand for the return of its former colonies was of concern to all mandatory countries, but it was not something that Britain could decide alone. Moreover, there were many European issues that urgently needed to be resolved, so it was appropriate to postpone the handling of colonial issues. Finally, he said that his declaration on July 27th of last year was sufficient to represent the opinions of all cabinet members. According to German newspapers, the British government's internal opinions on the colonial issue had been inconsistent recently. Eden's words were to deny this claim. Political figures also believe that the British newspaper once said that Ribbentrop had raised the colonial issue with Acting Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and avoided meeting with Eden because Lord Halifax's attitude was more favorable to Germany. Ribbentrop's visit to Eden today was to refute the above fallacy. (Havas dispatch from the 26th)

### India Plans to Increase Sugar and Silver Tariffs

Result of Shortfall in Tax Revenue

⊙New Delhi Sir James Grigg, the Finance Member of the Government of India, presented the budget in parliament today and announced an increase in the import tax on sugar and silver. It is said that the silver tax will be increased from two annas to three annas, and the domestic tax on sugar will be increased from one and a half rupees to two rupees per hundredweight (British measure, equal to 112 pounds). The sugar tariff will be set at seven rupees four per hundredweight, plus the current domestic tax. He also said that although the budget was disappointing, he hoped to eliminate all difficulties without much trouble or inconvenience. He now knew that the surplus for the year ending in March 1936, designated for the tax revenue reserve fund, was only 18.4 million rupees, a decrease of 1.3 million rupees from the expected amount. The amount of sugar imports has recently decreased significantly, due to the sanctions imposed on imports from Italy. This trend continued in the second half of the year, resulting in a revised forecast of 19.7 million rupees short for 1936-37, while the initial expectation was a surplus of 600,000 rupees. Tariff revenue was 21.6 million rupees short, with sugar accounting for 14.5 million rupees alone. The continuous decrease in sugar tax revenue forced the government to reject the procedure of implementing tax cuts. Sir James also mentioned that the tariff on British piece goods imports was reduced by 7.5 million rupees, saying that although British products had been taxed less, it still did not enable Britain to regain any of the market share it had recently occupied. The price of British goods still made Indian buyers recoil. Sir James concluded that the total amount of expenditure for the coming year was estimated at 83.41 million rupees, with defense accounting for 44.62 million rupees, including the cost of rebuilding the town of Quetta (which was destroyed by an earthquake last year) at 7.5 million rupees. Although the Ministry of National Defense had an unavoidable increase in expenditure of 6 million rupees, it had reduced 4 million rupees in other savable items to cope with temporary financial difficulties. The net shortfall in the draft budget of various departments was 15.8 million rupees. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th, Central News Agency)

### Current Status of Arctic Exploration

Report from the Soviet Union

[Moscow] Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Rudzutak published an article in the Izvestia newspaper, pointing out that the Party and government authorities and Stalin had long paid attention to the extreme importance of the Arctic sea route for the economic development of the far north and for maritime transportation between Leningrad, Arkhangelsk, and Vladivostok. Rudzutak said that the sparsely populated Arctic islands and the Siberian coast had undergone great changes. The area, which was previously only occasionally visited by hunters, is now dotted with weather stations and radio stations, and various important scientific works and exploration of the far north's rich natural treasures are underway. In 1936, the Arctic climate was extremely unfavorable for navigation, but the transportation plan on this route exceeded expectations. A total of 140 ships navigated the entire season, of which 14 completed the entire journey. In addition, two river tugboats navigated the Arctic Ocean and arrived at the Indigirka River and the Yana River in Yakutsk, creating an unprecedented event in history, as the residents there had never seen ships before. The total cargo transported during the entire navigation season last year was 271,000 tons. Arctic aviation also achieved good results, with a total of 13,000 hours of flight. The success of the Arctic sea route has revolutionized the economic and cultural life of the far north. Soviet culture has been brought by Soviet ships, and many schools, hospitals, libraries, and reading rooms have been established. New seaports and docks have begun to be built in the far north. This year, the development of the area will be even faster, and various industries will begin to be established. (TASS dispatch from the 26th)

### French Chamber of Deputies Debates General Policy

Opposition Party Fiercely Questions, Current Cabinet Ultimately Wins Confidence

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies convened today at 3:00 PM to debate the general policies of the Léon Blum cabinet. The leader of the Central faction, former Prime Minister Flandin, delivered a lengthy speech, posing questions to the government. Subsequently, former Finance Minister Reynaud, a member of the Central faction, spoke and also questioned the government. Finally, Prime Minister Léon Blum responded to the questions of the two men. The intensity of the debate was unprecedented since the establishment of the Popular Front government. (Havas, 26th)

[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies concluded its debate on the government's general policies late last night, after commencing in the afternoon. It passed a vote of confidence proposed by the government parties with 361 votes to 209, and rejected a motion proposed by the opposition with 361 votes to 211. (Havas, 27th)

When the Chamber convened, former Prime Minister Flandin delivered a speech, launching a fierce attack on Prime Minister Léon Blum, stating, "I firmly believe that Your Excellency's governance will inevitably lead the nation into ruin. If Your Excellency adheres to the current policies without modification, the French republican system will inevitably collapse one day." Flandin continued, "France's financial situation is now in a critical state, due to a general lack of confidence among investors, and the devaluation of the franc has also failed. French prices are now higher than world prices, making it difficult for French goods to be exported. This is clear evidence of the failure of the franc devaluation policy. Moreover, the gold reserves of the Bank of France totaled 64,358,000,000 francs last October, but have now decreased to 57,358,000,000 francs. If this continues, financial and monetary panics will inevitably occur simultaneously in the near future. At that time, Your Excellency will have no choice but to adopt policies of inflation and exchange controls. For now, Your Excellency has only one path to follow: Your Excellency should reverse your past actions and no longer allow capital and labor to continue to clash. Only in this way can social progress be consolidated." Flandin then cited the past of Germany, saying, "National Socialism was the direct result of the disastrous fall in the value of the German currency in 1923. If social progress is to be lasting, it must be done in cooperation with the middle class. This is evident from historical records. Therefore, I firmly believe that Your Excellency has no other way to solve the current difficulties except through national unity."

Former Finance Minister Reynaud then spoke, saying, "The government is currently pursuing two mutually contradictory economic policies. Externally, the government's economic policy is based on the Tripartite Monetary Agreement between Britain, the United States, and France. Internally, the government's economic policy is based on increasing wages in the hope of increasing people's purchasing power. It should be known that after increasing wages, inflation and exchange controls will inevitably follow, and the result will be the abolition of the Tripartite Monetary Agreement between Britain, the United States, and France. The self-contradictory nature of the government's policies can be seen from this." Reynaud's speech concluded with the same point as Flandin: that there is no other way out except through national unity.

At this point, Prime Minister Léon Blum took the stage to respond to the questions of Flandin and Reynaud. The Prime Minister first described the increasing improvement of France's economic situation, listing several favorable factors, such as: ㊀ The number of unemployed people in France has decreased by 70,000 compared to last year. ㊁ Partial unemployment (referring to workers being forced to reduce working hours) has completely disappeared. ㊂ Railway freight has increased compared to before. As for the increase in prices, the Prime Minister said that part of the reason was that producers overestimated their production costs. In the future, the government will prohibit this kind of situation. "In short, the phenomena currently being experienced in France are the same as those already experienced in other countries in the past. As a result of the implementation of military armament programs and large-scale public works, first, inventories are insufficient and need to be replenished; second, private investment inevitably competes with national investment. This is a phenomenon that has already occurred in various countries in the past, not just France. In conclusion, if capital that has fled abroad and is hoarded domestically can be reinvested in the economy and circulate in the market, the phenomenon of recession will completely disappear." Regarding Reynaud's claim that the government's economic policies are self-contradictory, Léon Blum replied, "The government must implement large-scale social reform programs and bear huge national defense expenditures at the same time, so it is forced to have this kind of contradictory phenomenon." The Prime Minister concluded, "The Popular Front government must not be transformed into a coalition cabinet of various factions, because this kind of cabinet is contrary to the wishes of the majority of the people. I firmly believe that all parties belonging to the democratic faction must continue to participate in the current government. We should continue on the current path without any change. In other words, we should continue to maintain the Popular Front government, because this is the only true government of national unity. Our power comes from the trust of the masses of the people. In terms of international policy, we act in the position of the 'French government,' so we must be able to obtain the support of the entire French people. This is the only 'national unity' that we seek." (Havas, 26th)

### US Senate Passes Old Judge Retirement Bill

[Washington] Today, the Senate passed a bill by a vote of 74 to 4, allowing Supreme Court justices who are 70 years old or older to retire automatically with full pay. The bill has already been passed by the House of Representatives and has now been sent to President Roosevelt for his signature. It is said that although President Roosevelt has not expressed opposition to the bill, it will not affect the President's insistence that Congress must pass his judicial reform plan and that the President can appoint new judges when Supreme Court justices reach the age of 70 and are unwilling to retire. (National Telegram, 26th)

[Rome] The Italian government has recently issued an order prohibiting aircraft from flying within eight miles of Pantelleria Island. Pantelleria is a volcanic island in the Mediterranean Sea, with a strategic location controlling traffic between Sicily and Africa. The prohibition of aircraft flying over the island proves that the rumors that the Italian government built a strong naval base there during the Italo-Ethiopian War when the League of Nations advocated sanctions are true. It is also said that the island controls the straits of the eastern Mediterranean, and its situation is even more important than Malta. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 27th)

### New Discovery of Pseudo-National Salvation Army on Chahar-Suiyuan Border

Pseudo-Mongolian Governor's Office Expected to Appear, Certain Party's Aircraft Stage Large-Scale Air Raid

Zhangbei Correspondence: Recently, a so-called Northwest National Salvation Army pseudo-organization was suddenly discovered in the Taolin County area bordering eastern Suiyuan and western Chahar. Its second route pseudo-guerrilla commander is Wang Zhendong, and the deputy commander is Liu Liquan. The number of people is less than 1,000, and they appear and disappear unpredictably, showing quite active. How their background is, has not yet been ascertained. This kind of neither-donkey-nor-horse army will also be a future disaster for the border.

The organization of the pseudo-Mongolian Military and Political Governor's Office has been brewing for many days. It can be established after Prince De returns to Jiabusi Temple from West Sunite Banner. On the 23rd, Prince De had already arrived at the temple. Zhuo Shihai, stationed in Zhangbei, and Li Shouxin, who went to Shangdu from Zhangbei a few days ago, will both go to Jiabusi Temple in separate ways in the coming days to discuss with Prince De and others the establishment of the pseudo-Governor's Office. Approximately in the near future, this pseudo-organization can be realized. The traitor Li Shouxin was originally responsible for commanding the pseudo-army in northern Chahar. After meeting Prince De, he still has to ask a certain party's advisors for instructions on the issue of the distribution of the pseudo-army's defense areas.

At about 1:00 PM on the 21st of this month, about 40 aircraft flew from Dolon to Zhangbei, circling in the sky, performing various air combat techniques, and dropping bombs and machine gun fire. The sound of aircraft, gunfire, and explosions resonated for a time, shaking the roofs. A certain party's military headquarters also sent many military officers to direct everything. It ended at 3:00 PM and then flew east. Currently, there are a total of seven aircraft parked at Zhangbei Airport. Most of them are stationed in Dolon. Zhangbei was originally a thoroughfare for traffic outside the pass. Recently, a certain party has been conscripting more than 1,000 civilians in Zhangbei every day to actively build highways. It is not known what their intention is.

From the 7th of this month to the present, the pseudo-army that has returned to Rehe Province from Zhangbei includes about 10,000 people from the Rehe armies of Zhang Junzhe, Yu Zhishan, Wang Jingxiu, Li Zhenyu, Hu Yushan, and others. On the 10th, two artillery regiments, about 1,300 people, passed through the west gate of Zhangbei and returned to Rehe Province from Daqinggou. They are part of Zhang Haipeng and Wang Jingxiu. The Second Mixed Brigade and the pseudo-Xingan Garrison Army, originally stationed in Dongguan, Zhangbei, totaling about 2,000 people, also returned to Rehe Province on the 2nd of this month. In addition, the Second and Fourth Mongolian Armies were dispatched to Rehe and Dolon on the 21st, one after the other. There have also been reports recently that other Mongolian armies are heading east to Rehe.

### Banks Compete to Pay Salt Tax, Merchants Urge Prohibition of Manipulation

Total Amount of Prepaid Tax Reaches Six to Seven Million Piculs, United Opposition from Industries in Anhui and Henan

Haizhou Correspondence: The Two Huai Salt Affairs Inspection Office and the Transport Envoy Office have, in recent years, planned and coordinated the adjustment, production, and sales of Huai salt, giving consideration to both supply and demand. In particular, they have made unremitting efforts to pilot the Changping Granary case, soliciting merchants to increase transportation and store salt. The various coasts have complied with the regulations, and tax revenues have increased sharply. The inspection authorities, therefore, starting from February of this year, continued to handle the 21 counties in northern Anhui in the Anhui-Henan area. They still solicited merchants to increase transportation and stipulated that starting from the first of this month, they would recognize and prepay taxes once (that is, pay taxes first and then transport salt) for 600,000 piculs, and then increase transportation by 100,000 piculs every day to provide a reserve and avoid salt shortages. According to past practice, salt merchants entrusted banks to pay prepaid taxes and paid monthly interest. This time, because the Bank of China had more merchants entrusting it, it prepaid taxes for 1.16 million piculs at once, actually exceeding the original quota of 600,000 piculs. Other banks, upon learning of this, also recognized and prepaid taxes one after another, such as the Bank of Communications, which recognized and prepaid 1.8 million piculs, the Jiangsu Bank, which recognized and prepaid 430,000 piculs, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, which recognized and prepaid 480,000 piculs, the National Bank, which recognized and prepaid 70,000 piculs, and the Jincheng Bank, which recognized and prepaid 10,000 piculs. Seeing the competition among the banks to recognize and prepay taxes, the Bank of China then added 800,000 piculs. After the Bank of China recognized and prepaid taxes, the Shanghai Bank also added 600,000 piculs, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank added 200,000 piculs. Finally, the Bank of China added another 500,000 piculs. It can be seen that the competition for recognizing and prepaying salt transportation taxes is fierce, which is unprecedented. The above-mentioned are all the actions of the branches of Banpu following the instructions of the salt affairs departments of the various head offices. As of the 24th, the total number of prepaid taxes recognized by the China Shanghai, Communications, Jiangsu, Xingye, National, and Jincheng banks was no less than 6-7 million piculs (including odd numbers). The head offices in Shanghai have telegraphed the branches in northern Anhui to stop recognizing and prepaying taxes. The Two Huai Inspection Office originally planned to solicit transportation of 600,000 piculs, but now the amount of recognized and prepaid taxes has exceeded eleven times the original amount. Because the competition among the banks is so fierce, it has become an unprecedented situation, which is beyond the initial expectations of the salt affairs authorities. Last year, the Anhui northern free trading area coast increased the transportation and storage of salt was based on the old tax payment, with wheeled inserts and sales. In terms of the current concentration of goods on that coast, the salt in storage and transported to the coast amounts to 300,000 piculs. There are still 700,000 piculs that have been taxed but not yet transported. This 700,000 piculs of salt is enough for more than half a year of wholesale sales. In addition to the 6-7 million piculs of newly recognized and prepaid taxes by the various banks, it is enough for five years of sales. In terms of the current tax per picul (4 yuan per picul for the yard tax), the prepaid tax is divided into current tax and term tax. The current tax is 2 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen per picul, and the term tax is 1 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen per picul. In addition, there is a local public welfare donation of 2 fen per picul, and the central surtax is still outside, reaching more than 14.4 million yuan. If calculated on the basis of the current tax, term tax, and public welfare donation, the total is more than 26.93 million yuan. It is heard that the Huai salt merchants, because the various banks are vigorously competing to pay the salt transportation prepaid tax, are actually entrusted by salt firms. While banks with more prominent creditworthiness may be involved, those without a license, are suspected of manipulating the salt industry with financial power. The Salt Industry Association has been holding meetings for days to discuss countermeasures. It is believed that if this precedent is set, the future of the salt industry is unimaginable. A resolution was passed by more than 20 salt firms, including Daxing and Dayi, to jointly telegraph the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Finance, urging them to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and prohibit manipulation in order to maintain the salt industry, and to unite with the same industries in Anhui and Henan to take a consistent attitude to show opposition.

Xi'an Correspondence

### Retrospection After the Resolution of the Shaanxi Incident

The Peaceful Resolution Process

The Xi'an Incident of the Double Twelfth last year occurred suddenly. Except for Zhang and Yang, most of the senior generals of the Northeast Army and the 17th Route Army were unaware of it. At that time, Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, and others were still gathered at Mi Chunlin's residence for a meeting. After Zhang went to Mi's residence to inform them of the incident, they were all shocked and considered it too risky. However, it was already impossible to reverse it. At that time, the Communists had not yet participated. On the 17th, the Communist representative Zhou Enlai arrived in Xi'an, and the Communists also advanced to the Sanyuan area. Gradually, on the 25th, Zhang Xueliang respectfully sent Commander Chiang back to Nanjing, which had already started a peaceful beginning. However, twists and turns occurred later, and peace was almost broken several times. One reason was that Zhang Xueliang was stimulated by the disarmament during his trial in Nanjing. At that time, his testimony was inevitably intense, giving the key figures of the central government a bad impression. At the same time, the generals of Zhang and Yang in Xi'an were also greatly stimulated by this and demanded that Zhang's return to Xi'an be a prerequisite for peace. As a result, the situation in Shaanxi became more and more rigid, and the hope for peace became increasingly slim. Because the central army was actively increasing its deployment to surround Shaanxi, the troops of Zhang and Yang urgently returned to Xi'an to concentrate, and the Communists also advanced from northern Shaanxi to the area of Yiyuan and Fuping. The situation was like an arrow on a string, and a war was about to break out. However, some generals of the central army, fearing that the troops of Zhang and Yang did not have sincere intentions of repentance, also advocated a war, resulting in the "general offensive on January 23." The generals on both sides believed that peace was hopeless. On the 22nd, Liu Zhendong, a staff officer of the Guanzhong Camp, contacted Liu Duoquan, the commander of the 105th Division in Xi'an, by telephone to solicit his opinion. Soon, Gu Zhutong and Chen Cheng also directly negotiated with Liu Duoquan on the phone, explaining their misunderstandings to each other, and peace had a turning point. The Xi'an side then asked Deng Baoshan to bring the peace conditions to Shanghai to see Chiang Kai-shek. Commander Chiang replied at that time that except for Zhang Xueliang's temporary refusal to return to Shaanxi, the rest would be generously tolerated. After Deng returned to Shaanxi, the generals all embraced the idea of peace and no longer insisted on Zhang's return to Shaanxi. However, due to the issue of defense areas, the Northeast Army pushed He Zhuguo again on the 14th of this month to fly south to pay respects to Chiang and Zhang. He returned to Shaanxi on the 19th. The result of the negotiation was quite satisfactory. After the senior officers of the Northeast Army fly south to pay respects to Chiang and Zhang for instructions in the coming days, they can begin to withdraw their defenses to the Pingliang area.

As for Yang Hucheng, after Gu Zhutong entered Xi'an, he once expressed a passive attitude. After Gu persuaded him, he dismissed the intention to resign. Yang's troops originally consisted of two divisions (Feng Qinzhai's and Sun Weiru's troops, with the name of an army but the organization of a division) and three garrison brigades, totaling 20 regiments. After the incident, Feng Qinzhai's troops surrendered to the central government, and half of his garrison brigades also surrendered to the central government or were transferred. Gu Zhutong promised to replenish Yang's troops and decided to restore them to their original state before the incident. It is currently under negotiation. In addition to the troops of Zhang and Yang, the main body of the Xi'an issue is the Communist bandits. After years of attacks by the national army, the Communist bandits retreated to a few counties in northern Shaanxi, such as Fushi, Yanchuan, and Yanchang. The land is barren and their strength is dwindling. During this incident, the troops of Zhang and Yang organized a coalition army and provided a large amount of assistance to the Communist bandits. Fortunately, they did not take the opportunity to disturb the area, which was also a blessing for the local area.

Cause and Effect of the 2-2 Incident

The 2-2 Incident was actually a factor in promoting the resolution of the Shaanxi Incident. Having had the opportunity to talk with the parties involved, I learned the general outline and briefly recorded it as follows:

The main leaders of the radical elements in the Northeast Army were Sun Mingjiu, Wan Jianqiu, and Ying Detian, with Sun as the leader. During the Double Twelfth Incident, it was Bai Fengxiang and Sun Mingjiu who led the troops to kidnap Commander Chiang Kai-shek in Lintong. After Zhang sent Chiang back to Nanjing, Bai fled in fear of punishment. Sun, with his position as the protagonist of the incident, did not give up his ambition and carried out extensive activities, using the excuse of asking Zhang to return to Xi'an to vigorously publicize to the officers and soldiers of Zhang and Yang's troops. After the peace issue, which was on the verge of breaking down on January 23, had a turning point and continued, they were greatly disappointed. Sun, with his position as the culprit, considered his own interests and was determined not to allow the realization of peace. Therefore, he did not hesitate to make a desperate gamble and used violence to force the senior generals to order an attack on the central army. Wang Yizhe happened to be recuperating at his private residence, and they forced him to sign the attack order. Wang refused, and was shot down by random bullets, dying with nine bullets in his body. At that time, Wang's wife and two doctors were still in Wang's room, diagnosing his illness, and they were spared from the bullets by escaping. At that time, He Zhuguo knew that Sun and others were going to take unstable actions, so he made an appointment with Yu Xuezhong to go to Yang Hucheng's office at the Sui Jing Office for temporary refuge. After Sun and others shot Wang Yizhe, they rushed to the Sui Jing Office to look for Yu and He, wanting to force Yu to order the front-line generals to attack the central army by telephone. Under duress, Yu spoke with Liu Duoquan of Xianyang by telephone, but only said "Ah, ah," trying to express his dangerous state of losing his freedom. Liu understood his meaning and united with the Northeast generals in the front, jointly telegraphed Yang Hucheng, asking him to protect the safety of Yu and He. Sun and others wanted to take He Zhuguo away, but fortunately, Yang Hucheng strongly suppressed them and avoided it. It is heard that Sun Mingjiu and others' plan for the riot originally planned to execute 33 senior military officers from Northeast Army and 17th Route Army (16 main officers and 17 secondary officers). Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, Miao Zhengliu, Sun Weiru and others were all on the list of those to be killed. Later, when Zhang left Shaanxi, he left a hand-written note stating that the Northeast Army was to be handed over to Yang and Yu for command. Fearing that no one would command the entire army after Yu was killed, and because the front-line generals and Yang protected him, their poisonous plan did not succeed. Before the riot of Sun and others, a senior general of a certain army, because the rumors were rampant, advised Wang Yizhe to avoid it a little. Wang was confident that there would be no other incidents and did not adopt it. Wang also thought that Sun and others were his students at the Northeast Military Academy, and that orders in the Northeast Army had always been unified. He did not expect that Sun and others' riot would go beyond the norm, and Wang became their sacrifice. Sun also forbade Wang's family from mourning Wang, and sent soldiers from the special service regiment armed with live ammunition to guard the door, preventing relatives and friends from offering condolences. Only a white paper was posted at the door with the words "Condolences are respectfully declined." At the same time, Jiang Bin, Xu Fang, Song Xueli and others were successively shot and killed. Later, Yang and Yu, in order to stabilize people's hearts and maintain peace, ordered a strict crackdown on the rioters. After four or five days, the chaos was finally settled. Except for the three culprits, Sun, Miao and Ying, who fled, the rest, such as Gao Fuyuan, the brigade commander of the 105th Division, was shot to death on the spot. Kang Hongtai, the regimental commander of the division, Gu Kui, and Wan Yi, the regimental commander of the 109th Division, were also detained. After the disturbance was quelled, Yu Xuezhong issued a notice to all units of the Northeast Army, acting as the Director of the Pacification of Sui, and exercised the power to command the Northeast Army that Zhang had given him. He will follow He Zhuguo and fly south to meet Chiang and Zhang to ask about the location of the Northeast Army's withdrawal and the follow-up arrangements. After this incident, the generals of the Northeast Army became more determined in their belief in peace.

Miao Rongquan, Meng Apei, Chen Amao, Qi Gengui, Chen Xinggen, and several other workers from the Taihe Flour Company outside Fengmen, after drinking alcohol inside Fengmen around 8:00 PM on the 26th, went to the Dongwu Theater outside Fengmen to watch Southern Opera. Because the theater was already full, but the workers insisted on entering, a conflict arose with the theater's ushers. Miao Rongquan, one of the workers, sustained severe injuries. Police officers who witnessed the scene took both parties to the police station. After arriving at the police station, Miao Rongquan bled from his mouth and nose and died due to the severity of his injuries.

Police Chief Injured While Raiding Gambling Den

Every year around the New Year, gambling becomes rampant in various villages. Yan, the supervising officer of the Zhitang Police Substation, learned that a gambling den was operating at the home of Yang Qibao in the nearby Fengtang Village. He dispatched Police Chief Jin Dingxun, leading eight officers, to investigate and shut it down. Unexpectedly, the gambling den had over a hundred gamblers, with sentries posted around the perimeter to relay information. As the police officers arrived, the sentries had already detected and reported their presence. The crowd immediately stopped gambling and, armed with wooden sticks and iron bars, ambushed the police from all sides. The police officers, caught off guard, were all injured, with Police Chief Jin sustaining the most severe injuries. After a while, the crowd dispersed. The other officers hired local villagers to carry Jin back to the police station. That night, Supervising Officer Yan came to the city to report the incident and sent the injured officers to the county for examination of their injuries.

### Wuxi

Great New World Smashed Up

Since its opening, the Great New World on Tongqin Road has been packed with spectators. At 8:00 PM on the 26th, several dockworkers from Hubei attempted to watch a play without tickets, leading to a conflict. Hu Jinshan, who had been acting violently, was detained at the Guangqin Road Police Station. Shortly after, fifty or sixty workers from Hubei, armed with bamboo poles, iron shovels, shoulder poles, and stones, stormed into the Great New World. They attacked people and destroyed property. Ticket collectors Yang Qingshan, Tao Tujin, Wang Aren, Wu Peixiang, Zhang Aoyao, Pan Shengan, and Ma Shengsan, as well as audience member Zeng Ada, were all injured and sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment.

Xu Han, the director of the factory's preparatory office, stated that the investigation lists of confirmed opium addicts from various counties in the district had already been submitted to the Special Commissioner's Office, which then ordered Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, Taicang, Wujiang, Changshu, and five other counties to send the confirmed opium addicts to the factory for work within three months. The factory's initial plan is to accommodate four hundred people. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Long of this county instructed Xing Yuantang, the warden of the Fifth Prison, to comply.

### Zhenjiang

Sightseeing Tour Bus Service Launched

The Provincial Highway Administration, recognizing that the provincial capital is located upstream on the Yangtze River, with mountains and rivers offering picturesque scenery, including the famous Golden Mountain, Jiaoshan, North Gu Mountain, and the bamboo forests south of Huangshan, attracts many visitors from afar. However, due to time and financial constraints, visitors often cannot fully enjoy the sights. To facilitate sightseeing for tourists, the Provincial Highway Administration plans to launch a sightseeing tour bus service. The plan has been approved by the Construction Department and is scheduled to begin on March 1st, operating every Sunday and on public holidays. The tour bus routes are divided into two lines, both starting from the Zhenjiang Station on Zhongzheng Road. The first route goes from Zhenjiang Station via Helin Temple, Zhaoyin Temple, Zhenjiang Middle School, Huangshan Park, the Equestrian Association, and the West Gate Railway Station to Golden Mountain. The second route goes from Zhenjiang Station via Dashikou, North Gu Mountain, Riverside Park, Pagoda Road, and the Zhenyang Wharf, where passengers can take a ferry to Jiaoshan, then via Boxian Park and the West Gate Railway Station to Golden Mountain. Both tour bus routes will return via the original routes after reaching Golden Mountain. Regardless of the distance traveled, the fare is fifteen cents per person per trip, for military personnel, police, and children alike.

### Huaiyin

Reconstruction of City-Traversing Road

The Jiangsu Construction Department is reconstructing the road that traverses the county seat of this county. The route passes through Ren Street in the North Gate. Shopkeepers on that street have been ordered to voluntarily demolish and vacate their premises starting in late February. From the North Gate to the South Gate, all the houses along the street have been uniformly taken in hand. The Guanyin Pavilion in the central market, which spans the city from east to west, especially obstructs the widening of the route. The resident monk has moved the large and small clay sculptures of deities to the West Guandi Temple, leaving only empty buildings to be demolished. Therefore, the North Gate Street has completely suspended its market activities. Once the demolition and vacationing are completed, the road construction project can begin.

### Jiaxing

Labor Service Has Begun

Jiaxing County's labor service projects for this year, designed by the county government, include dredging rivers and canals, building roads, opening up drill grounds, constructing public cemeteries, and building new village housing. In the urban area, the canal bank from Xili Bridge to the Three Pagodas and the vertical road from Puyuan in the Xincheng area through Xincheng to Shuangqiao have been completed one after another. The other projects have been delayed due to rain. The county government has now dispatched personnel to each district to set stakes and mark out the land, and has set a deadline of March 2nd for each district to conscript laborers to start work, ensuring that the projects in each district are completed quickly during the agricultural off-season, without perfunctory handling that would delay important government affairs.

### Hangzhou

Bridge Construction Dispute Resolved

The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's Hangzhou-Cao'e section includes the construction of more than seventy bridges along the line. The various organizations in Shaoxing requested a change in the plan, arguing that it would affect farmland irrigation. The Railway Department sent Section Chief Sa Fujun to investigate and explain to leaders from all sectors. He has since returned to Nanjing to report. It is now known that the engineering department has received an order to widen the river channel at the bridge construction sites and add underground pipes to facilitate water flow. The bidding for the facilities for the ticket offices, platforms, and warehouses along the section has been completed, and contracts are being signed with the contractors. Construction is scheduled to begin in early March.

### Yuyao

Recent News on the Widening of Di'an Road

The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration had previously determined that the Yuyao Di'an Highway was too narrow, which would cause inconvenience for salt transport in the future. They dispatched Fan Binglin to Yuyao to discuss widening the road and reconstructing bridges with the county government and the Guancao Company. All expenses were to be loaned by the Railway Administration and repaid by the county in annual installments from salt transport revenues. However, due to differing opinions among the parties involved, no agreement was reached at the time. Now that the Guancao Company has abandoned its previous proposal due to a lack of profit, the county government has responded to the Railway Administration, stating that the Railway Administration would be responsible for designing and implementing the road widening and salt transport facilities, provided that it does not increase the county's burden and guarantees a reasonable profit for the original assets. When the road widening is implemented in the future, the two sides will need to discuss the details further.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

After reading the news report about the cracking of the pawnshop theft case in the Songjiang correspondence column of your newspaper on February 21st, there are some discrepancies in the details. For example, it stated that "Captain Yang personally went to the shop around 1:00 AM and, together with Town Chief Xu, called for the door to be opened for a search. The shop handed over Li Genquan and the original banknotes to the police station for interrogation." After investigation, it was discovered that when Captain Yang and Town Chief Xu came to knock on our shop's door around midnight to summon our employee Li Genquan, I asked Genquan what had happened. He said that his father-in-law, Jin Shiliang, had found fire-damaged banknotes and deposited them with us, asking us to exchange them on his behalf. There were no other incidents. Because we had nothing to hide, he voluntarily went with them. The original banknotes were also handed over by Genquan, and our shop had absolutely no connection to them. Therefore, we specifically request that your newspaper promptly correct the report.

Sincerely,

Xie Changzhen of Huayang Bridge, Songjiang

To the Editor:

After investigation, the Baimao Sluice project has been completed and handed over to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for management for half a year. Except for some slight erosion of the soil slopes of the newly excavated diversion channel, the entire sluice project has not undergone any changes. The statement in your newspaper on the 13th that there is a risk of a breach and that farmers have suffered significant losses is completely untrue. Please correct it. Furthermore, since the construction of the sluice, the water in the upstream river has become clear, the water flow is stable, and the effects of storing clear water and rejecting turbid water, as well as resisting high tides, have been seen. Please disclose these actual facts in your newspaper to clarify the truth.

Sincerely,

### Kowloon Residents' Representative Lu Zhang Hosts Gathering Yesterday Afternoon

Reports Hong Kong Government's Forced Demolition of Residences, Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Next Week to Request Negotiation

According to the Central News Agency, the Guangdong Sojourners Association in Shanghai received a statement from Lu Zhang, a representative of Kowloon residents, that the Hong Kong government is forcibly demolishing residences in Kowloon and expelling Kowloon residents. He requested assistance from all sectors of Shanghai. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a gathering was held at the 9th floor of the YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao, with dozens of representatives attending. Li Dachao, a representative of the Guangdong Sojourners Association in Shanghai, chaired the meeting and reported the reasons for hosting the gathering. Following him, Representative Lu reported the process of the Hong Kong government's forced demolition of Kowloon residences as follows:

Report on the Process

Representative Lu reported the process of the Hong Kong government's forced demolition of Kowloon residences, stating that in the 24th year of the Guangxu reign, the British Empire privately entered into an agreement with the Qing government to lease Hong Kong and Kowloon for a term of ninety-nine years. The sovereignty of Kowloon City, however, still belonged to our country. For decades, the residents of the city lived and worked in peace and contentment, and no accidents had ever occurred. Unexpectedly, on October 25, 1931, the Hong Kong government suddenly ordered the residents of the city to move out. After negotiations by Mr. Zhu Zhaoxin of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Department, the matter was settled. On February 5, 1933, the Hong Kong government again gave the residents of the city six months to move out. After Gan Jiehou, a special envoy of foreign affairs from five provinces, negotiated with British Minister Lampson, he received a written reply from Minister Lampson stating that the Hong Kong government had not forced the residents of the city to demolish their houses and move. The matter returned to peace. Unexpectedly, last year (October 3, 1936), the Hong Kong government suddenly sent police to pursue the residents of the city, ordering them to move out by December 31 of that year, otherwise they would be burned down. On December 29 of that year, the Kowloon South District Civil Affairs Bureau and the Hong Kong government again sent two police officers and five workers to forcibly demolish the residence at No. 25 in the city. The residents of the house immediately reported the incident to the foreign affairs envoy Diao Zuqian by long-distance telephone and asked him to find a way to stop it. Envoy Diao immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing to report the incident. He then received a reply telegram from Minister Zhang stating that in addition to lodging a protest with the British ambassador, he should immediately negotiate with the Hong Kong government. On January 4 of this year, Envoy Diao personally went to Kowloon City to investigate the demolished residences and search for evidence. Since the Hong Kong government's forced demolition of Kowloon residences occurred, all sectors of Hong Kong, believing that the Hong Kong government was violating the treaty and affecting Sino-British relations, have risen up to provide assistance. This time, the residents of Kowloon City have specially sent Lu Zhang to Nanjing to petition the government authorities, maintain our country's sovereignty, and earnestly hope that all sectors of Shanghai will rise up to provide assistance.

Request for Negotiation

Mr. Lu plans to stay in Shanghai for a few more days to meet with leaders from all sectors, report the details of the case, and request their strong support. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing next week to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities and urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate as soon as possible to reassure the residents of Kowloon. The Guangdong Sojourners Association in Shanghai has also decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct negotiations.

### Sun Ke's Remarks

Central Government Decides to Eradicate Red Menace, Liu Luyin Case to be Handled According to Law

According to the Central News Agency, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, left Nanjing by overnight train at 11:00 PM the night before and arrived at Zhenru at 6:50 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. He went out around 9:00 AM and visited Mr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, around 10:00 AM. He left about an hour later. According to Mr. Sun, the outcome of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was extremely satisfactory. Regarding the issue of eradicating the Red Menace, the resolution of the plenary session has already been announced, and four minimum measures have been decided. If the Communist bandits have the determination to abide by the four measures and demonstrate this fact to the entire nation, they can be pacified without being suppressed. The current Japanese cabinet still adheres to its consistent traditional policy, and its mildness towards China is only temporary. He plans to go south to inspect various construction projects in Qiongya and Guangdong Province, but this has not yet been fully decided. The Liu Luyin case will be handled according to law.

### Huang Xuchu to Remain in Shanghai Temporarily

Did Not Return to Guangxi the Day Before Due to Matters Not Resolved

According to the Central News Agency, Huang Xuchu, Chairman of Guangxi Province, came to Shanghai after the conclusion of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. He was originally scheduled to take the French postal ship Neraes to return south the morning before and had already purchased a ticket. However, due to private matters still pending in Shanghai, he temporarily canceled his ticket. It is also learned that Mr. Huang will fly to Wuhan by plane within a few days and then take the Yuehan Railway to Guangdong to return to Guangxi. At that time, Li Zongren's representative Liu Weizhang will travel with him.

### Fishery Syndicate to be Established Tomorrow

Board of Directors to be Established Simultaneously, Permanent Directors to be Mutually Elected

According to the Central News Agency, after three months of preparation by the Ministry of Industries, the Fishery Syndicate has had its capital subscribed by various participating banks, established a preparatory office, and drafted various articles of association. After approval by the Ministry of Industries, it is scheduled to be formally established tomorrow. The process is detailed below.

Preparation Process

Our country's fishing industry has traditionally adhered to old methods. In recent years, it has been declining due to the impact of the economic recession. To revitalize our country's fishing industry, the Ministry of Industries first established a fish market in Shanghai to improve transportation and sales. After a long period of planning, it was completed last year. Since Wu Dingchang became the head of the Ministry of Industries, the improvement plan has placed particular emphasis on economic assistance. The Fishery Syndicate was proposed by Minister Wu. After drafting the outline and approving it by the Executive Yuan, this matter was mentioned at the meeting of the Preparatory Office of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank and the banking industry, which was well received. Therefore, letters were sent to Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhixin, and Kui Yanfang, asking them to be responsible for the preparation. At that time, due to numerous procedures, the preparation took time, and the fishing season was approaching, so funds were urgently needed. Therefore, Zhonghui, Xinhua, and the Savings Society of the Four Banks allocated 120,000 yuan to be loaned to the Yongbo Cooperative and Shanghai Fish Market wholesalers, who then lent it to the fishermen. The preparatory office was formally established on November 7. A total of twelve banks participated.

Establishment Tomorrow

The syndicate's capital is 1,000,000 yuan, of which 200,000 yuan is allocated by the Ministry of Industries as fixed capital, which has now been fully allocated. The remaining 800,000 yuan is subscribed by the banks, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications each subscribing 110,000 yuan, and Jincheng, Yanyeh, Shanghai, Zhongnan Mainland, the Four Banks, Xinhua, Zhonghui, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank each subscribing 60,000 yuan, and Siming 40,000 yuan. The funds will be paid in installments when loans are issued, and each bank will enter into a contract with the syndicate. The draft contract will be signed after approval by the board of directors. The syndicate's articles of association and loan regulations have been passed by the preparatory meeting and are being submitted to the Ministry of Industries for approval. The candidates for directors have been nominated by the Ministry of Industries and various banks. The chairman of the board of directors will be appointed by the Ministry of Industries, and permanent directors will be mutually elected at the board of directors meeting tomorrow to be responsible for the syndicate's business operations. Minister Wu will be invited to attend the meeting and deliver a speech.

### Qiongya Industrial Inspection Team Announces Introductory Remarks and Organizational Regulations

According to the Xinxin News Agency, Li Xingqu, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, has invited Mo Keming to Shanghai to meet with Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Commission, for instructions on the development of Qiongya and to organize the Qiongya Industrial Inspection Team, inviting people from all sectors of Guangdong and Shanghai to participate. The team's introductory remarks and organizational regulations are listed below.

Introductory Remarks

Qiongya is the shield of our country's South China Sea and an excellent industrial area in our country's south. Its natural resources are abundant, comparable to Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago of Southeast Asia, if not surpassing them. Qiongya's mineral resources, such as gold and tin mines, have large outputs. Agricultural products include rubber, coffee, potatoes, coconuts, betel nuts, sugar cane, and forests. All tropical agricultural products are available. Other industries such as fishing, salt production, and animal husbandry are all suitable. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated turning Qiongya into Guangdong Province. In recent years, local people in Qiongya have also been engaged in the movement to build a new Qiongya. However, due to the lack of opportunity and various obstacles, it has not been realized, which is a pity. Now that the national government's policies have been unified and production and construction have been progressing, since Committee Member Song Ziwen went south to Qiongya for investigation, he plans to have the central government allocate large sums of money to handle important matters such as Qiongya's transportation and port construction. At the same time, he advocates that the government should not compete with the people for profit and welcomes domestic and foreign capitalists to invest together, so as to achieve the goal of fully developing Qiongya. Therefore, we have initiated the organization of the "Qiongya Industrial Inspection Team" and united giants from the industrial, financial, and banking sectors in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, as well as various professionals, to go to Qiongya to conduct planned explorations and thorough inspections, and prepare for future investment and business ventures. However, at the beginning of the organization, we hope that our comrades in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai will work together to follow the path of production and construction, practically enrich the national strength and the people's livelihood, and achieve the goal of revitalizing our country's social and economic situation. All our comrades, we hope you will support us. The organizational regulations are as follows:

Regulations

Article 1: Name: The team is named the Qiongya Industrial Inspection Team. Article 2: Purpose: The team is jointly organized by comrades with the same purpose. The purpose is to go to Qiongya to inspect various industrial conditions, prepare for future investment, and welcome comrades from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai to participate actively and work together for the greatest efforts with purpose. Article 3: Office: The team's office is located in the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. The Shanghai liaison office is temporarily located at Manager Zhou Zongjun's office in the Xinxin Company. Article 4: Number of Team Members: The team will temporarily have 30 members, divided into 10 from Guangzhou, 10 from Hong Kong, and 10 from Shanghai (the number of people in each place must not be less than 5, and more are especially welcome). Merchants, industrialists, financiers, professionals, and those who are interested in engaging in industry in Qiongya can participate. Article 5: Organization: The team will have one president and one vice president to preside over all affairs of the team. There will be one secretary and six officers (two officers will be nominated by Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai respectively, and one of the six will be mutually elected as the chief officer). Article 6: Expenses: The team members will be responsible for their own expenses (some expenses should be publicly accounted for and shared). Each of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai will nominate one accountant to manage the expenses in their respective areas. The cost will be approximately 500 yuan per person. The exact amount will be notified again after the budget is prepared. Article 7: Inspection Items: 1. Planting, 2. Mining, 3. Salt Industry, 4. Forestry, 5. Animal Husbandry, 6. Fishing, 7.

Article 8: Inspection Period: The inspection period in Qiongya will not exceed 15 days. The list of names must be sent to the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce by April 1, and the team will gather in Hong Kong and depart before April 15. Article 5: Supplementary Provisions: If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be amended at any time upon the proposal of more than half of the team members.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Promotes Income Tax, Regularly Calls General Meetings for Explanation

Ministry of Finance Confirms that Public Accumulation Should be Included in Capital Calculation, Income Tax Study Classes in North and South Shanghai Start Today

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is actively assisting in the implementation of income tax and is constantly researching and contributing its findings for adoption by the financial authorities. As the deadline for reporting capital is approaching, some guilds and shops have not yet understood the requirements. In addition to requesting a one-month extension, the chamber of commerce is also scheduling a general meeting of guild representatives to explain everything. The details are as follows:

Scheduled Meeting

The chamber of commerce issued a notice to various trade associations yesterday, stating, "According to the implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Ordinance, each business must fill out a capital amount report form and, if they have received deposits, also a deposit report form. To help businesses in this city understand the reporting procedures, we have scheduled a discussion meeting on March 5 at 2:00 PM at the chamber of commerce for representatives of various guilds, representatives of member stores, and directors of various branch offices. We hope that you will be punctual."

Request for Confirmation

The chamber of commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding the inclusion of public accumulation in the capital calculation, stating, "The inclusion of the entire public accumulation in the capital amount calculation is related to the reporting of the capital amount and is a matter that needs to be resolved urgently. Many stores have not yet been able to start filling out the report since receiving the notice that the deadline for reporting is the end of February, precisely because the standard for how to include public accumulation in the capital calculation has not yet been determined. Therefore, we respectfully request that your ministry review and approve the previous requests for amendments as soon as possible, so that reporting capital will be easier to calculate."

Classes Begin

The income tax study classes established by the chamber of commerce, one in the South City at the Commercial Vocational School on Zhonghua Road in Xiaonanmen and one in the North City at the chamber of commerce, have already received over one hundred registrants. The South City class has now been changed to classes every Monday and Wednesday, starting on March 1, from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Both classes will be taught by accountant Xu Yongzuo.

However, Chinese citizens traveling to the Philippines must comply with the U.S. immigration regulations, obtain passports, undergo medical examinations, and pay head taxes, etc. To facilitate passengers' understanding of entry requirements to the Philippines, the China Merchants Bureau has specially announced the detailed measures as follows:

Comprehensive Facilities

This Bureau aims to connect Amoy, a major Chinese port, with Manila, the capital of the Philippines, to facilitate travel for tourists seeking tropical scenery and for those engaged in Far East overseas trade. Therefore, the Amoy-Philippines route has been established, with steamers regularly sailing to provide services and attract business. The Hai Heng steamer has been designated by this Bureau to operate on the Amoy-Philippines route, specifically for passenger and cargo transportation needs. The Hai Heng steamer travels at a speed of approximately thirteen nautical miles per hour. The distance between Amoy and the Philippines is approximately 675 nautical miles, so it can make a round trip in less than ten days. The number of days spent at sea is only half of that, leaving ample time after arriving at each port for tourists to enjoy their leisure. The Hai Heng steamer was built by a British shipyard just over two years ago and is one of the newest types of ships operating along the South China coast, well-known to tourists and merchants alike. The ship is 343 feet long, 47 feet wide, and has a tonnage of over 3,400 tons. Its internal machinery and structure are very modern. Other equipment, such as anti-theft devices, automatic water level indicators, direction finders, etc., are all available, no different from those equipped on the latest ocean liners. In short, it can be said to be safe, comfortable, and clean. All levels of cabins, except for the steerage class, are exterior rooms, with comfortable berths, electric fans, hot water radiators, and other modern sanitary facilities. Connected to the first-class cabins are spacious lounges (smoking rooms) and elegant dining rooms, with top-class chefs hired to prepare exquisite Chinese and Western cuisine. In addition, there is a large reception and dining room at the front of the ship for first and second-class passengers. The Hai Heng steamer has ten first-class cabins, each with two berths, accommodating a total of twenty first-class passengers. There are six second-class cabins, each with three berths, accommodating a total of eighteen second-class passengers. There are fourteen third-class cabins, each with four berths, accommodating a total of fifty-six third-class passengers. The steerage class berths are further divided into two types, accommodating a total of approximately 650 passengers. Crew members and administrative staff are all carefully selected professionals, capable of serving diligently. The cabin attendants (i.e., waiters) in each class have received considerable education and strict training, providing prompt and attentive service, ensuring convenience and comfort for all passengers.

Ticketing Information

The fares for each class of cabin between Amoy and the Philippines are listed as follows:

▲ Child and Servant Tickets: For children under three years of age, the fare is calculated at one-quarter of the adult fare. For children between three and eleven years of age, the fare is reduced by half of the adult fare. Children twelve years of age and older are charged the adult fare. For each passenger, one child under three years of age may travel free of charge, provided they do not occupy a berth. Passengers bringing servants should pay the fare calculated according to the class of cabin occupied by the servant. However, these servants may serve in their master's cabin but may not stay overnight.

▲ Free Baggage Allowance: Passengers in each class of cabin are entitled to the following free baggage allowance:

First Class: Each passenger is allowed up to 350 pounds of baggage free of charge. Second Class: Each passenger is allowed up to 250 pounds of baggage free of charge. Third Class: Each passenger is allowed up to 200 pounds of baggage free of charge. Steerage Class: Each passenger is allowed up to 150 pounds of baggage free of charge. The free baggage allowance for children's tickets is calculated proportionally to their fare. Passengers exceeding the above free baggage allowance will be charged at a rate of three cents per pound in national currency or two cents per pound in Philippine currency.

▲ Group Ticket Prices: Group ticket fares will be reduced according to the following rates:

Ten or more people: 10% discount on the regular fare
Twenty or more people: 15% discount on the regular fare
Thirty or more people: 20% discount on the regular fare

▲ Ticket Refunds: If passengers return their tickets before the scheduled departure of the steamer, they may receive a refund of 80% of the original fare at the original purchase location. If a refund is requested within 24 hours after the ship's departure, a refund of 50% of the original fare will be given.

▲ Cabin Reservations: Passengers reserving cabins should pay 20% of the cabin fare in advance. The advance payment can be deducted when purchasing the ticket. This type of cabin reservation is only reserved until two days before the scheduled departure of the steamer. After that, it will be canceled. In any case, the advance cabin reservation fee will not be refunded.

Important Information for Traveling to the Philippines

"When entering a country, inquire about its customs." The important information for Chinese citizens traveling to the Philippines includes: (Passport Inspection) Passengers traveling from Amoy to Manila must obtain a passport before departure to prove their nationality. The passport must then be sent to the local U.S. diplomatic representative in China for verification and visa issuance. Upon arrival in Manila, immigration officials will board the ship to inspect passenger reports and passports. Only those who comply with immigration laws will be allowed to disembark. Passengers traveling from Manila to Amoy should also have their passports properly prepared. (Port Quarantine) Passengers traveling to Manila must comply with the Philippine government's health regulations. Before purchasing a ticket and departing, they must first undergo a physical examination by a doctor accredited by the U.S. diplomatic representative in China and obtain a health certificate for submission to the quarantine officer upon arrival in Manila. (Head Tax) Passengers traveling to Manila will have the Philippine government's head tax collected by the Bureau's ticket office when purchasing their tickets. Each person must pay 16 Philippine pesos. Tourists leaving the Philippines within 60 days can request a refund of the taxes paid from the Philippine government. (Customs Inspection) The Amoy and Manila customs authorities will inspect passengers' baggage. Therefore, please do not privately carry any prohibited items or taxable goods to avoid violating the law. (Placement of Passenger Baggage) Passengers' handbags and small suitcases can be placed inside the cabin. The remaining large suitcases should be handed over to the cabin attendants for proper storage. Passengers must pay attention to their own baggage when boarding or disembarking. (Valuable Items) Passengers with valuable items such as money, sealed by themselves, can hand them over to the ship's purser for safekeeping. However, the purser is not responsible for the contents of the sealed package. (Dogs) Dogs carried by passengers must be placed in a fixed and suitable place, not allowed in the cabins, public lounges, or passenger promenade areas on the ship. They must also be properly muzzled. A fee of five yuan per dog is required. (Ship Doctor) The ship has a renowned doctor serving on board. If illness occurs during the voyage, free medical treatment will be provided.

Passengers must cooperate with the ship's staff to maintain peace and order on board.

The Bureau's Amoy and Manila agents are happy to assist with any matters that passengers need help with before departure.

### Yu Jichuan From Hunan Negotiates Investment With Banking Circles in Shanghai

Founding a Second Textile Factory in Hunan Province

China News Agency reports: Yu Jichuan, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Construction, after the closing of the Third Plenary Session, went to Shanghai from Nanjing with He Jian, the Chairman of the province. Yu has been very busy contacting various parties in Shanghai. Regarding the establishment of a second yarn factory in Hunan Province, he also discussed the matter with the Bank of China yesterday and visited major factories in the city. The details are as follows:

Yarn Factory Loan

The Hunan Provincial Government, in order to develop the province's textile industry, has decided to establish a second yarn factory, with 30,000 spindles, specializing in spinning 20-count cotton yarn. The estimated start-up cost is 2 million yuan. Last month, Fan Xindu, the director of the province's first yarn factory, came to Shanghai to negotiate a loan with the Bank of China, but no result was achieved. After Yu arrived in Shanghai this time, he again discussed with Wang Lifu, the head of cotton lending at the Bank of China, and others, and decided to use the first yarn factory as collateral to borrow 2 million yuan. According to sources at the Bank of China, the bank is very supportive of investing in the development of textiles but hopes that the organization of the second yarn factory can be more commercially oriented to facilitate investment.

Consulting He Jian

After Yu had some progress in negotiating the yarn factory loan with the Bank of China, he decided to consult with He Jian, the chairman of the province, who was staying in Shanghai, regarding the commercialization of the second yarn factory and its organizational charter. He will continue discussions with the Bank of China in the coming days, and it is expected to proceed smoothly. It is reported that Hunan Province needs more than 160,000 bales of cotton yarn annually. The province's first yarn factory can only supply more than 40,000 bales, and the rest is imported from other places, worth about 30 million yuan. If the second yarn factory is established in the future, the demand can be gradually balanced.

### Foreign Merchants' Attempt to Divide China's Sugar Market Unsuccessful

Negotiations Halted Due to Conflicting Interests; China's Sugar Industry Has Great Prospects

Central News Agency reports: In recent years, the domestic sugar industry has gradually developed, and production has increased sharply. Jardine Matheson's sugar factory intended to negotiate an agreement with the Japan Sugar Association to divide China's sugar market. The reporter inquired with relevant parties and learned that this news is difficult to confirm and is unlikely to become a reality. The details are as follows:

Foreign Sugar Severely Affected

Foreign merchants have been severely affected by the sharp increase in domestic sugar production and sales. Moreover, domestic sugar manufacturers are united and well-managed. Therefore, there was a proposal to negotiate an agreement. However, due to conflicting interests, the negotiations were halted, and it is unlikely to become a reality. Domestic sugar products are no worse than Jardine Matheson's, and the China Sugar Production and Sales Association is in charge of all sales matters. Only when domestic sugar is in short supply can foreign sugar be purchased. Therefore, it is not easy for foreign merchants to divide the market.

Future Development of Domestic Sugar

Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, and Liu Weichi, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction, passed through Shanghai after the closing of the Third Plenary Session. Leaders of the sugar industry in the city visited them to discuss the development of domestic sugar. It is expected that the development of domestic sugar will be very promising.

Participating in the World Sugar Conference

Regarding the World Sugar Conference convened by the United Kingdom in London on April 5, China has decided to send representatives to participate. The candidates are currently being selected by the Ministry of Industry. It is expected to be announced next week. If time is tight, they will fly to attend. This conference brings together representatives from countries around the world to discuss international sugar issues. For the sake of rights, we cannot easily give up this opportunity.

### Qian Chengxu Hosts Bada at a Banquet

Qian Chengxu, a member of the China National Economic Construction Association, hosted Bada and his entourage at the Hua Mao Hotel on Nanjing Road last night. Guests included Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao), Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Czech Consul General McGurn, British Commercial Counselor Peel, Hylas Smith, General Manager of the Bo Nei Men Company, and over twenty others. During the banquet, Qian Chengxu gave a welcome speech, stating that when he parted with Mr. Bada in the Czech Republic two years ago, they agreed to meet in the Far East two years later. Now that Mr. Bada has come to China to fulfill the agreement, he is extremely happy. In the past few hundred years, countless scientific and technological experts have continuously improved and researched footwear around the world, but even today, there are still many shortcomings in the manufacturing process. As for China's footwear industry, it has always been simple and crude. It is feared that since the beginning of shoemaking, no one has paid attention to its improvement. In terms of machine-made shoes, it is even more difficult to foresee. China has a vast territory and a population of over 400 million. At a minimum, 50 million pairs of shoes must be manufactured daily to meet demand. If industrialists can promote this, it will have a great impact on the development of the national economy, as well as military transportation and national defense. When I returned from overseas two years ago, based on the impression and experience of visiting the Bada shoe factory, I founded a Chinese machine-made shoe factory. Although there has been some progress today, the degree and time required to fulfill my long-held goal of a successful shoe industry revolution are still far apart. In short, today's European and American shoemaking machines are not very suitable for manufacturing Chinese shoes, and the efforts of Western technologists are focused on Western shoes, and they have no energy or time to design for China. Therefore, the realization of large-scale machine-made Chinese shoes in the future, its various machines, inventions, and equipment, must rely on the minds and brains of the Chinese people to solve the difficulties in the Chinese shoe industry. Bada's reply was very long, repeatedly commenting on the struggle between natural and artificial raw materials. Qian Chengxu translated the meaning on the spot, stating that although the European War of 1914 originated in politics, its actual purpose was to compete for raw material markets. In the past ten years, the population has gradually increased, and the raw materials needed by general industrial countries are still insufficient. As a result, economic disputes have arisen. Countries with natural raw materials can maintain their position, while countries lacking natural raw materials have no choice but to use scientific inventions to manufacture artificial raw materials to fight against them. In the future, the degree of separation between the two types of raw materials will become deeper, and the opportunity for human peace and proximity will become farther and farther. In short, the world has entered a stage of serious economic struggle. Only nations with economic resistance can fight against countries that invade with economic support to maintain a balanced situation. After the speech, Guo Bingwen asked Bada whether Czechoslovakia, as an emerging country, exported cheap goods, whether it was related to low wages, or whether it had special talents and technologies. Bada replied that before the founding of Czechoslovakia, it was originally Hungarian-Austrian territory. The Paris Peace Conference divided the territory, and most of the industries were located in the Czech Republic. Due to the shortening of the production line and the improvement of economic conditions, external actions were more active. Moreover, there is no large market in the Czech Republic to supply commodity sales, so the national technical efficiency may be higher than that of countries with domestic markets. This is probably created by the situation. As for the wages, although the wages in Central Europe are lower than those in England and France, the power of trade unions in the Czech Republic is very strong, and production is limited by trade union regulations, unlike other countries, such as the textile industry, which can manage more than 20 looms per person, using mechanical capabilities to reduce the number of employed workers. At the end of the banquet, photos were taken to commemorate the occasion.

### Solicitation Forms for the Handicraft Exhibition Have Been Issued

Since the National Handicraft Exhibition was scheduled to be held in the capital, the Departments of Construction and Social Affairs of various provinces and cities have been preparing to collect exhibits to participate. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs also established a collection office in conjunction with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and published a notice in the newspaper to collect exhibits separately. And because the previously scheduled collection period was too short, various manufacturers either did not know or were informed, so it was extended to the end of February. The manufacturers in the city believe that the full exhibition is of great significance, which can promote the construction of the national economy and the sales of products of various manufacturers, and it is especially closely related to the promotion of local products, so they have been collecting fine products to respond to the solicitation. It is reported that the city's collection office has urged the manufacturers to pack and seal the solicited items as soon as possible and send them to the office for registration and issuance of free transportation certificates for transporting them to Nanjing on a regular basis. It is also reported that the conference has set up a collection department to facilitate the manufacturers to sell their products, and its sales application form has been issued yesterday. Manufacturers who are willing to participate in the sales can go to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's collection office to obtain and fill out the form so that the conference venue can reserve a location in advance. In order to popularize the solicitation, the solicited items sent before March 6 will also be transferred to Nanjing for consideration.

### Municipal Federation Submits a Request for Negotiations to Withdraw Japanese Troops From the Yongfeng Building

And to Stop Patrols to Calm People's Hearts

The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of the city submitted a request to the municipal government yesterday morning, saying: It is to submit a request for negotiations to withdraw the Japanese troops occupying the Yongfeng Building and to stop the patrols to calm people's hearts and maintain the market. According to the report from the 25th District Branch of the Federation (the original text has been seen in the previous report), etc. According to this, it is found that at the beginning of the Haining Road incident last year, the Japanese troops deployed outposts and patrols, which could be excused as being out of vigilance. Now that the time has passed, they are still occupying the Yongfeng Building and patrolling all day long, which is really incomprehensible. It only makes people panic, and the industrial and commercial industries have suffered significant losses. According to the above report, it is reasonable to submit a request to your government to quickly negotiate the withdrawal of the Japanese troops occupying the Yongfeng Building and to stop the patrols to calm people's hearts and maintain the market. I am deeply grateful, respectfully submitted.

### Request for Relief from Families of Zhaohe Martyrs

The remains of Mo Jinyang, Xie Qiuying, Yu Liaotai, and other martyrs who died in the Zhaohe warship uprising are still exposed at the Guangzhao Cemetery, and their families are also impoverished. Their family members, including Yu Baotai, Xie En, and Mo Gansheng, jointly submitted a request to the Central Executive Committee for compensation and also sent a letter to President Sun of the Legislative Yuan requesting ways to provide relief. This matter was reported previously (February 18th). The letter's wording was mournful, sincere and touching. Now, the original letter and President Sun's reply are recorded below:

Letter to President Sun

Respectfully, esteemed President Zhegong: My deceased brothers Yu Liaotai, Xie Qiuying, Mo Jinyang, and others embraced the revolution and sacrificed their lives for the country. During the winter of the fourth year of the Republic [1915], they participated in the Zhaohe warship uprising, moving quickly and vying to be the first to land. Unfortunately, due to lack of support and exhaustion of strength, they were captured and brutally murdered by the enemy before the battle. This is truly heartbreaking. However, although the event failed, their loyalty and bravery were evident. Afterwards, Guangdong responded and the entire country followed suit, leading to the demise of Hongxian's imperial regime. Are they not like the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang? Therefore, although the participants cannot be said to have achieved great accomplishments, they should be credited with small contributions. My deceased brothers died in this campaign, which was their duty, but their families are destitute, scattered, enduring hardship, and struggling to survive. Encountering such devastation is truly lamentable. Moreover, their remains are exposed, and we are still unable to bury them. Thinking of their loyal souls increases our grief. Baotai and others, like geese with broken wings, feel the pain deeply. The families of the deceased are poor, and we are responsible for their sustenance. Baotai and others have tried their best to help in this emergency, but our efforts are insufficient. Baotai and others are all from working-class families without constant property, lacking specialized skills, and struggling to support ourselves, making it even more difficult to care for others. At this time when there is no way to get assistance, we can only appeal to the central government for compensation. We respectfully submit the petition to the Central Executive Committee for your review and humbly request your great assistance to obtain relief, so that the martyrs can be properly buried, and their families can avoid destitution. Both the living and the dead will be grateful and repay your kindness. Respectfully, we submit this letter with a hundred bows and ask for your consideration. We wish you good health. February 15th.

President Sun's Reply

Dear Sirs: I have received and read your letter and understand everything. I have already forwarded your petition to the central government for verification and consideration of compensation. Sincerely, Sun Ke. February 18th. To Yu Baotai, Xie En, and Mo Gansheng.

### Jiangdong Company's Scheduled Opening

Vehicles Being Rushed to Completion

The Jiangdong Long-Distance Bus Company has been preparing to open its office in Shanghai for quite some time. Due to various factors related to the political situation and personnel, the opening has been delayed. It is now learned that the company's organizers, Guo Zongyi, Jiang Shanzhi, Li Donghou, and others have obtained the support and participation of local gentry and merchants, and have re-raised capital to strengthen their internal capabilities.

As soon as they are finished, the buses will be officially put into service. It is also heard that they plan to place additional orders with Meitong Company for freight trucks and parcel vans.

### County Land Administration Bureau Sets Deadline for Supplementary Registration

Failure to Register by Deadline Will Result in Levy of Land Usufruct

The first installment of the land value tax for the 25th year of the Republic [1936] in Shanghai County has already been collected, and the second installment is about to be levied. The County Land Administration Bureau has set a deadline of March 15 for supplementary registration of unregistered land. Failure to register by the deadline will result in a monthly levy of 6% annual interest on the assessed land value. The announcement is recorded as follows: "According to Instruction No. 37 from the Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Bureau, regarding the usufruct of temporarily managed land, it was originally decided to collect it from land users in installments for convenience. However, those who request supplementary registration during the management period, in addition to paying the registration fee of six thousandths of the land value according to regulations, the unpaid usufruct should be calculated at an annual interest rate of six percent of the land value and collected monthly until the month of supplementary registration. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance. After investigation, land registration in this county was completed in July of the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. All unregistered land has been legally sealed. The second installment of the land value tax for the 25th year [1936] is about to be levied. All unregistered property owners are hereby given a deadline of March 15th of this year to apply for registration. Those who apply for registration within this period will be exempt from the aforementioned usufruct as a gesture of consideration. If they continue to delay, they will be charged monthly interest at an annual rate of six percent of the assessed land value, according to the previous order."

It is also reported that if there is any division or consolidation of already registered land, the owner should bring the documents to the Land Administration Bureau to apply for re-measurement from now until March 10th, so as to correct the tax register.

### News About Zhabei Public Buses

Route 1A Suspended Tomorrow; Route 4 Rerouted to West Baoxing Road

Since the Shanghai Huashang Public Bus Company began operating the Jiangwan Route 1 bus in two lines, A and B, last year, passengers have found the B line to be more convenient and economical, and now all take the B line instead of the A line. The company, in view of the fact that the racetrack has stopped racing and that the students of Fudan University are now taking Routes 4 and 5, has found that the A line has only a few passengers getting on and off at West Baoxing Road, and almost none at other stops. In order to avoid oversupply and maintain its capital, the company has applied to the authorities and has been approved to temporarily suspend the A line of Route 1 starting from the 1st of the month. The B line will continue to operate as usual. At the same time, in order to maintain traffic on West Baoxing Road, Route 4 will be rerouted to West Baoxing Road, Shui Dian Road, Xiang Yin Road, and back to the original route to the Municipal Government. The fares for the entire line will be divided into sections. Except for the Qingyun Road stop, the Sanyang Road and Liuying Road stops have been changed to the Baziqiao stop, and the rest remain the same. It is also heard that when the racetrack resumes racing, special buses will be provided to facilitate spectators.

### Japanese Vice-Consul Aoyagi's Residence Robbed

Minimal Loss; Police Investigating

At around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, a man in Japanese attire suddenly entered the residence of Aoyagi Ichiro, the Japanese Vice-Consul stationed in Shanghai, at Apartment No. 12 on the third floor of the Pearce Apartments at No. 207 Zhaopu Road, wielding a knife to commit robbery. The Vice-Consul was out on official business at the time, and only his hired maid, Nagai Hideko, was arranging the tableware in the dining room. The assailant repeatedly threatened her, and she was unable to resist. She allowed him to choose whatever he wanted and leave, but the assailant refused. Nagai Hideko was forced to take out two Japanese yen from her person and give it to him. The assailant then left and fled. Afterwards, Nagai Hideko reported the information to the Vice-Consul, who immediately notified the Hongkou police station. The police station sent Japanese detectives to investigate and immediately launched a city-wide search. It is reported that the assailant is about thirty years old and appears to have a mental illness. Last year, he stole a wireless radio and hired a car to send it to the Hongkou police station, which was also done by him.

### Zhang Jingle, Manager of Lao Baosheng Silver Shop on Baille Road, Smelting Silver for Illegal Export

Former Partner Wu Pengnian Sues Shareholders; Shanghai District Court Transfers Case for Prosecution

On November 3, 1935, the National Government promulgated the nationalization of silver, and the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were designated as legal tender for circulation in the market. Any unscrupulous merchant who collects silver for illegal export will be prosecuted in accordance with Article 2 of the Emergency Crime Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China. Zhang Jingle, a native of Ningbo (40 years old this year), the manager of the Lao Baosheng Silver Shop at No. 175 Baille Road in the French Concession, has recently been collecting silver and silver dollars, melting them, and secretly transporting them to Hong Kong for sale for profit. His former partner Wu Pengnian informed more than ten shareholders of the shop, who jointly reported the matter to the relevant authorities. The Ministry of Finance secretly ordered the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to arrest him. Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun obeyed the order and dispatched Bai Zhongqi, the captain of the first detective squad, Squad Leader Xue Shilin, and other detectives to rush to the scene with French police detectives. Zhang Jingle was arrested and taken back to the police station for detention pending investigation. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau then requested the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate to send a document to the Second Special Court requesting a transfer of jurisdiction, but the police station had not yet brought the defendant to court and could not transfer jurisdiction. Yesterday morning, the French police sent Zhang Jingle, along with a model that was seized, to the Second Special Court, requesting a trial and investigation. Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the trial in the first criminal court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, saying that the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau had sent personnel stating that the bureau had received a secret order from the Ministry of Finance stating that the defendant was suspected of illegally exporting gold and silver, and requested the police station to assist in arresting the defendant. As the police station still needed to investigate whether the defendant had committed any crimes in the concession, he requested a short extension for investigation, etc. At that time, Zhang Shuping, the judicial police chief from the Shanghai District Procuratorate, and police officer Chen Xihui arrived with a document requesting the transfer of the defendant. Judge Sun then declared that since the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate had sent a document based on Article 7 of the agreement, requesting the transfer of jurisdiction, it could not be refused according to law. The Police Department lawyer did not express any objection to the transfer and asked the court to rule. The court briefly questioned the defendant about his age and origin, and then ruled that Zhang Jingle should be handed over to the personnel from the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate for trial. Zhang Shuping, the personnel who came, signed a receipt and took Zhang down to the court for questioning.

### Zhang Shujuan, a Woman from Xikang, Studies Pharmaceutical Manufacturing

Interning at Zhongxi Pharmacy Yesterday

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Ms. Zhang Shujuan from Xikang is from Aba'er. After graduating from the Dartsemdo Primary School, she was taken to Qingdao by a Good Shepherd priest to study medicine. Later, she went to Chongqing Renji Hospital for a two-year internship. Feeling that her medical knowledge was insufficient, she came to Shanghai at her own expense after an introduction from the Frontier Education Association to learn pharmaceutical manufacturing, so that she could use Kang-produced medicinal materials to prepare medicines in the future. Yesterday, through the introduction of Huang Jingwan and Liu Zhanen, she entered Zhongxi Pharmacy and was treated favorably by Zhou Bangjun and Chu Minyi, where she first learned the basic sciences of pharmaceutical manufacturing. In the autumn, she will intern at the Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory.

### Continuous Rain Affects Spring Harvest

### Father Jin Returns to Shanghai

States China Has Made Definite Progress

According to a French-language Shanghai Daily report translated by the Foreign News Agency, there is a Father Jin Road in the French Concession of Shanghai, which is in memory of a Father Jin of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. This Father Jin has now returned to Shanghai. Father Jin is currently the Superior General of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. After arriving in Shanghai, he will stay for several days before going to Hong Kong. Father Jin's reputation is well-known among foreigners in the Far East. His footprints have reached Singapore, Bangkok, Batavia, and other places besides China. He is indeed a great colonialist. Father Jin first came to Shanghai in 1888 and was elected to the French Municipal Council, serving until 1903. Father Jin made great contributions to the construction of the French Concession. Father Jin has a wealth of plans for colonial expansion, and the French Concession's expansion to its present state is largely due to Father Jin's efforts. The properties outside the concession were all purchased by him, and the strategies for building roads were also determined by him. From 1903 to 1926, Father Jin was transferred to Hong Kong to serve as the head priest. Later, he was transferred to Paris to be the assistant to Bishop Gubenlion. In March 1935, Father Jin was appointed as the Superior General of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. A reporter (a reporter from a French newspaper who identified himself) heard that Father Jin had arrived in Shanghai and immediately went to visit the San Detang office of the Paris Foreign Missions Society on Terrace Road, and was summoned. The reporter asked about his impressions of returning to Shanghai and questioned him about his observations on the development of the Shanghai French Concession. Father Jin said, "Since I left Shanghai in 1903, I almost don't recognize it this time I return. Fortunately, I came to Shanghai once in 1927, so I haven't forgotten everything." The development of the Shanghai French Concession is truly unexpected. I have traveled to various parts of the Americas and Europe and have not seen anything similar. The French Concession became a city in a cemetery and wasteland. Father Jin also said that the rapid development of the French Concession was due to the filling of the Yangjingbang to create Edward Road, which greatly facilitated transportation. Therefore, since 1900, the French Concession has gradually modernized. Also, in 1900, on the proposal of Director Baochang, Shan Zhong Road, Haig Road, and other roads were built on the right side of Mintiniyin Road to reach the old Xujiahui Road. In addition, Baochang Road was also built. This Baochang Road was later renamed Avenue Joffre. According to Father Jin, the creation of Avenue Joffre was initiated by him. At the time, he was criticized for being too large, but judging from the congestion of Avenue Joffre today, Avenue Joffre seems to be too small. Father Jin's visit to Shanghai this time came via the South Seas, visiting Singapore, the Malay Archipelago, Siam, and Manila. In Manila, he participated in the Catholic Eucharistic Congress. According to Father Jin, the Eucharistic Congress in Manila was very successful. The number of participants was very large, and even more people received Communion, which is very gratifying. There are also 146 French priests in the Philippines, so the power of the French Catholic Church is also quite impressive. The reporter then inquired about his general views on the Chinese political situation, as Father Jin is known as an expert on Chinese affairs. Father Jin said that ancient China has progressed slowly, but it has indeed made progress. The country is too large, and the modernization project cannot but be carried out slowly.

### Postal Bureau Stipulates Procedures for Mailing to Guangdong and Hong Kong by Airmail

### Former Consul-General's Secretary of Switzerland in Shanghai, Mr. Jia, Embezzlement Case Cracked

Embezzled Funds Exceed 100,000 Yuan; Changed His Appearance Multiple Times, Eventually Confessed

The Shanghai Qin Wu Shi Bao (Shanghai Times) reported that Mr. Jia Kaoket Guila Mode, 37 years old, former secretary of the Swiss Consul-General's Office in Shanghai, was arrested for embezzling funds under his care while in office. He fled in July 1935 to evade punishment. Despite the police's extensive search and pursuit, his whereabouts remained unknown until yesterday (the 26th) morning when he was finally caught. It is reported that the total amount of funds embezzled by Mr. Jia exceeded 100,000 Chinese yuan, which included $35,000 US dollars, which was a sum the Swiss Consul-General's Office was holding from a Swiss remittance to a British national here in Shanghai. There was also 12,000 Swiss francs, 50,000 French francs, and 1,000 US dollars, all proceeds from the sale of Swiss-owned properties. According to Mr. Jia's confession to the police yesterday, after leaving Shanghai, he traveled to Guangzhou, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and other places, intending to reside in the South Seas Islands permanently. However, he was also deceived and lost some funds. He then decided to return to Shanghai, arriving in December 1935. He lived in seclusion and changed his appearance to avoid detection. Mr. Jia's original blond hair was dyed black, and he pretended to have a limp. Over the years, he lost about 35 pounds, and his face became thin. However, he ultimately could not escape the keen eyes of the detectives. After being hidden in Shanghai for a long time without being discovered, Mr. Jia became negligent in his self-protection and began to frequent dance halls on North Sichuan Road and Broadway Road. The police, upon learning this, began to stake out these locations. Yesterday, they received information that Mr. Jia was playing cards at a dance hall at No. 227 Broadway Road. Detective Bai Laitlai and an informant were dispatched to arrest him. They found Mr. Jia sitting at a table, enjoying himself. However, due to Mr. Jia's completely altered appearance, the detective and the informant were initially hesitant to act. They sat at a neighboring table to observe him. Later, Mr. Jia left his seat and exited the dance hall. The two followed him to a corner on Nansun Road, where they approached and arrested him. Mr. Jia initially denied his identity but eventually confessed. He was taken to the General Police Station for the night and was escorted to the Swiss Consul-General's Office in the morning. Consul-General Lai Di was overjoyed upon hearing the news. After a brief interrogation, he ordered Mr. Jia to be detained. It is currently unknown whether the case will be tried in Shanghai.

### Rickshaw Deflation Case Leads to Numerous Criminal Law Defendants

Zheng Fa Zhu Sues Hou Shao An and 140 Others; Multiple People with the Same Name, Including Women and a Lawyer

Zheng Fa Zhu, a native of Yancheng, Jiangbei, was involved in the public concession rickshaw deflation incident. He was arrested by the police and brought before the First Special District Court, where he was sentenced to three months in prison. Subsequently, rickshaw businessman Hou Shao An and others filed a civil lawsuit against Zheng, seeking compensation of 30,000 yuan for the losses incurred due to the deflation. The case was dismissed. Zheng then filed a criminal self-suit against Hou Shao An and 141 others, the plaintiffs in the civil case, with the Shanghai Local Court, alleging that the loss statistics submitted by Hou and others in the civil court of the First Special District Court were forged, and that most of the listed plaintiffs were not formal rickshaw businessmen, with some already deceased, clearly indicating an intent to defraud. After reviewing the case, the Local Court determined that it should be handled by the First Special District Court and transferred the case to the First Special District Court. The Special Court has already summoned the parties once, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, Judge Dai Rong Tuo presided over the hearing of the case in the Fifth Criminal Court. Among the defendants accused by Zheng, there were four Mao Guang Fa, two Zhang Fa Ji, two Mao Guang Cai, Mao Gui Bao, four women named Ge Wu Yu Ying, Ye Wu Yu Zhen, Xue Zhang Pei Hua, Chen Mei Yu Xiu, and lawyer Bao Zhen Huang was also listed as a defendant. Although some defendants were present at the hearing, Song Qi arrived, and Judge Dai, after questioning them, ordered the hearing to be rescheduled.

Ten suspects, including Lu Yong Qing and Shi Wan Jin, were arrested. A large quantity of one-yuan counterfeit banknotes, subsidiary coins, and various printing equipment and seals of the Central Bank were seized. They were sent to the First Special Court and repeatedly brought to trial for detailed questioning. At that time, Li Zhi Shan, the lawyer prosecuting for the police station, argued that the defendants forged the national currency, disrupting the financial system, and that some of the defendants were engaged in this as a profession, and should be severely punished. The court ordered them to await sentencing. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning at 9:30, Judge Fu Lin ascended the bench in the Eighth Criminal Court and announced the judgment: Lu Yong Qing, a recidivist of jointly forging banknotes, was sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for ten years; Shi Wan Jin, for jointly forging banknotes, was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for ten years; Chen Xi Wei, for jointly forging currency, was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for ten years; Wang Bo Lu, for jointly forging banknotes, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for seven years; Huang Shi Zhen, for jointly forging banknotes, was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for six years; Chen Tian Xin and Guo Chun Xuan, for jointly using counterfeit currency, were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for five years; Qian Yin Sheng, for jointly using counterfeit currency, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for three years; Zhang Bai Ting, for jointly attempting to use counterfeit currency, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years; Wang Ming Qing, for intending to use and collecting counterfeit currency, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years.

### Xu Chun Yuan's Ears Were Cut Off

Thugs Set Up Gambling Den, Uneven Distribution of Profits; Strict Investigation to Arrest Culprits and Bring Them to Justice

Near Yao Huang Miao He Ji Clothing Factory in Zhabei, at around 7 o'clock last night, a local man, Xu Chun Yuan (26 years old), had half of both his ears cut off with sharp knives by several thugs, and his mouth and nose were also stabbed, causing profuse bleeding. Xu cried out in pain, and the thugs scattered and fled. Afterwards, Xu was taken to Cihe Hospital by the police station for treatment. Regarding the reason for the attack, it is said that Xu is a gangster who recently set up a gambling den with his peers, skimming profits, and the distribution was uneven, leading to infighting. The police discovered this and raided the place. The peers suspected Xu of informing the police, so they attacked him to vent their anger. The police are now strictly investigating and arresting the culprits to bring them to justice.

### Reduced Freight Rates for Paper Cigarettes on Two Railways

Extended for Six Months

The special freight rates for paper cigarettes transported on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo-Suzhou-Jiaxing railways, which were set on a per-box basis since September 1st of last year, were approved by the Ministry of Railways for a trial period of six months. The trial period will expire at the end of March. The railway authorities, considering the trial results to be good, with an increase in both the quantity of goods transported and the freight revenue, have reapplied for approval to continue the per-box special freight rate for paper cigarettes for another six months, starting from March 1st.

### Police Bureau Announces Strict Prohibition of Hunting and Killing Pigeons

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau issued Announcement No. 3 on political matters, stating that the bureau had previously received a letter from the Social Affairs Bureau stating that the Municipal Zoo had reported that carrier pigeons could supplement the inadequacies of scientific communication and had been recognized by major powers as necessary equipment for national defense transportation. The Special Communications Team of the Military and Political Department of China also had carrier pigeon training classes. The zoo, in order to promote civilian breeding of carrier pigeons and research and improve breeds, held the Shanghai Carrier Pigeon Competition on May 9, 1935, and in August of the same year, gathered carrier pigeon enthusiasts in the city to establish the Carrier Pigeon Research Association in the zoo, engaging in research on breeding and training. Members of the Carrier Pigeon Research Association have repeatedly reported that carrier pigeons leave their nests and are either foraging in fields or temporarily resting on rooftops. Those with knowledge know to protect them, but the ignorant, as well as a small number of hunters, often arbitrarily hunt and kill them. Carrier pigeons have lead rings on their feet, which distinguishes them from ordinary pigeons, and their value is also hundreds or thousands of times greater. If a long-trained carrier pigeon is hunted and killed, the loss is significant. Therefore, we have prepared a document to request that you forward it to the Public Security Bureau to immediately issue an announcement to inform the public and hunters that hunting and killing carrier pigeons with lead rings on their feet is prohibited. In view of this, it is deemed feasible to prohibit the hunting of carrier pigeons as requested by the zoo. In addition to instructions, we are sending a letter to your bureau to investigate and announce the prohibition, etc. This has been reported to the Municipal Government and forwarded to the Military and Political Department for approval. All types of pigeons are strictly prohibited from hunting and killing in order to emphasize carrier pigeon training. In addition to replying to the letter and issuing separate orders, a public announcement is hereby made. Please comply with this announcement. Issued on February 26, 1937, by Cai Jin Jun, Director of the Bureau.

### Xue Xiang Yun's Medical Examination Concludes She Has Not Given Birth

Wang Gen Bao is Not Xue's Child; Wang Yong Quan's Side Requests Re-examination

Xue Xiang Yun, daughter of the paint tycoon Xue Bin Run, has been married to real estate businessman Xu Liang Chen for more than ten years. Recently, Wang Yong Quan, a former chauffeur of the Xue family, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, requesting confirmation that his son, Wang Gen Bin, is the illegitimate child of Xue Xiang Yun. After a trial, the court ruled against Wang Yong Quan. Now Xue Xiang Yun (i.e., Xu Xue Shi) has also hired lawyers E Sen Tang Shen Pei to sue Wang Yong Quan and his son Wang Gen Bin in the Criminal Court of the First Special District, accusing them of fraud, perjury, and defamation. Judge Zhong Qing has summoned them twice. Xu Xue Shi requested a medical examination by forensic doctor Wei Li Gong during the civil lawsuit, who determined that Xu Xue Shi had not given birth. Judge Zhong believed that Xu Xue Shi's previous examination was a personal action and not legally compliant. To ensure impartiality, he ordered her to go to the female forensic doctor's office at the Local Court for a re-examination. Later, with Xu Xue Shi's permission, the examination was changed to the Zhen Ru Forensic Institute. As reported in this newspaper several times, yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Judge Pan Zhen Yang presided over the continuation of the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. Judge Pan first announced that the court had received a report from the Zhen Ru Forensic Institute, confirming that Xu Xue Shi had not given birth, indicating that Wang Zhen Bin was not Xue's child. Wang Yong Quan insisted that Gen Bin was indeed Xue's child, and his defense lawyer Chen Wen Qi stated that according to Article 187 of the Criminal Procedure Law, they could refuse the鉴定(jiàndìng - expert determination/evaluation). In this case, when Judge Zhong first opened the trial, in order to comply with the Ministry of Justice's order that a female forensic doctor should examine a woman's lower body, he instructed Xu Xue Shi to come to the court the next morning to be accompanied to the female forensic doctor's office at the Local Court. Unexpectedly, she disobeyed the court order and insisted on going to the Zhen Ru Forensic Institute for a鉴定. The defendant had already stated in writing before the鉴定结果 (jiàndìng jiéguǒ - assessment result) was obtained that they would object to the result regardless of what it may be. Judge Pan stated that this case was originally handled by Judge Zhong, but now Judge Zhong is on leave, so the hearing will be adjourned to a later date.

### Public Concession Deputy Chief Inspector Younger Talks About the History of the Police Force

Relating to Shanghai Lore, Providing Citizens with Reference

Last week, at a meeting held by the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Younger, the Deputy Chief Inspector of the Public Concession, gave a speech on the history of the development of the police force in the Public Concession. Given its relevance to Shanghai lore, we have extracted and translated the following for your reference. It is said that the history of the Shanghai police force is the history of the Public Concession. This statement is very close to the truth. Although the British Concession was established in 1843, it did not obtain the right to establish a police force until 1854. The first Land Regulations of 1845 prohibited the establishment of a police force, only allowing the employment of security guards approved by Chinese officials. At that time, the number of foreigners in the concession was small, and the number of Chinese residing in the concession was only a few hundred. Therefore, there was no need to establish a police force. In 1853, the Small Swords Society occupied Shanghai City, and about 20,000 Chinese from the city moved into the concession. The concession's allowance of Chinese to move in was contrary to the treaties at the time, which stipulated that new Chinese residents were not allowed to live in the concession, and existing Chinese residents were not allowed to rent out houses or build new houses to rent to Chinese. Because so many refugees moved in, it was necessary to amend the Land Regulations and establish a police force. The amended Land Regulations of 1854 allowed the organization of a guard or police force, which was the starting point for the establishment of the concession police station. At that time, the entire concession belonged to the British, and the British Consul had full power of management. Today's Hongkou area once had an American concession, but in 1863, the British and American concessions merged to form the International Concession, now known as the Public Concession. One of the main reasons for the merger was that the British Concession's police administration was handled conscientiously, and rogues generally considered Hongkou as their area of activity. The British Concession initially had only eight constables, supervised by a head constable. During the Taiping Rebellion, the number of Chinese in the concession increased to about 300,000, so the number of constables was increased to about 200. In 1864, after the Taiping Rebellion was suppressed, many Chinese returned to their hometowns, and the population in the concession decreased to about 70,000. The value of the concession land also fluctuated greatly due to the increase and decrease of residents. Therefore, due to economic difficulties, the number of constables was reduced to 164, all of whom were foreigners. It was not until 1865 that Chinese constables were recruited for the first time. In that year, there were 61 foreign constables and 42 Chinese constables. In 1884, the recruitment of Indian constables began, who patrolled the remote areas of Jing'an Temple Road and Jessfield Road. Since then, the number of police officers has gradually increased. In 1916, 30 Japanese constables were recruited. As of today, the police force has a total of 3,452 Chinese officers, 452 European officers, 555 Indian officers, and 272 Japanese officers. Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life live, so the police administration is an important part of the Public Concession's municipal administration.

It is currently divided into four districts for management, and a special department is set up in the headquarters, with detectives under the supervision of a deputy chief inspector, specializing in handling various political cases, labor strikes, and other matters that may disrupt the security of the concession. The headquarters administration is divided into several specialized departments, such as the transportation department. In addition, there is a special police force in the concession, which is a volunteer group that also patrols. It was established during the European War and assists the regular police in maintaining law and order when needed. Their dedication to public welfare is commendable.

### This City's Radio Station Stopped Broadcasting Yesterday

Petitioning in Beijing

Various radio stations in this city, including Tongle, Zhou Xie Ji, Anding, Shiyin, Huiling, and Xinsheng, were previously ordered by the Ministry of Transportation to stop broadcasting, as reported earlier. These stations believe that they were legally established private enterprises after applying for permission in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Transportation for private radio stations. If there is no violation of the regulations, they should be protected by the government according to law. On February 4, they stated their reasons and submitted another request to the Ministry of Transportation to withdraw the order and promulgate the equipment standards for private radio stations, but they did not receive a reply. Therefore, yesterday (the 27th), all private radio stations stopped broadcasting for one day and sent representatives to Beijing to petition.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

In the February 27th issue of your newspaper, there was a news item in the local news section titled "Liang Shao Liquor Industry Fined, Decided to Hold a General Meeting to Discuss." After investigation, this news item does not conform to the facts of the public association's petition. On the afternoon of February 25th, four representatives of the Liang Shao Liquor Industry Public Association, accompanied by Yuan Hongjun and other staff members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, came to the bureau to petition. At that time, the director of the bureau was in Beijing on official business, so Chief Jiang of the Fourth Section was appointed to meet them. The representatives submitted a written petition, mainly consisting of four points: (1) All Chinese and foreign alcohol factories in this city should be subject to a uniform ex-factory tax and the tax rate should be increased. (2) The inspection should be entrusted to a specialized agency, and the deduction of liquor should be publicly inspected. (3) The original penalties for previously deducted liquors should be revoked, and sampling should be conducted again for chemical inspection. (4) The rules for penalties for adulterated liquors should be revised, and the amount of fines should be reduced. Chief Jiang explained each point one by one. Regarding the first point in the petition, the government is currently conducting diplomatic efforts to address it. Regarding the second point, this bureau is responsible for tax collection and should comply with orders for inspection. The Commodity Inspection Bureau is a government agency for inspecting commodities, and the standards for acidity and alcohol content are based on scientific evidence. Regarding the third point, the penalties for previously deducted liquors have been imposed in accordance with regulations and cannot be arbitrarily revoked by the original official agency. If merchants have sufficient reasons, they can apply for administrative reconsideration and await a decision. There are special provisions in the law that cannot be changed. Regarding the fourth point, the penalty rules for adulterated liquors are stipulated by the Executive Yuan, and this bureau can only comply with and implement them. In summary, none of the points fall within the authority of this bureau. As for the situation of inspectors extorting, arbitrarily deducting, or engaging in private favoritism, the director of the bureau has repeatedly issued orders to strictly prohibit them and allow merchants to report or send them to the bureau at any time, and they will be severely punished in accordance with the law, and no leniency will be shown. The bureau will also maintain the legitimate liquor industry and eliminate corruption. The representatives then bid farewell and left. This letter is specially requested to be published in the "Letter to the Editor" column of your newspaper to clarify the truth, in the spirit of public friendship.

Sincerely,
Secretariat of the Su-Zhe-Wan District Unified Tax Bureau
February 27th

(6) Management of kitchens and firewood and fuel.

(7) Organization of operating areas.

(8) Fixed places for washing, drying, and airing clothes, and concealment of soiled baby cloths.

The above various aspects should be divided into those for each family, for the whole village, or for the public with neighboring villages, to seek proper storage and management, which is the first step in improving the appearance of the village. A further step is the organization of houses and areas.

(1) Exterior of houses: walls, doors and windows, and roofs. If there are any defects, clutter, skewness, damage, they should be corrected and removed at any time. Whether it is a wooden house, tile house, thatched house, or earth house, it must always be complete and new, without any weeds, rotten wood, missing bricks or tiles, peeling plaster, or broken paper or glass.

(2) Interior walls and floors of houses: if there is any dirt, damage, or unevenness, it should be corrected and removed at any time.

(3) Method of arranging objects.

However, to achieve this kind of realm, the resistance is not in external things, but in oneself, that is, one must have considerable ambition and diligence. Without this ambition and diligence, even if there is financial resources, time, and suitable tools, it will not be possible to achieve the slightest success; therefore, what we suffer from is not the lack of financial resources, time, and tools, but the lack of ambition and diligence in our own psychology and limbs. If we can make efforts in psychology and limbs, then everything else is not difficult.

The most urgent aspects of wilderness appearance to be improved are as follows:

(1) Roads and bridges that are damaged or broken should be repaired.

(2) Rivers and harbors that are silted up, and riverbanks that are overgrown with weeds, should be dredged and repaired.

(3) Graves that are broken or exposed coffins, grass coffins. Unburied remains, should be repaired and buried.

(4) Grasslands and forest areas that are overgrown and scattered should be corrected.

(5) Riversides, roadsides, villagesides, gravesides, and other areas that are not suitable for cultivation and have not yet been planted, should be planted with flowers and grasses, and colored forests and shaped forests, etc., to seek beautiful and profitable planting.

(6) Management of agricultural land and non-agricultural land.

(7) Establishment of forests, grasslands, recreation areas, and training grounds for public recreation.

In addition, there are (classes and the order between plant bodies, which are also necessary for village and wilderness appearance. (To be continued)

Therefore, in recent years, there has been a theory in the education field advocating the integration of moral education and teaching, precisely because it recognizes that in the past, educators generally only paid attention to how subjects conformed to regulations and neglected the training of students' moral character and other matters. Moreover, there was a misconception that training matters were the responsibility of the moral education office, and other teachers did not have any responsibility. If this error is not corrected, education is deformed. In recent years, everyone has emphasized moral education and stipulated that military management be implemented in senior high schools and scout management in junior high schools to correct this error, enabling students to cultivate the foundation for being a good person in school. However, this method may encounter difficulties in the initial implementation stage, so today we have specifically convened everyone here to discuss together. In the future, depending on the needs, we will convene two or three times each semester. The results of the meeting will bring the educational administrative authorities and the people who are actually responsible for implementation in various schools together, so that the theory and practice of moral education in secondary schools are consistent, which should greatly help in promoting education and guiding students in their lives.

Leading by Example: (2) In addition to implementing the prescribed plan, the most effective method of moral education is for teachers and students to live together. As the saying goes, "Teaching by example is better than teaching by words," and "Following example leads to compliance, teaching by words leads to disputes." This shows that leading by example is the best method of moral education. Students learn by imitating; students are fundamentally imitating others. Imitation must have a model; teachers are the students' model. Therefore, the moral education director should help the principal and make all faculty and staff understand this meaning, and everyone should lead by example and be a good role model for students. Then, no matter who the students learn from, they can improve without limit and become sound citizens. Therefore, in addition to discussions today, I hope that everyone will make a resolution to take on the responsibility of cultivating students into sound citizens. Then, students in Shanghai's secondary schools will definitely undergo a complete transformation in a short period of time. In recent years, there has been a very good fact to show everyone, that is, Generalissimo Chiang's promotion of the New Life Movement, etc. Not only has Generalissimo Chiang given instructions in words and speeches, but also Generalissimo Chiang's spirit of hard work and the example of actual life have led the people of the whole country in tangible and intangible ways. It can be seen that to teach people, one must demonstrate it in daily life and be a model for everyone.

Active Work: (3) Moral education is not passive work, but active work. In the past, some people thought that the moral education office only managed whether students had faults, such as truancy, leave, demerits, and punishments. Therefore, the moral education office became a court specializing in punishments. Of course, rewards and punishments cannot be avoided, but we must not forget that moral education is originally active work. Confucius said, "Guide them with government policies, regulate them with punishments, and the people will avoid them but have no sense of shame; guide them with virtue, regulate them with ritual, and they will have a sense of shame and also be corrected." This means that in addition to passive maltreatment and punishment, we must take a further step to make people automatically do good. All countries use all possible active methods for youth training. You must also always think about how to actively guide students to do what they should do in addition to passive work. A country has its own needs, and an era has its own needs. Therefore, all national modern facts that meet the needs of the times and the spirit of the times can be used as training materials for students. For example, Generalissimo Chiang's instructions to Zhang and Yang when he left Xi'an are the most practical and greatest civic education materials. In addition, the unified declaration of national salvation recently issued by all sectors of society is also a text to correct people's erroneous thoughts and behaviors. The reason why China has not been able to become a modern country in the past is that the divisive and separatist thoughts within the country have been at play. Although this is gradually changing now, the foundation is not yet solid. Therefore, I hope that the next generation of citizens can break this inferiority and make everyone have a central belief and spirit of unity, so that they can complete the work of creating a modern country. Therefore, we are now opposing division on the one hand, and training students to have a spirit of unity on the other. I hope you will advise the principal to pay attention to the leadership of students' thoughts and actions. Especially important are the Chinese language teachers, whose teaching materials have a significant impact on students, because Chinese language teaching materials contain ideological content. It is absolutely impossible to teach teaching materials that do not meet the needs of the times and the needs of the nation at will, otherwise it will definitely be contrary to the main purpose of training students. Therefore, the principal must carefully review them. All decadent, depressed, and biased materials are not suitable for our country's modern youth's Chinese language teaching materials. I hope that all moral education directors will pay attention to this point. Finally, regarding military management and scout management, the principal is the commander in each method, and the moral education director, military instructors, and scout trainers are deputy commanders or deputy commanders. Therefore, the principal is in charge of everything in the school, and the moral education director and others must cooperate sincerely to help the principal promote and implement them. Whether students' thoughts and behaviors are proper or not, the moral education director helps the school to bear major responsibilities, and all teachers cannot shirk their responsibilities. As an accompanying report, the Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Department are preparing to jointly organize a united association of outstanding students and are preparing to issue honorary awards. This is a method to encourage outstanding students. I hope that all schools will carefully select good students who are excellent in all aspects of character, academics, and physique, and report to the Social Bureau so that young students can be encouraged and strive to improve. Next, Yu Zhongbiao reported on the significance of the review by the moral education director.

Discussion Issues: (1) How to strictly implement military management and scout management to make school life militarized. Resolution: (A) All previous youth training groups or youth training teams in various schools should be cancelled. In the future, this city will generally implement the newly promulgated military management methods and scout management methods. (B) Senior high schools and junior high schools should be managed separately according to the two methods. (C) The division of powers between the moral education director and the military instructor is, in principle, that the military instructor is in charge of technical training (such as field, drill ground, guards, etc.), and the moral education director is in charge of other daily management and spiritual training work. (D) The issue of treatment and moral education work time is currently being drafted in the treatment conditions for moral education directors. (2) How to implement compulsory after-school sports to universalize the physical development of students. Resolution: The moral education director is responsible for discussing with the physical education teachers of each school to formulate detailed methods and implement them thoroughly according to this principle. (3) How to increase group activities for students' academic research and technical practice, such as speech contests and debates in Chinese and English at all levels. Resolution: Supervise and implement them responsibly according to the requirements. (4) How to prohibit middle school students from dancing and smoking cigarettes. Resolution: Joint management by schools and students' parents. (5) How to assess the daily extracurricular homework of day students to promote the normalization of their off-campus life. Resolution: Each school should pay attention to it at any time. (6) How should all students in the school be required to wear uniforms? Resolution: It should start with the principal and moral education director wearing uniforms themselves to lead by example, so that students wear uniforms uniformly. This point should also be notified to all schools by the Social Bureau for compliance. (7) How should students be guided in proper extracurricular entertainment, such as singing teams, drama clubs, and visiting groups? Resolution: Urge implementation. (8) How should students be guided and assessed in research activities and reading materials, such as newspapers and magazines, to increase students' understanding of reality? Resolution: Organize a "Student Reading Material Review and Guidance Committee" within the school for guidance.

### Solicitation for the 20th Anniversary of the Vocational Education Society Opens

The China Vocational Education Society was established in May of the Republic of China year six and has reached its 20th anniversary. They are holding an expanded solicitation, which was previously reported. Yesterday at noon, Chairman Qian Xinzhi of the society and Chief Solicitation Captain Wang Rutang held a public banquet for the captains of various Shanghai city teams at the Pudong Building and held an opening ceremony.

However, this matter relies entirely on the vigorous promotion of all gentlemen. Today, I have prepared a small amount of wine and respectfully invite everyone here to jointly plan the progress. I hope you will give us more advice. I am extremely grateful. He also said that Mr. Wang Rutang has a fever and cold today and cannot participate in the grand event. He asked his younger brother to represent him and apologize. He asked Mr. Jiang Wenyu to report on the recent work of the society.

The report briefly stated that the society has a history of twenty years. Usually, in view of the needs of society, it handles various vocational education undertakings. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into five categories: (1) vocational school education, (2) vocational guidance, (3) vocational supplementary education, (4) rural improvement, (5) labor education. In the past, it has relied entirely on the support of leaders from all walks of life and has made some contributions to society. In the future, it hopes that leaders from all walks of life will provide more supervision and guidance so that the original cause can advance with the times. This solicitation is not only to help in terms of material, but also to give more support in terms of spirit. Subsequently, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Mu Ouchu, Li Dachao, and other gentlemen gave speeches one after another, with many words of encouragement. They dispersed happily until 4 PM.

### Both Sino-Western Football Games Postponed Due to Rain Yesterday, Pinghan Will Fight Lau Yier Today

At 3 PM at Shenyuan Football Field

Donghua Will Fight L克斯 in the City Center District

After the Pinghan Railway Football Team came to Shanghai, they originally wanted to challenge the strong Sino-Western teams to gain benefits from others. Unfortunately, the Shanghai teams were too busy with two inter-port and league games to cope with the visiting team. The Sports Association only scheduled a game between Lau Yier and today at 3 PM at Shenyuan. The referee is Shen Huichun, and the linesmen are Lü Changfu and Hail. The strength of the British army can be called the best of the time, and Pinghan has strong armor and soldiers. At the time of the competition, there will be a wonderful performance. The lineups of the two teams are listed on the left.

Today's Sino-Western Football, Donghua vs. L克斯, will be played in the city center district. The strength of both teams is quite substantial. There will be a fierce battle at the time. It is a pity that Li Ning and Jia Gongliang of Donghua will not play, which will inevitably detract from it. The referee is Chen Jixiang, and the linesmen are Ma Liesi and He Chunhui.

Also, the Morning League, Jinde vs. Jewish, will be played at 12:30 PM in the third field of Hongkou Park. The referee is Tan Xi. This is Jinde's last time. The championship has been won by Jinde.

Yesterday afternoon, the game between French Business and Lau Yier was suddenly postponed due to rain, so the great game had to wait for another day. The battle between Jinan and Western Police and the three games of the China Association yesterday were also postponed uniformly.

The situation of the Sino-Western League A Group is as follows:

### Jinnan Lost to Xintong 31 to 26

Jinnan Lost 16 Points in the First Half Due to Abnormal Performance

Intensified Work in the Second Half Resulted in a Loss of 5 Points

The Sino-Western basketball giants Jinan and Xintong fought as a prelude to the Sino-American international match yesterday at Shenyuan. Xintong has the help of Pihesi, the famous guard of the American West Coast All-Star Team, and Locke, the god of Maling, so its strength is very strong. Xintong in the Sino-Western League is another face. Jinan was too careful, and its performance was abnormal in the first half, resulting in the largest difference, lagging behind by as much as 16 points. Fortunately, it gradually recovered in the second half, changing to the fastest tactics, and the defense was extremely tight, so that Pihesi and Carson had no room for activity at all, and the points increased frequently. Unfortunately, due to too much loss in the first half, it still lost by five points with a score of 31 to 26. In the game yesterday, Jinan had many chances to win in the second half. In the future international matches, if our Chinese team can fight with fast tactics, the hope of victory is very strong. Moreover, in addition to the thick team, the United States will lack a Pihesi. Zhang Guoxun was absent from yesterday's game and was judged by Shi Zhaokang and Qu Xilin. Not long after the jump ball, Lan Yin was fined for a foul. It was a pity that Kuang Yaoya's execution was off and the opportunity to open the record was lost. Before long, Carson Pihesi scored two goals in a row, and Xintong took the lead with four points. Jinan called a timeout. After the exchange of fire, Wang Nanzhen rushed in alone and put it into the basket, becoming two to four. However, Carson scored again, and Kuang and Wang lost good opportunities due to being too impatient. Then, Yin Guiren scored one point for Fosite's foul. Pihesi made a wonderful move again, and Locke took the old method of dragging people, and the score became ten to three. Jinan called a timeout for the second time, but because it was eager to win, the shooting was abnormal. Cai Yanxiong and Kuang Yaoya lost it too easily, and the angle was skewed. After Locke Lan Yin increased to fourteen to three, Yin Guiren's free throw also missed. Then, Cai Yanxiong got a wonderful pass from Yin Guiren and threw it in from the sideline with one hand, which was normal. However, the luck of the ball was not good after all. Wang Yin Kuang made five shots, all skimming over the circle, while Xintong scored two shots from Pihesi and two free throws from Locke, and the score increased to twenty to five. Jinan called a timeout for the third time. Cai Yanxiong was also penalized by Locke for a foul, making it twenty-one to five, which was the most suspenseful score of yesterday's game. Jinan rose up to besiege. Kuang Yaoya scored with a zero-distance ball from Nanzhen's supply. Nanzhen also made a long shot, and the score at the end of the first half was twenty-one to nine, and Jinan was still lagging behind by twelve points. At the beginning of the second half, Jinan gradually saw a turning point. Cai Yanxiong first scored one point due to Locke's foul. Yin Guiren broke out of the encirclement and chased it to twelve to twenty-one with one hand on the sideline. At this time, the situation gradually became tense. Wang Nanzhen's long shot missed, and Kuang Yaoya's free throw also missed. Carson and Pihesi were also monitored too strictly by Jinan, and the shooting was also continuously skewed. The front line was calm at times. After a slight pause, Han Zhenyuan scored with a backhand hit with Kuang Yaoya's wonderful pass, fourteen to twenty-one, lagging behind by only seven points. Then Pihesi shot from the side and hit the target. Xintong scored for the first time since the beginning of the second half. After Jinan called a timeout for the fourth time, it changed to a fast attack method. Han Zhenyuan scored with a long shot, but Locke returned the favor in the same way, still nine points behind (twenty-five to sixteen). Before long, Wang Nanzhen made two miraculous achievements, suddenly becoming twenty to twenty-five, and the difference was only two and a half balls, which made Xintong have to request a timeout. There were still eight minutes left at this time. Lan Yin secretly waited under the basket with the old method and put in a goal, but Cai Yanxiong recovered the lost ground in the same way with a long shot. Unexpectedly, Locke got two shots from Carson and Lan Yin and put them into the basket. The score suddenly increased to thirty-one to twenty-two. Therefore, Jinan called out the fifth timeout. Sure enough, the brilliant plan was more stringent in defense. After Xintong lost the opportunity under the basket in Locke Lan Yin, it changed to a planned fighting method, but it could not prevent Jinan's activity. It was a pity that after Kuang Yaoya and Han Zhenyuan scored one after another, the gong rang loudly. Jinan finally lost miserably by twenty-six to thirty-one due to too much loss in the first half.

### Silk Yarn

The Yarn Market Sees Another Sharp Decline

Inventories Rise Gradually in All Factories

Rumors of Profiteering in Large Purchases

Third-Grade Yarn Also Approaches the 40 Yuan Mark

The yarn market has turned weak, and the trend of falling prices has resumed. This is mainly because inventories at various factories are expected to gradually increase. At the same time, the price of third-grade yarn has broken through the 240 yuan mark. As a result, sellers are unusually active. Regarding the large quantities of spot yarn purchased by multiple parties, although they are trying their best to sell them in the market, due to the large quantity, it is not easy to sell them all at once. Therefore, most people are psychologically inclined to sell. One firm is frequently going short, with Chang Feng entering in the morning and exiting in the afternoon in substantial quantities. Geng Feng also shows signs of going short. As a result, the market cannot hold, and there is frequent trading between long and short positions, with a significant increase in chips. The future is likely to be volatile.

Standard Yarn Drops Three Yuan

The standard yarn market opened lower across all months, with a sharp decline and a sense of panic. Rumors circulated that the goods purchased by multiple parties were being profited from. Geng Feng, on behalf of a certain firm, massively went short. At the same time, Osaka third-grade yarn also fell sharply, breaking through the 40 yuan mark. As a result, confidence weakened further, and selling pressure intensified. The market continued to decline. Only Chang Feng and Da Chang worked hard to buy, but trading in standard yarn became quiet. As a result of the standard yarn market, all months fell by 2.6 to 3.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market recovered slightly in the afternoon, due to profit-taking. However, Chang Feng suddenly engaged in wholesale selling, loosening the market. By the closing, it suddenly fell, and the momentum remained weak. As a result of the standard yarn market, March rose by 0.7 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and distant months fell by 0.4 yuan. Chang Feng bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon, selling 4,350 bales to Geng Feng, 1,900 bales to He Xing, 1,400 bales to Sen Kang, 1,150 bales to Ren Feng, 1,650 bales to Yuan Yi, 3,500 bales to Da Chang Cheng, 1,300 bales to Run Kang, 1,900 bales to Tong He, and 1,000 bales to Ji Feng. It bought 2,250 bales from Ming De, 1,000 bales from Tong Fu, 1,050 bales from Cheng Ji, 1,900 bales from Heng Yi, 1,850 bales from Da Feng, 2,150 bales from Rui Da, 1,150 bales from Heng De, 1,450 bales from Tai Chang, 1,200 bales from Yi Chang, 4,650 bales from Da Chang, and 2,400 bales from Yong Da. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Sales Remain Good

According to statistics, various guilds bought a total of 1,534 bales yesterday, with prices falling by 1-2 yuan. The purchase amounts of various guilds are as follows:

Cotton Prices Remain Relatively Stable

Speculative Target is Cotton Yarn

However, Industry Insiders are Bearish

The cotton market was affected by the yarn market and also fell, but the decline was not as sharp as in the yarn market because its base price was lower than that of yarn. The speculative target is also concentrated on cotton yarn. Only a portion of industry insiders are waiting for lower prices because cotton stocks from various regions have not been shipped out.

The standard cotton market opened lower across all months, following the yarn market, with a very weak sentiment. There were many sellers, and the market could not hold. Although American and Indian cotton continued to rise, confidence was difficult to boost. It is said that cotton stocks in the interior are abundant, industry insiders are bearish, and there is heavy pressure. As a result of the standard cotton market, all months fell by 0.3 to 0.35 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market turned firm in the afternoon as those who made a profit offset their positions. The price gradually rose in small increments. However, by the closing, the market suddenly fell due to the weakness of the yarn market. As a result, the current month rose by 0.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and distant months fell by 0.05 yuan. It was found that Heng Yi sold 2,000 dan, Ji Feng 1,400 dan, Ju Xing 2,000 dan, Yu Da 5,800 dan, Ming De 4,300 dan, Zhen Da 1,400 dan, Geng Feng 9,000 dan, Shen Da 3,900 dan, Sen Kang 4,000 dan, Feng Tai 1,600 dan, Da Chang Cheng 3,700 dan, Run Kang 2,000 dan, Yong Da 3,800 dan, and Heng Chang 1,700 dan. It bought 7,400 dan from Yi Chang, 7,500 dan from Xin Cheng, 2,000 dan from Xin Hua, 3,800 dan from Xin Chang, 2,000 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, 3,800 dan from Chang He, 3,400 dan from Yuan Yi, 2,600 dan from Wang Tai Xing, 5,000 dan from Ren Feng, 2,200 dan from Da Feng, 3,400 dan from Da Fu, and 1,700 dan from He Xing. A comparison of the market prices for the day is shown below.

Yarn Inventory Exceeds 30,000 Bales

Cause of Recent Sharp Drop in Yarn Prices

Recently, the Indian firms at the Chinese Silk and Cotton Exchange have been squeezing the February contracts aggressively. Short sellers have been releasing large quantities of spot yarn, and yarn inventories in warehouses have been increasing daily. Although long positions have been trying to sell, inventories are still at 30,130 bales by the end of this month. Therefore, the yarn market has been falling sharply recently. Among the inventories, Jin Cheng has the largest quantity of 10-count coarse yarn, with 4,930 bales, and Wu Fu has 300 bales of 20-count yarn. These two brands have the largest inventories, which is putting significant pressure on the yarn market. The details are excerpted below (unit: bales):

American Cotton Industry Inclined to Buy

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. Industry insiders bought near-month contracts, Liverpool bought new cotton, and brokers also bought a considerable amount. All short selling and long position liquidations were absorbed, and prices rose by 1 to 5 points. After the Liverpool market closed, there was a brief correction, but the trend remained firm. Later, industry insiders covered their short positions in March, and prices rose again. Due to strong spot cotton prices and rising wartime material prices, market sentiment favored the buyers. The closing was stable, with spot prices rising by 7 points, March contracts rising by 1 to 12 points, British cotton spot prices rising by 2 points, and futures falling by 1 to 3 points. The Indian cotton market was active. It was initially weak due to profit-taking by Japanese and mainland traders, but recovered due to buying and short-covering by futures traders. As a result, Ping Guo Er rose or fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 1 to 1.75 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 1.75 to 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 26th).

According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 27th was Bai Luoxi at 224 rupees, down 0.75 rupees, Aomula at 205.5 rupees, down 0.5 rupees, and Ping Guo Er at 178.5 rupees, down 0.25 rupees.

Osaka Yarn Market Falls in Both Spot and Futures

According to a telegram from Osaka on the 27th, spot yarn prices fell by 2-3 yuan. 16-count Fan Mian was at 228 yuan, unchanged. 20-count Jin Yu was at 246 yuan, down 2 yuan. 40-count Wu Xing was at 380 yuan, down 3 yuan. 42-count Zhi Zi was at 370 yuan, unchanged. Third-grade yarn futures fell by 2-4 yuan, with near-month contracts at 238.5 yuan and distant-month contracts at 240.7 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan, with near-month contracts at 74.6 yuan and distant-month contracts at 75.85 yuan.

### Piece Goods

More Merchants Displaying Woolen Fabrics at Teahouses

There has been significant progress in wool and woolen fabrics recently. Spring sales are timely, and efforts are being made from all directions. Sales of broadcloth for Chinese clothing, door-to-door shop sales have improved, and thick broadcloth, Harris homespun, and durable checkered fabrics are selling even more. Wholesale stores and foreign firms specializing in the sale of domestic goods, such as the Lian Yi Company, a joint venture of domestic firms, are bustling with activity. The business of fabric wholesalers is increasing. More merchants are displaying goods at teahouses such as the Gong Yi Hui, Yi Lin Chun, and Chang Le Le Yuan. The current market situation is better than in previous years, and buyers are more willing to purchase, with less bargaining. Banks and money shops are also lending more easily than last year, and the sentiment for rising prices is even stronger.

### Finance

Gold Market Recovers Slightly

The gold market initially rose slightly yesterday due to a slight increase in overseas silver markets and continued exchange rate declines. London spot gold rose by 0.5 pence. The Central Bank's listed prices were unchanged for both British and American currencies, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price rose to 1156.8 yuan. Although confidence was stable, buyers were unwilling to raise prices excessively, making it difficult to complete transactions. Opposing parties only emerged at 9:35 AM. The market opened slightly higher in the morning, but transactions became even rarer after opening. The market weakened after the initial rise. The result was a recovery of only 0.2 yuan. Yesterday, call options were offered by long positions at 0.3 yuan and 0.25 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:

Morning Opening: 55.5 yuan, up 0.3 yuan from the previous close. Sheng Yuan, Yong Heng Chang, and Yong Lai entered. The silver balance tax rose by 0.25, gradually rising to 5.5 yuan. Xiang He and Tong Feng took advantage of the high prices to supply, and Da Feng Heng also sold to square their positions. Later, Yu Xin Xiang and Li Feng showed some selling interest. Although there were no formal transactions, the afternoon closing retreated to 1155.4 yuan, with only 0.2 yuan fluctuation in the first half of the day. The result was a recovery of 0.2 yuan.

The closing price was 1156.8 yuan, as the Central Bank's standard gold price rose. In terms of the closing price, it was about 1 yuan higher. The spot market was stable. Cooked gold was sold by Da Feng Heng at 50 taels, priced at 15 yuan extra. The buying price was 12 yuan extra, and Tianjin goods were 14 yuan extra, but no transactions were made. Recent sources are limited, with only a small amount arriving from Sichuan, and several hundred taels were purchased by spot dealers at 12 yuan extra. Yesterday, call options were offered by long positions Heng Yu at 200 options at a rate of 0.25 yuan and short position Cheng Da, Yuan Mao, and Yong each at 200 options at a rate of 0.3 yuan

Very few transactions were made in the market. In summary, Heng Chang, Yong Sheng Yuan, and Yong slightly entered, while Xiang He, Tong Feng Yu, and Da Feng Heng sold slightly. The total volume for the first half of the day was 525 options.

Regarding the options for March that have not yet been rolled over, the long positions are Qing Fa Yong at 1,100 options, Chun Yuan Yong Sheng Yuan Yong at 200 options, and Tong Feng Heng Ding Kang at 100 options each. The short positions are Heng Yu at 500 options, Jing Fu at 300 options, Fu Wen Yong Yuan Mao Yong Qia Feng Yong at 200 options, and Run Chang Yu Da De Cheng at 100 options.

The total number is 3,899 options, with 27 long positions and 12 short positions.

Sassoon Aggressively Selling Spot Shillings

HSBC Maintaining Prices

The foreign exchange market saw Sassoon aggressively selling spot shillings, making the process even more difficult. The morning began with overseas telegrams reporting that London big bars, both near and distant, rose by 0.0625. The New York silver market remained unchanged. Forward silver prices in Monte Carlo rose slightly, by 0.001 to 0.006. London spot gold rose by 0.5 pence. British pounds fell by 0.02 against the US dollar, rose by 0.04 against the French franc, and remained unchanged against the Japanese yen. The US dollar fell by 0.01875 against the British pound, fell by 0.05625 against the French franc, and fell by 0.02 against the Japanese yen. The Central Bank's listed prices were unchanged for both British and American currencies, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.59375 for British pounds and 29.6875 yuan for US dollars, which was flat for British pounds and tightened by 0.03125 for US dollars compared to the previous closing. After opening, HSBC listed prices remained flat for both British and American currencies, and the silver balance tax rose by 0.025. However, due to the efforts of Sassoon and others to aggressively sell spot shillings, the process loosened, and banks were not actively taking positions. This was mainly because the British government issued huge national defense bonds, which inevitably dampened confidence. HSBC took advantage of the low prices to maintain the pound price, and finally stabilized slightly. The afternoon closing saw near-term selling prices of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.625 for British pounds and 29.75 yuan for US dollars, which was looser by 0.03125 for British pounds and tighter by 0.03125 for US dollars compared to the previous closing. The same was true for forward prices. Chinese merchants slightly took on a small number of shillings, while Western merchants, Sassoon, aggressively sold a large number of spot shillings. The transaction prices for the first half of the day are recorded below:

British pounds opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.59375. Zhejiang Shanghai took spot goods at 0.625. Sassoon sold to HSBC, Li Feng, Citibank, and Mai Jiali in the same month at 0.59375 and 0.625. The closing selling prices were 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.625 for spot goods, 0.59375 for March, and 0.5625 for April. The buying price was 0.03125 extra. The transaction volume was approximately 80,000 pounds.

US dollars opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 29.6875 yuan. Foreign firms sold to Mai Jiali spot goods at 0.8125. Citibank took on February contracts at 0.78125. HSBC filled February contracts at 0.75. The closing selling prices were 29.75 yuan for spot goods, 29.6875 yuan for March, 29.625 yuan for April, and 29.5625 yuan for May. The buying price was 0.0625 extra. The transaction volume was approximately 100,000 yuan.

Eastern currencies were sold by Zheng Jin and Joseon to the Dalian gang at a spot price of 104 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 200,000 yuan.

Yesterday, HSBC took British pounds and filled US dollars at 4 yuan, 8 jiao, and 8.5 fen for February contracts.

The forward exchange rate for imports and exports for four months also loosened yesterday, with British pounds at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.8125 and US dollars at 30 yuan.

### Securities

Government Bonds Fluctuate in a Small Range

Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange market was still fluctuating. Class A bonds remained lifeless. No. 35 continued to sell, so the market could not rise. Even if the long positions wanted to take action, they were hesitant. After a period of fluctuation, the market still showed no signs of improvement. If it wants to rise, it must first show signs of improvement. Otherwise, it will be difficult to fluctuate in a small range. Yesterday, No. 35 and No. 77 continued to sell, and confidence remained weak, causing a uniform decline of 0.15 to 0.35 yuan. No. 43 bought quite a bit, slightly raising the market price. The market price rose and fell accordingly, and the market price rose by 0.15 to 0.45 yuan. However, Class A bonds only improved slightly by about 0.1 yuan. The market was stronger in the afternoon, with retail buying stronger. Class D bonds rose the most in the near term, by 0.45 yuan, while the rest rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. At the closing, No. 4 suddenly needed bonds, raising the price of Class B bonds by 0.3 yuan, and the rest also continued to improve by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. As a result, the market price has rebounded by 0.15 to 0.5 yuan, except for No. 96, which fell slightly by 0.05 yuan. The total transaction volume was 7.37 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Grains

Settlement of Flour, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains

Yesterday was the settlement date for February flour contracts. The actual settlement quantity was only 8,000 bags, including 7,000 bags of Changzhou Heng Feng Green Lion and 1,000 bags of Ningbo Tai Feng Green Shepherd Boy. It is said that more than 50,000 bags were settled outside the exchange, all of which were handled by the street and customers. If the standard is appropriate and customers take positions, the market may become active again, otherwise it will be difficult to expect activity.

The total settlement quantity for February wheat contracts was 81 carts. In terms of delivery, No. 5 delivered 32 carts, No. 6 delivered 2 carts, No. 19 delivered 8 carts, No. 26 delivered 10 carts, No. 36 delivered 2 carts, No. 23 delivered 26 carts, and No. 41 delivered 1 cart. The receivers were No. 1 at 25 carts, No. 28 at 15 carts, and No. 43 at 41 carts. Most of it was handled by Tianjin Shou Feng. Yesterday, the spot wheat market remained calm. Kaiyang River wheat was priced at 6.61 yuan, and Tiantai wheat was priced at 6.55 yuan, totaling 1,100 bags, which were handled by Shen Da.

For the February settlement of miscellaneous grains, wheat was the most traded, but there were also some soybean cakes, soybeans, and sesame seeds. The total quantity was 24 carts of soybeans, 800 tons of sesame seeds, 9,000 pieces of soybean cake, and 1,300 dan of soybean oil. The soybeans were taken by factories, and the rest were distributed by customers in the street.

Ke Xian Rice Sales Are Smooth

Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market was strong overall, but with vigorous sales to Guangdong, the market slightly rose. The street also actively took positions. The total daily transaction volume was 12,000-13,000 bags. However, sales to Shantou, Xiamen, the Northern Seas, and the Northwest remained sluggish. However, the Cantonese market was sufficient to maintain the market. If the arrival of goods decreases in the future and the Cantonese market remains strong, then the market can gradually improve. Otherwise, with the strong arrival of goods, it will be difficult for the market to improve in the future. The total daily shipments included 6,700 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,040 bags of Hunan rice, 1,400 bags of Shahan rice, and 1,767 bags of Wen Yong rice.

Shanghai South Rice Market Slightly Tight

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various guilds received a total of more than 20 shipments, with about 5,000 dan of goods. There were more than 10 shipments of thin rice. The continuous cloudy and rainy weather stabilized confidence. Although local sales were sluggish, taking positions did not move, and the situation seemed to remain tight. As a result, thick rice prices were good, and thin rice did not see much improvement or decline. The same was true for early rice. Du Yang Jian was stable, but with an oversupply of Yin Yuan, the market was uniquely weak.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday morning, the weather was cloudy and rainy, and there were few boats arriving from the river. Due to the limited supply from various shops, the market was unusually quiet. The spot market price of white rice was a small fraction of a cent, early rice followed with a small 0.05-0.06, thin rice was soft, and Yang Du Jian rice was about 0.04 to 0.05. The rest of the market was weak.

### Silk and Tea

Silk Trading Returns to Quiet

Yesterday, the overseas silk market saw another decline. New York Daiwa silk prices each fell by 0.02 per pound. Near and distant month standard silk futures also fell by 0.02. Domestic and foreign market sentiment weakened again. Western merchants in Shanghai deliberately pushed down silk prices, causing silk trading to become quiet again. White filature silk saw little trading. Xin Fu slightly purchased dried Tussah silk, such as Jin Niao, at a price of 681.25 yuan, down 3.25 yuan from before, with only 15 dan sold. The user silk market saw little trading and tended to be sluggish. The current market price for ordinary B-grade silk is 740 yuan, but there have been no transactions.

### North-South Goods

Daylily Market Shows Weakness

Recently, the daylily market has seen strong shipments to Guangdong, and the market is loosening. Yesterday, 31 packages of Xuzhou daylilies were opened, priced at 26 yuan, down more than 1 yuan from before. In addition, 300 packages of Bozhou red dates were opened, priced at 9 yuan, and 218 packages of chicken heart red dates were opened, priced at 8.5 yuan. The market was stable.

### Review of American Economic Conditions and Raw Silk Consumption (I)

— Wang Tianyu

(I) Introduction

The United States is the largest consumer of raw silk in the world. Since the European War, following the crowning of the gold country, not only did the world's economic center gently shift to the United States, but also the silk weaving industry in the textile industry, as well as the raw silk distribution market, moved from Europe to the New World. This is the same as the current world's raw silk production, which must first be attributed to Japan. According to the statistics of the New York Commodities Exchange, in the five years from 1930 to 1934, the amount of raw silk consumed in the United States accounted for more than 80% of the total amount consumed in the world (accounting for 87% in 1930, 90% in 1931, 83% in 1932, 83% in 1933, and 80% in 1934), approximately 560,000 bales. Because of the huge consumption, the amount of silk stored and consumed in the United States has the closest relationship with the price of raw silk in the world market. In other words, the key to silk prices is American consumption.

In recent years, due to the world's economic panic, the amount of silk used in the United States has been decreasing year by year. However, in the second half of the year before last (1935), due to the gradual recovery of the American economy and the result of Japan's production reduction, the consumption and price of raw silk both had an upward trend, and the impact was also reflected in the Chinese silk market. I had a more detailed description in my article "The Silk Industry in the Past Year" this year. (See Shen Bao in January 25th) Since last year (1936), there have often been very contradictory news about silk prices and silk sales. Not only are the Shen Xin Shi Shi and other newspapers in Shanghai reporting different records in the same day's commercial and economic news, but even the same newspaper inevitably publishes conflicting news after an interval of one or two days. As a result, the general practitioners are asking how the American economic situation affects the silk market? Can prices and sales rise in the same proportion as the American economic situation? Or is the relationship very small? This point is different for everyone. Even in Japan, which has been researching this issue, there are extremely contradictory opinions. For example, Mr. Yamamoto Qingzao believes that the American economic situation has improved based on the increase in the American economic index and the increase in production, and therefore believes that the raw silk situation will improve. Mr. Shimojo Hideo is based on the American consumption boom and has great hopes for the consumption of raw silk; he believes that American consumption has shifted from direct consumption to durable consumption; therefore, raw silk can maintain or continue its good situation, and there is hope for a further upward trend. However, economic scholars specializing in sericulture, such as Inoue Keizo and Kojima Seiichi, are opponents of optimism. Mr. Inoue once based his pessimism about raw silk on the limping nature of the American economic situation in "Sericulture." He also expressed the same view in the Yomiuri Evening News on October 4 last year. And in the Chugai Commercial News on November 10 and the recent Sericulture News, we can also see Mr. Kojima Seiichi's endorsement of Mr. Inoue's view. They all believe that the American economic situation is the steel economic situation, which is a phenomenon under the extreme expansion of heavy industry, and is a limping locality. Therefore, there is a danger of making a historical mistake by analyzing and speculating on the consumption trends of raw silk based on the steel economic situation. Here, on the one hand, I want to analyze the recent consumption situation in the United States based on the relationship between the American economic situation and raw silk, based on numbers. On the other hand, I want to observe the impact on China and Japan, the world's two largest raw silk suppliers, from the number of American raw silk consumption by country, and the trends generated by this impact. I hope that readers will provide guidance!

(II) A Bird's-Eye View of the American Economic Situation

First of all, what we need to understand is the rising state of the American economy. However, due to space limitations, I only want to give a general overview here. We know that the American presidential election. Mr. Roosevelt won an absolute majority of votes, defeating his political enemy Landon, setting a new record for American presidential elections. This is not a coincidence. This phenomenon seems to be a political relationship on the surface, but if we think about it carefully, we will find that it is completely tied to the economy. In fact, before the election, the general stability of the economic circle and the continuation of its good situation were unprecedented good phenomena before the past presidential elections. From this economic stability, it has also been possible to determine that Mr. Luo will win. Therefore, the improvement of the American economic situation is the main reason for Mr. Luo's victory. The first is based on the comprehensive economic index of the analyst (Analyst). After the lowest in February and August last year (with normal Normal 1924 as 100), it rose in a straight line in half a year, crossing the so-called summer slump. Since July, it has broken through 100, reaching a height above 100 in September last year, while the same period last year was only 86:

American Economic Index in 1936 (1924 — 100)

Secondly: Such as the steel industry operating index, which is always regarded as a barometer of the economic situation, and the average price of industrial stocks have all risen. Other increases in investment and the rise in production and consumption indices are sufficient to explain the economic recovery in the United States. Even the devaluation of the franc and the collapse of the gold standard group, as well as the turmoil in the European political situation, did not show any adverse effects. Therefore, the National City Bank Monthly Report published the following words in its October issue (general idea):

"There are many things that can be optimistic about from the business reports in various aspects of the country, and at least it can be believed that it is the current economic phenomenon. Such as the increase in employment in the industrial sector, the increase in farmers' income, the increase in government financial expenditures, and the increase in dividends from industrial companies are all signs of smooth economic progress. Although the bad materials that prevent the economic situation from improving, such as financial instability, tax increase instability, and the pressure of improper competition from state-owned enterprises, have not been completely eliminated; At least it must be considered that the economic situation has advanced to another stage." (To be continued)

Shen Bao Children's Special

### Overthrowing "Starting Tomorrow" Begins Today

— Wang Shouqiu

"Starting tomorrow"—these words are truly the worst. Yet, most children have this thought. In fact, it's not just children; even adults are like this. For example, when preparing to do homework, they think: "I'll play for one more day today, and start tomorrow!" Originally, delaying one day is not a big deal. But today there is a tomorrow, and tomorrow there is another tomorrow. The word "tomorrow" is forever present. If we think today, "Let's start tomorrow," but when tomorrow arrives, we still think, "Let's start tomorrow!" One tomorrow after another, the courage and determination, even great future endeavors, will be ruined by these words, "starting tomorrow." Just imagine: how regrettable and lamentable this is!

In the past, Da Yu spoke of cherishing every inch of time. Later, Tao Kan also said: "Da Yu was a sage, and he still cherished every inch of time. We should cherish every minute of time." This means that even a short minute of time should be cherished. All you children, ancient sages and virtuous people all cherished every inch and minute. How much more should we cherish an entire day? Therefore, I advise you children, if you have made a decision about anything, you must have the courage to start today! Furthermore, we must complete today's tasks today, and never expect to do them tomorrow. You must know that after tomorrow, there is always another tomorrow!

### The Motives of Great Inventors

— Cao Yixuan

The motives behind many great inventions that benefit all of humanity are actually quite strange. Yet, ordinary things, when seen by intelligent people, are contemplated and studied diligently. Dull people cannot do this. Now, let me tell you the motives of several great inventors: (1) Watt saw a teapot lid shaking from the steam of boiling water, and invented the steam engine. (2) Galileo, at the age of eighteen, visited a monastery and saw lanterns hanging in the courtyard swaying, and invented the pendulum for clocks. (3) Bronal saw shipworms boring holes into the planks of ships, and sailors coating the ship's hull with liquid. He pondered this and invented the underground railway. (4) Fulton, at the age of fourteen, sat by a small rowboat, playing with the water with his feet, and the boat moved forward. He was amazed and asked: "Why does the boat move forward?" He carefully studied it and invented the steamboat, and later the submarine. (5) Brown saw spiders constantly drawing silk to make webs from one side to the other and conceived the idea of a giant suspension bridge. (6) Walter-Hunf lost a button from his raincoat on a snowy day. He used a piece of wire, bending it to hold the front of his raincoat, walking and thinking all the way, and later invented the safety pin. (7) Garbane saw the corpse of a frog near a generator, grasped a metal wire, and saw it shake when electricity was generated, and thus invented an electroscope. (8) Lennuchik walked past a lumberyard and saw a boy quietly rubbing one end of a piece of wood with an iron nail. Another boy at the other end could hear the sound of the nail rubbing. He stood still and pondered, and thus invented the stethoscope. (9) Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and suddenly realized that thunder was the discharge of electricity in the air, and invented the lightning rod. (10) Geenna heard a milkmaid say: "After I have cowpox, I will be immune to smallpox in the future." Indeed, he invented the method of inoculation. (11) Wataman was originally a small insurance company clerk. One day, ink dripped from his pen, staining valuable books. He thought of a way to prevent ink from leaking and invented the fountain pen. (12) Ripman went out one day and forgot to bring an eraser for pencil marks. Later, he often made mistakes and found it very difficult. So he thought of a method of embedding an eraser on the end of a pencil. (13) Monre was a very poor employee of a flower shop. One day, he carelessly broke a very expensive flowerpot. Later, he thought of using wire mesh and adding cement to make very hard steel-reinforced flowerpots, which is the origin of the steel-reinforced concrete used in building large Western-style houses today. (14) Gillette was a company diplomat. Because he had important business to attend to, he didn't shave his beard and felt the inconvenience of shaving equipment. Later, he invented the safety razor. (15) Gim saw a woman sitting on a park bench, holding a mirror in her left hand, applying powder with her right hand, and also combing her hair. He felt that women's makeup was very troublesome. Later, the woman carelessly dropped the mirror on the ground, breaking it into pieces. He felt even more the inconvenience of the tools, and later came up with the idea of a very convenient handbag.

### Sponges

— Zhongmei

After the three-week winter vacation, Xiao Min organized the homework he had completed during the vacation to prepare to submit it to the teacher. So, he spent the remaining time playing basketball in the school gymnasium with several friends. After more than three quarters of an hour, his clothes were soaked with sweat, and his body was very tired. So, he took a towel and clothes to the bathroom to take a bath. He took out two sponges he had just bought in the store. One was brushed with soap and rubbed all over his body. The other he held in his hand to look at carefully. It was yellow in color and had many small holes of different sizes. So, he said to a friend next to him: "Brother Yong, why are there so many holes on this sponge? Were they carved by someone?"

"Brother Min, you are so silly. If it was carved by someone, that would be extremely troublesome. The many holes on it are their tiny skeletons."

"What is the overall shape of a sponge?" Xiao Min asked unconvinced:

"Their overall shape is roughly like a teapot, and they are attached to the reefs in the ocean. There is a large cavity at the top, without any respiratory organs, circulatory organs, etc., and the body is very soft. These are their skeletons. Because there are many small holes everywhere, they are connected to the large cavity at the top. In the places they pass through, there are fine hairs that can swing freely. So, water enters through the holes, and they take in tiny, weak animals in the water. This entire system is called the flagellated chamber."

"Then what are the different types and what are their characteristics?"

"There are about three types: (1) Glass sponges: their skeletons contain glass, which can be made into decorations. (2) Calcareous sponges: their skeletons contain calcium carbonate. (3) Fiber sponges: because their skeletons are very soft, they can be used for bathing. They have three characteristics: (1) Their reproduction has two types: division reproduction or budding reproduction. (2) They often gather together in large numbers, forming tree-like shapes, growing on reefs in the ocean. (3) The body wall is thick and has many holes, capturing food by the inflow and outflow of water."

### Why Isn't a Whale a Fish?

— Junqi

Children! You must be wondering about my statement, how can I say that a whale is not a fish? Isn't that a contradiction? Moreover, how can something living in the ocean not be a fish? Children, don't be anxious. After you listen to my explanation, you will immediately understand your initial mistaken notion, falling for the literal meaning!

Originally, animals that swim in the water are not necessarily fish. There are all kinds of creatures in the water. The whale is a type of mammal that lives in the water. We only need to compare it with fish to immediately know that it is different from fish: fish have a gill cover behind their heads, with red, comb-like structures called gills underneath for breathing. Whales breathe with lungs. Fish have scales on their bodies, whales do not. Fish have vertically flattened tail fins, while whales have horizontally flattened tail fins. There is one point that can most clearly distinguish whales from fish: baby whales are nourished with milk from mammary glands on their bodies, while fish are hatched from eggs! Animals that nourish their young with milk like humans are called mammals; therefore, whales are mammals and not fish.

Whales live in the water because their bodies are heavy and unsuitable for life on land. So, they live in the ocean, using the buoyancy of the water to float their bodies on the surface of the water, making it easier to move and survive. Because they don't need feet, they have degenerated into fins, like fish, which are used to adapt and help the tail swim and balance the body.

Children! Now you must understand that I did not speak wrongly. Whales are indeed not fish!

### Making Your Own Correction Fluid

— Bairen

When writing with a fountain pen on paper, sometimes you write the wrong word, and it is not easy to erase with a rubber eraser. Carelessly, the paper is torn by the eraser. Therefore, using a rubber eraser to erase ink is not a good method. Here, let me tell you children about a very effective kind of liquid that does not damage the paper and is very easy to make yourself.

Please go to the pharmacy yourself and buy two things: one is called potassium permanganate, and the other is called oxalic acid. The former is a solid red, and the latter is a liquid. Dissolve the potassium permanganate in water and store it in a bottle. Dissolve a very small amount of oxalic acid in another bottle, and then you can use it.

When using it, you use a glass rod (or a thin bamboo stick) to first dip some of the red potassium permanganate and apply it to the wrong word. Then use another glass rod to dip some oxalic acid and apply it to the area that has already been coated with potassium permanganate. At this time, a chemical reaction occurs, the red potassium permanganate becomes colorless, and the wrong word disappears without a trace. You can use blotting paper to absorb any remaining water. After it dries, you can use a pen to write the word you want to write.

### Even Wings That Can't Fly Are Useful

— Te

Children! You all know that birds can fly because they have wings, but did you know that there are many birds that, although they have wings, still cannot fly like wild animals? Ostriches, geese, and ducks all belong to this category. Because they cannot fly, they do not fly. Precisely because they cannot fly, they are pitied by many people. In fact, there is no need to pity them. Their wings, although they cannot lift their bodies into the air, are not completely useless and are sometimes closely related to their own happiness. For example, the ostrich is considered the largest of birds. We don't know if ostriches used to fly, but we know that today the ostrich's wings are too small and definitely cannot lift its body off the ground. As long as we observe the ostrich running, we will understand that its wings are not completely useless. When the ostrich runs, it holds its two small wings upright, like sails, so it can use the wind power like a sail to run very fast. There is a type of ostrich in South America that can use these "sails" to increase its running speed when the wind is favorable, even faster than a horse. There is also a type of goose that often flaps its wings, as if telling people: "Look! I only have wings like this, please pity me!" Children! There is no need to pity them. Their wings are very useful when swimming. Those rows of scale-like feathers are as useful as fins. When we look down from a high place, the fins swim in the water, simply like flying. There is also a type of hen on New Zealand Island with large wings that cannot fly. People were surprised at first. Later, after scientists studied the reason why it could not fly, they learned that it was because the feathers were too soft and did not have the strength to resist the air, so it could not fly. But its wings are not useless. When it encounters a fierce attack, it runs and flaps its wings, often escaping danger by this means. Ducks are originally birds that can fly, but there is a type of "steamer duck" that has a rather large body and cannot fly, and does not quack like ordinary ducks. The sound it makes is like a pig squealing. Although it cannot fly, its wings allow it to swim on the water surface as fast as an arrow. Its speed can reach fifteen nautical miles per hour. The place it swims through leaves a trail with water bubbles, like the trail left by a ship with a rudder, so people call it "steamer duck." The wings of birds that seem to have no great use are only found on a type of bird called the "kiwi" on New Zealand Island. Its wings are more degenerate than any bird that cannot fly, often hidden under the hair-like feathers on its body. But although its wing strength is weak, its leg strength is very strong, and it runs very fast. This is a very rare bird, so we don't need to pity it for not being able to fly. Furthermore, the New Zealand government, to prevent it from becoming extinct, has implemented a special regulation to protect it.

### Call for Submissions

### Song of the Sleeping Lion

— Chen Tiewu

The Lion King, in the East,
A long roar shakes the mountains and rivers,
All beasts are afraid,
Holding their breath in the deep mountains.

But this lion is drowsy every day,
Good claws and teeth, not used,
Sound asleep and sound asleep again,
Loving long dreams all day long,
Jackals are in power every day,
Hogs are becoming more and more domineering;
They bite his feet, devour his chest,
The Lion King is still drowsy;
They divide his body, tear his flesh,
The Lion King is still asleep.

Children:
If you want this lion not to perish,
Every cell must become stronger,
We are one of them,
Don't hesitate, don't be at a loss,
Quickly wake up this Lion King,
From now on, invigorate yourselves,
Don't let the clowns jump around again.

### The Story of the Sacred Ship

— Da Haizi

By chance, I went into the Mengjiang Temple in front of the village and saw two flower boats hanging from the beams in the hall, one larger and one smaller; they were very beautiful. So, I curiously asked the old teacher who was teaching there. The teacher was very happy and told me the "Story of the Sacred Ship"!

Perhaps in the Ming Dynasty, one year the winter was very cold. There was a young man named Zhu here. He was a merchant in Changsha and had not returned to his hometown for five years. Because he received news that his mother was seriously ill, he rushed back day and night, wanting to see his mother. Along the way, he came down the Yangtze River. When he arrived in Suzhou, it was almost the end of the lunar year. At that time, he only hoped to return home as soon as possible to see his mother whom he had not seen for five years. He had no interest in the scenery along the way.

After arriving in Suzhou, the weather suddenly became very cold. The northwest wind swept across the sky, blowing non-stop for several days and nights, blowing so hard that not even a small boat came and went in the harbor. He stayed in the inn for two days, running to the river at the foot of the Xumen Yang Bridge every day to see if any sailing ships from Dongting Xishan had come in. At the same time, he inquired everywhere about stone boats and cargo ships from Dongxi Mountain, but he didn't even see a shadow. He returned to the small inn in disappointment, praying for the wind to stop. On the morning of the fourth day, he woke up from a dream of returning home and heard that the wind had indeed stopped. So, he was very happy, thinking that the heavens had a spirit and his prayers had moved God. So, he jumped out of bed and thought of waiting at the pier. If a ship came today, he could definitely return home tomorrow. At that time, he could see his mother whom he had not seen for five years, and he didn't know how happy his mother would be to see him!

He walked out of the small inn excitedly and walked towards the river. Although it was particularly cold today, he didn't mind. He walked to the river and saw that a layer of ice had frozen on the river, but there was not even a shadow of a ship. He hit the ice with a stone and it was very thick: "The Taihu Lake freezes to the bottom in the third nine, and ships are cut off for forty-nine days." So, he was so anxious that he really didn't know what to do. He knew that the ice on Taihu Lake would definitely not allow ships to travel for ten or eight days. However, he couldn't go up or down, and he couldn't grow wings to fly over.

The river had frozen over, and ships could not pass. So, he had no choice but to stay in the small inn and wait for the ice on Taihu Lake to thaw before returning home. However, one day, two days, three days... the weather did not warm up. He waited for ten days and only saw the ice in the river thicken, and the money he had with him gradually dwindled.

One afternoon, he stood by the river as usual, hoping for the ice to thaw, from afternoon to evening, to dusk, to when people lit the lights. He didn't even think about returning to the inn, just staring and thinking; when he thought of sad things, he couldn't help but cry out to his mother in the southwest direction.

It was New Year's Eve, and people were busy celebrating the New Year, but he was drifting around here. He didn't even know if his mother's illness was better or worse?

Just as he was sad, he suddenly heard a sound from the river. When he looked, it was a sailing ship moving towards him. He felt like he was dreaming, but he was determined not to let the opportunity pass lightly. He boldly inquired and learned that it happened to be a sailing ship from his hometown and was going back tonight. So, he begged them to take him back. Fortunately, they did not refuse, but told him to hide in the cabin and not stick his head out.

He took a package and an umbrella, went to the ship, and lay quietly in the cabin. Although he was worried about encountering some accident, his eagerness to return home to see his mother made him lie inside regardless of everything, only hearing the sound of the water under the ship and the wind whistling above. Not long after all the sounds stopped, the people on the ship called him ashore. He walked out of the cabin and saw that it was exactly his hometown that he had been away from for five years. So, he thanked them and went ashore. However, he was still very moved and surprised by the absence of ice on Taihu Lake and the speed of the ship.

After returning home, it wasn't long before his mother's illness was indeed cured.

One day, when the village held a celebration for the Heavenly King Mengjiang, he also went to the temple to play. He saw a small flower boat in the hall, the form of the boat being exactly the same as the one he had sat on. He walked over suspiciously and looked into the boat, and saw an umbrella inside. When he looked, he saw that his own name was engraved on the umbrella handle. Then he suddenly realized that the one he had sat on that day was this sacred ship.

Three years later, he became successful, so he came to renovate this temple and built this large ship to hang in the center of the hall.

### Chicken Meat in a Mud Pile

——Answer to Wang Zaichun of Guangdong Public School in Shanghai

Brother Zaichun:

Generally speaking, the problems about "bamboo tube rice" and "water and fire roasted chicken" that we discussed in previous correspondence are indeed of interest to everyone. Isn't that so? These methods are very novel. Due to space limitations here, we cannot say everything. Today, I am going to tell you another wonderful method of roasting chicken.

Many travelers are very good at using various methods to use natural items as cooking tools. For example, when they hunt a pheasant or a duck, they will use the mud that is everywhere to roast a delicious dish of meat.

When most people kill a chicken, they always pluck the chicken feathers after killing the chicken. But they don't do that. After killing the chicken, they cut open the chicken's belly, take out the liver and intestines, wash the inside clean, sprinkle salt inside, and add some other ingredients. Finally, they sew up the belly with a needle and thread. This is the end of the first step. However, there is one point to pay special attention to, that is, the chicken feathers must never be plucked. The second step is to spread mud on the chicken's body, spreading it fully so that no feathers or meat are exposed, then put it in the fire, and wait for the mud to be completely dried and cracked by the fire, and a fragrant smell comes out, then it is finished. This probably takes an hour.

At this time, you only need to take out this thing that looks like a mud pile, pat off the mud, and the chicken feathers will fall off with it. Then a clean, delicious, hot, and steaming fat chicken will make your mouth water!

What do you think of this method? I hope you can try it with your team members! Farewell, I wish you success!

### Justice (6)

— Qing

After the death of the first mate, the highest-ranking sailor was a young second mate named McLean, who had the same dedication to service as the first mate. He immediately instructed the sailors to right the lifeboat. At this point, there were only four of them left who could all get on the boat, including himself, the gunner's mate Meldre, the youngest Wilson, and another sailor. For twenty consecutive hours, their boat struggled in the water, the blazing sun scorching their heads. With no water to drink and nothing to eat, they were almost completely drained of their strength; furthermore, their oars were long gone, so they could not row. Although it was now evening and the air was cooler, the sea was pitch black, and there was no hope of being spotted and rescued by any passing ships.

Around 10 o'clock at night, the poor Wilson and another sailor, having endured all kinds of hardships, lost their minds and jumped into the sea together, ending their lives. McLean and Meldre were stunned by this unexpected shock for quite a while before they calmed down and continued to bail out the water in the boat, almost completely drying out the inside, so they could lie down and sleep. They were so exhausted that they quickly fell into a deep sleep. They only woke up when the sunlight peeked over the horizon. Upon waking, they saw that they were in a very fragile lifeboat. All their companions had died one after another, and the surrounding water was still teeming with those cruel river fish. The sun was scorching overhead, they had gone thirty-six hours without food, and their mouths were parched with thirst. However, they were determined not to drink the salty seawater, knowing full well that even if it temporarily quenched their thirst, they would not escape the suffering later, and might even go mad. In despair, they didn't even want to speak. One sat at the bow and the other at the stern, silently, waiting patiently for death to arrive.

Hour after hour passed in silence, but around eight o'clock in the morning, they suddenly saw a white dot in the distance. The two of them quickly opened their dry lips and shouted wildly: "It's a ship! It's a ship!" They held each other's hands, shedding tears of joy and hope, and stared wide-eyed as the ship slowly approached. The black hull of the ship was already visible on the horizon. Closer and closer, the ship seemed to be less than half a mile away. Alas! But it changed its course and sailed away elsewhere. They shouted hoarsely, waving their coats, but nothing worked—the people on the ship didn't see them, and they had no choice but to await their doom.

Meldre then stood up. He was older and physically stronger. He quietly expressed his opinion that he would swim towards the ship. But for people who had been without food or water for many hours, swimming such a distance felt particularly long and terrifying. And more terrifying than drowning was the danger hidden beneath the blue water and golden waves—the merciless river fish. If they stayed in the boat and didn't move, they would both surely perish. It was better to take a chance so that one person could have a last hope. This brave Meldre entrusted everything to McLean and made one last request: if he saw any river fish chasing him, he should not let him know. Then he offered a brief prayer to God, asking for his blessing. He shook hands with McLean to say goodbye, turned over, and jumped into the water.

### Starting from the Uncovering of the Japanese Secret Service in Zhengzhou's Conspiracy to Harm Our Country

— Naimu

This newspaper recently reported the uncovering of documents detailing the Japanese secret service in Zhengzhou's conspiracy to harm our country. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a formal protest with Japan regarding this case. After reading these documents, the enemy's conspiracies are truly enough to make us "tremble with fear." However, this is the only case that has been uncovered. Friendly nations have long been known throughout the world for their "espionage" activities. Even the strong United States, with slightly inadequate precautions, has long been harassed by them. The fishermen on both sides of the Panama Canal are said to be mostly spies from friendly nations. As for our country, with its wide-open borders, friendly nations come and go as if entering an empty house. Open military exercises can be conducted without any concern or restraint, let alone secret reconnaissance, which is even more difficult to investigate. However, the only place uncovered in our country is the secret service in Zhengzhou. And fortunately, it is in Zhengzhou, far from the influence of the Tianjin Garrison. If it were in the vicinity of Peiping and Tianjin, who could guarantee that it wouldn't lead to a "humiliating the Imperial Army" diplomatic incident? Because we know that pear peels and longan shells have also been international diplomatic cases.

This incident makes us think about what the secret services of friendly nations stationed in various parts of our country are actually doing! And since the September 18th Incident, these agencies have been set up in various important locations in our country. Even as far away as the vicinity of Qinghai, there are traces of them. However, the nameplates they display proudly proclaim them to be the "Imperial Army" of a certain country. This is still out in the open. Rumors spread throughout our country about reconnaissance personnel in all areas, either from that country or from our own people, the number of which is alarming. The large number of traitors captured in important cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the past year is proof of this. However, these are just minor pawns. Who can capture the important ones? Shi Yousan, clearly an enemy henchman, openly appeared on the streets of Peiping and Tianjin, with great fanfare. Yin Rugeng has already betrayed the country and been ordered to be suppressed by the central government, but he is still a distinguished guest in Peiping and Tianjin. There are countless examples like this. However, those who are unfortunately arrested and killed are only minor traitors, and only our own people. As for those who are known to be spies but are from friendly nations, we have never heard of any action being taken against them. It seems that Chinese laws are an exception when it comes to these people.

If it were in another country, I ask you: could a major spy from the enemy, openly appearing in our country's official circles and diplomatic circles, like the so-called "secret service," gain a foothold? According to the laws of all countries, spies are caught and shown no mercy. But in our country, the situation is different. I think this is not only related to national defense, but also a kind of shame!

### Treating Illness by Ascending a Building

— Wusi

There are two lines in Tang poetry: "To see a thousand miles further, ascend another story." I would now like to change these to: "To cure internal and external illnesses, ascend another story." In the past, it was really not easy for people to find a suitable place to treat illnesses. Now, on the fourth floor of the Wuzhou Building on Fuzhou Road, renowned doctors from all departments are gathered in one place, such as Diao Xinde, Tan Yili, Luo Chuanrong, Yu Xinyan, Li Jingwen, Zhang Fuxing, Zhou Jiazao, Zhu Baolin, Chen Bangdian, and Ge Jing, all of whom are famous doctors known far and wide. Moreover, the consultation rooms for various medical departments are equipped with very complete facilities. When patients enter, they feel physically and mentally at ease. Whether it is internal medicine, surgery, venereal disease, eye disease, dental disease, urological disease, or hemorrhoids, if patients want to recover quickly, please come to the Wuzhou Building.

### My Family and Soap

— Chen Meisheng

I am twelve years old this year and studying at elementary school. The day before yesterday, the teacher asked each of us to write an essay reporting on the hygiene of our families. I wrote this essay, "My Family and Soap," for him. Now I am copying it down below:

"My whole family is hygienic, which can be seen from their habit of using soap. However, the soap used by my family members is different: Mom likes to use 'Guben Soap.' She says this soap is durable for washing clothes and removes dirt quickly. My older brother often exercises, and he likes to use 'Guben Medicated Soap.' He says this medicated soap can kill bacteria and protect the skin. My older sister likes to use 'Guben Perfumed Soap.' She says this perfumed soap has a delicate fragrance and fine texture. I think what they say is all right."

### Spider

— Luo Caiqing

Because it was almost the New Year, the bedroom was slightly tidied up. The so-called "tidying up" was just wiping the glass windows clean and dusting around the walls.

While dusting, I found a large spider web in the corner of the wall. Naturally, it should also be classified as dust and "tidied up" along with the rest.

Spiders making webs is a common sight in the countryside. However, the spiders in the countryside seem to be smarter. They never spread their "weapons for catching flying insects" in the corners of the walls inside the house. They usually set up in ventilated places under the eaves, which are both unrelated to people and bustling areas for capturing prey.

In summer, after taking a bath, dragging out a rattan chair and sitting in the courtyard to watch spiders weave their webs is quite pleasant and leisurely. Watching them hang upside down from the eaves, because their "silk nest" (I don't know what the place where they spin silk is actually called) is at the tip of their butt, to live, they must first humiliate themselves and hang upside down in the air for a long time, waiting for the breeze to blow, taking advantage of the momentum to swing and attach to another place where they can stand. Then this thread becomes the main trunk of the web. When three threads intersect, it starts weaving the web. Summer is a season with many insects. Dragonflies, mosquitoes, and many small flying insects fall into its "security zone," and it hides steadily in the dark, reaping endless harvests. However, the countryside also has its own hardships, which are that when those children catch cicadas, the spider webs often suffer undeserved disasters. The method is to use a thin bamboo strip to make a circle at the upper end of a bamboo pole. A spider web can be easily picked off with a light touch and completely stick to the bamboo circle. It is very effective to use it to catch cicadas. In fact, this method is the same as spiders catching insects, except that one spreads a web and lets the flying insects "throw themselves into the net," and the other takes a net to catch them—the latter is relatively more advanced.

In Shanghai, there are no good places under the eaves for spiders to set up "security zones," so they just make do with corners of the house as places to settle down. The spider web in my bedroom, I don't know how long it had been there, until it was discovered during the New Year cleaning.

Now the New Year has passed, and no one pays attention to that corner anymore, but the spider's spirit of perseverance is indeed impressive. Not only has it spun a web in the original place, but many flying insects that we have never seen before have thrown themselves into its web, providing it with food.

From this, I discovered the value of the spider's "tenacity." As long as it can diligently spin a web, even without a windy eave, the corner of the house can also be a "security zone." And what about us Chinese? We only think of "digging a well" when we are dying of thirst; that "well" may be dug by chance, but whether we will not die of thirst is still a question.

## Page 20

. Isn't it? We only think of cleaning up when it is almost the New Year, and a "tragedy" occurs. Then, our blood boils and we shout "Down with ××-ism," "Economic severance," and even think that putting a stamp on banknotes is revenge. When we see other people's airplanes flying all over the sky like dragonflies, we shout "Saving the country through aviation," but the result unexpectedly becomes a business for speculators—that is, the prevalence of "children's airplane hats." It seems too early to have those children who are not even comfortable riding "tricycles" go "fly," go "save the country."

To survive, we must learn from the spider's "tenacity" spirit of perseverance!

### Road Building

— Qing Shuang

Today, Afu got up very early. The sun had just reflected a faint red light from the treetops. The village was buried in the morning mist, and its clear outlines could not yet be seen. The threshing ground was wet and sticky with the night's dew. The grass, carrying sparkling water droplets, shimmered as it was blown in the morning breeze.

Afu walked to the edge of the field, following the ridges, and looked at the rice plants that he had cultivated with his own hard work. Cluster after cluster, they emitted a tender green light, carrying moisture, and a burst of fragrance wafted in his nose. Afu's heart was filled with the joy of earning a living through his own labor, and he happily inspected the field.

But a painful shadow suddenly covered his heart. He got up early today not to weed in the fields. These days, the rain and sunshine have been favorable, and the rice plants are growing fast, and the weeds are growing fast too. Afu had planned to go back to work in the fields in a few days, otherwise the rice plants would be damaged. But there was a more important matter weighing on his shoulders: he was busy building roads these past two days.

Roads—damn it, they are not important to us farmers. They are much more convenient for the gentlemen in the city to go to other big docks. In the past, the only way to get from the county to W city was by night boat, which took a whole day and night. Afu recalled that he had taken it once when he was a child. Since there were steamships, it only took four and a half hours to get there, and the city people were overjoyed, saying it was much more convenient. But most villagers still take night boats to W city, because the boat fare is only three hundred copper coins, while steamships cost five dimes. Now the city people are saying that steamships are too slow and they want to take cars. They often say that in the future, taking cars will also feel slow, and it would be best to have airplanes. Happiness is for the rich to enjoy. Just take this car road that is being filled in as an example. The mud and gravel are all carried and laid by villagers. Villagers seem to be destined to suffer.

A series of worries, like yellow soybeans pouring out of a broken bag, scattered all over Afu's heart.

One afternoon the day before, the village chief hurried to the village with official business. Each household was assigned a strong man, and they were given twenty days to build the road to W city. They had to provide their own food, and those with outstanding results would be rewarded, otherwise they would be punished. The village chief said this to them while reading the official notice.

Noisy objections arose:

"These few days are the busy season in the fields. What if we have to work in our own fields?"

"Humph! Three acres of my ten acres of land were taken away, and I only got fifteen silver dollars. Now you want to assign me to build roads! Village Chief! What do you think?"

The village chief stiffened his face:

"This is official business! What's there to say!"

After a pause, he came up with a way to accommodate people:

"If you don't want to build it yourself, you can also pay half a dollar a day to have someone build it for you. Many people in the city do this."

The village chief left with the official notice.

Half a dollar a day—hiring someone to work in the fields only costs three dimes. Why would I pay money instead of building it myself?

Afu came back from his jumbled thoughts. The sun had already climbed from the treetops to the rooftops. People in the village were coming out of their houses. Each person carried a pair of baskets on their shoulders and a hoe in their hands.

"Afu, why aren't you going yet?"

On the highway, groups of farmers were gathered. Hoes chopped into the fields like raindrops. The supervisor watched, digging along the marked white lines. Digging into their own fields, watching the soybean seedlings that they had worked so hard to grow for several months, so green and lovely, were also destroyed under their hoes. Their hands went soft.

The roadbed gradually rose higher. It was cutting through the middle of the fields. Entire pieces of fields were cut into two halves. On the side of the road, two deep trenches were dug, turning into small rivers three to five feet wide. The remaining fields were only a narrow strip of a few feet wide. The village chief measured the roadbed and found that a total of 5.4 mu of land had been requisitioned, and the price was 25.2 yuan.

A question arose among the road workers: at the pond bridge, the road should have gone straight, why did it make such a big bend from west to east?

"Humph! What do you know!" It was Zhao Sanda who spoke. He often sat in teahouses and had inside information. So he continued, "The village chief made almost a thousand dollars by making that turn!"

The thing was this: the road should have gone straight through the fields, but the fields belonged to the village chief, and he had a lot of them, requiring almost twenty mu to be taken. The village chief knew the highway engineering office. He spent nearly a thousand dollars to keep his fields. That's how the road made such a big bend.

From morning till night, the road workers hurried to build the road as quickly as they could, exerting all their physical strength, because their own work in the fields was waiting for them to go back and do it. As a result, the road-building performance was particularly outstanding, and an order for awards arrived: the road workers of this section were ordered to build another hundred meters to demonstrate their excellent ability, which was worthy of emulation.

A year later, fierce cars sped day and night on that highway. People in the city, sitting in cars, looked at the green fields on both sides, flying backwards behind the car, and said with joy:

"Transportation is really convenient now."

"The only thing that is a bit unsatisfactory is that when the car passes the pond bridge, it has to make such a big turn, which often causes accidents."
